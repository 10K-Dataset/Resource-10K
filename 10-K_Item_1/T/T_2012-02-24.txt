History

AT&T, formerly known as SBC Communications Inc. (SBC), was formed as one of several regional holding companies created to hold AT&T Corp.’s (ATTC) local telephone companies. On January 1, 1984, we were spun-off from ATTC pursuant to an anti-trust consent decree, becoming an independent publicly traded telecommunications services provider. At formation, we primarily operated in five southwestern states. Our subsidiaries merged with Pacific Telesis Group in 1997, Southern New England Telecommunications Corporation in 1998 and Ameritech Corporation in 1999, thereby expanding our wireline operations as the incumbent local exchange carrier (ILEC) into a total of 13 states. In November 2005, one of our subsidiaries merged with ATTC, creating one of the world’s leading telecommunications providers. In connection with the merger, we changed the name of our company from “SBC Communications Inc.” to “AT&T Inc.” In December 2006, one of our subsidiaries merged with BellSouth Corporation (BellSouth) making us the ILEC in an additional nine states. With the BellSouth acquisition, we thereby acquired BellSouth’s 40% economic interest in AT&T Mobility LLC (AT&T Mobility), formerly Cingular Wireless LLC, and BellSouth’s 34% economic interest in YELLOWPAGES.COM (YPC), resulting in 100% ownership of AT&T Mobility and YPC. Our services and products are marketed under the AT&T brand name, including alliances such as AT&T Yahoo! and AT&T | DIRECT TV.



Scope

We are a leading provider of telecommunications services in the United States and the world. We offer our services and products to consumers in the U.S. and services and products to businesses and other providers of telecommunications services worldwide.

Our local exchange subsidiaries are subject to regulation by each state in which they operate and by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). Wireless service providers are regulated by the FCC. Additional information relating to regulation is contained under the heading “Government Regulation” and in the Annual Report under the heading “Operating Environment and Trends of the Business,” and is incorporated herein by reference pursuant to General Instruction G(2).




AT&T Inc.





With the expansion of our company through acquisitions and the resulting ownership consolidation of AT&T Mobility, and with continuing advances in technology, our services offerings now combine our traditional wireline and wireless services. We make our customers’ lives more convenient and productive and foster competition and further innovation in the communications and entertainment industry. In 2012, we plan to focus on the areas discussed below.



Wireless

AT&T Mobility began operations in October 2000 as a joint venture between us and BellSouth and, in 2004, acquired AT&T Wireless Services, Inc. Upon our acquisition of BellSouth in 2006, AT&T Mobility became a wholly-owned subsidiary.



We cover most major metropolitan areas of the United States with our Universal Mobile Telecommunications System/High-Speed Downlink Packet Access (HSPA) and HSPA+ network technology, with HSPA+ providing 4G speeds when combined with our upgraded backhaul. At the end of 2011, over 80% of our data traffic was carried over this enhanced backhaul. Our network provides superior mobile broadband speeds for data and video services, as well as operating efficiencies using the same spectrum and infrastructure for voice and data on an IP-based platform. Our wireless network also relies on digital transmission technologies known as GSM, General Packet Radio Services and Enhanced Data Rates for GSM Evolution for data communications. As of December 31, 2011, we served 103 million subscribers. We have also begun transitioning our network to next generation LTE technology and expect this network to cover approximately 80% of the U.S. population and to be largely complete by the end of 2013. We continue to expand the number of locations, including airports and cafés, where customers can access broadband Internet connections using wireless fidelity (local radio frequency commonly referred to as Wi-Fi) wireless technology.



As the wireless industry continues to mature, we believe that future wireless growth will increasingly depend on our ability to offer innovative data services to customers, which in turn, will depend on the availability of additional spectrum. We are facing significant spectrum and capacity constraints on our wireless network in certain markets. We expect such constraints to increase and expand to additional markets in the coming years. While we are continuing to invest significant capital in expanding our network capacity, our capacity constraints could affect the quality of existing voice and data services and our ability to launch new, advanced wireless broadband services, unless we are able to obtain more spectrum. Any spectrum solution will require that the FCC makes new spectrum available to the wireless industry and allows us to obtain the spectrum we need more immediately to meet the needs of our customers. We will continue to attempt to address spectrum and capacity constraints on a market-by-market basis.



Business Customers

We expect to continue to strengthen the reach and sophistication of our network facilities and our ability to offer a variety of communications services, both wireless and wireline, to large businesses and wholesale customers worldwide. We expect to offer similar services to small- and medium-businesses and to increase the attractiveness of our services to governmental customers. We also expect to extend our wholesale business offerings to other service products and systems integration services.



Data/Broadband

As the communications industry continues to move toward Internet-based technologies that are capable of blending traditional wireline and wireless services, we plan to offer services that take advantage of these new and more sophisticated technologies. In particular, we intend to continue to focus on expanding our AT&T U-verse high-speed broadband and video offerings and on developing IP-based services that allow customers to unite their home or business wireline services with their wireless service.



U-verse ServicesDuring 2011, we continued to expand our offerings of U-verse High Speed Internet and TV services.

As of December 31, 2011, we reached our deployment goal of 30 million living units and have now passed 30.3 million living units (constructed housing units as well as platted housing lots). We are marketing U-verse services to 78% of those units and had 3.8 million subscribers by year-end 2011. During 2012, we will continue our efforts to increase sales to this base.



We believe that our U-verse TV service is a “video service” under the Federal Communications Act. However, some cable providers and municipalities have claimed that certain IP services should be treated as a traditional cable service and therefore subject to the applicable state and local cable regulation. Certain municipalities have delayed our requests to offer this service or have refused us permission to use our existing or new right-of-ways to deploy or activate our U-verse-related equipment, services and products, resulting in litigation. Petitions have been filed at the FCC alleging that the manner in which we provision “public, educational and governmental” (PEG) programming over our U-verse TV service conflicts with federal law, and a lawsuit has been filed in a California state superior court raising similar allegations under California law. If courts having jurisdiction where we have significant deployments of our U-verse services were to decide that federal, state and/or local cable regulation were applicable to our U-verse services, or if the FCC, state agencies or the courts were to rule that we must deliver PEG programming in a manner substantially different from the way we do today or in ways that are inconsistent with our current network architecture, it could have a material adverse effect on the cost and extent of our U-verse offerings.






AT&T Inc.





Voice over Internet Protocol(VoIP)VoIP is generally used to describe the transmission of voice using IP-based technology rather than a traditional wire and switch-based telephone network. A company using this technology can often provide voice services at a lower cost because this technology uses bandwidth more efficiently than a traditional network and because this technology has not been subject to traditional telephone industry regulation. While the development of VoIP has resulted in increased competition for our wireless and wireline voice services, it also presents growth opportunities for us to develop new products for our customers.



BUSINESS OPERATIONS



OPERATING SEGMENTS

Our segments are strategic business units that offer different products and services over various technology platforms and are managed accordingly. We analyze our various operating segments based on segment income before income taxes. We make our capital allocations decisions based on our strategic direction of the business, needs of the network (wireless or wireline) providing services and other assets needed to provide emerging services to our customers. Actuarial gains and losses from pension and other postretirement benefits, interest expense and other income (expense) – net, are managed only on a total company basis and are, accordingly, reflected only in consolidated results. Therefore, these items are not included in the calculation of each segment’s percentage of our total segment income. Each segment’s percentage of total segment operating revenue and income calculations is derived from our segment results, and income percentage may total more than 100 percent due to losses in one or more segments. We have four reportable segments: (1) Wireless; (2) Wireline; (3) Advertising Solutions; and (4) Other.



Additional information about our segments, including financial information, is included under the heading “Segment Results” on pages 32 through 40 and in Note 4 of the Annual Report and is incorporated herein by reference pursuant to General Instruction G(2).



WIRELESS

Wireless consists of our subsidiary, AT&T Mobility, which operates as a wireless provider to both business and consumer customers. Our Wireless segment provided approximately 50% of 2011 total segment operating revenues and 94% of our 2011 total segment income. At December 31, 2011, we had more than 103 million wireless subscribers. We classify our customers as either postpaid, prepaid, connected device or reseller.



Services and Products

We offer a comprehensive range of high-quality nationwide wireless voice and data communications services in a variety of pricing plans, including postpaid and prepaid service plans. Our offerings are tailored to meet the communications needs of targeted customer segments, including youth, family, active professionals, small businesses, government and major national corporate accounts.



Service –Our voice service is generally offered on a contract basis for one- or two-year periods, referred to as postpaid. Under the terms of these contracts, service is billed and provided on a monthly basis according to the applicable rate plan chosen. Our wireless services include basic local wireless communications service, long-distance service and roaming services. Roaming services enable our subscribers to utilize other carriers’ networks when they are “roaming” outside our network footprint. We also charge fees to other carriers for providing roaming services to their customers when their customers utilize our network. We also offer prepaid voice service to certain customers who prefer to control usage or pay in advance.



Wireless data revenues continue to be a growing area of our business, representing an increasing share of our overall subscriber revenue. We are experiencing solid growth from both consumer and enterprise wireless data services, as an increasing number of our subscribers have upgraded their handsets to more advanced integrated devices. We are also seeing rapid growth in demand for new data-centric devices such as notebooks, tablets, eReaders, direction and navigation aids and monitoring devices. Customers in our “connected device” category (e.g., users of eReaders and navigation aids) purchase those devices from third-party suppliers which buy data access supported by our network. Other data-centric device users are classified as either postpaid customers (primarily netbook and notebook users) or prepaid customers (primarily tablet users) since they purchase service directly from us. We continue to upgrade our network and coordinate with equipment manufacturers and applications developers in order to further capitalize on the continued growth in the demand for wireless data services. As of December 31, 2011, we were a leading provider of wireless data in the U.S. wireless industry based on subscribers.






AT&T Inc.





Equipment –We sell a wide variety of handsets, wirelessly enabled computers (i.e., notebooks and tablets) and personal computer wireless data cards manufactured by various suppliers for use with our voice and data services. We sell through our own company-owned stores or through agents or third-party retail stores. We also sell accessories, such as carrying cases, hands-free devices, batteries, battery chargers and other items, to consumers, as well as to agents and other third-party distributors for resale. Like other wireless service providers, we often provide postpaid contract subscribers substantial equipment subsidies to initiate or upgrade service.



Additional information on our Wireless segment is contained in the Annual Report in the “Operating Environment Overview” section under the heading “Expected Growth Areas,” “Wireless” beginning on page 41 and is incorporated herein by reference pursuant to General Instruction G(2).



WIRELINE

Our Wireline subsidiaries provide both retail and wholesale communication services domestically and internationally. Our Wireline segment provided approximately 47% of 2011 segment operating revenues and 45% of our 2011 total segment income. We divide our wireline services into three product-based categories: voice, data and other. Revenues from our traditional voice services have been declining as customers have been switching to wireless, cable and other Internet-based providers. In addition, the continuing weak economy has caused wireline customers to terminate their residential or business phone service as individuals have lost jobs or otherwise combined households and businesses have closed or reduced operations. We have responded by offering packages of combined voice and data services, including broadband and video, and intend to continue this strategy during 2012.



Services and Products



Data –We provide data services that rely on IP-based technology and data services that rely on older, circuit-based technology. We provide businesses voice applications over IP-based networks (i.e., Enhanced Virtual Private Networks or “EVPN”). Over the past several years, we have built out our new multi-protocol label switching/asynchronous transfer mode, or MPLS/ATM network, to supplement, and eventually replace, our other extensive global networks. These products allow us to provide highly complex global data networks. Additional IP-based services include Internet access and network integration, dedicated Internet and enterprise networking services, U-verse services and related data equipment sales.



Our circuit-based, traditional data products include switched and dedicated transport that allow business customers to transport data at high speeds, as well as DSL and dial-up Internet access. Our private line offering uses high-capacity digital circuits to transmit from point-to-point in multiple configurations and allows customers to create internal data networks and to access external data networks. Switched Transport services transmit data using switching equipment to transfer the data between multiple lines before reaching its destination. Dedicated Transport services use a single direct line to transmit data between destinations. DSL is a digital modem technology that converts existing twisted-pair telephone lines into access paths for multimedia and high-speed data communications to the Internet or private networks. DSL allows customers to simultaneously make a phone call and access information via the Internet or an office local area network. Digital Services use dedicated digital circuits to transmit digital data at various high rates of speed.



Network integration services include installation of business data systems, local area networking and other data networking offerings. Internet access services include a wide range of products for residences and businesses including basic dial-up access service, dedicated access, web hosting, managed services, e-mail and high-speed access services. Our managed web-hosting services for businesses provide network, server and security infrastructure as well as built-in data storage and include application performance management, database management, hardware and operating system management. Our hosting services also provide customers with secure access to detailed reporting information about their infrastructure and applications.



Packet services consist of data networks using packet switching and transmission technologies, including traditional circuit-based, and IP connectivity services. Packet services enable customers to transmit large volumes of data economically and securely and are used for local area network (LAN) interconnection, remote site, point of sale and branch office communications. High-speed packet services are used extensively by enterprise (large business) customers.




AT&T Inc.





Enterprise networking services provide comprehensive support from network design, implementation and installation to ongoing network operations and management for networks of varying scales, including LANs, wide area networks, and virtual private networks. These services include applications such as e-mail, order entry systems, employee directories, human resource transactions and other database applications.



We also offer Wi-Fi services (local radio frequency commonly known as wireless fidelity).



We provide local, interstate and international wholesale networking capacity to other service providers. We offer a combination of high-volume transmission capacity and conventional dedicated line services on a regional, national and international basis to wireless carriers, interexchange carriers, Internet service providers (ISPs) and facility-based and switchless resellers. Our wholesale customers are primarily large ISPs, wireless carriers, competitive local exchange carriers (CLECs), regional phone companies, interexchange carriers, cable companies and systems integrators.



Voice– Voice includes traditional local and long-distance service provided to retail customers and wholesale access to our network and individual network elements provided to competitors. At December 31, 2011, our wireline subsidiaries served approximately 19 million retail consumer access lines, 16 million retail business access lines and 2 million wholesale access lines. We also have a number of integrated voice and data services, such as integrated network connections, that provide customers the ability to integrate access for their voice and data services, the data component of which is included in the data category. Additionally, voice revenues do not include any of our VoIP revenues, which are included in data revenues.



Long distance consists of traditional long distance and international long distance for customers that select us as their primary long-distance carrier. Long distance also includes services provided by calling card, 1-800 services and conference calling. These services are used in a wide variety of business applications, including sales, reservation centers or customer service centers. We also provide wholesale switched access service to other service providers.



Voice also includes calling features, fees to maintain wire located inside customer premises and other miscellaneous voice products. Calling features are enhanced telephone services available to retail customers such as Caller ID, Call Waiting and voice mail. These calling features services are generally more profitable than basic local phone service.



Other –Other includes application management, security service, integration services, customer premises equipment, outsourcing, government-related services, and satellite video services. Security services include business continuity and disaster recovery services as well as premise and network based security products.



Customer premises equipment and other equipment sales range from single-line and cordless telephones to sophisticated digital Private Branch Exchange (PBX) systems. PBX is a private telephone switching system, typically used by businesses and usually located on a customer’s premises, which provides intra-premise telephone services as well as access to our network.



ADVERTISING SOLUTIONS

Advertising Solutions includes our directory operations, which publish Yellow and White Pages directories and sell directory advertising and Internet-based advertising and local search. The Advertising Solutions segment provided approximately 3% of total segment operating revenues in 2011. In 2011, segment operating expenses exceeded revenues due to a recorded impairment of goodwill and a trade name. This segment sells advertising services throughout the United States, with our print directory operations primarily covering our 22-state area.





AT&T Inc.



OTHER

Our Other segment includes customer information services (i.e., operator services) and corporate and other operations, as well as impacts from corporate-wide decisions for which the individual operating segments are not being evaluated, including interest cost and expected return on pension and postretirement benefits. The Other segment provided less than 1% of total segment operating revenues in 2011. In 2011, segment operating expenses exceeded revenues. We also include in this segment the equity income (loss) from our investments in Télefonos de México, S.A. de C.V.  and América Móvil, S.A. de C.V.

GOVERNMENT REGULATION



Wireless communications providers must be licensed by the FCC to provide communications services at specified spectrum frequencies within specified geographic areas and must comply with the rules and policies governing the use of the spectrum as adopted by the FCC. The FCC’s rules have a direct impact on whether the wireless industry has sufficient spectrum available to support the high quality, innovative services our customers demand. Wireless licenses are issued for a fixed time period, typically ten years, and we must seek renewal of these licenses. While the FCC has generally renewed licenses given to operating companies such as us, the FCC has authority to both revoke a license for cause and to deny a license renewal if a renewal is not in the public interest. Additionally, while wireless communications providers’ prices and service offerings are generally not subject to regulation, the federal government and an increasing number of states are considering new regulations and legislation relating to various aspects of wireless services.



Our wireline subsidiaries are subject to regulation by state commissions which have the power to regulate intrastate rates and services, including local, long-distance and network access services, provided such state regulation is consistent with federal law. These subsidiaries are also subject to the jurisdiction of the FCC with respect to intercarrier compensation, interconnection, and interstate and international rates and services, including interstate access charges. Access charges are a form of intercarrier compensation designed to compensate our wireline subsidiaries for the use of their networks by other carriers.



Our subsidiaries operating outside the United States. are subject to the jurisdiction of national and supranational regulatory authorities in the market where service is provided. Regulation is generally limited to operational licensing authority for the provision of enterprise services.



Additional information relating to regulation of our subsidiaries is contained in the Annual Report under the headings “Operating Environment Overview” beginning on page 40 and “Regulatory Developments” beginning on page 42 and are incorporated herein by reference pursuant to General Instruction G(2).
