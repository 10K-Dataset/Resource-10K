History

AT&T, formerly known as SBC Communications Inc. (SBC), was formed as one of several regional holding companies created to hold AT&T Corp.’s (ATTC) local telephone companies. On January 1, 1984, we were spun-off from ATTC pursuant to an anti-trust consent decree, becoming an independent publicly-traded telecommunications services provider. At formation, we primarily operated in five southwestern states. Our subsidiaries merged with Pacific Telesis Group in 1997, Southern New England Telecommunications Corporation in 1998 and Ameritech Corporation in 1999, thereby expanding our wireline operations as the incumbent local exchange carrier (ILEC) into a total of 13 states. In November 2005, one of our subsidiaries merged with ATTC, creating one of the world’s leading telecommunications providers. In connection with the merger, we changed the name of our company from “SBC Communications Inc.” to “AT&T Inc.” In December 2006, one of our subsidiaries merged with BellSouth Corporation (BellSouth) making us the ILEC in an additional nine states. With the BellSouth acquisition, we thereby acquired BellSouth’s 40 percent economic interest in AT&T Mobility LLC (AT&T Mobility), formerly Cingular Wireless LLC, resulting in 100 percent ownership of AT&T Mobility. Substantially all of our services and products are marketed under the AT&T brand name. In 2013, we launched a new wireless brand, Aio, which offers prepaid services and devices with no annual contract.



Scope

We are a leading provider of telecommunications services in the United States and the world. We offer our services and products to consumers in the U.S. and services and products to businesses and other providers of telecommunications services worldwide.



The services and products that we offer vary by market, and include: wireless communications, local exchange services, long-distance services, data/broadband and Internet services, video services, telecommunications equipment, managed networking, and wholesale services. We group our operating subsidiaries as follows, corresponding to our operating segments for financial reporting purposes:

·wireless subsidiaries provide both wireless voice and data communications services across the U.S. and, through roaming agreements, in a substantial number of foreign countries.

·wireline subsidiaries provide primarily landline voice and data communication services, AT&T U-verse®high-speed broadband, video, and voice services (U-verse) and managed networking to business customers.

·other subsidiaries include results from corporate and other operations, our portion of results from our equity investments and impacts from corporate-wide decisions for which the individual operating segments are not being evaluated.



Our local exchange subsidiaries operate as the ILEC in 22 states: Alabama, Arkansas, California, Connecticut, Illinois, Indiana, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Kansas, Michigan, Mississippi, Missouri, Nevada, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas and Wisconsin (22-state area). In December 2013, we agreed to sell our local exchange operations in Connecticut. Our local exchange subsidiaries are subject to regulation by each state in which they operate and by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). Wireless service providers are regulated by the FCC. Additional information relating to regulation and pending deals, including the Connecticut operations sale, are contained under the heading “Government Regulation” and in the Annual Report under the headings “Operating Environment and Trends of the Business” and “Other Business Matters” and is incorporated herein by reference pursuant to General Instruction G(2).



1AT&T Inc.With the expansion of our company through acquisitions and the resulting ownership consolidation of AT&T Mobility, and with continuing advances in technology, our services offerings now combine our traditional wireline and wireless services. We make our customers’ lives more convenient and productive and foster competition and further innovation in the communications and entertainment industry. In 2014, we plan to focus on the areas discussed below.



Wireless

AT&T Mobility began operations in October 2000 as a joint venture between us and BellSouth and, in 2004, acquired AT&T Wireless Services, Inc. Upon our acquisition of BellSouth in 2006, AT&T Mobility became a wholly-owned subsidiary. As of December 31, 2013, we served more than 110 million subscribers.



In the United States, we now cover all major metropolitan areas and nearly 280 million people with our LTE technology. We expect to cover approximately 300 million people and to be essentially complete by the summer of 2014. We also provide 4G coverage using various other technologies (UMTS and HSPA+), and when combined with our upgraded backhaul, we are able to enhance our network capabilities and provide superior mobile broadband speeds for data and video services. Our wireless network also relies on other GSM digital transmission technologies for 3G and 2G data communications. As of December 31, 2013, we served more than 110 million subscribers. We continue to expand the number of locations, including airports and cafés, where customers can access broadband Internet connections using wireless fidelity (local radio frequency commonly referred to as Wi-Fi) technology.



As the wireless industry continues to mature, we believe that future wireless growth will increasingly depend on our ability to offer innovative data services and a wireless network that has sufficient spectrum and capacity to support these innovations. We are facing significant spectrum and capacity constraints on our wireless network in certain markets. We expect such constraints to increase and expand to additional markets in the coming years. While we are continuing to invest significant capital in expanding our network capacity, our capacity constraints could affect the quality of existing voice and data services and our ability to launch new, advanced wireless broadband services, unless we are able to obtain more spectrum. Any long-term spectrum solution will require that the FCC make new or existing spectrum available to the wireless industry to meet the expanding needs of our subscribers. We will continue to attempt to address spectrum and capacity constraints on a market-by-market basis. To that end, we closed more than 60 deals to acquire spectrum and wireless operations during 2013. Much of the recently acquired spectrum came from an innovative solution in which we obtained FCC approval to use Wireless Communication Services spectrum for mobile broadband for the first time.



Also as part of our efforts to improve our network performance and help address the need for additional spectrum capacity, we intend to redeploy spectrum currently used for basic 2G services to support more advanced mobile Internet services on our 3G and 4G networks. We will continue to manage this process consistent with previous network upgrades and will transition customers on a market-by-market basis from 2G networks to our more advanced 3G and 4G networks. We expect to fully discontinue service on our 2G networks by approximately January 1, 2017. As of December 31, 2013, about 4 percent of AT&T’s postpaid subscribers used 2G-capable handsets. We do not expect this transition to have a material impact on our operating results.



Business Customers

We expect to continue to strengthen the reach and sophistication of our network facilities and our ability to offer a variety of communications services, both wireless and wireline, to large businesses, governmental and wholesale customers worldwide. We expect to offer similar services to small- and medium-businesses and to increase the attractiveness of our services to governmental customers. We also expect to extend our wholesale business offerings to other service products and systems integration services.



Data/Broadband

As the communications industry continues to move toward Internet-based technologies that are capable of blending traditional wireline and wireless services, we plan to offer services that take advantage of these new and more sophisticated technologies. In particular, we intend to continue to focus on expanding our AT&T U-verse high-speed broadband and video offerings and on developing IP-based services that allow customers to unite their home or business wireline services with their wireless service.



2AT&T Inc.

U-verse ServicesDuring 2013, we continued to expand our offerings of U-verse high speed Internet and TV services. As of December 31, 2013, we are marketing U-verse services to approximately 27 million customer locations (locations eligible to receive U-verse service). As of December 31, 2013, we had 10.7 million total U-verse subscribers (high-speed Internet and video), including 10.4 million Internet and 5.5 million video subscribers (subscribers to both services are only counted once in the total). As part of Project Velocity IP (VIP), we plan to expand our IP-broadband service to approximately 57 million customer locations, including U-verse services to a total of 33 million customer locations. We expect to be substantially complete in the 2015 and 2016 timeframe.



We believe that our U-verse TV service is a “video service” under the Federal Communications Act. However, some cable providers and municipalities have claimed that certain IP services should be treated as a traditional cable service and therefore subject to the applicable state and local cable regulation. Petitions have been filed at the FCC alleging that the manner in which we provision “public, educational and governmental” (PEG) programming over our U-verse TV service conflicts with federal law, and a lawsuit has been filed in a California state superior court raising similar allegations under California law. If courts having jurisdiction where we have significant deployments of our U-verse services were to decide that federal, state and/or local cable regulation were applicable to our U-verse services, or if the FCC, state agencies or the courts were to rule that we must deliver PEG programming in a manner substantially different from the way we do today or in ways that are inconsistent with our current network architecture, it could have a material adverse effect on the cost and extent of our U-verse offerings.



Internet Protocol TechnologyIP is generally used to describe the transmission of voice (called voice over IP or VoIP) and data using a software-based technology rather than a traditional wire and physical switch-based telephone network. A company using this technology can provide voice and data services at a lower cost because this technology uses bandwidth more efficiently than a traditional network and because this technology has not been subject to traditional telephone industry regulation. Using this technology also presents growth opportunities especially in providing data and video services to both fixed locations and mobile devices.  To take advantage of both these growth and cost-savings opportunities, we have announced plans to transition wireline customers in our current 22-state area to services using this technology by the end of 2020.



BUSINESS OPERATIONS



OPERATING SEGMENTS

Our segments are strategic business units that offer different products and services over various technology platforms and are managed accordingly. We analyze our operating segments based on segment income before income taxes. We make our capital allocations decisions based on the strategic needs of the business, needs of the network (wireless or wireline) providing services and demands to provide emerging services to our customers. Actuarial gains and losses from pension and other postemployment benefits, interest expense and other income (expense) – net, are managed only on a total company basis and are, accordingly, reflected only in consolidated results. Therefore, these items are not included in the calculation of each segment’s reportable results. The customers and long lived assets of our reportable segments are predominantly in the United States. Each segment’s percentage of total segment operating revenue and income calculations is derived from our segment results, and income percentage may total more than 100 percent due to losses in one or more segments. We have three reportable segments: (1) Wireless, (2) Wireline, and (3) Other.



Additional information about our segments, including financial information, is included under the heading “Segment Results” on pages 13 through 20 and in Note 4 of the Annual Report and is incorporated herein by reference pursuant to General Instruction G(2).



WIRELESS

Wireless consists of our subsidiary, AT&T Mobility, which operates as a wireless provider to both business and consumer subscribers. Our Wireless segment provided approximately 54% of 2013 total segment operating revenues and 76% of our 2013 total segment income. At December 31, 2013, we served more than 110 million wireless subscribers. We classify our subscribers as either postpaid, prepaid, connected device or reseller.



Services and Products

We offer a comprehensive range of high-quality nationwide wireless voice and data communications services in a variety of pricing plans, including postpaid and prepaid service plans. Our offerings are tailored to meet the communications needs of targeted customer segments, including youth, family, active professionals, small businesses, government and major national corporate accounts.

3AT&T Inc.

Data



Voice, text and other service–Our voice service is generally offered on a contract basis for one- or two-year periods, referred to as postpaid. Under the terms of these contracts, service is billed and provided on a monthly basis according to the applicable rate plan chosen. Our wireless services include basic local wireless communications service, long-distance service and roaming services. Roaming services enable our subscribers to utilize other carriers’ networks when they are “roaming” outside our network footprint. We also charge fees to other carriers for providing roaming services to their customers when their customers utilize our network. We also offer prepaid voice service to certain customers who prefer to control usage or pay in advance.



Equipment–We sell a wide variety of handsets, wirelessly enabled computers (i.e., tablets and notebooks) and personal computer wireless data cards manufactured by various suppliers for use with our voice and data services. We sell through our own company-owned stores, agents or third-party retail stores. Like other wireless service providers, we often provide postpaid contract subscribers substantial equipment subsidies to initiate, renew or upgrade service. To reduce these subsidies, we launched our AT&T Next program, which allows customers to buy handsets on an installment basis. As a result of the program, we expect equipment revenues to increase in 2014 along with a proportionate decline in service revenues. We also sell accessories, such as carrying cases, hands-free devices, batteries, battery chargers and other items, to consumers, as well as to agents and third-party distributors for resale.



Equity in net income (loss) of affiliates –The Wireless segment includes expenses from our mobile payment joint venture with Verizon and T-Mobile, marketed as the Isis Mobile WalletTM(ISIS).



Additional information on our Wireless segment is contained in the Annual Report in the “Operating Environment Overview” section under the heading “Expected Growth Areas,” “Wireless” and in “Other Business Matters” and “Liquidity and Capital Resources” beginning on page 21 and is incorporated herein by reference pursuant to General Instruction G(2).



WIRELINE

Our Wireline subsidiaries provide both retail and wholesale communication services domestically and internationally. Our Wireline segment provided approximately 46% of 2013 segment operating revenues and 27% of our 2013 total segment income. We divide our wireline services into three product-based categories: data, voice and other. Revenues from our traditional voice services have been declining as customers have been switching to wireless, or VoIP services provided by either us, cable or other Internet-based providers. In addition, the continuing weak job growth and business starts have caused wireline customers to terminate their residential or business phone service as individuals have lost jobs or otherwise combined households and businesses have not added jobs. We have responded by offering packages of combined voice and data services, including broadband and video, and intend to continue this strategy during 2014.



Services and Products

Data– We provide data services that rely on IP-based technology and data services that rely on older, circuit-based technology. We provide businesses voice applications over IP-based networks (i.e., Enhanced Virtual Private Networks or “EVPN”). Over the past several years, we have built out our new IP/MPLS (Internet Protocol/MultiProtocol Label Switching) network, to supplement our IP-based product set, and eventually replace our older circuit-based networks and services. These products allow us to provide highly complex global data networks. Additional IP-based services include Internet access and network integration, dedicated Internet and enterprise networking services, U-verse services and related data equipment sales. These advanced IP-based services continued to grow during 2013 as customers shift from our older circuit-based services. Advanced IP-data now represents more than 30% of our revenues from wireline business customers. We expect this trend to continue in 2014 as both consumers and businesses continue to use more services based on Internet access and demand ever-increasing transmission speeds, especially for video. To cope with these trends, we continue to re-configure our wireline network.

4AT&T Inc.

Our circuit-based, traditional data products include switched and dedicated transport services that allow business customers to transmit data at high speeds, as well as DSL Internet access. Our offerings use high-capacity digital circuits, and allow customers to create internal data networks and to access external data networks. Switched Transport services transmit data using switching equipment to transfer the data between multiple lines before reaching its destination. Dedicated Transport services use a single direct line to transmit data between destinations. DSL is a digital modem technology that converts existing twisted-pair telephone lines into access paths for multimedia and high-speed data communications to the Internet or private networks.



Network integration services include installation of business data systems, local area networking and other data networking offerings. Internet access services include a wide range of products for residences and businesses including access service, dedicated access, web hosting, managed services, e-mail and high-speed access services. Our managed web-hosting services for businesses provide network, server and security infrastructure as well as built-in data storage and include application performance management, database management, hardware and operating system management. Our hosting services also provide customers with secure access to detailed reporting information about their infrastructure and applications. These services are evolving to a cloud delivery model, providing customers with on-demand data storage and computing capabilities from a centrally-managed network (referred to as the cloud) accessible from a variety of different devices and locations.



Packet services consist of data networks using packet switching and transmission technologies, including traditional circuit-based, and IP connectivity services. Packet services enable customers to transmit large volumes of data economically and securely and are used for local area network (LAN) interconnection, remote site, point of sale and branch office communications. High-speed packet services are used extensively by enterprise (large business) customers.



Enterprise networking services provide comprehensive support from network design, implementation and installation to ongoing network operations and management for networks of varying scales, including LANs, wide area networks, and virtual private networks. These services include applications such as e-mail, order entry systems, employee directories, human resource transactions and other database applications. We also offer Wi-Fi service.



We provide local, interstate and international wholesale networking capacity to other service providers. We offer a combination of high-volume transmission capacity and conventional dedicated line services on a regional, national and international basis to wireless carriers, interexchange carriers, Internet service providers (ISPs) and facility-based and switchless resellers. Our wholesale customers are primarily large ISPs, wireless carriers, competitive local exchange carriers, regional phone companies, interexchange carriers, cable companies and systems integrators.



Voice– Voice includes traditional local and long-distance service provided to retail customers and wholesale access to our network and individual network elements provided to competitors. At December 31, 2013, our wireline subsidiaries served approximately 12 million retail consumer access lines, 10 million retail business access lines and 2 million wholesale access lines. We also have a number of integrated voice and data services, such as integrated network connections, that provide customers the ability to integrate access for their voice and data services, the data component of which is included in data revenues. Additionally, voice revenues do not include any of our VoIP revenues, which are included in data revenues.



Long distance consists of traditional long distance and international long distance for customers that select us as their primary long-distance carrier. Long distance also includes services provided by calling card, 1-800 services and conference calling. We also provide wholesale switched access service to other service providers.



Voice also includes calling features, fees to maintain wire located inside customer premises and other miscellaneous voice products. Calling features are enhanced telephone services available to retail customers such as Caller ID, Call Waiting and voice mail.



Other–Other includes major items such as outsourcing, integration services and customer premises equipment, and government-related services.



Customer premises equipment and other equipment sales range from single-line and cordless telephones to sophisticated private digital switching systems used by larger businesses to provide intra-office telephone services as well as access to our network.

5AT&T Inc.OTHER

The Other segment provided less than 1% of total segment operating revenues in 2013. Since segment operating expenses exceeded revenues in 2013, a segment loss was incurred. We also include in this segment the equity income from our investments in América Móvil, S.A. de C.V. and YP Holdings. Our Other segment also includes corporate and other operations and impacts from corporate-wide decisions for which the individual operating segments are not being evaluated.

1Includes major items such as outsourcing, integration services and customer premises equipment, and government-related services.



GOVERNMENT REGULATION



Wireless communications providers must be licensed by the FCC to provide communications services at specified spectrum frequencies within specified geographic areas and must comply with the rules and policies governing the use of the spectrum as adopted by the FCC. The FCC’s rules have a direct impact on whether the wireless industry has sufficient spectrum available to support the high quality, innovative services our customers demand. Wireless licenses are issued for a fixed time period, typically ten years, and we must seek renewal of these licenses. While the FCC has generally renewed licenses given to operating companies such as us, the FCC has authority to both revoke a license for cause and to deny a license renewal if a renewal is not in the public interest. Additionally, while wireless communications providers’ prices and service offerings are generally not subject to regulation, the federal government and various states are considering new regulations and legislation relating to various aspects of wireless services.



On January 14, 2014, the D.C. Circuit released its decision on Verizon’s appeal of the FCC’s Net Neutrality rules. Those rules prohibited providers of fixed, mass market Internet access service from blocking access to lawful content, applications, services or non-harmful devices. The rules prohibited providers of mobile broadband Internet access service from blocking consumers from accessing lawful websites or applications that compete with the provider’s own voice or video telephony services. The rules also imposed transparency requirements on providers of both fixed and mobile broadband Internet access services, requiring public disclosure of information regarding network management practices, performance and commercial terms of their service offerings. In addition, the rules prohibited providers of fixed (but not mobile) broadband Internet access service from unreasonably discriminating in their transmission of lawful network traffic.



In its decision, the court found the FCC had authority under section 706 of the Act (which directs the FCC and state commissions to promote broadband deployment) to adopt rules designed to preserve the open Internet, but vacated and remanded the antidiscrimination and no-blocking rules on the ground that they impermissibly imposed common carrier regulation on broadband Internet access service. The court held that, having declared broadband Internet access services to be information services, the FCC could not regulate them as telecommunications services. The court did not vacate the transparency rules.



The invalidation of the no-blocking and antidiscrimination rules means that broadband Internet access providers have greater flexibility in their provision of mass market services. However, the court’s finding that section 706 provides the FCC independent authority to adopt rules to promote broadband deployment appears to give the FCC broad authority to regulate the Internet and, more generally, IP-based services, provided the FCC finds such regulation promotes deployment of broadband infrastructure. In addition, because section 706(a) grants authority to both the FCC and the states to adopt rules to promote broadband deployment, states could attempt to rely on that provision to regulate broadband services, although the states’ authority to do so appears to be narrower than the FCC’s. If the FCC were to reclassify broadband as a telecommunications service, or the FCC and/or the states were to impose additional regulation of the Internet or broadband services, it could have a material adverse impact on our broadband services and operating results.

6AT&T Inc.Our wireline subsidiaries are subject to regulation by state governments, which have the power to regulate intrastate rates and services, including local, long-distance and network access services, provided such state regulation is consistent with federal law. Some states have eliminated or reduced regulations on our retail offerings. These subsidiaries are also subject to the jurisdiction of the FCC with respect to intercarrier compensation, interconnection, and interstate and international rates and services, including interstate access charges. Access charges are a form of intercarrier compensation designed to compensate our wireline subsidiaries for the use of their networks by other carriers.



Our subsidiaries operating outside the United States are subject to the jurisdiction of national and supranational regulatory authorities in the market where service is provided. Regulation is generally limited to operational licensing authority for the provision of enterprise services.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT



AT&T Labs’ scientists and engineers conduct research in a variety of areas, including IP networking; advanced network design and architecture; network and cyber security, network operations support systems; data mining techniques and advanced speech technologies. The majority of the development activities are performed by AT&T Services, Inc. The developers within AT&T Services, Inc. work with our business units and AT&T Labs to create new services and invent tools and systems to manage secure and reliable networks for us and our customers. In recent years, we initiated a technology outreach effort aimed at venture capital funded startups with the objective of rapidly introducing new solutions, products and applications developed by third parties. We also have a research agreement with Ericsson. Research and development expenses were $1,488 in 2013, $1,278 million in 2012, and $1,307 million in 2011.



EMPLOYEES



As of January 31, 2014, we employed approximately 243,000 persons. Approximately 55 percent of our employees are represented by the Communications Workers of America (CWA), the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers or other unions.  Contracts covering wages and other non-benefit working terms for mobility employees are structured on a regional basis.  In February 2014, we reached a tentative agreement with the CWA for the one regional Mobility contract (covering approximately 11,500 employees) expiring in 2014.  The four year tentative agreement includes moderate wage increases, work rule changes and, for employees hired after 2014, the Company will increase its matching contributions to a 401(k) plan rather than provide a pension plan.  No contracts covering employees in our traditional wireline telephone operations will expire during 2014.



At December 31, 2013, we had approximately 310,000 retirees who, along with their dependents, were eligible to receive retiree benefits.
