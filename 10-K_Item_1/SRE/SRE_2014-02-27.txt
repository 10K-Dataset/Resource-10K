GOVERNMENT REGULATION





California State Utility Regulation



The California Utilities are regulated by the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC), the California Energy Commission (CEC) and the California Air Resources Board (CARB).



The California Public Utilities Commission:



§consists of five commissioners appointed by the Governor of California for staggered, six-year terms.



§regulates SDG&E’s and SoCalGas’ rates and conditions of service, sales of securities, rates of return, capital structure, rates of depreciation, and long-term resource procurement, except as described below in “United States Utility Regulation.”



§has jurisdiction over the proposed construction of major new electric generation, transmission and distribution, and natural gas storage, transmission and distribution facilities in California.



§conducts reviews and audits of utility performance and compliance with regulatory guidelines, and conducts investigations into various matters, such as deregulation, competition and the environment, to determine its future policies.



§regulates the interactions and transactions of the California Utilities with Sempra Energy and its other affiliates.



The CPUC also oversees and regulates new products and services, including solar energy, bioenergy and other forms of renewable energy. In addition, the CPUC’s safety and enforcement role includes inspections, investigations and penalty and citation processes for safety violations.



We provide further discussion in Notes 13 and 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in the Annual Report.



SDG&E is also subject to regulation by the CEC, which publishes electric demand forecasts for the state and for specific service territories.  Based upon these forecasts, the CEC:



§determines the need for additional energy sources and conservation programs;



§sponsors alternative-energy research and development projects;



§promotes energy conservation programs;



§maintains a statewide plan of action in case of energy shortages; and



§certifies power-plant sites and related facilities within California.



The CEC conducts a 20-year forecast of available supplies and prices for every market sector that consumes natural gas in California. This forecast includes resource evaluation, pipeline capacity needs, natural gas demand and wellhead prices, and costs of transportation and distribution. This analysis is one of many resource materials used to support the California Utilities’ long-term investment decisions.



In 2010, the State of California required certain California electric retail sellers, including SDG&E, to deliver 20 percent of their retail energy sales from renewable energy sources. The rules governing this requirement, administered by both the CPUC and the CEC, are generally known as the Renewables Portfolio Standard (RPS) Program. In December 2011, California Senate Bill 2(1X) (33% RPS Program) went into effect, superseding the previous RPS program. The 33% RPS Program requires each California utility to procure 33 percent of its annual electric energy requirements from renewable energy sources by 2020, with an average 20 percent required over the three-year period January 1, 2011 through December 31, 2013; 25 percent by December 31, 2016; and 33 percent by December 31, 2020. We discuss this requirement as it applies to SDG&E in Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in the Annual Report.



Certification of a generation project by the CEC as an Eligible Renewable Energy Resource (ERR) allows the purchase of output from such generation facility to be counted towards fulfillment of the RPS Program requirements, if such purchase meets the provisions of California Senate Bill 2(1X). This may affect the demand for output from renewables projects developed by Sempra Renewables and Sempra Mexico, particularly from California utilities. Sempra Renewables’ Copper Mountain Solar 1 facility in Nevada is certified as an ERR. Sempra Renewables has 50-percent interests in both the Copper Mountain Solar 2 and Mesquite Solar 1 facilities, both of which have ERR certification. Sempra Renewables has received pre-certification of the Copper Mountain Solar 3 facility and will submit an application for ERR certification of each phase as it begins operations. We plan to obtain ERR certification for all of our renewable facilities operating in and/or providing power to California as they become operational.



CaliforniaAssembly Bill (AB) 32, the California Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006, assigns responsibility to CARB for monitoring and establishing policies for reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The bill requires CARB to develop and adopt a comprehensive plan for achieving real, quantifiable and cost-effective GHG emission reductions, including a statewide GHG emissions cap, mandatory reporting rules, and regulatory and market mechanisms to achieve reductions of GHG emissions. CARB is a department within the California Environmental Protection Agency, an organization that reports directly to the Governor’s Office in the Executive Branch of California State Government. Sempra Natural Gas and Sempra Mexico are also subject to the rules and regulations of CARB. We provide further discussion in Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in the Annual Report.





United States Utility Regulation



The California Utilities are also regulated by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) and the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT).



In the case of SDG&E, the FERC regulates the interstate sale and transportation of natural gas, the transmission and wholesale sales of electricity in interstate commerce, transmission access, rates of return on transmission investment, the uniform systems of accounts, rates of depreciation and electric rates involving sales for resale.



In the case of SoCalGas, the FERC regulates the interstate sale and transportation of natural gas and the uniform systems of accounts.



The NRC oversees the licensing, construction, operation and decommissioning of nuclear facilities in the United States, including the San Onofre Nuclear Generating Station (SONGS), in which SDG&E owns a 20-percent interest. NRC regulations require extensive review of the safety, radiological and environmental aspects of these facilities. The majority owner of SONGS, Southern California Edison Company (Edison), made a decision to permanently retire the facility in June 2013. We provide further discussion of current SONGS matters involving the NRC and the closure of the facility in Note 13 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in the Annual Report.



The DOT has established regulations regarding engineering standards and operating procedures applicable for the California Utilities’ natural gas transmission and distribution pipelines. The DOT has certified the CPUC to administer oversight and compliance with these regulations for the entities they regulate in California.





State and Local Regulation Within the U.S.



SoCalGas has natural gas franchises with the 12 counties and the 222 cities in its service territory. These franchises allow SoCalGas to locate, operate and maintain facilities for the transmission and distribution of natural gas. Most of the franchises have indefinite lives with no expiration date. Some franchises have fixed expiration dates, ranging from 2014 to 2062.



SDG&E has



§electric franchises with the three counties and the 27 cities in or adjoining its electric service territory; and



§natural gas franchises with the one county and the 18 cities in its natural gas service territory.



These franchises allow SDG&E to locate, operate and maintain facilities for the transmission and distribution of electricity and/or natural gas. Most of the franchises have indefinite lives with no expiration dates. Some natural gas and some electric franchises have fixed expiration dates that range from 2015 to 2037.



Sempra Natural Gas also operates Mobile Gas Service Corporation (Mobile Gas), a natural gas distribution utility serving southwest Alabama that is regulated by the Alabama Public Service Commission. Mobile Gas has franchise agreements with the two counties and eight cities in its service territory, with fixed expiration dates ranging from 2015 to 2033, which allow it to locate, operate and maintain facilities for the transmission and distribution of natural gas.



Sempra Renewables has operations, investments or development projects in Arizona, California, Colorado, Hawaii, Indiana, Kansas, Nebraska, Nevada and Pennsylvania. Sempra Natural Gas develops and operates natural gas storage and related pipeline facilities in Alabama, Louisiana and Mississippi, operates its Mesquite Power natural gas generation facility in Arizona and has marketing operations in Texas and California. Sempra Natural Gas also operates Willmut Gas Company (Willmut Gas), a natural gas distribution utility serving Hattiesburg, Mississippi and regulated by the Mississippi Public Service Commission. These entities are subject to state and local laws, and to regulations in the states in which they operate.





Other U.S. Regulation



In the United States, the FERC, with ratemaking authority over sales of wholesale power and the transportation and storage of natural gas in interstate commerce, and siting and permitting authority for liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminals, regulates Sempra Renewables’ and Sempra Natural Gas’ operations. Sempra Renewables and Sempra Natural Gas operate under the jurisdiction of the North American Electric Reliability Corporation, which is subject to oversight by the FERC. Sempra Natural Gas also owns an interest in the Rockies Express Pipeline, a natural gas pipeline that operates in eight states in the United States and is subject to regulation by the FERC. We discuss our investment in the pipeline further in Note 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in the Annual Report.



The FERC may regulate rates and terms of service based on a cost-of-service approach or, in geographic and product markets determined by the FERC to be sufficiently competitive, rates may be market-based. Our LNG terminal in the United States is subject to market-based rates and terms of service. FERC-regulated rates at the following businesses are



§Sempra Renewables and Sempra Natural Gas: market-based for wholesale electricity sales



§Sempra Natural Gas: cost-based and market-based for the transportation and storage of natural gas, respectively



§Sempra Natural Gas: market-based for the receipt, storage, and vaporization of LNG and liquefaction of natural gas and the purchase and sale of LNG and natural gas



The California Utilities and Sempra Natural Gas are subject to regulation by the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission. Sempra Natural Gas is also subject to DOT rules and regulations regarding pipeline safety. Our Cameron LNG terminal is also subject to regulations of the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) regarding the export of LNG.





Foreign Regulation



Our Sempra Mexico segment owns and operates the following in Mexico:



§a natural gas-fired power plant in Baja California, Mexico



§natural gas distribution systems in Mexicali, Chihuahua, and the La Laguna-Durango zone in north-central Mexico



§natural gas pipelines between the U.S. border and Baja California, Mexico and Sonora, Mexico. Sempra Mexico also owns a 50-percent interest in a joint venture with PEMEX (the Mexican state-owned oil company) that operates several natural gas pipelines and propane systems in Mexico



§the Energía Costa Azul LNG terminal located in Baja California, Mexico



These operations are subject to regulation by the Energy Regulatory Commission (Comisión Reguladora de Energía, or CRE) and by the labor and environmental agencies of city, state and federal governments in Mexico.



Sempra Mexico’s operations in Mexico are primarily contained in the Sempra Energy subsidiary Infraestructura Energética Nova, S.A.B. de C.V. (IEnova). In the first quarter of 2013, IEnova completed a private offering in the U.S. and outside of Mexico and concurrent public offering in Mexico of common stock. The issuance of shares was approved and is subject to regulation by the Mexican National Banking and Securities Commission (Comisión Nacional Bancaria y de Valores, CNBV) for registration of the shares with the Mexican National Securities Registry (Registro Nacional de Valores, RNV) maintained by the CNBV. IEnova’s shares are traded on the Mexican Stock Exchange (La Bolsa Mexicana de Valores, S.A.B. de C.V., BMV) under the symbol “IENOVA.”



Sempra South American Utilities has two utilities in South America that are subject to laws and regulations in the localities and countries in which they operate. Chilquinta Energía S.A. (including its subsidiaries, Chilquinta Energía) is an electric distribution utility serving customers in the cities of Valparaiso and Viña del Mar in central Chile. Luz del Sur S.A.A. (including its subsidiaries, Luz del Sur) is an electric distribution utility in the southern zone of metropolitan Lima, Peru. These utilities serve primarily regulated customers, and their revenues are based on tariffs that are set by the National Energy Commission (Comisión Nacional de Energía, or CNE) in Chile and the Energy and Mining Investment Supervisory Body (Organismo Supervisor de la Inversión en Energía y Minería, or OSINERGMIN) of the National Electricity Office under the Ministry of Energy and Mines in Peru.





Licenses and Permits



The California Utilities obtain numerous permits, authorizations and licenses in connection with the transmission and distribution of natural gas and electricity and the operation and construction of related assets, some of which may require periodic renewal.



Our other subsidiaries are also required to obtain numerous permits, authorizations and licenses in the normal course of business. Some of these permits, authorizations and licenses require periodic renewal.



Sempra Mexico and Sempra South American Utilities obtain numerous permits, authorizations and licenses for their electric and natural gas distribution and transmission systems from the local governments where the service is provided. The concession to operate from the Ministerio de Energía for both Chilquinta Energía’s and Luz del Sur’s distribution operations is for an indefinite term, not requiring renewal.



Sempra Mexico and Sempra Natural Gas obtain licenses and permits for the operation and expansion of LNG facilities, and the import and export of LNG and natural gas.



SempraRenewables obtains a number of permits, authorizations and licenses in connection with the construction and operation of power generation facilities, and in connection with the wholesale distribution of electricity.



SempraNatural Gas obtains a number of permits, authorizations and licenses in connection with the construction and operation of power generation facilities and natural gas storage facilities and pipelines, and in connection with the wholesale distribution of electricity.



Most of the permits and licenses associated with construction and operations within the Sempra Renewables and Sempra Natural Gas businesses are for periods generally in alignment with the construction cycle or life of the asset and in many cases greater than 20 years. We do not anticipate that our ongoing requirement to renew or extend shorter duration permits and licenses would have a material impact to the ongoing operations of these businesses.



We describe other regulatory matters in Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in the Annual Report.





CALIFORNIA NATURAL GAS UTILITY OPERATIONS



SoCalGas and SDG&E sell, distribute and transport natural gas. SoCalGas purchases and stores natural gas for its core customers and SDG&E’s core customers on a combined portfolio basis and provides natural gas storage services for others. The California Utilities’ resource planning, natural gas procurement, contractual commitments, and related regulatory matters are discussed below. We also provide further discussion in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” and in Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in the Annual Report.





Customers



At December 31, 2013, SoCalGas had 5.8 million customer meters consisting of approximately:



§5,568,200 residential



§246,700commercial



§27,000industrial



§40 electric generation and wholesale



At December 31, 2013, SDG&E had approximately 865,000 natural gas customer meters consisting of approximately:



§832,000 residential



§28,600commercial



§3,700electric generation and cogeneration



For regulatory purposes, end-use customers are classified as either core or noncore customers. Core customers are primarily residential and small commercial and industrial customers. Noncore customers at SoCalGas consist primarily of electric generation, wholesale, large commercial and industrial, and enhanced oil recovery customers. SoCalGas’ wholesale customers are primarily other investor-owned utilities (IOUs), including SDG&E, or municipally owned natural gas distribution systems. Noncore customers at SDG&E consist primarily of electric generation and large commercial and industrial customers.



Most core customers purchase natural gas directly from SoCalGas or SDG&E. While core customers are permitted to purchase directly from producers, marketers or brokers, the California Utilities are obligated to provide reliable supplies of natural gas to serve the requirements of their core customers. Noncore customers are responsible for the procurement of their natural gas requirements.



In 2013, SoCalGas added approximately 23,000 new connected natural gas customer meters, representing an annual growth rate of 0.4 percent; in 2012, it added approximately 18,000 new connected meters, representing an annual growth rate of 0.3 percent. SDG&E’s connected natural gas customer meters increased by nearly 5,000 in both 2013 and 2012, representing an annual growth rate of 0.6 percent in both years. Based on forecasts of new housing starts, SoCalGas and SDG&E each expects that its new meter annual growth rates in 2014 will be slightly higher than those in 2013.





Natural Gas Procurement and Transportation



SoCalGaspurchases natural gas under short-term and long-term contracts for the California Utilities’ core customers. SoCalGas purchases natural gas from Canada, the U.S. Rockies and the southwestern U.S. to meet its and SDG&E’s core customer requirements and maintain pipeline reliability. It also purchases some California natural gas production and additional supplies delivered directly to California for its remaining requirements. Purchases of natural gas are primarily priced based on published monthly bid-week indices.



To ensure the delivery of the natural gas supplies to its distribution system and to meet the seasonal and annual needs of customers, SoCalGas has entered into firm interstate pipeline capacity contracts that require the payment of fixed reservation charges to reserve firm transportation rights. These contracts expire on various dates between 2014 and 2028. Pipeline companies, primarily El Paso Natural Gas Company, Transwestern Pipeline Company, Gas Transmission Northwest, Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PG&E), and Kern River Gas Transmission Company, provide transportation services into SoCalGas’ intrastate transmission system for supplies purchased by SoCalGas or its transportation customers from outside of California. The FERC regulates the rates that interstate pipeline companies may charge for natural gas and transportation services.





Natural Gas Storage



SoCalGas provides natural gas storage services for core, noncore and non-end-use customers. The California Utilities’ core customers are allocated a portion of SoCalGas’ storage capacity. SoCalGas offers the remaining storage capacity for sale to others, including SDG&E for its non-core customer requirements, through an open bid process. The storage service program provides opportunities for these customers to purchase and store natural gas when natural gas costs are low, usually during the summer, thereby reducing purchases when natural gas costs are expected to be higher. This program allows customers to better manage their natural gas procurement and transportation needs.





Demand for Natural Gas



Growth in the demand for natural gas largely depends on the health and expansion of the Southern California economy, prices of alternative energy products, environmental regulations, renewable energy, legislation, and the effectiveness of energy efficiency programs. External factors such as weather, the price of electricity, the use of hydroelectric power, development of renewable energy resources, development of new natural gas supply sources, and general economic conditions can also result in significant shifts in market price, which may in turn impact demand.



The California Utilities face competition in the residential and commercial customer markets based on customers’ preferences for natural gas compared with other energy products. In the noncore industrial market, some customers are capable of securing alternate fuel supplies from other suppliers which can affect the demand for natural gas. The California Utilities’ ability to maintain their respective industrial market shares is largely dependent on the relative price spread between delivered natural gas and potential fuel alternatives such as propane.



Natural gas demand for electric generation within Southern California competes with electric power generated throughout the western U.S. Natural gas transported for electric generating plant customers may be affected by the growth in renewable generation, the addition of more efficient gas technologies and to the extent that regulatory changes and electric transmission infrastructure investment divert electric generation from the California Utilities’ respective service areas. The demand may also fluctuate due to volatility in the demand for electricity and the availability of competing supplies of electricity such as hydroelectric generation and other renewable energy sources. We provide additional information regarding the electric industry in Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in the Annual Report.



The natural gas distribution business is seasonal, and revenues generally are greater during the winter heating months. As is prevalent in the industry, SoCalGas injects natural gas into storage during the summer months (usually April through October) for withdrawal from storage during the winter months (usually November through March) when customer demand is higher.





ELECTRIC UTILITY OPERATIONS





SDG&E





Customers



SDG&E’s service area covers 4,100 square miles. At December 31, 2013, SDG&E had 1.4 million electric customer meters consisting of approximately:



§1,252,400 residential



§148,000commercial



§500industrial



§2,100 street and highway lighting



§5,400direct access



SDG&E’s active electric customer meters increased by approximately 7,000 in both 2013 and 2012, representing annual growth rates of 0.5 percent in both years. Based on forecasting of new housing starts, SDG&E expects that its new meter annual growth rate in 2014 will be slightly higher than the growth in 2013.



Resource Planning and Power Procurement



SDG&E’s resource planning, power procurement and related regulatory matters are discussed in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and in Notes 14 and 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in the Annual Report.





Electric Resources



The supply of electric power available to SDG&E for resale is based on CPUC-approved purchased-power contracts currently in place with its various suppliers, its wholly owned generating facilities, and purchases on a spot basis. This supply as of December 31, 2013 is as follows:

It includes cogeneration facilities, which produce electricity and another form of useful thermal energy (such as heat or steam) used for industrial, commercial, residential or institutional purposes.(2)Tolling contracts are purchased-power agreements under which SDG&E provides the fuel for generation to the energy supplier.





Charges under most of the contracts with QFs are based on SDG&E’s avoided cost. Charges under the remaining contracts are for firm and as-generated energy, and are based on the amount of energy received or are tolls based on available capacity. The prices under these contracts are based on the market value at the time the contracts were negotiated.





Natural Gas Supply



SDG&E buys natural gas under short-term contracts for its Palomar, Miramar, Desert Star and Cuyamaca Peak generating facilities and for the Otay Mesa Energy Center LLC, Orange Grove Energy L.P., El Cajon Energy, LLC and Escondido Energy Center, LLC tolling contracts. Purchases are from various southwestern U.S. suppliers and are primarily priced based on published monthly bid-week indices. SDG&E’s natural gas is typically delivered from Southern California border receipt points to the SoCal CityGate pool via backbone transmission system rights which expire on September 30, 2014. The natural gas is then delivered to the generating facilities through SoCalGas’ and SDG&E’s pipeline systems in accordance with a transportation agreement that expires on May 31, 2015. SDG&E has also contracted with SoCalGas for natural gas storage through March 31, 2014.





Power Pool



SDG&E is a participant in the Western Systems Power Pool, which includes an electric-power and transmission-rate agreement with utilities and power agencies located throughout the United States and Canada. More than 300 investor-owned and municipal utilities, state and federal power agencies, energy brokers and power marketers share power and information in order to increase efficiency and competition in the bulk power market. Participants are able to make power transactions on standardized terms, including market-based rates, preapproved by the FERC.





Transmission Arrangements



SDG&E’s 500-kilovolt (kV) Southwest Powerlink transmission line, which is shared with Arizona Public Service Company and Imperial Irrigation District, extends from Palo Verde, Arizona to San Diego, California. SDG&E’s share of the line is 1,162 MW, although it can be less under certain system conditions.



SDG&E’s Sunrise Powerlink is a 500-kV transmission line project built by SDG&E that is delivering up to 800 MW of energy and is designed to deliver more than 1,000 MW of power from the Imperial Valley to the San Diego region. The line was placed in service in June 2012. We provide further discussion of Sunrise Powerlink in Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in the Annual Report.



Mexico’s Baja California system is connected to SDG&E’s system via two 230-kV interconnections with combined capacity up to 408 MW in the north-to-south direction and 800 MW in the south-to-north direction, although it can be less under certain system conditions.



Edison’s transmission is connected to SDG&E’s system at SONGS via five 230-kV transmission lines with a total firm capacity up to 2,500 MW into SDG&E’s system, although it can be less under certain system conditions.





Transmission Access



The National Energy Policy Act governs procedures for requests for transmission service. The FERC approved the California IOUs’ transfer of operation and control of their transmission facilities to the Independent System Operator in 1998. We provide additional information regarding transmission issues in Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in the Annual Report.





Chilquinta Energía





Customers



Chilquinta Energía is an electric distribution utility serving approximately 640,000 customers in the cities of Valparaiso and Viña del Mar in central Chile, with a main service area covering 4,400 square miles. At December 31, 2013, its customers consisted of approximately:

Power Generation System



The Sistema Eléctrico Interconectado Nacional (SEIN) is the Peruvian national interconnected system.  Peru also has several isolated regional and smaller systems that provide electricity to specific areas. The OSINERGMIN is an autonomous public regulatory entity that controls and enforces compliance with legal and technical regulations related to electric activities, sets tariffs and supervises the bidding processes required by distribution companies to purchase energy from generators.



TheCommittee of Economic Operation of the National Interconnected System (Comité de Operación Económica del Sistema Interconectado Nacional, orCOES) coordinates the operation and dispatch of electricity of the SEIN, and manages the short-term market. The COES oversees generation, transmission and distribution companies, as well unregulated customers with a demand higher than 200 kW.



Transmission System and Access



Transmission lines in Peru are divided into principal and secondary systems. The principal system lines are accessible by all generators and allow the flow of energy through the national grid. The secondary system lines connect principal transmission with the network of distribution companies or connect directly to certain final customers. The transmission company receives tariff revenues and collects tolls based on a charge per unit of electricity.





RATES AND REGULATION – UTILITIES



We provide information concerning rates and regulation applicable to our utilities in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and in Notes 1, 13 and 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in the Annual Report.





SEMPRA INTERNATIONAL AND SEMPRA U.S. GAS & POWER



Sempra International and Sempra U.S. Gas & Power contain most of our subsidiaries that are not subject to California utility regulation. In addition to the discussion of our South American utilities above, we provide descriptions of these operating units’ segments and information concerning their operations in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and in Notes 1, 3, 4, 15 and 16 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in the Annual Report.





Competition



Sempra Energy’s non-utility businesses are among many others in the energy industry providing similar services. They are engaged in highly competitive activities that require significant capital investments and highly skilled and experienced personnel. Among these competitors there may be significant variation in financial, personnel and other resources compared to Sempra International and Sempra U.S. Gas & Power.



Generation – Renewables



Sempra Renewables primarily competes for wholesale contracts for the generation and sale of electricity through its development of and investments in wind and solar generation facilities. For sales of non-contracted renewable energy, Sempra Renewables competes with other non-utility generators, regulated utilities, unregulated subsidiaries of regulated utilities, and other energy service companies. The number and type of competitors may vary based on location, generation type and project size. Also, recently enacted regulatory initiatives designed to enhance energy consumption from renewable resources for regulated utility companies may increase competition from these types of institutions. These utilities may have a lower cost of capital than most independent renewable power producers and often are able to recover fixed costs through rate base mechanisms. This recovery allows them to build, buy and upgrade renewable generation projects without relying exclusively on market clearing prices to recover their investments.  Additionally, generation from Sempra Renewables’ renewable energy assets is exposed to fluctuations in naturally occurring conditions such as wind, inclement weather and hours of sunlight.



Our renewable energy competitors include, among others:



§Exelon Energy§Iberdrola Renewables§MidAmerican Energy§NextEra Energy Resources§NRG Energy





Generation – Natural Gas



For sales of non-contracted power, Sempra Natural Gas is subject to competition from energy marketers, utilities, industrial companies and other independent power producers. For a number of years, natural gas has been the fuel of choice for new power generation facilities for economic, operational and environmental reasons. While natural gas-fired facilities will continue to be an important part of the nation’s generation portfolio, some regulated utilities are now constructing units powered by renewable resources, often with subsidies or under legislative mandate. These utilities may have a lower cost of capital than most independent power producers and often are able to recover fixed costs through rate base mechanisms. This recovery may allow them to build, buy and upgrade generation without relying exclusively on market clearing prices to recover their investments.



When Sempra Natural Gas sells power not subject to long-term contractual commitments, it is exposed to market fluctuations in prices based on a number of factors, including the amount of capacity available to meet demand, the price and availability of fuel, and the presence of transmission constraints. Some of our competitors, such as electric utilities and generation companies, have their own generation capacity, including natural gas, coal and nuclear generation.  These companies, generally larger than our segments engaged in the natural gas business, may have a lower cost of capital and may have competitive advantages as a result of their scale and the location of their generation facilities. In January 2014, management approved a plan to market and sell Sempra Natural Gas’ remaining generation asset, a 625-MW block of the Mesquite Power natural gas-fired power plant in Arizona, as we discuss in Note 18 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in the Annual Report.



Our natural gas generation competitors include, among others:



§Calpine§NextEra Energy Resources§Dynegy§Exelon Corporation§NRG Energy





Because Sempra Mexico sells the power that it generates at its Termoeléctrica de Mexicali plant into California, it is also impacted by these competitive factors.



Natural Gas Pipelines and Storage Facilities



Within its market area, Sempra Natural Gas’ and Sempra Mexico’s pipelines businesses and Sempra Natural Gas’ storage facilities businesses compete with other regulated and unregulated storage facilities and pipelines. They compete primarily on the basis of price (in terms of storage and transportation fees), available capacity and interconnections to downstream markets.



Sempra Natural Gas’ competitors include, among others:



§AGL Resources§Boardwalk Pipeline Partners§Cardinal Gas Storage Partners§Clean Energy§Duke Energy§Enbridge§Energy Transfer Partners§Enstor§Enterprise Products Partners§Kinder Morgan§Macquarie Infrastructure Partners§NiSource§Plains All American Pipeline§Spectra Energy§TransCanada§The Williams Companies





Sempra Mexico’s natural gas pipeline competitors include, among others:



§EDF Energy§Elecnor§Enagas§Fermaca§GDF SUEZ§Kinder Morgan§Mitsui§PEMEX (MGI)§Promigas§TransCanada





LNG



Technological advances associated with shale gas and tight oil production have reduced the forecasted need for North American LNG import facilities and increased interest in liquefaction and export opportunities.



At current forward gas prices, brownfield U.S. Gulf Coast liquefaction appears to be among the most price competitive potential LNG supply in the world. Its price competitiveness results from many factors, including:



§high levels of undeveloped North American unconventional natural gas and tight oil resources relative to domestic consumption levels;



§increasing gas and oil drilling productivity and decreasing unit costs of gas production;



§low breakeven prices of marginal North American unconventional gas production;



§proximity to ample existing gas transmission pipeline and underground gas storage capacity; and



§existing LNG tankage and berths.



It is expected that global LNG competition, primarily from Canada, Russia, East Africa and Australia, will limit U.S. LNG exports, as international liquefaction projects attempt to match U.S. Gulf Coast LNG production costs. Host governments for international liquefaction projects are altering fiscal and tax regimes in an effort to make projects in their jurisdictions competitive relative to U.S. projects.  It is expected that United States LNG exports will greatly increase competition for current and future global natural gas demand, and thereby facilitate development of a global commodity market for natural gas.



Sempra Natural Gas is currently progressing with plans for a development project to utilize its Cameron LNG receipt terminal for the liquefaction of natural gas and export of LNG. Sempra Natural Gas has signed long-term contracts for liquefaction services that allow us to fully utilize our existing regasification infrastructure while minimizing our future additional capital investment. The liquefaction facility will utilize Cameron LNG’s existing facilities, including two marine berths, three LNG storage tanks, and vaporization capability of 1.5 billion cubic feet (Bcf) per day. In January 2012, the DOE approved Cameron LNG’s application for authorization to export LNG to Free Trade Agreement (FTA) countries. In February 2014, the DOE issued a conditional authorization to export LNG to countries that do not have an FTA with the U.S.



In May 2013, Cameron LNG signed a joint venture agreement with its liquefaction customers, affiliates of GDF SUEZ S.A., Mitsubishi Corporation (through a related company jointly established with Nippon Yusen Kabushiki Kaisha (NYK)), and Mitsui & Co., Ltd., subject to a final investment decision, finalization of permit authorizations, securing financing commitments and other conditions. These customers compete globally to market and sell LNG to end users, including gas and electric utilities located in LNG importing countries around the world. By providing liquefaction services, Cameron LNG would compete indirectly with liquefaction projects currently operating and those under development in the global LNG market. In addition to the U.S., these competitors are located in the Middle East, Southeast Asia, Africa, South America, Australia and Europe.



Our planned LNG liquefaction business’ major domestic and international competitors include, among others, the following companies and their related LNG affiliates:



§BG§Kogas§BP§Mitsubishi§Cheniere Energy§Mitsui§Chevron§Petronas§China National Petroleum Company§Qatar Petroleum§ConocoPhillips§Santos§Dow Chemical§Royal Dutch Shell§ExxonMobil§Total§GDF SUEZ§Woodside§Kinder Morgan





ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS



We discuss environmental issues affecting us in Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in the Annual Report. You should read the following additional information in conjunction with those discussions.





Hazardous Substances



In 1994, the CPUC approved the Hazardous Waste Collaborative mechanism, allowing California’s IOUs to recover hazardous waste cleanup costs for certain sites, including those related to certain Superfund sites. This mechanism permits the California Utilities to recover in rates 90 percent of hazardous waste cleanup costs and related third-party litigation costs, and 70 percent of the related insurance-litigation expenses. In addition, the California Utilities have the opportunity to retain a percentage of any recoveries from insurance carriers and other third parties to offset the cleanup and associated litigation costs not recovered in rates.



At December 31, 2013, we had accrued estimated remaining investigation and remediation liabilities of $5.5 million at SDG&E and $15.1 million at SoCalGas, both related to hazardous waste sites for which the Hazardous Waste Collaborative mechanism applies, as described above. The accruals include costs for numerous locations, most of which had been manufactured-gas plants at SoCalGas. This estimated cost excludes remediation costs of $0.1 million associated with SDG&E’s former fossil-fuel power plants and other locations for which the cleanup costs are not being recovered in rates. We believe that any costs not ultimately recovered through rates, insurance or other means will not have a material adverse effect on the consolidated results of operations, cash flows or financial condition of Sempra Energy, SDG&E or SoCalGas.



We record estimated liabilities for environmental remediation when amounts are probable and estimable. In addition, we record amounts authorized to be recovered in rates under the Hazardous Waste Collaborative mechanism as regulatory assets.







Air and Water Quality



The electric and natural gas industries are subject to increasingly stringent air-quality and greenhouse gas standards, such as those established by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the CARB. We discuss these standards in “Government Regulation – California State Utility Regulation” above. The California Utilities generally recover in rates the costs to comply with these standards.



In connection with the issuance of operating permits, SDG&E and the other owners of SONGS have an agreement with the California Coastal Commission (CCC) to mitigate environmental impacts to the marine environment attributed to the cooling-water discharge from SONGS during its operation. SONGS’ early retirement, described in Note 13 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in the Annual Report, does not reduce SDG&E’s mitigation obligation. SDG&E’s share of the mitigation costs is estimated to be $57 million, of which $43 million had been incurred through December 31, 2013, and $14 million is accrued for the remaining costs through 2050. Artificial kelp reef, fish hatchery and wetlands restoration projects are complete, but continue to be studied until the CCC accepts the projects. The remaining costs are to meet CCC acceptance requirements and maintain the projects through 2050.
