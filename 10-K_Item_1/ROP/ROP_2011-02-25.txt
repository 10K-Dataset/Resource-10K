ITEM 1.BUSINESS





Our Business



Roper Industries, Inc. (“Roper” or the “Company”) was incorporated on December 17, 1981 under the laws of the State of Delaware. We are a diversified growth company that designs, manufactures and distributes medical and scientific imaging products and software, energy systems and controls, industrial technology products and radio frequency (“RF”) products and services. We market these products and services to selected segments of a broad range of markets including RF applications, medical, water, energy, research, education, food and food services, security and other niche markets.



We pursue consistent and sustainable growth in sales and earnings by emphasizing continuous improvement in the operating performance of our existing businesses and by acquiring other carefully selected businesses that offer high value-added services, engineered products and solutions and are capable of achieving growth and maintaining high margins. We compete in many niche markets and believe that we are the market leader or a competitive alternative to the market leader in the majority of these markets.





Market Share, Market Expansion, and Product Development



Leadership with Engineered Content for Niche Markets- We maintain a leading position in many of our markets. We believe our market positions are attributable to the technical sophistication of our products, the applications expertise used to create our advanced products and systems, and our distribution and service capabilities. Our operating units grow their businesses through new product development and development of new applications and services for existing products to satisfy customer needs. In addition, our operating units grow our customer base by expanding our distribution, selling other products through our existing channels and entering adjacent markets.



Diversified End Markets and Geographic Reach- Over the past decade, we have strategically expanded the number of end markets we serve to expand our opportunities for growth. We have a global presence, with sales of products manufactured and exported from the United States (“U.S.”) and manufactured abroad and sold to customers outside the U.S. totaling $944 million in 2010.  Information regarding our international operations is set forth in Note 15 of the notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report.



Research and Development- We conduct applied research and development to improve the quality and performance of our products and to develop new technologies and products. Our research and development spending was $102.4 million in 2010 as compared to $83.4 and $87.4 million in 2009 and 2008, respectively. Research and development expense as a percentage of sales increased to 4.3% in 2010 from 4.1% in 2009. The percentage has increased as the mix of our businesses shifts to higher technology, medical and software platforms.

Materials and Suppliers



We believe that most materials and supplies we use are readily available from numerous sources and suppliers throughout the world. However, some of our components and sub-assemblies are currently available from a limited number of suppliers. Some high-performance components for digital imaging products can be in short supply and/or suppliers have occasional difficulty manufacturing such components to our specifications. We regularly investigate and identify alternative sources where possible, and we believe that these conditions equally affect our competitors. Thus far, supply shortages have not had a material adverse effect on Roper’s sales although delays in shipments have occurred following such supply interruptions.





Environmental Matters and Other Governmental Regulation



Our operations and properties are subject to laws and regulations relating to environmental protection, including laws and regulations governing air emissions, water discharges, waste management and workplace safety. We use, generate and dispose of hazardous substances and waste in our operations and, as a result, could be subject to potentially material liabilities relating to the investigation and clean-up of contaminated properties and related claims. We are required to conform our operations and properties to these laws and adapt to regulatory requirements in all countries as these requirements change. In connection with our acquisitions, we may assume significant environmental liabilities, some of which we may not be aware of, or may not be quantifiable, at the time of acquisition. In addition, new laws and regulations, stricter e
nforcement of existing laws and regulations, the discovery of previously unknown contamination or the imposition of new requirements could increase our costs or subject us to new or increased liabilities.





Customers



No customer accounted for 10% or more of net sales for 2010 for any segment or for Roper as a whole.





Competition



Generally, our products and solutions face significant competition, usually from a limited number of competitors. We believe that we are a leader in most of our markets, and no single company competes with us over a significant number of product lines. Competitors might be large or small in size, often depending on the life cycle and maturity of the technology employed. We compete primarily on product quality, performance, innovation, technology, price, applications expertise, distribution channel access and customer service capabilities.





Patents and Trademarks



In addition to trade secrets, unpatented know-how, and other intellectual property rights, we own or license the rights under a number of patents, trademarks and copyrights relating to certain of our products and businesses. We also employ various methods, including confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements with employees, to protect our trade secrets and know-how. We believe that our operating units are not substantially dependent on any single patent, trademark, copyright, or other item of intellectual property or group of patents, trademarks or copyrights.





Employees



As of December 31, 2010, we had approximately 8,050 total employees, with approximately 5,870 located in the United States. Approximately 180 of our employees are subject to collective bargaining agreements. We have not experienced any work stoppages and consider our relations with our employees to be good.
