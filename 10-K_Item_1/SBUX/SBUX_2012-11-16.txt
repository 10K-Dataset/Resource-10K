General

Starbucks is the premier roaster, marketer and retailer of specialty coffee in the world, operating in60countries. Formed in 1985, Starbucks Corporation’s common stock trades on the NASDAQ Global Select Market (“NASDAQ”) under the symbol “SBUX.” We purchase and roast high-quality coffees that we sell, along with handcrafted coffee, tea and other beverages and a variety of fresh food items, through company-operated stores. We also sell a variety of coffee and tea products and license our trademarks through other channels such as licensed stores, grocery and national foodservice accounts. In addition to our flagship Starbucks brand, our portfolio also includes Tazo®Tea, Seattle’s Best Coffee®, Starbucks VIA®Ready Brew, Starbucks Refreshers™ beverages, Evolution Fresh™, La Boulange bakery brand and the Verismo™ System by Starbucks.

Our objective is to maintain Starbucks standing as one of the most recognized and respected brands in the world. To achieve this goal, we are continuing the disciplined expansion of our global store base. In addition, by leveraging the experience gained through our traditional store model, we continue to offer consumers new coffee products in a variety of forms, across new categories, and through diverse channels. Starbucks Global Responsibility strategy and commitments related to coffee and the communities we do business in, as well as our focus on being an employer of choice, are also key complements to our business strategies.

In this Annual Report on Form 10-K (“10-K” or “Report”) for the fiscal year endedSeptember 30, 2012(“fiscal2012”), Starbucks Corporation (together with its subsidiaries) is referred to as “Starbucks,” the “Company,” “we,” “us” or “our.”



Segment Financial Information

Segment information is prepared on the same basis that our management reviews financial information for operational decision-making purposes. Beginning with the first quarter of fiscal 2012, we redefined our reportable operating segments to align with the three-region leadership and organizational structure of our retail business that took effect at the beginning of fiscal 2012.

The three-region structure includes: 1) Americas, inclusive of the US, Canada, and Latin America; 2) Europe, Middle East, and Africa, collectively referred to as the “EMEA” region; and 3) China / Asia Pacific (“CAP”). Our chief executive officer, who is our chief operating decision maker, manages these businesses, evaluates financial results, and makes key operating decisions based on the new organizational structure. Accordingly, beginning with the first quarter of fiscal 2012, we revised our reportable operating segments from 1) US, 2) International, and 3) Global Consumer Products Group to the followingfourreportable segments: 1) Americas, 2) EMEA, 3) CAP, and 4) Global Consumer Products Group. In the second quarter of fiscal 2012, we renamed our Global Consumer Products Group segment “Channel Development.”  Segment revenues as a percentage of total net revenues for fiscal year2012were as follows: Americas (75%), EMEA (9%), CAP (5%), and Channel Development (10%).

Concurrent with the change in reportable operating segments, we revised our prior period financial information to reflect comparable financial information for the new segment structure. Historical financial information presented herein reflects this change.

The Americas, EMEA, and CAP segments include both company-operated and licensed stores. Our Americas segment is our most mature business and has achieved significant scale. Certain markets within EMEA and CAP operations are in the early stages of development and require a more extensive support organization, relative to the current levels of revenue and operating income, than the Americas operations. The Americas and EMEA segments also include foodservice accounts, primarily in Canada and the UK. Our Americas segment also includes the retail and wholesale activities of Bay Bread, LLC (doing business as La Boulange), which was acquired in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012.









Our Channel Development segment includes whole bean and ground coffees, premium Tazo® teas, Starbucks VIA® Ready Brew, Starbucks®coffee and Tazo®tea K-Cup®portion packs, a variety of ready-to-drink beverages, such as Starbucks Refreshers™ beverages, and other branded products sold worldwide through channels such as grocery stores, warehouse clubs, convenience stores, and US foodservice accounts.

Seattle’s Best Coffee is reported in “Other” along with Evolution Fresh, Digital Ventures and unallocated corporate expenses that pertain to corporate administrative functions that support our operating segments but are not specifically attributable to or managed by any segment and are not included in the reported financial results of the operating segments. The Other category comprised approximately1%of total net revenues.

Financial information for Starbucks reportable operating segments and Other is included in Note 17 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this 10-K.



Revenue Components

We generate our revenues through company-operated stores, licensed stores, consumer packaged goods ("CPG") and foodservice operations.

The mix of company-operated versus licensed stores in a given market will vary based on several factors, including the ability to access desirable local retail space, the complexity and expected ultimate size of the market for Starbucks, and the ability to leverage the support infrastructure in an existing geographic region.



Company-operated Stores

Revenue from company-operated stores accounted for79%of total net revenues during fiscal2012. Our retail objective is to be the leading retailer and brand of coffee in each of our target markets by selling the finest quality coffee and related products, and by providing each customer a uniqueStarbucks Experience. TheStarbucks Experienceis built upon superior customer service as well as clean and well-maintained company-operated stores that reflect the personalities of the communities in which they operate, thereby building a high degree of customer loyalty.

Our strategy for expanding our global retail business is to increase our market share in a disciplined manner, by selectively opening additional stores in new and existing markets, as well as increasing sales in existing stores, to support our long-term strategic objective to maintain Starbucks standing as one of the most recognized and respected brands in the world. Store growth in specific existing markets will vary due to many factors, including the maturity of the market.









The following is a summary of total company-operated store data for the periods indicated:

Starbucks company-operated stores are typically located in high-traffic, high-visibility locations. Our ability to vary the size and format of our stores allows us to locate them in or near a variety of settings, including downtown and suburban retail centers, office buildings, university campuses, and in select rural and off-highway locations. To provide a greater degree of access and convenience for non-pedestrian customers, we continue to selectively expand development of drive-thru stores.

Starbucks stores offer a choice of regular and decaffeinated coffee beverages, a broad selection of Italian-style espresso beverages, cold blended beverages, iced shaken refreshment beverages, a selection of premium Tazo®teas, distinctively packaged roasted whole bean and ground coffees, a variety of Starbucks VIA®Ready Brew soluble coffees, Starbucks®coffee and Tazo®tea K-Cup®portion packs, Starbucks Refreshers™ beverages, juices and bottled water.

focusing on high-quality ingredients, nutritional value and great flavor. Food items include pastries, prepared breakfast and lunch sandwiches, oatmeal and salads. A focused selection of beverage-making equipment and accessories are also sold in our stores. Each Starbucks store varies its product mix depending upon the size of the store and its location. To complement the in-store experience, our US company-operated Starbucks stores also provide customers free access to wireless internet.

Starbucks Card

The Starbucks stored value card program is designed to increase customer loyalty and the frequency of store visits by cardholders. Starbucks Cards are accepted at company-operated and most licensed stores in North America. The cards are also accepted at a number of international locations. Customers who register their cards in the US, Canada, and certain other countries are enrolled in the My Starbucks Rewards™ program and can receive various benefits depending on the number of Stars earned in a 12-month period.



Licensed Stores

Product sales to and royalty and license fee revenues from our licensed stores accounted for9%of total revenues in fiscal2012. In our licensed store operations, we leverage the expertise of our local partners and share our operating and store development experience. Licensees provide improved, and at times the only, access to desirable retail space. Most licensees are prominent retailers with in-depth market knowledge and access. As part of these arrangements, we receive royalties and license fees and sell coffee, tea and related products for resale in licensed locations. Employees working in licensed retail locations are required to follow our detailed store operating procedures and attend training classes similar to those given to employees in company-operated stores. For our Seattle’s Best Coffee brand, we use various forms of licensing, including traditional franchising.

Consumer Packaged Goods

Consumer packaged goods includes both domestic and international sales of packaged coffee and tea as well as a variety of ready-to-drink beverages and single-serve coffee and tea products to grocery, warehouse club and specialty retail stores. It also includes revenues from product sales to and licensing revenues from manufacturers that produce and market Starbucks and Seattle’s Best Coffee branded products through licensing agreements. Revenues from sales of consumer packaged goods comprised8%of total net revenues in fiscal2012.



Foodservice

Revenues from foodservice accounts comprised4%of total net revenues in fiscal2012. We sell Starbucks®and Seattle’s Best Coffee®whole bean and ground coffees, a selection of premium Tazo®teas, Starbucks VIA®Ready Brew, and other coffee and tea related products to institutional foodservice companies that service business and industry, education, healthcare, office coffee distributors, hotels, restaurants, airlines and other retailers. We also sell our Seattle’s Best Coffee®through arrangements with national accounts. The majority of the sales in this channel come through national broadline distribution networks with SYSCO Corporation, US Foodservice™, and other distributors.



Product Supply

Starbucks is committed to selling only the finest whole bean coffees and coffee beverages. To ensure compliance with our rigorous coffee standards, we control coffee purchasing, roasting and packaging, and the global distribution of coffee used in our operations. We purchase green coffee beans from multiple coffee-producing regions around the world and custom roast them to our exacting standards, for our many blends and single origin coffees.

The price of coffee is subject to significant volatility. Although most coffee trades in the commodity market, high-altitudearabicacoffee of the quality sought by Starbucks tends to trade on a negotiated basis at a premium









above the “C” coffee commodity price. Both the premium and the commodity price depend upon the supply and demand at the time of purchase. Supply and price can be affected by multiple factors in the producing countries, including weather, natural disasters, crop disease, general increase in farm inputs and costs of production, inventory levels and political and economic conditions. Price is also impacted by trading activities in thearabicacoffee futures market, including hedge funds and commodity index funds. In addition, green coffee prices have been affected in the past, and may be affected in the future, by the actions of certain organizations and associations that have historically attempted to influence prices of green coffee through agreements establishing export quotas or by restricting coffee supplies.

We buy coffee using fixed-price and price-to-be-fixed purchase commitments, depending on market conditions, to secure an adequate supply of quality green coffee. Price-to-be-fixed contracts are purchase commitments whereby the quality, quantity, delivery period, and other negotiated terms are agreed upon, but the date, and therefore the price, at which the base “C” coffee commodity price component will be fixed has not yet been established. For these types of contracts, either Starbucks or the seller has the option to select a date on which to “fix” the base “C” coffee commodity price prior to the delivery date. Until prices are fixed, we estimate the total cost of these purchase commitments. Total green coffee purchase commitments as ofSeptember 30, 2012were$854 million, comprised of$557 millionunder fixed-price contracts and an estimated$297 millionunder price-to-be-fixed contracts. As ofSeptember 30, 2012, approximately$125 millionof our price-to-be-fixed contracts were effectively fixed through the use of futures contracts. All price-to-be-fixed contracts as ofSeptember 30, 2012were at the Company’s option to fix the base “C” coffee commodity price component. Total purchase commitments, together with existing inventory, are expected to provide an adequate supply of green coffee through fiscal 2013.

We depend upon our relationships with coffee producers, outside trading companies and exporters for our supply of green coffee. We believe, based on relationships established with our suppliers, the risk of non-delivery on such purchase commitments is remote.

To help ensure sustainability and future supply of high-quality green coffees and to reinforce our leadership role in the coffee industry, Starbucks operates Farmer Support Centers in six countries. The Farmer Support Centers are staffed with agronomists and sustainability experts who work with coffee farming communities to promote best practices in coffee production designed to improve both coffee quality and yields.

In addition to coffee, we also purchase significant amounts of dairy products, particularly fluid milk, to support the needs of our company-operated stores. For our largest markets, the US, Canada and the UK, we purchase substantially all of our fluid milk requirements from eight dairy suppliers. We believe, based on relationships established with these suppliers, that the risk of non-delivery of sufficient fluid milk to support our stores is remote.

Products other than whole bean coffees and coffee beverages sold in Starbucks stores include Evolution Fresh™ juices and a number of ready-to-drink beverages that are purchased from several specialty suppliers, usually under long-term supply contracts. Food products, such as pastries, breakfast sandwiches and lunch items, are purchased from national, regional and local sources. We also purchase a broad range of paper and plastic products, such as cups and cutlery, from several companies to support the needs of our retail stores as well as our manufacturing and distribution operations. We believe, based on relationships established with these suppliers and manufacturers, that the risk of non-delivery of these items is remote.





Competition

Our primary competitors for coffee beverage sales are quick-service restaurants and specialty coffee shops. In almost all markets in which we do business, there are numerous competitors in the specialty coffee beverage business. We believe that our customers choose among specialty coffee retailers primarily on the basis of product quality, service and convenience, as well as price. We continue to experience direct competition from large competitors in the US quick-service restaurant sector and the US ready-to-drink coffee beverage market. We also continue to face competition from well-established companies in many international markets.









Our coffee and tea products sold through our Channel Development segment compete directly against specialty coffees and teas sold through supermarkets, club stores and specialty retailers and compete indirectly against all other coffees and teas on the market. Starbucks also faces competition from both restaurants and other specialty retailers for prime retail locations and qualified personnel to operate both new and existing stores.



Patents, Trademarks, Copyrights and Domain Names

Starbucks owns and has applied to register numerous trademarks and service marks in the US and in additional countries throughout the world. Some of our trademarks, including Starbucks, the Starbucks logo, Seattle’s Best Coffee, Frappuccino, Starbucks VIA and Tazo are of material importance. The duration of trademark registrations varies from country to country. However, trademarks are generally valid and may be renewed indefinitely as long as they are in use and/or their registrations are properly maintained.

We own numerous copyrights for items such as product packaging, promotional materials, in-store graphics and training materials. We also hold patents on certain products, systems and designs. In addition, Starbucks has registered and maintains numerous Internet domain names, including “Starbucks.com”, “Starbucks.net”, and “Seattlesbest.com.”



Seasonality and Quarterly Results

Our business is subject to seasonal fluctuations, including fluctuations resulting from the holiday season. Cash flows from operations are considerably higher in the first fiscal quarter than the remainder of the year. This is largely driven by cash received as Starbucks Cards are purchased and loaded during the holiday season. Since revenues from Starbucks Cards are recognized upon redemption and not when purchased, seasonal fluctuations on the consolidated statements of earnings are much less pronounced. Quarterly results can also be affected by the timing of the opening of new stores and the closing of existing stores. For these reasons, results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved for the full fiscal year.



Employees

Starbucks employed approximately160,000people worldwide as ofSeptember 30, 2012. In the US, Starbucks employed approximately120,000people, with113,000in company-operated stores and the remainder in support facilities, store development, and roasting and warehousing operations. Approximately40,000employees were employed outside of the US, with38,000in company-operated stores and the remainder in regional support facilities and roasting and warehousing operations. The number of Starbucks employees represented by unions is not significant. We believe our current relations with our employees are good.
