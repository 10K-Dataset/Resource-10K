We also sell a variety of coffee and tea products and license our trademarks through other channels such as licensed stores, grocery and national foodservice accounts. In addition to our flagship Starbucks brand, our portfolio also includes goods and services offered under these brands: Teavana, Tazo, Seattle’s Best Coffee, Starbucks VIA, Starbucks Refreshers, Evolution Fresh, La Boulange and Verismo.

Our objective is to maintain Starbucks standing as one of the most recognized and respected brands in the world. To achieve this, we are continuing the disciplined expansion of our global store base. In addition, by leveraging the experience gained through our traditional store model, we continue to offer consumers new coffee and other products in a variety of forms, across new categories, and through diverse channels. Starbucks Global Responsibility strategy and commitments related to coffee and the communities we do business in, as well as our focus on being an employer of choice, are also key complements to our business strategies.

Segment Financial Information

We havefourreportable operating segments: 1) Americas, inclusive of the US, Canada, and Latin America; 2) Europe, Middle East, and Africa ("EMEA"); 3) China / Asia Pacific (“CAP”) and 4) Channel Development. Segment revenues as a percentage of total net revenues for fiscal year2013were as follows: Americas (74%), EMEA (8%), CAP (6%), Channel Development (9%), and all other segments (3%).

Our Americas, EMEA, and CAP segments include both company-operated and licensed stores. Our Americas segment is our most mature business and has achieved significant scale. Certain markets within our EMEA and CAP operations are still in the early stages of development and require a more extensive support organization, relative to their current levels of revenue and operating income, than our Americas operations. The Americas and EMEA segments also include certain foodservice accounts, primarily in Canada and the UK. Our Americas segment also includes our La Boulange®retail stores.

Our Channel Development segment includes whole bean and ground coffees, premium Tazo®teas, Starbucks- and Tazo-branded single serve products, a variety of ready-to-drink beverages, such as Starbucks Refreshers™ beverages, and other branded products sold worldwide through channels such as grocery stores, warehouse clubs, specialty retailers, convenience stores, and US foodservice accounts.

Our other, non-reportable, operating segments include the operating results from Teavana, Seattle's Best Coffee, Evolution Fresh, and our Digital Ventures business. These other operating segments are referred to as All Other Segments.

Effective at the beginning of fiscal 2013, we decentralized certain leadership functions in the areas of retail marketing and category management, global store development and partner resources to support and align with the respective operating segment presidents. In conjunction with these moves, certain general and administrative and depreciation and amortization expenses associated with these functions, which were previously reported as unallocated corporate expenses within "Other," are now reported within the respective reportable operating segments to align with the regions they support.

Beginning in the second quarter of fiscal 2013, we changed the presentation of our unallocated corporate expenses, which were previously combined with our non-reportable operating segments in "Other".  Unallocated corporate operating expenses pertain primarily to corporate administrative functions that support the operating segments but are not specifically attributable to or managed by any segment. These expenses are now presented as a reconciling item between total segment operating results and consolidated operating results.

Concurrent with the reporting changes noted above, we revised our prior period financial information to reflect comparable financial information. Historical financial information presented herein reflects these changes. There was no impact on consolidated net revenues, total operating expenses, operating income, or net earnings as a result of these changes.

Starbucks segment information is included in Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this 10-K.











Revenue Components

We generate nearly all of our revenues through company-operated stores, licensed stores, consumer packaged goods ("CPG") and foodservice operations.

The mix of company-operated versus licensed stores in a given market will vary based on several factors, including our ability to access desirable local retail space, the complexity and expected ultimate size of the market for Starbucks, and our ability to leverage the support infrastructure in an existing geographic region.



Company-operated Stores

Revenue from company-operated stores accounted for79%of total net revenues during fiscal2013. Our retail objective is to be the leading retailer and brand of coffee in each of our target markets by selling the finest quality coffee and related products, and by providing each customer a uniqueStarbucks Experience. TheStarbucks Experienceis built upon superior customer service, as well as clean and well-maintained company-operated stores that reflect the personalities of the communities in which they operate, thereby building a high degree of customer loyalty.

Our strategy for expanding our global retail business is to increase our market share in a disciplined manner, by selectively opening additional stores in new and existing markets, as well as increasing sales in existing stores, to support our long-term strategic objective to maintain Starbucks standing as one of the most recognized and respected brands in the world. Store growth in specific existing markets will vary due to many factors, including the maturity of the market.

Starbucks®company-operated stores are typically located in high-traffic, high-visibility locations. Our ability to vary the size and format of our stores allows us to locate them in or near a variety of settings, including downtown and suburban retail centers, office buildings, university campuses, and in select rural and off-highway locations. To provide a greater degree of access and convenience for non-pedestrian customers, we continue to expand development of Drive Thru stores.

Starbucks®stores offer a choice of coffee and tea beverages, distinctively packaged roasted whole bean and ground coffees, a variety of premium single serve products, juices and bottled water. Starbucks®stores also offer an assortment of fresh food offerings, including selections focusing on high-quality ingredients, nutritional value and great flavor. A focused selection of beverage-making equipment and accessories are also sold in our stores. Each Starbucks®store varies its product mix depending upon the size of the store and its location. To complement the in-store experience, our company-operated Starbucks®stores in the US, Canada, and certain other international markets also provide customers free access to wireless internet.

Starbucks Card

The Starbucks stored value card program is designed to provide convenience, support gifting, and increase the frequency of store visits by cardholders. Starbucks Cards are sold in company-operated and most licensed stores in North America, as well as on-line and in other retail locations. The cards are also sold in a number of other international locations. Customers may access their card balances by utilizing their Starbucks Card or mobile app in retail stores. Customers who register their card in the US, Canada, and certain other countries are automatically enrolled in the My Starbucks Rewards™ program and can receive various benefits depending on the number of reward points (“Stars”) earned in a 12-month period.

Licensed Stores

Product sales to and royalty and license fee revenues from our licensed stores accounted for9%of total net revenues in fiscal2013. In our licensed store operations, we leverage the expertise of our local partners and share our operating and store development experience. Licensees provide improved, and at times the only, access to desirable retail space. Most licensees are prominent retailers with in-depth market knowledge and access. As part of these arrangements, we receive royalties and license fees and sell coffee, tea and related products for resale in licensed locations. Employees working in licensed retail locations are required to follow our detailed store operating procedures and attend training classes similar to those given to employees in company-operated stores. For Teavana and Seattle's Best Coffee, as well as Starbucks in the UK, we also use traditional franchising.

Consumer Packaged Goods

Consumer packaged goods includes both domestic and international sales of packaged coffee and tea as well as a variety of ready-to-drink beverages and single-serve coffee and tea products to grocery, warehouse club and specialty retail stores. It also includes revenues from product sales to and licensing revenues from manufacturers that produce and market Starbucks and Seattle’s Best Coffee branded products through licensing agreements. Revenues from sales of consumer packaged goods comprised7%of total net revenues in fiscal2013.











Foodservice

Revenues from foodservice accounts comprised4%of total net revenues in fiscal2013. We sell Starbucks®and Seattle’s Best Coffee®whole bean and ground coffees, a selection of premium Tazo®teas, Starbucks VIA®Ready Brew, and other coffee and tea related products to institutional foodservice companies that service business and industry, education, healthcare, office coffee distributors, hotels, restaurants, airlines and other retailers. We also sell our Seattle’s Best Coffee®through arrangements with national accounts. The majority of the sales in this channel come through national broadline distribution networks with SYSCO Corporation, US Foodservice™, and other distributors.



Product Supply

Starbucks is committed to selling only the finest whole bean coffees and coffee beverages. To ensure compliance with our rigorous coffee standards, we control coffee purchasing, roasting and packaging, and the global distribution of coffee used in our operations. We purchase green coffee beans from multiple coffee-producing regions around the world and custom roast them to our exacting standards for our many blends and single origin coffees.

The price of coffee is subject to significant volatility. Although most coffee trades in the commodity market, high-altitudearabicacoffee of the quality sought by Starbucks tends to trade on a negotiated basis at a premium above the “C” coffee commodity price. Both the premium and the commodity price depend upon the supply and demand at the time of purchase. Supply and price can be affected by multiple factors in the producing countries, including weather, natural disasters, crop disease, general increase in farm inputs and costs of production, inventory levels and political and economic conditions. Price is also impacted by trading activities in thearabicacoffee futures market, including hedge funds and commodity index funds. In addition, green coffee prices have been affected in the past, and may be affected in the future, by the actions of certain organizations and associations that have historically attempted to influence prices of green coffee through agreements establishing export quotas or by restricting coffee supplies.

We buy coffee using fixed-price and price-to-be-fixed purchase commitments, depending on market conditions, to secure an adequate supply of quality green coffee. Price-to-be-fixed contracts are purchase commitments whereby the quality, quantity, delivery period, and other negotiated terms are agreed upon, but the date, and therefore the price, at which the base “C” coffee commodity price component will be fixed has not yet been established. For these types of contracts, either Starbucks or the seller has the option to select a date on which to “fix” the base “C” coffee commodity price prior to the delivery date. Until prices are fixed, we estimate the total cost of these purchase commitments. Total green coffee purchase commitments as ofSeptember 29, 2013were$882 million, comprised of$588 millionunder fixed-price contracts and an estimated$294 millionunder price-to-be-fixed contracts. As ofSeptember 29, 2013, approximately$0.3 millionof our price-to-be-fixed contracts were effectively fixed through the use of futures contracts. All price-to-be-fixed contracts as ofSeptember 29, 2013were at the Company’s option to fix the base “C” coffee commodity price component. Total purchase commitments, together with existing inventory, are expected to provide an adequate supply of green coffee through fiscal 2014.

We depend upon our relationships with coffee producers, outside trading companies and exporters for our supply of green coffee. We believe, based on relationships established with our suppliers, the risk of non-delivery on such purchase commitments is remote.

To help ensure the future supply of high-quality green coffees, and to reinforce our leadership role in the coffee industry, Starbucks operates farmer support centers insixcountries. The farmer support centers are staffed with agronomists and sustainability experts who work with coffee farming communities to promote best practices in coffee production designed to improve both coffee quality and yields.

In addition to coffee, we also purchase significant amounts of dairy products, particularly fluid milk, to support the needs of our company-operated stores. We believe, based on relationships established with our dairy suppliers, that the risk of non-delivery of sufficient fluid milk to support our stores is remote.

Products other than whole bean coffees and coffee beverages sold in Starbucks®stores include tea and a number of ready-to-drink beverages that are purchased from several specialty suppliers, usually under long-term supply contracts. Food products, such as La Boulange™pastries, breakfast sandwiches and lunch items, are purchased from national, regional and local sources. We also purchase a broad range of paper and plastic products, such as cups and cutlery, from several companies to support the needs of our retail stores as well as our manufacturing and distribution operations. We believe, based on relationships established with these suppliers and manufacturers, that the risk of non-delivery of these items is remote.











Competition

Our primary competitors for coffee beverage sales are quick-service restaurants and specialty coffee shops. In almost all markets in which we do business, there are numerous competitors in the specialty coffee beverage business. We believe that our customers choose among specialty coffee retailers primarily on the basis of product quality, service and convenience, as well as price. We continue to experience direct competition from large competitors in the US quick-service restaurant sector and the US ready-to-drink coffee beverage market, in addition to well-established companies in many international markets. We also compete with restaurants and other specialty retailers for prime retail locations and qualified personnel to operate both new and existing stores.

Our coffee and tea products sold through our Channel Development segment compete directly against specialty coffees and teas sold through grocery stores, warehouse clubs, specialty retailers, convenience stores, and US foodservice accounts and compete indirectly against all other coffees and teas on the market.



Patents, Trademarks, Copyrights and Domain Names

Starbucks owns and has applied to register numerous trademarks and service marks in the US and in additional countries throughout the world. Some of our trademarks, including Starbucks, the Starbucks logo, Tazo, Seattle’s Best Coffee, Teavana, Frappuccino, Starbucks VIA, Evolution Fresh and La Boulange are of material importance. The duration of trademark registrations varies from country to country. However, trademarks are generally valid and may be renewed indefinitely as long as they are in use and/or their registrations are properly maintained.

We own numerous copyrights for items such as product packaging, promotional materials, in-store graphics and training materials. We also hold patents on certain products, systems and designs. In addition, Starbucks has registered and maintains numerous Internet domain names, including “Starbucks.com,” “Starbucks.net,” "Tazo.com," “Seattlesbest.com" and “Teavana.com.”



Seasonality and Quarterly Results

Our business is subject to seasonal fluctuations, including fluctuations resulting from the holiday season in December. Our cash flows from operations are considerably higher in the first fiscal quarter than the remainder of the year. This is largely driven by cash received as Starbucks Cards are purchased and loaded during the holiday season. Since revenues from Starbucks Cards are recognized upon redemption and not when purchased, seasonal fluctuations on the consolidated statements of earnings are much less pronounced. Quarterly results are also affected by the timing of the opening of new stores and the closing of existing stores. For these reasons, results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved for the full fiscal year.



Employees

Starbucks employed approximately182,000people worldwide as ofSeptember 29, 2013. In the US, Starbucks employed approximately137,000people, with129,000in company-operated stores and the remainder in support facilities, store development, and roasting and warehousing operations. Approximately45,000employees were employed outside of the US, with43,000in company-operated stores and the remainder in regional support operations. The number of Starbucks employees represented by unions is not significant. We believe our current relations with our employees are good.
