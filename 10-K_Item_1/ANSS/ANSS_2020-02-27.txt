PRODUCT QUALITY

Our employees generally perform product development tasks according to predefined quality plans, procedures and work instructions. Certain technical support tasks are also subject to a quality process. These plans define, for each project, the methods to be used, the responsibilities of project participants and the quality objectives to be met. The majority of software products are developed under a quality system that is certified to the ISO 9001:2015 standard. We establish quality plans for our products and services, and subject product designs to multiple levels of testing and verification in accordance with processes established under our quality system.









SALES AND MARKETING

We distribute and support our products through our own direct sales offices, as well as a global network of independent channel partners. This channel partner network provides us with a cost-effective, highly-specialized channel of distribution and technical support. It also enables us to draw on business and technical expertise from a global network, provides relative stability to our operations to help mitigate geography-specific economic trends and provides us with an opportunity to take advantage of new geographic markets or enhance our sales coverage in existing markets.

The channel partners sell our products to new customers, expand installations within the existing customer base, offer training and consulting services, and provide the first line of our technical support. Our channel partner certification process helps to ensure that each channel partner has the ongoing capability to adequately represent our expanding product lines and to provide an acceptable level of training, consultation and customer support. We derived22.9%,22.4%and 24.8% of our total revenue through the indirect sales channel for the years endedDecember 31, 2019,2018and2017, respectively.

We also have a direct sales organization to develop an enterprise-wide, focused sales approach and to implement a worldwide go-to-market account strategy. The sales management organization also functions as a focal point for requests from the channel partners and provides additional support in strategic locations through the presence of direct sales offices.

During2019, we continued to invest in our existing domestic and international strategic sales offices. In total, our direct sales organization comprised2,100and 1,700 employees as ofDecember 31, 2019and2018, respectively, who were responsible for the sales, technical support, consulting services, marketing initiatives and administrative activities designed to support our overall revenue growth and expansion strategies.

Our products are utilized by organizations ranging in size from small consulting firms to the world's largest industrial companies. No single customer accounted for more than 5% of our revenue in2019,2018or2017.

Information with respect to foreign and domestic revenue may be found in Note 17 to the consolidated financial statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and in the section entitled “Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Part II, Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

STRATEGIC ALLIANCES AND MARKETING RELATIONSHIPS

We have established and continued to pursue strategic alliances with advanced technology suppliers, cloud computing providers, hardware vendors, specialized application developers, and CAD, ECAD and PLM providers. We believe that these relationships facilitate accelerated incorporation of advanced technology into our products, provide access to new customers, expand our sales channels, develop specialized product applications and provide direct integration with leading CAD, electronic design automation (EDA), product data management and PLM systems.

We have technical and marketing relationships with leading CAD vendors, such as Autodesk, PTC and Siemens Digital Industries, to provide direct links between products. These links facilitate the transfer of electronic data models between the CAD systems and our products.

We partnered with PTC to accelerate product innovation by providing customers a world-class simulation-driven design solution. Working together, we are delivering Ansys Discovery Live real-time simulation within PTC’s Creo®3D CAD software. The combined solution, Creo Simulation Live, is sold by PTC as part of the Creo product suite. This solution offers customers a unified modeling and simulation environment, removing the boundaries between CAD and simulation and enabling design engineers to gain insight into each of the many design decisions they make throughout the product development process. This insight enables design engineers to create higher quality products, while reducing product and development costs.

Similarly, we maintain marketing and software development relationships with leading EDA software companies, including Cadence Design Systems, Synopsys, Mentor Graphics, Zuken and National Instruments. These relationships support the transfer of data between electronics design and layout software and our electronics simulation portfolio. In 2017, we entered into an integration and distribution agreement with Synopsys to cooperatively integrate Ansys RedHawk technology into an in-design add-on to a Synopsys design tool for the primary purpose of providing customers with direct, in-design access to the RedHawk technology's capabilities.

We also have relationships with Siemens and Spatial Corporation to provide the 3D modeling kernel and format translation technologies upon which our in-house geometry modeling software solutions are built.

The main method we employ to democratize HPC to a wider audience is through partnerships with a number of companies, such as cloud computing providers, HPC hardware manufacturers and supercomputing centers such as HLRS in Stuttgart,









Germany. In 2019, we launched a new cloud service fully managed by us and developed in collaboration with Microsoft Azure that provides on-demand access to HPC directly from within our flagship applications. We also collaborated with Flexera to improve our elastic licensing solution by now supporting on-premise use and internet-based usage monitoring. We added Hewlett Packard Enterprises and Dell Technologies as new members to the HPC appliance program that is designed to simplify and accelerate HPC cluster deployment.

Our open cloud strategy allows us to work with various public cloud providers and cloud-hosting partners. This approach makes it easy for customers to use the same workflows on-premise and in the Cloud. Cloud-hosting partners such as Nimbix, Rescale and Gompute provide cloud access to us and/or third-party applications for customers having very complex workflows or other restrictive security certification requirements. Furthermore, we continued to enjoy mutually-committed alliances with large cloud platform providers such as Microsoft, AWS, Google and Alibaba. In 2018, we entered into an agreement with SAP SE (SAP) to embed our pervasive simulation solutions for digital twins into SAP's market-leading digital supply chain, manufacturing and asset management portfolio. The partnership's first solution launched in 2019 and runs on the SAP Cloud Platform and empowers industrial asset operators to optimize operations and maintenance through real-time engineering insights, which reduces product cycle times and increases profitability.

Our Partner Program actively encourages developers of specialized software solutions to use our technology as a development platform for their applications and provides customers with enhanced functionality related to their use of our software. With more than 200 active solution partnerships, spanning a wide range of technologies, including materials, optimization, electronics, optical, mechanical, fluid and systems simulation, our partner ecosystem extends the depth and breadth of our technology offerings.

We have a software license agreement with HBM that provides the advanced fatigue capabilities of nCode DesignLife™, a leading durability software from HBM. nCode DesignLife™ technology leverages the open architecture of our platform and enables mechanical engineers to more easily address complex product life and durability issues before a prototype is built. A similar agreement was executed with VirtualMotion to offer Ansys Motion™ as a tightly-integrated, next-generation capability for simulating complex multi-body mechanisms and assemblies.

COMPETITION

We believe that the principal factors affecting sales of our software include ease of use, breadth and depth of functionality, flexibility, quality, ease of integration with other software systems, file compatibility across computer platforms, range of supported computer platforms, performance, price and total cost of ownership, customer service and support, company reputation and financial viability, and effectiveness of sales and marketing efforts.

We continue to experience competition across all markets for our products and services. Our competitors include large, global, publicly traded companies; small, geographically-focused firms; startup firms; and solutions produced in-house by the end users. Some of our current and possible future competitors have greater financial, technical, marketing and other resources than us, and some have well-established relationships with current and potential customers of ours. Our current and possible future competitors also include firms that have elected, or may in the future elect, to compete by means of open source licensing. These competitive pressures may result in decreased sales volumes, price reductions and/or increased operating costs, and could result in lower revenues, margins and net income.

PROPRIETARY RIGHTS AND LICENSES









We license our software products utilizing a combination of web-based and hard-copy license terms and forms. For certain software products, we primarily rely on "click-wrapped" licenses (i.e. online agreements where the website provider posts terms and conditions, and the user clicks on the "accept" button). The enforceability of these types of agreements under the laws of some jurisdictions is uncertain.

We also seek to protect the source code of our software as a trade secret and as registered unpublished copyrighted work. We have obtained federal trademark registration protection for Ansys and other marks in the U.S. and foreign countries. Additionally, we were awarded numerous patents by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office and have a number of patent applications pending. To the extent we do not choose to seek patent protection for our intellectual property, we primarily rely on the protection of our source code as a trade secret. We seek additional protection of our proprietary rights in our source code via copyright registrations.

Our employees have signed agreements under which they have agreed not to disclose trade secrets or confidential information. These agreements, where legally permitted, restrict engagement in or connection with any business that is competitive with us anywhere in the world while employed by us (and, in some cases, for specified periods thereafter) and state that any products or technology created by employees during their term of employment are our property. In addition, we require all channel partners to enter into agreements not to disclose our trade secrets and other proprietary information.

Despite these precautions, there can be no assurance that misappropriation of our technology and proprietary information (including source code) will be prevented. Further, there can be no assurance that copyright, trademark, patent and trade secret protection will be available for our products in certain jurisdictions, or that restrictions on the ability of employees and channel partners to engage in activities competitive with us will be enforceable. Costly and time-consuming litigation could be necessary in the future to enforce our rights to our trade secrets and proprietary information or to enforce our patent rights and copyrights, and it is possible that, in the future, our competitors may be able to obtain our trade secrets or to independently develop similar, unpatented technology.

The software development industry is characterized by rapid technological change. Therefore, we believe that factors such as the technological and creative skills of our personnel, new product developments, frequent product enhancements, name recognition and reliable product maintenance are also important to establishing and maintaining technology leadership in addition to the various legal protections of our technology that may be available.

We do not believe that any of our products infringe upon the proprietary rights of third parties. There can be no assurance, however, that third parties will not claim such infringement by us or our licensors or licensees with respect to current or future products. In addition, there are non-practicing entities (NPEs) and patent assertion entities (PAEs) whose business models are built on not producing any products but rather extracting payments from revenue generating companies through patent infringement assertions and/or litigation. We expect that software suppliers will increasingly be subject to the risk of such claims as the number of products and suppliers continues to expand and the functionality of products continues to increase. Any such claims, with or without merit, could be time consuming, result in costly litigation, cause product release delays or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements. Such royalty or licensing agreements, if required, may not be available on terms acceptable to us.

SEASONAL VARIATIONS

Our business has experienced seasonality, including quarterly reductions in software sales resulting from slowdowns of customer activities during the summer months, particularly in Europe, as well as from the seasonal purchasing and budgeting patterns of our global customers. Lease and maintenance contract renewals are typically highest in the first and fourth quarters. Our revenue is typically highest in the fourth quarter.









DEFERRED REVENUE AND BACKLOG

Deferred revenue consists of billings made or payments received in advance of revenue recognition from customer agreements. Thedeferred revenue on our consolidated balance sheets does not represent the total value of annual or multi-year, noncancellable agreements. Our backlog represents installment billings for periods beyond the current quarterly billing cycle. Our deferred revenue and backlog as ofDecember 31, 2019and2018consisted of the following:

Balance at December 31, 2019(in thousands)TotalCurrentLong-TermDeferred revenue$365,274$351,353$13,921Backlog505,469218,398287,071Total$870,743$569,751$300,992
