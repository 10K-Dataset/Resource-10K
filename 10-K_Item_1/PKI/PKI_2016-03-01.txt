Recent Developments

As part of our strategy to grow our core businesses, we have recently taken the following actions:



Strategic Business Realignment:

We realigned our organization at the beginning of fiscal year 2015 to enable us to both deliver complete solutions targeted towards certain end markets and develop value-added applications and solutions to foster further expansion of those markets. OneSource, our multivendor laboratory service business that serves the life sciences end market, was moved from our Environmental Health segment into our Human Health segment. The results reported forfiscal year 2015reflect this new alignment of our operating segments. Financial information in this report relating tofiscal years 2014 and 2013has been retrospectively adjusted to reflect this change to our operating segments.



Acquisitions in Fiscal Year 2015:

We completed the acquisition of five businesses infiscal year 2015for a total consideration of$77.1 million, in cash.  The acquired businesses included Vanadis Diagnostics AB (“Vanadis”), which was acquired for total consideration of$35.1 millionin cash, as further described in Note 21 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on Form 10-K, and other acquisitions for an aggregate consideration of$42.0 millionin cash. We have a potential obligation to pay the shareholders of Vanadis additional contingent consideration of up to$93.0 million, which at closing had an estimated fair value of$56.9 million. We reported the operations for all of these acquisitions within the results of our Human Health and Environmental Health segments from the acquisition dates.



Restructuring:

Duringfiscal year 2015, we recorded pre-tax restructuring charges of$4.4 millionin our Human Health segment and$13.2 millionin our Environmental Health segment related to a workforce reduction from restructuring activities. Our









management approved these plans principally to realign resources to emphasize growth initiatives and to focus resources on higher growth end markets. We also recorded pre-tax restructuring reversals of$2.3 millionin our Human Health segment and$3.9 millionin our Environmental Health segment related to lower than expected costs associated with workforce reductions. Infiscal year 2015, we also recorded a pre-tax restructuring charge of$2.0 millionin our Human Health segment relating to the closure of excess facility space and a pre-tax restructuring charge of$0.1 millionin our Environmental Health segment primarily as a result of terminating various contractual commitments. This pre-tax restructuring activity has been reported as restructuring and contract termination charges and is included as a component of operating expenses from continuing operations. We expectnosignificant impact on future operating results or cash flows from the restructuring activities executed infiscal year 2015.



As part of our ongoing business strategy, we also took the following actions:



Share Repurchase Program:

On October 23, 2014, our Board of Directors (our "Board") authorized us to repurchase up to8.0 millionshares of common stock under a stock repurchase program (the "Repurchase Program"). The Repurchase Program will expire on October 23, 2016 unless terminated earlier by our Board, and may be suspended or discontinued at any time. Duringfiscal year 2015, we repurchased1.5 millionshares of common stock in the open market at an aggregate cost of$72.0 million, including commissions, under the Repurchase Program. As ofJanuary 3, 2016,5.9 millionshares remained available for repurchase under the Repurchase Program. From January 4, 2016 throughFebruary 25, 2016, we repurchased2.4 millionshares of common stock in the open market at an aggregate cost of$109.7 million, including commissions, under the Repurchase Program.



Business Segments and Products

We report our business in two segments: Human Health and Environmental Health. We performed our annual impairment testing onJanuary 1, 2015, the annual impairment date for our reporting units, and based on the first step of the impairment process (the comparison of the fair value to the carrying value of the reporting unit to determine if the carrying value exceeds the fair value), we concluded that there was no goodwill impairment.



We realigned our organization at the beginning of fiscal year 2015 to enable us to both deliver complete solutions targeted towards certain end markets and develop value-added applications and solutions to foster further expansion of those markets. OneSource, our multivendor laboratory service business that serves the life sciences end market, was moved from our Environmental Health segment into our Human Health segment. The results reported forfiscal year 2015reflect this new alignment of our operating segments. Financial information in this report relating tofiscal years 2014 and 2013has been retrospectively adjusted to reflect this change to our operating segments.

Marketing

All of our businesses market their products and services primarily through their own specialized sales forces. As ofJanuary 3, 2016, we employed approximately3,700sales and service representatives operating in approximately35countries and marketing products and services in more than150countries. In geographic regions where we do not have a sales and service presence, we utilize distributors to sell our products.











Raw Materials, Key Components and Supplies

Each of our businesses uses a wide variety of raw materials, key components and supplies that are generally available from alternate sources of supply and in adequate quantities from domestic and foreign sources. We generally have multi-year contracts, with no minimum purchase requirements, with our suppliers. For certain critical raw materials, key components and supplies required for the production of some of our principal products, we have qualified only a limited or a single source of supply. We periodically purchase quantities of some of these critical raw materials in excess of current requirements, in anticipation of future manufacturing needs. With sufficient lead times, we believe we would be able to qualify alternative suppliers for each of these raw materials and key components. See the applicable risk factor in “Item 1A. Risk Factors” for an additional description of this risk.



Intellectual Property

We own numerous United States and foreign patents and have patent applications pending in the United States and abroad. We also license intellectual property rights to and from third parties, some of which bear royalties and are terminable in specified circumstances. In addition to our patent portfolio, we possess a wide array of unpatented proprietary technology and know-how. We also own numerous United States and foreign trademarks and trade names for a variety of our product names, and have applications for the registration of trademarks and trade names pending in the United States and abroad. We believe that patents and other proprietary rights are important to the development of both of our reporting segments, but we also rely upon trade secrets, know-how, continuing technological innovations and licensing opportunities to develop and maintain the competitive position of both of our reporting segments. We do not believe that the loss of any one patent or other proprietary right would have a material adverse effect on our overall business or on any of our reporting segments.



In some cases, we may participate in litigation or other proceedings to defend against or assert claims of infringement, to enforce our patents or our licensors’ patents, to protect our trade secrets, know-how or other intellectual property rights, or to determine the scope and validity of our or third parties’ intellectual property rights. Litigation of this type could result in substantial cost to us and diversion of our resources. An adverse outcome in any litigation or proceeding could subject us to significant liabilities or expenses, require us to cease using disputed intellectual property or cease the sale of a product, or require us to license the disputed intellectual property from third parties.



Backlog

We believe that backlog is not a meaningful indicator of future business prospects for either of our business segments due to the short lead time required for a majority of our sales. Therefore, we believe that backlog information is not material to an understanding of our business.



Competition

Due to the range and diversity of our products and services, we face many different types of competition and competitors. Our competitors range from foreign and domestic organizations, which produce a comprehensive array of goods and services and that may have greater financial and other resources than we do, to more narrowly focused firms producing a limited number of goods or services for specialized market segments.



We compete on the basis of service level, price, technological innovation, operational efficiency, product differentiation, product availability, quality and reliability. Competitors range from multinational organizations with a wide range of products to specialized firms that in some cases have well-established market positions. We expect the proportion of large competitors to increase through the continued consolidation of competitors.



Research and Development

Research and development expenditures were$125.9 millionduringfiscal year 2015,$121.1 millionduringfiscal year 2014, and$132.4 millionduringfiscal year 2013.



We have a broad product base, and we do not expect any single research and development project to have significant costs. We directed our research and development efforts infiscal years 2015, 2014 and 2013primarily toward the diagnostics and research markets within our Human Health segment, and the environmental, industrial and laboratory service markets within our Environmental Health segment, in order to help accelerate our growth initiatives. We expect to continue our strong investments in research and development to drive growth duringfiscal year 2016, and to continue to emphasize the diagnostics and research markets within our Human Health segment, and the environmental, industrial and laboratory services markets within our Environmental Health segment.











Environmental Matters

Our operations are subject to various foreign, federal, state and local environmental and safety laws and regulations. These requirements include those governing uses, emissions and discharges of hazardous substances, the remediation of contaminated soil and groundwater, the regulation of radioactive materials, and the health and safety of our employees.



We may have liability under the Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act and comparable state statutes that impose liability for investigation and remediation of contamination without regard to fault, in connection with materials that we or our former businesses sent to various third-party sites. We have incurred, and expect to incur, costs pursuant to these statutes.



We are conducting a number of environmental investigations and remedial actions at our current and former locations and, along with other companies, have been named a potentially responsible party (“PRP”) for certain waste disposal sites. We accrue for environmental issues in the accounting period that our responsibility is established and when the cost can be reasonably estimated. We have accrued

$11.8 million

and

$12.3 million

as of

January 3, 2016

and

December 28, 2014

, respectively, which represents our management’s estimate of the cost of the remediation of known environmental matters, and does not include any potential liability for related personal injury or property damage claims. During fiscal year 2014, we recorded a benefit of

$2.3 million

for cost reimbursements related to a particular site, of which

$1.2 million

was for future monitoring and mitigation activities. During fiscal year 2013, we accrued an additional

$5.7 million

related to a particular site for increased monitoring and mitigation activities, of which

$4.6 million

was recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2013. Our environmental accrual is not discounted and does not reflect the recovery of any material amounts through insurance or indemnification arrangements. The cost estimates are subject to a number of variables, including the stage of the environmental investigations, the magnitude of the possible contamination, the nature of the potential remedies, possible joint and several liability, the time period over which remediation may occur, and the possible effects of changing laws and regulations. For sites where we have been named a PRP, our management does not currently anticipate any additional liability to result from the inability of other significant named parties to contribute. We expect that the majority of such accrued amounts could be paid out over a period of up to ten years. As assessment and remediation activities progress at each individual site, these liabilities are reviewed and adjusted to reflect additional information as it becomes available. There have been no environmental problems to date that have had, or are expected to have, a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements. While it is possible that a loss exceeding the amounts recorded in the consolidated financial statements may be incurred, the potential exposure is not expected to be materially different from those amounts recorded.



We may become subject to new or unforeseen environmental costs or liabilities. Compliance with new or more stringent laws or regulations, stricter interpretations of existing laws, or the discovery of new contamination could cause us to incur additional costs.



Employees

As ofJanuary 3, 2016, we employed approximately8,000employees in our continuing operations. Several of our subsidiaries are parties to contracts with labor unions and workers’ councils. As ofJanuary 3, 2016, we estimate that we employed an aggregate of approximately1,600union and workers’ council employees. We consider our relations with employees to be satisfactory.



Financial Information About Business Segments
