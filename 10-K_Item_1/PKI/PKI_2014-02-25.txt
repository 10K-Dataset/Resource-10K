Our Strategy

Our strategy is to provide innovative products, services and solutions that drive scientific enhancements and productivity improvements in targeted high growth market segments and to develop value-added applications and solutions to foster further development and expansion of the markets we serve. To execute on our strategy and drive higher revenue growth, we focus on broadening our product and service offerings through the acquisition of innovative technology and expenditures for research and development. Our strategy includes:

•Achieving significant growth in both of our core business segments, Human Health and Environmental Health, through strategic acquisitions and licensing;

•Accelerating innovation through both internal research and development and third-party collaborations and alliances;

•Strengthening our position within key markets, by expanding our product and service offerings and maintaining superior product quality;

•Utilizing our share repurchase programs to help drive shareholder value; and

•Attracting, retaining and developing talented and engaged employees.



Recent Developments

As part of our strategy to grow our core businesses, we have recently taken the following actions:



Strategic Business Re-Alignment:

We realigned our organization at the beginning of fiscal year 2013, to allow us to implement our strategy and propel our vision to improve global health by innovating technologies that help make healthcare more effective, affordable and accessible around the world. Our Informatics business, as well as our field service on products previously sold by our former Bio-discovery business, were moved from our Environmental Health segment into our Human Health segment. The results reported for fiscal year 2013 reflect this new alignment of our operating segments. Financial information relating to fiscal years 2012 and 2011 has been retrospectively adjusted to reflect the changes to the operating segments.



Acquisitions in fiscal year 2013:

We completed the acquisition of four businesses for total consideration of$11.4 million, in cash. As of the closing dates, we potentially had to pay additional contingent consideration for the four acquired businesses of up to$2.2 million, which at closing had an estimated fair value of$1.1 million. The excess of the purchase price over the fair value of each of the acquired businesses' net assets represents cost and revenue synergies specific to us, as well as non-capitalizable intangible assets, such as the employee workforce acquired, and has been allocated to goodwill, none of which is tax deductible. We reported the operations for these acquisitions within the results of our operations from the acquisition dates.



Restructuring:

Duringfiscal year 2013, we recorded a$23.7 millionpre-tax restructuring charge in our Human Health segment related to a workforce reduction from reorganization activities and the closure of excess facility space, and recognized a$12.0 million









pre-tax restructuring charge in our Environmental Health segment related to a workforce reduction from reorganization activities and the closure of excess facility space. Our management approved these plans principally to shift certain of our research and development resources into a newly opened Center for Innovation, to shift certain of our operations into a newly established shared service center, to realign operations, research and development resources and production resources as a result of previous acquisitions and to focus resources on higher growth end markets. We also recorded a pre-tax restructuring reversal of

$1.5 million

primarily related to lower than expected costs primarily related to workforce reductions within our Human Health segment, as well as a reversal of

$1.0 million

primarily related to lower than expected costs associated with workforce reductions within our Environmental Health segment. During

fiscal year 2013

, we recorded a pre-tax charge of

$0.7 million

primarily as a result of terminating various contractual commitments in connection with certain disposal activities in our Environmental Health segment. The pre-tax restructuring activity associated with these plans has been reported as restructuring and contract termination charges and is included as a component of operating expenses from continuing operations. We expect the impact of future cost savings on operating results and cash flows from restructuring activities executed in fiscal year


will exceed

$9.0 million

annually beginning in fiscal year 2015, primarily as decreases to cost of revenue, selling, general and administrative expenses, and research and development expenses.



As part of our ongoing business strategy, we also took the following actions:



Redemption of 6% Senior Unsecured Notes Due in 2015:

In December 2013, we redeemed all of our 6% senior unsecured notes due in 2015 (the “2015 Notes”) for a redemption price that included the outstanding principal amount of$150.0 millionand a prepayment premium of$11.1 million, which is included in other expense, net. The transaction also resulted in the write-off of$2.8 millionfor the remaining unamortized derivative losses for previously settled cash flow hedges and the write-off of$0.2 millionfor the remaining deferred debt issuance costs. Both of these amounts are included in interest expense.



Share Repurchase Program:

On October 24, 2012, our Board of Directors (our "Board") authorized us to repurchase up to6.0 millionshares of common stock under a stock repurchase program (the "Repurchase Program"). The Repurchase Program will expire on October 24, 2014 unless terminated earlier by our Board, and may be suspended or discontinued at any time. Duringfiscal year 2013, we repurchased approximately3.6 millionshares of common stock in the open market at an aggregate cost of$123.0 million, including commissions, under the Repurchase Program. As ofDecember 29, 2013, approximately2.4 millionshares authorized by our Board under the Repurchase Program remained available for repurchase.



Business Segments and Products

We report our business in two segments: Human Health and Environmental Health. We performed our annual impairment testing onJanuary 1, 2013, the annual impairment date for our reporting units, and based on the first step of the impairment process (the comparison of the fair value to the carrying value of the reporting unit to determine if the carrying value exceeds the fair value), we concluded that there was no goodwill impairment.



We realigned our organization at the beginning of fiscal year 2013, to allow us to implement our strategy and propel our vision to improve global health by innovating technologies that help make healthcare more effective, affordable and accessible around the world. Our Informatics business, as well as our field service on products previously sold by our former Bio-discovery business, were moved from our Environmental Health segment into our Human Health segment. The results reported for fiscal year 2013 reflect this new alignment of our operating segments. Financial information relating to fiscal years 2012 and 2011 has been retrospectively adjusted to reflect the changes to the operating segments.

Marketing

All of our businesses market their products and services primarily through their own specialized sales forces. As ofDecember 29, 2013, we employed approximately3,600sales and service representatives operating in approximately35countries and marketing products and services in more than150countries. In geographic regions where we do not have a sales and service presence, we utilize distributors to sell our products.



Raw Materials, Key Components and Supplies

Each of our businesses uses a wide variety of raw materials, key components and supplies that are generally available from alternate sources of supply and in adequate quantities from domestic and foreign sources. We generally have multi-year contracts, with no minimum purchase requirements, with certain of our suppliers. For certain critical raw materials, key components and supplies required for the production of some of our principal products, we have qualified only a limited or a single source of supply. We periodically purchase quantities of some of these critical raw materials in excess of current requirements, in anticipation of future manufacturing needs. With sufficient lead times, we believe we would be able to qualify alternative suppliers for each of these raw materials and key components. See the applicable risk factor in “Item 1A. Risk Factors” for an additional description of this risk.



Intellectual Property

We own numerous United States and foreign patents and have patent applications pending in the United States and abroad. We also license intellectual property rights to and from third parties, some of which bear royalties and are terminable in specified circumstances. In addition to our patent portfolio, we possess a wide array of unpatented proprietary technology and know-how. We also own numerous United States and foreign trademarks and trade names for a variety of our product names, and have applications for the registration of trademarks and trade names pending in the United States and abroad. We believe that patents and other proprietary rights are important to the development of both of our reporting segments, but we also rely upon trade secrets, know-how, continuing technological innovations and licensing opportunities to develop and maintain the competitive position of both of our reporting segments. We do not believe that the loss of any one patent or other proprietary right would have a material adverse effect on our overall business or on any of our reporting segments.



In some cases, we may participate in litigation or other proceedings to defend against or assert claims of infringement, to enforce our patents or our licensors’ patents, to protect our trade secrets, know-how or other intellectual property rights, or to determine the scope and validity of our or third parties’ intellectual property rights. Litigation of this type could result in substantial cost to us and diversion of our resources. An adverse outcome in any litigation or proceeding could subject us to









significant liabilities or expenses, require us to cease using disputed intellectual property or cease the sale of a product, or require us to license the disputed intellectual property from third parties. We are currently involved in a lawsuit involving claims of violation of intellectual property rights. See “Item 3. Legal Proceedings” for a discussion of this matter.



Backlog

We believe that backlog is not a meaningful indicator of future business prospects for either of our business segments due to the short lead time required on a majority of our sales. Therefore, we believe that backlog information is not material to an understanding of our business.



Competition

Due to the wide range of our products and services, we face many different types of competition and competitors. This affects our ability to sell our products and services and the prices at which these products and services are sold. Our competitors range from large foreign and domestic organizations, which produce a comprehensive array of goods and services and that may have greater financial and other resources than we do, to small firms producing a limited number of goods or services for specialized market segments.



We compete on the basis of service level, price, technological innovation, operational efficiency, product differentiation, product availability, quality and reliability. Competitors range from multinational organizations with a wide range of products to specialized firms that in some cases have well-established market niches. We expect the proportion of large competitors to increase through the continued consolidation of competitors.



We believe we compete effectively in each of the areas in which our businesses experience competition.



Research and Development

Research and development expenditures were$133.0 millionduringfiscal year 2013,$132.6 millionduringfiscal year 2012, and$115.8 millionduringfiscal year 2011.



We have a broad product base, and we do not expect any single research and development project to have significant costs. We directed our research and development efforts infiscal years 2013, 2012, and 2011primarily toward the diagnostics and research markets within our Human Health segment, and the environmental, and laboratory service and support markets within our Environmental Health segment, in order to help accelerate our growth initiatives. We expect to continue our strong investments in research and development to drive growth duringfiscal year 2014, and to continue to emphasize the diagnostics and research markets within our Human Health segment, and the environmental, industrial and laboratory services markets within our Environmental Health segment.



Environmental Matters

Our operations are subject to various foreign, federal, state and local environmental and safety laws and regulations. These requirements include those governing uses, emissions and discharges of hazardous substances, the remediation of contaminated soil and groundwater, the regulation of radioactive materials, and the health and safety of our employees.



We may have liability under the Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act and comparable state statutes that impose liability for investigation and remediation of contamination without regard to fault, in connection with materials that we or our former businesses sent to various third-party sites. We have incurred, and expect to incur, costs pursuant to these statutes.



We are conducting a number of environmental investigations and remedial actions at our current and former locations and, along with other companies, have been named a potentially responsible party (“PRP”) for certain waste disposal sites. We accrue for environmental issues in the accounting period that our responsibility is established and when the cost can be reasonably estimated. During fiscal year 2013, we accrued an additional

$5.7 million

related to a particular site for increased monitoring and mitigation activities, of which

$4.6 million

was recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2013. We have accrued

$13.5 million

as of

December 29, 2013

, which represents our management’s estimate of the cost of the remediation of known environmental matters, and does not include any potential liability for related personal injury or property damage claims. This amount is not discounted and does not reflect the recovery of any material amounts through insurance or indemnification arrangements. These cost estimates are subject to a number of variables, including the stage of the environmental investigations, the magnitude of the possible contamination, the nature of the potential remedies, possible joint and several liability, the time period over which remediation may occur, and the possible effects of changing laws and regulations. For sites where we have been named a PRP, our management does not currently anticipate any additional liability to result from the inability of other significant named parties to contribute. We expect that the majority of such accrued amounts could be paid out over a period of up to ten years. As assessment and remediation activities progress at each individual site,









these liabilities are reviewed and adjusted to reflect additional information as it becomes available. There have been no environmental problems to date that have had, or are expected to have, a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements. While it is possible that a loss exceeding the amounts recorded in the consolidated financial statements may be incurred, the potential exposure is not expected to be materially different from those amounts recorded.



We may become subject to new or unforeseen environmental costs or liabilities. Compliance with new or more stringent laws or regulations, stricter interpretations of existing laws, or the discovery of new contamination could cause us to incur additional costs.



Employees

As ofDecember 29, 2013, we employed approximately7,600employees in our continuing operations. Several of our subsidiaries are parties to contracts with labor unions and workers’ councils. As ofDecember 29, 2013, we estimate that we employed an aggregate of approximately1,400union and workers’ council employees. We consider our relations with employees to be satisfactory.

Our Informatics business, as well as our field service on products previously sold by our former Bio-discovery business, were moved from our Environmental Health segment into our Human Health segment. The results reported for fiscal year 2013 reflect this new alignment of our operating segments. Financial information relating to fiscal years 2012 and 2011 has been retrospectively adjusted to reflect the changes to the operating segments.



We have included the expenses for our corporate headquarters, such as legal, tax, audit, human resources, information technology, and other management and compliance costs, as well as the activity related to the mark-to-market adjustment on postretirement benefit plans, as “Corporate” below. We have a process to allocate and recharge expenses to the reportable segments when these costs are administered or paid by the corporate headquarters based on the extent to which the segment benefited from the expenses. These amounts have been calculated in a consistent manner and are included in our calculations of segment results to internally plan and assess the performance of each segment for all purposes, including determining the compensation of the business leaders for each of our reporting segments.
