ITEM 1.  OUR
  BUSINESS



We are a
Delaware corporation incorporated in 1985 and we have two principal
subsidiaries: Alaska Airlines, Inc. (Alaska) and Horizon Air Industries, Inc.
(Horizon). Through these subsidiaries, we provide passenger air service to more
than 22 million passengers per year to more than 90 destinations. We also
provide freight and mail services, primarily to and within the state of Alaska
and on the West Coast. Although Alaska and Horizon both operate as airlines,
their business plans, competition, and economic risks differ substantially.
Alaska is a major airline that operates an all-jet fleet with an average
passenger trip length in 2009 of 1,180 miles. Horizon is a regional airline,
operates turboprop and jet aircraft, and its average passenger trip length for
2009 was 356 miles. Individual financial information about Alaska and Horizon is
in Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements and throughout this report,
specifically in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations.”



Both of
our airlines continue to distinguish themselves from competitors by providing
award-winning customer service and differentiating amenities. Our outstanding
employees and excellent service in the form of advance seat assignments,
expedited check-in with Airport of the Future®, web check-in, flight alerts, an
award-winning frequent flyer program, well-maintained aircraft, a first-class
section aboard Alaska aircraft, and other amenities are regularly recognized by
independent studies, awards, and surveys of air travelers. For example, Alaska
has ranked “Highest in Customer Satisfaction among Traditional Network Carriers”
in both 2009 and 2008 by J.D. Power and Associates and won the “Program of the
Year” Freddie award for 2008 and 2007 for our Mileage Plan program. Horizon won
the 2007 “Regional Airline of the Year” from Air Transport World.  We
are very proud of these awards and we continue to strive to have the best
customer service in the industry.

ALASKA



Alaska
Airlines is an Alaska corporation that was organized in 1932 and incorporated in
1937. We offer extensive north/south service within the western U.S., Canada and
Mexico, and passenger and dedicated cargo services to and within the state of
Alaska. We also provide long-haul east/west service to Hawaii and twelve cities
in the mid-continental and eastern U.S., primarily from Seattle, where we have
our largest concentration of departures; although we do offer long-haul
departures from other cities as well.



In 2009,
we carried 15.6 million revenue passengers in our mainline operations, and
we carry more passengers between Alaska and the U.S. mainland than any other
airline. Based on the number of passengers carried in 2009, Alaska’s leading
airports are Seattle, Los Angeles, Anchorage and Portland. Based on 2009
revenues, the leading nonstop routes are Seattle-Anchorage, Seattle-Los Angeles,
and Seattle-San Diego. At December 31, 2009, Alaska’s operating fleet
consisted of 115 jet aircraft, compared to 110 aircraft as of December 31,
2008.

HORIZON



Horizon
Air Industries is a Washington corporation that first began service, was
incorporated in 1981 and was acquired by Air Group in 1986. It is the largest
regional airline in the Pacific Northwest, and serves a number of cities in
seven states, five cities in Canada, and two cities in Mexico.



In 2009,
Horizon carried 6.8 million revenue passengers. Approximately 90% of
Horizon’s revenue passenger miles in 2009 were flown domestically, primarily in
the states of Washington, Oregon, Idaho and California, compared to 91% in 2008.
The Canada markets accounted for 8% of revenue passenger miles in both 2009 and
2008. Flying to Mexico accounted for about 2% of total traffic in 2009 compared
to less than 1% in 2008.



Based on
2009 passenger enplanements, Horizon’s leading airports are Seattle, Portland,
Boise, and Spokane. Based on revenues in 2009, the leading nonstop routes are
Portland-Seattle, Spokane-Seattle, and Boise-Seattle. At December 31, 2009,
Horizon’s operating fleet consisted of 18 jets and 40 turboprop aircraft.
Horizon flights are listed under the Alaska Airlines designator code in airline
reservation systems.



Alaska
and Horizon integrate their flight schedules to provide convenient, competitive
connections between most points served by their systems. In 2009 and 2008,
approximately 22% and 23%, respectively, of Horizon’s passengers connected to
flights operated by Alaska.



INDUSTRY CONDITIONS



GENERAL



The
airline industry is highly competitive and has historically been characterized
by low profit margins and high fixed costs, primarily for wages, aircraft fuel,
aircraft ownership, and facilities rents. Because expenses of a flight do not
vary significantly with the number of passengers carried, a relatively small
change in the number of passengers or in pricing has a disproportionate effect
on an airline’s operating and financial results. In other words, a minor
shortfall in expected revenue levels could cause a disproportionately negative
impact on our results of operations. Passenger demand and ticket prices are, to
a large measure, influenced by the general state of the economy, current global
economic and political events and total available airline seat
capacity.






2009 was
a year plagued by economic woes and the worst recession the United States has
experienced since the Great Depression.  The result was a steep
decline in the demand for air travel, causing a double-digit percentage decline
in unit revenue and passenger count across the industry.  In response
to this decline and the high price of oil in 2008, airlines reduced domestic
capacity by approximately 7% in 2009 compared to 2008. The significant decline
in the average price of jet fuel from its 2008 high helped mitigate an otherwise
difficult year for the industry.  In order to maximize revenue to help
offset the demand decline, airlines continued down the path of adding or
increasing ancillary fees for checked baggage, buy-on-board items, ticket fees,
etc.  These fees helped to recover some of the lost revenue from the
decline in traffic, but certainly not all of it.



During
2009, our key initiative was to optimize revenue.  We reduced and
redeployed capacity to better match demand, and the new markets we have entered
are performing well.  Our revenue initiatives, combined with lower
fuel costs, our continued focus on customer service and our strong operational
performance resulted in financial results that significantly improved from 2008
and were among the best in the industry.

OUR
      REVENUE INITIATIVES, COMBINED WITH LOWER FUEL COSTS, OUR CONTINUED FOCUS
      ON CUSTOMER SERVICE AND OUR STRONG OPERATIONAL PERFORMANCE RESULTED IN
      2009 FINANCIAL RESULTS THAT WERE AMONG THE BEST IN THE
      INDUSTRY.

FUEL



Our
business and financial results are highly affected by the price and,
potentially, the availability of jet fuel. Fuel prices have been extremely
volatile over the past few years. The price of crude oil averaged over $106 per
barrel in 2008, with a high of nearly $150 per barrel in July 2008. The average
price in 2009 was a more moderate $62 per barrel, although that price is still
historically high.  For us, a $1 per barrel increase in the price of
oil equates to approximately $9 million of additional fuel cost
annually.  A one-cent change in our fuel price per gallon will impact
our expected annual fuel cost by approximately $3.5 million per
year.

We refer
to the price we pay for fuel at the airport, including applicable taxes, as our
“raw” fuel price. Raw fuel prices are impacted by world oil prices and refining
costs, which can vary by region in the U.S. Generally, West Coast jet fuel
prices are somewhat higher and more volatile than prices in the Gulf Coast or on
the East Coast, putting our airlines at a slight competitive disadvantage.
Historically, fuel costs have generally represented 10% to 15% of an airline’s
operating costs, but due to volatility in prices over the past few years, fuel
costs have been in the range of 20% to 40% of total operating costs. Both the
crude oil and refining cost components of jet fuel are volatile and outside of
our control, and they can have a significant and immediate impact on our
operating results.



As
depicted in the charts below, our average raw fuel cost per gallon declined 43%
in 2009, and increased 42% and 8% in 2008 and 2007, respectively.





We use
crude oil call options and jet fuel refining margin swap contracts as hedges to
decrease our exposure to the volatility of jet fuel prices. Call options
effectively cap our pricing on the crude oil component of fuel prices, limiting
our exposure to increasing fuel prices for about half of our planned fuel
consumption. With these call option contracts, we still benefit from the decline
in crude oil prices, as there is no future cash exposure above the premiums we
pay to enter into the contracts.

OUR
      AIRCRAFT ARE AMONG THE MOST FUEL-EFFICIENT IN THEIR RESPECTIVE
      CLASSES.

We
believe that operating fuel-efficient aircraft also helps to mitigate the effect
of high fuel prices. Alaska operates an all-Boeing 737 fleet. At Horizon, the
long-term goal is to transition to an all-Q400 turboprop fleet. Because of these
changes, Alaska’s fuel burn expressed in available seat miles flown per gallon
(ASMs/g) improved from 65.9 ASMs/g in 2006 to 75.9 ASMs/g in 2009. Similarly,
Horizon’s fuel burn has improved from 51.7 ASMs/g in 2006 to 54.8 ASMs/g in
2009.



These
reductions have not only reduced our fuel cost, but also the amount of
greenhouse gases and other pollutants that our operations emit.



MARKETING AND COMPETITION



ALLIANCES WITH OTHER AIRLINES



We have
marketing alliances with several airlines that provide reciprocal frequent flyer
mileage credit and redemption privileges as well as code sharing on certain
flights as shown in the table below. Alliances are an important part of our
strategy and enhance our revenues by:



•offering
      our customers more travel destinations and better mileage
      credit/redemption opportunities;



•offering
      our Mileage Plan program a competitive advantage because of our
      partnership with carriers from two major global alliances (Oneworld and
      Skyteam);



•giving
      us access to more connecting traffic from other airlines;
    and



•providing
      members of our alliance partners’ frequent flyer programs an opportunity
      to travel on Alaska and Horizon while earning mileage credit in our
      partners’ programs.



Most of
our codeshare relationships are free-sell codeshares, where the marketing
carrier sells seats on the operating carrier’s flights from the operating
carrier’s inventory, but takes no inventory risk. Our marketing agreements have
various termination dates, and at any time, one or more may be in the process of
renegotiation.

COMPETITION



Competition
in the airline industry is intense. We believe the principal competitive factors
in the industry that are important to customers are:



•safety
      record and reputation,



•flight
      schedules,



•fares,



•customer
      service,



•routes
      served,



•frequent
      flyer programs,



•on-time
      arrivals,



•baggage
      handling,



•on-board
      amenities,



•type
      of aircraft, and



•code-sharing
      relationships.



Together,
Alaska and Horizon carry approximately 3.5% of all U.S. domestic passenger
traffic. We compete with one or more domestic or foreign airlines on most of our
routes, including Southwest Airlines, United Airlines, Delta Air Lines,
Continental Airlines, American Airlines, US Airways, JetBlue Airways, Virgin
America, Allegiant and regional affiliates associated with some of these
carriers.



Due to
its short-haul markets, Horizon also competes with ground transportation in many
markets, including train, bus and automobile transportation.  Both
carriers, to some extent, also compete with technology such as video
conferencing and internet-based meeting tools that have resulted in a change in
business travel.



TICKET DISTRIBUTION



Airline
tickets are distributed through three primary channels:



•Alaskaair.com. It is
      less expensive for us to sell through this direct channel and, as a
      result, we continue to take steps to drive more business to our website.
      In addition, we believe this channel is preferable from a branding and
      customer-relationship standpoint in that we can establish ongoing
      communication with the customer and tailor offers
    accordingly.



•Traditional and online travel
      agencies.Consumer reliance on traditional travel agencies
      continues to shrink, giving way to online travel agencies. Both
      traditional and online travel agencies typically use Global Distribution
      Systems (GDS), such as Sabre, to obtain their fare and inventory data from
      airlines. Bookings made through these agencies result in a fee that is
      charged to the airline. Many of our large corporate customers require that
      we use these agencies. Some of our competitors do not use this
      distribution channel and, as a result, have lower ticket distribution
      costs.



•Reservation call
      centers. These call centers are located in Phoenix, Ariz.; Kent,
      Wash.; and Boise, Idaho. We generally charge a $15 fee for booking
      reservations through these call
centers.

EMPLOYEES



Labor
costs have historically made up 30% to 40% of an airline’s total operating
costs. Most major airlines, including ours, have employee groups that are
covered bycollective
bargaining agreements. Airlines with unionized work forces have higher labor
costs than carriers without unionized work forces, and they may not have the
ability to adjust labor costs downward quickly enough to respond to new
competition. New entrants into the U.S. airline industry generally do not have
unionized work forces, which can be a competitive advantage for those
airlines.



- 7
- -
We had
12,440 (9,046 at Alaska and 3,394 at Horizon) active full-time and part-time
employees at December 31, 2009, compared to 14,143 (10,250 at Alaska and
3,893 at Horizon) as of December 31, 2008. Wages, salaries and benefits
(including variable incentive pay) represented approximately 43% and 40% of our
total non-fuel operating expenses in 2009 and 2008, respectively.



At
December 31, 2009, labor unions represented 82% of Alaska’s and 46% of
Horizon’s employees. Our relations with our labor organizations are governed by
the Railway Labor Act (RLA). Under this act, collective bargaining agreements do
not expire but instead become amendable as of a stated date. If either party
wishes to modify the terms of any such agreement, it must notify the other party
in the manner prescribed by the RLA and/or described in the agreement. After
receipt of such notice, the parties must meet for direct negotiations, and if no
agreement is reached, either party may request the National Mediation Board
(NMB) to initiate a process including mediation, arbitration, and a potential
“cooling off” period that must be followed before either party may engage in
self-help.

REGULATION



GENERAL



The
airline industry is highly regulated.



The
Department of Transportation (DOT) and the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)
exercise significant regulatory authority over air carriers.



•DOT:In order to provide passenger
      and cargo air transportation in the U.S., a domestic airline is required
      to hold a certificate of public convenience and necessity issued by the
      DOT. Subject to certain individual airport capacity, noise and other
      restrictions, this certificate permits an air carrier to operate between
      any two points in the U.S. Certificates do not expire, but may be revoked
      for failure to comply with federal aviation statutes, regulations, orders
      or the terms of the certificates. In addition,the DOT has jurisdiction over the
      approval of international codeshare agreements, alliance agreements
      between domestic major airlines, international route authorities and
      certain consumer protection matters, such as advertising, denied boarding
      compensation and baggage liability. International treaties may also
      contain restrictions or requirements for flying outside of the
      U.S.



•FAA:The FAA, through
      Federal Aviation Regulations (FARs), generally regulates all aspects of
      airline operations, including establishing personnel, maintenance and
      flight operation standards. Domestic airlines are required to hold a valid
      air carrier operating certificate issued by the FAA. Pursuant to these
      regulations we have established, and the FAA has approved, our operations
      specifications and a maintenance program for each type of aircraft we
      operate. The maintenance program provides for the ongoing maintenance of
      such aircraft, ranging from frequent routine inspections to major
      overhauls. From time to time the FAA issues airworthiness directives (ADs)
      that must be incorporated into our aircraft maintenance program and
      operations. All airlines are subject to enforcement actions that are
      brought by the FAA from time to time for alleged violations of FARs or
      ADs. At this time, we are not aware of any enforcement proceedings that
      could either materially affect our financial position or impact our
      authority to operate.



The
Aviation and Transportation Security Act (the Security Act) generally provides
for enhanced aviation security measures. Pursuant to the Security Act, the
Transportation Security Administration (TSA) is responsible for aviation
security.  The Security Act imposes a $2.50 per enplanement security
service fee (maximum $5.00 one-way fee), which is collected by the air carriers
and submitted to the government to pay for these enhanced security measures. In
addition, carriers are required to pay an amount to the TSA to cover the cost of
providing security measures equal to the amount the air carriers paid for
screening passengers and property in 2000. We paid $12.6 million each year to
the TSA for this security charge in 2009, 2008 and 2007.



The
Department of Justice has jurisdiction over airline antitrust matters. The U.S.
Postal Service has jurisdiction over certain aspects of the transportation of
mail and related services. Labor relations in the air transportation industry
are regulated under the Railway Labor Act. To the extent we continue to fly to
foreign countries and pursue alliances with international carriers, we may be
subject to certain regulations of foreign agencies.



AIRLINE FARES



Airlines
are permitted to establish their own domestic fares without governmental
regulation, and the industry is characterized by vigorous price competition. The
DOT maintains authority over international (generally outside of North America)
fares, rates and charges. International fares and rates are also subject to the
jurisdiction of the governments of the foreign countries we serve. Although air
carriers are required to file and adhere to international fare and rate tariffs,
substantial commissions, overrides and discounts given to travel agents, brokers
and wholesalers characterize many international markets.



ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS



We are
subject to various laws and government regulations concerning environmental
matters and employee safety and health in the U.S. and other countries. U.S.
federal laws that have a particular effect on us include the Airport Noise and
Capacity Act of 1990, the Clean Air Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery
Act, the Clean Water Act, the Safe Drinking Water Act, and the Comprehensive
Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, or Superfund Act. We are
also subject to the oversight of the Occupational Safety and Health
Administration (OSHA) concerning employee safety and health matters. The U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency, OSHA, and other federal agencies have been
authorized to create and enforce regulations that have an impact on our
operations. In addition to these federal activities, various states have been
delegated certain authorities under these federal statutes. Many state and local
governments have adopted environmental and employee safety and health laws and
regulations. We maintain our safety, health and environmental programs in order
to meet or exceed these requirements.



It is
expected that the current federal administration will likely move forward with
legislation to reduce carbon andother
greenhouse gas emissions. We do not believe legislation is necessary to motivate
airlines to reduce fuel burn and, in turn, reduce emissions. For example, Alaska
and Horizon have transitioned or are transitioning to more fuel-efficient
aircraft fleets, thereby greatly reducing our total
emissions.



- 10
- -
The
Airport Noise and Capacity Act recognizes the rights of airport operators with
noise problems to implement local noise abatement programs so long as they do
not interfere unreasonably with interstate or foreign commerce or the national
air transportation system. Authorities in several cities have established
aircraft noise reduction programs, including the imposition of nighttime
curfews. We believe we have sufficient scheduling flexibility to accommodate
local noise restrictions.



Although
we do not currently anticipate that these regulatory matters, individually or
collectively, will have a material effect on our financial condition, results of
operations or cash flows, new regulations or compliance issues that we do not
currently anticipate could have the potential to harm our financial condition,
results of operations or cash flows in future periods.



CUSTOMER SERVICE



Along
with other domestic airlines, we have implemented a customer service commitment
plan to address a number of service goals, including, but not limited to, goals
relating to lowest fare availability, delays, cancellations and diversions,
baggage delivery and liability, guaranteed fares and ticket refunds. All of our
employees are required to periodically attend our Customer Experience Workshop
to enhance our customer service focus and ultimately improve the experience our
customers have when traveling with us.



In
December 2009, the DOT adopted new rules effective in April 2010 that set fines
of as much as $27,500 per passenger when airlines leave passengers on the
aircraft for more than three hours while on the ground.  These new
rules are in response to recent incidents involving other airlines that resulted
in lengthy tarmac delays.  Bills have been introduced in several
states, including the state of Washington, which propose to regulate airlines
when operating in those specific states. However, we believe these bills would
be preempted by federal law. We do not believe these bills are
necessary.



MILEAGE PLAN PROGRAM



All major
airlines have developed frequent flyer programs as a way of increasing passenger
loyalty. Alaska’s Mileage Plan allows members to earn mileage by flying on
Alaska, Horizon and other participating airlines and by using the services of
non-airline partners, which include a credit card partner, a grocery store
chain, a telephone company, hotels, car rental agencies, and other businesses.
Alaska is paid by non-airline partners for the miles it credits to member
accounts. With advance notice, Alaska has the ability to change the Mileage Plan
terms, conditions, partners, mileage credits, and award levels or to terminate
the program.



Mileage
can be redeemed for free or discounted travel and for various other awards. Upon
accumulating the necessary mileage, members notify Alaska of their award
selection. Mileage Plan accounts are generally deleted after two years of
inactivity in a member’s account. Over 80% of the free flight awards on Alaska
and Horizon in 2009 were subject to capacity-controlled seating.



As of
December 31, 2009 and 2008, approximately 3.0 million and
3.4 million, respectively, round-trip flight awards were eligible for
redemption by Mileage Plan members. Of those eligible awards, we estimate that
approximately 88% will ultimately be redeemed. For the years 2009, 2008 and
2007, approximately 1,190,000, 685,000 and 600,000 round-trip awards and
260,000, 410,000 and 250,000 one-way flight awards were redeemed and flown on
Alaska and Horizon. These awards represent approximately 15.0%, 9.3%, and 7.0%
for 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively, of the total passenger miles flown on
Alaska and Horizon. For the years 2009, 2008, and 2007, approximately 181,000,
214,000, and 243,000, respectively, round-trip flight awards were redeemed and
flown on airline partners. In November 2008, we began charging a $25 fee for
awards redeemed on our airline partners.



We also
have awards that allow for redemption of one-half the mileage redemption rate
plus 50% of the fare for eligible award travel.  Our members redeemed
approximately 730,000, 620,000, and 560,000 one-way equivalent awards under this
program in 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively.



We sell
mileage credits to our non-airline partners. We defer a majority of the sales
proceeds and recognize revenue when award transportation is
provided.



OTHER INFORMATION



SEASONALITY AND OTHER FACTORS



Our
results of operations for any interim period are not necessarily indicative of
those for the entire year because our business is subject to seasonal
fluctuations. Our profitability is generally lowest during the first and fourth
quarters due principally to lower traffic. It typically increases in the second
quarter and then reaches its highest level during the third quarter as a result
of vacation travel, including increased activity in the state of
Alaska.



In
addition to passenger loads, factors that could cause our quarterly operating
results to vary include:



•general
      economic conditions and resulting changes in passenger
    demand,



- 11
- -




•      pricing
initiatives by us and our competitors,



•changes
      in fuel costs,



•the
      timing and amount of maintenance expenditures (both planned and
      unplanned),



•increases
      or decreases in passenger and volume-driven variable costs,
      and



•labor
      actions.



In
addition to those factors listed above, seasonal variations in traffic, the
timing of various expenditures and adverse weather conditions may affect our
operating results from quarter to quarter. Many of the markets we serve
experience inclement weather conditions in the winter, causing increased costs
associated with deicing aircraft, canceled flights and reaccommodation of
displaced passengers. Due to our geographic area of operations, we can be more
susceptible to adverse weather conditions (particularly in the state of Alaska
and the Pacific Northwest) than some of our competitors, who may be better able
to spread weather-related risks over larger route systems.



No
material part of our business or that of our subsidiaries is dependent upon a
single customer, or upon a few high-volume customers.



INSURANCE



We carry
Airline Hull, Spares and Comprehensive Legal Liability Insurance in amounts and
of the type generally consistent with industry practice to cover damage to
aircraft, spare parts and spare engines, as well as bodily injury and property
damage to passengers and third parties. Since the September 11, 2001
attacks, this insurance program excludes coverage for War and Allied Perils,
including hijacking, terrorism, malicious acts, strikes, riots, civil commotion
and other identified perils. So, like other airlines, the company has purchased
war risk coverage for such events through the U.S. government.



We
believe that our emphasis on safety and our state-of-the-art flight deck safety
technology help to control the cost of aviation insurance.
