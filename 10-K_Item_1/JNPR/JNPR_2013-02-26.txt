ITEM 1.Business



Overview



At Juniper Networks, we design, develop, and sell products and services that together provide our customers with a high-performance network infrastructure built on simplicity, security, openness, and scale. We serve the high-performance networking requirements of global service providers, enterprises, governments, and research and public sector organizations that view the network as critical to their success. Our core competencies in hardware systems, silicon design, network architecture, and our open cross-network software platform are helping customers achieve superior performance, greater choice and flexibility, while reducing overall total cost of ownership.



We do business in three geographic regions: Americas, Europe, Middle East, and Africa ("EMEA"), and Asia Pacific ("APAC"). Beginning in the first quarter of 2012, we aligned our organizational structure to focus on our platform and software strategy, which resulted in two reportable segments organized principally by product families: Platform Systems Division ("PSD") and Software Solutions Division ("SSD"). Our PSD segment primarily offers scalable routing and switching products that are used in service provider, enterprise, and public sector networks to control and direct network traffic between data centers, core, edge, aggregation, campus, Wide Area Networks ("WANs"), branch, and consumer and business devices. Our SSD segment offers software solutions focused on network security and network services applications for both service providers and enterprise customers. Together, our high-performance product and service offerings help our customers to convert legacy networks that provide commoditized services into more valuable assets that provide differentiation, value, and increased performance, reliability, and security to end-users. See Note 13,Segments, in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K ("Report"), for financial information regarding each of our PSD and SSD segments, which is incorporated herein by reference.



During 2012, we also initiated a variety of actions to ensure we are positioned for the future. We worked to further align our resources to improve productivity and effectiveness, enabling us to deliver our roadmap for innovation and unprecedented value to customers. Our actions were carefully planned and managed to maximize efficiencies in our cost structure, while preserving the investments in innovation in our core businesses of routing, switching, and security.



During our fiscal year endedDecember 31, 2012, we conducted business in more than 100 countries around the world generating net revenues of$4,365.4 millionand net income attributable to Juniper Networks of$186.5 million. See Item 8 of Part II of this Report for more information on our Consolidated Balance Sheets as ofDecember 31, 2012and2011and our Consolidated Statements of Operations, Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income, Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, and Consolidated Statements of Changes in Stockholders' Equity for each of the three years endedDecember 31, 2012,2011, and2010.



We were incorporated in California in 1996 and reincorporated in Delaware in 1998. Our corporate headquarters are located in Sunnyvale, California. Our website address is www.juniper.net.



Our Strategy



Our objective and strategy is to be the leading provider of high-performance network infrastructure by transforming the experience and economics of networking. Our strategy is centered on innovation and customer value. Key elements of our strategy are described below.



Maintain and Extend Technology Leadership



We are recognized around the world as an innovation leader in networking. Our Junos OS, application-specific integrated circuit (“ASIC”) technology, and network-optimized product architecture have been key elements to establishing and maintaining our technology leadership. We believe that these elements can be leveraged for future products that we are currently developing. We intend to maintain and extend our technological leadership in the service provider and enterprise markets primarily through innovation and continued investment in research and development (“R&D”), supplemented by external partnerships, including strategic alliances and strategic acquisitions that would allow us to deliver a broad range of products and services to customers in target markets.











Leverage Position as Supplier of High-Performance Network Infrastructure



We are a pure play in high-performance networking. From inception, we have focused on designing, developing, and building high-performance network infrastructure for demanding service provider and enterprise networking environments and have integrated purpose-built technology into a network-optimized architecture that specifically meets customer needs. We believe that many customers will deploy networking equipment from only a few vendors, and that the performance, reliability, and security of our products will provide us with a competitive advantage, which is critical to be selected as one of those vendors.



Be Strategic to Our Customers



In developing our PSD and SSD solutions, we work very closely with customers to design and build best-in-class products and solutions specifically designed to meet their complex needs. Over time, we have expanded our understanding of the escalating demands and risks facing our customers, which has enabled us to design additional capabilities into our products. We believe our close relationships with, and constant feedback from, our customers have been key elements in our design wins and rapid deployments to date. We plan to continue to work hand-in-hand with our customers to implement product enhancements, as well as to design products that meet the evolving needs of the marketplace, while enabling customers to reduce costs. We are committed to investing in R&D at a level that drives our innovation agenda, enabling us to deliver highly differentiated products and outstanding value to our customers.



Enable New Internet Protocol ("IP")-Based Services



Our platforms enable network operators to quickly build and secure networks cost-effectively and deploy new differentiated services to drive new sources of revenue more efficiently than legacy network products. We believe that the secure delivery of IP-based services and applications, including web hosting, outsourced Internet and intranet services, outsourced enterprise applications, and voice-over IP, will continue to grow and benefit from cost efficiencies enabled by our high-performance network infrastructure offerings. By enabling these new IP-based services, we have significantly broadened our service provider business over the last several years, while also significantly expanding our presence in the enterprise market.



Establish and Develop Industry Partnerships



Our customers have diverse requirements. While our products meet certain requirements of our customers, our products are not intended to satisfy all of their requirements. Therefore, we believe that it is important that we attract and build relationships with other industry leaders with diverse technologies and services that extend the value of the network to our customers. These partnerships ensure that our customers have access to those technologies and services, whether through technology integration, joint development, resale, or other collaboration, in order to better support a broader set of our customers' requirements. In addition, we believe an open network infrastructure that invites partner innovation provides customers with greater choice and control in meeting their evolving business requirements, while enabling them to reduce costs.



Markets and Customers



We sell our high-performance network products and service offerings through direct sales and through distributors, value-added resellers ("VARS"), and original equipment manufacturer (“OEM”) partners to end-users in the following markets:



Service Providers



Service providers include wireline, wireless, and cable operators, as well as major Internet content and application providers. We support most major service provider networks in the world and our high-performance network infrastructure offerings are designed and built for the performance, reliability, and security that service providers demand. We believe our networking infrastructure offerings benefit our service provider customers by:



•Reducing capital and operational costs by running multiple services over the same network using our high density and highly reliable platforms;



•Creating new or additional revenue opportunities by enabling new services to be offered to new market segments based on our product capabilities;



•Increasing customer satisfaction, while lowering costs, by enabling consumers to self-select automatically provisioned service packages that provide the quality, speed, and pricing they desire; and











•Providing increased asset longevity and higher return on investment as our customers' networks can scale to multi-terabit rates based on the capabilities of our platforms.



While many of these service providers have historically been categorized separately as wireline, wireless, or cable operators, in recent years, we have seen increased convergence of these different types of service providers through acquisitions, mergers, and partnerships. We believe these strategic developments are made technically possible as operators invest in the build-out of next generation networks capable of supporting voice, video, and data traffic on the same IP-based network. This convergence relies on IP-based traffic processing and creates the opportunity for multi-service networks and offers service providers significant new revenue opportunities.



We believe that there are several other trends affecting service providers for which we are well positioned to deliver products and solutions. These trends include: significant growth in IP traffic on service provider networks because of peer-to-peer interaction; broadband usage; video; an increasing reliance on the network as a mission critical business tool in the strategies of our IP customers and of their enterprise customers; the advent of data center "clouds" that concentrate business applications in large, IP network connected facilities; and growth in mobile traffic as a result of the increase in mobile device usage including notebooks, netbooks, smartphones, and tablets.



The IP infrastructure market for service providers includes: products and technology at the network core; the network edge to enable access; the aggregation layer; security to protect from the inside out and the outside in; the application awareness and intelligence to optimize the network to meet business and user needs; and the management, service awareness, and control of the entire infrastructure.



Enterprise



Our high-performance network infrastructure offerings are designed to meet the performance, reliability, and security requirements of the world's most demanding businesses. Enterprises and public sector organizations, such as governments and research and education institutions, that view their networks as critical to their success are able to deploy our solutions as a powerful component in delivering the advanced network capabilities needed for their leading-edge applications. In addition, our solutions:



•Assist in the consolidation and delivery of existing services and applications;



•Accelerate the deployment of new services and applications;



•Offer integrated security to assist in the protection and recovery of services and applications; and



•Offer operational improvements that enable cost reductions, including lower administrative, training, customer care, and labor costs.



As with the service provider market, innovation continues to be a critical component in our strategy for the enterprise market. High-performance enterprises require networks that are global, distributed, and always available. Network equipment vendors serving these enterprises need to demonstrate performance, reliability, and security with best-in-class open solutions for maximum flexibility. We offer enterprise solutions and services for data centers, branch and campus applications, distributed and extended enterprises, and consumer and business devices.



As customers increasingly view the network as critical to their success, we believe that customers will increasingly demand fast, reliable, and secure access to services and applications over a single IP-based network. This is partly illustrated by the success of our SRX Series Services Gateways that consolidate switching, routing, and security services in a single device, Integrated Security Gateway (“ISG”) products that combine firewall/virtual private network (“VPN”) and intrusion detection and prevention (“IDP”) solutions in a single platform, and Secure Services Gateway (“SSG”) platforms that provide a mix of high-performance security with Local Area Network/Wide Area Network (“LAN”)/("WAN") connectivity for regional and branch office deployments. We will continue to invest to develop these and other converged technologies and solutions.



Customers with Ten Percent of Net Revenues or Greater



In 2012 and 2010, Verizon Communications, Inc. accounted for10.3%and10.4%of net revenues, respectively. In 2011,nosingle customer accounted for 10% or more of net revenues.











Our Products and Technology



Early in our history, we developed, marketed, and sold the first commercially available purpose-built IP backbone router optimized for the specific high-performance requirements of service providers. As the need for core bandwidth continued to increase, the need for service rich platforms at the edge of the network was created.



In the last six years, we have expanded our portfolio to address domains in the network: the core, the edge, access and aggregation, data centers, WANs, campus and branch, and consumer and business devices. We see every domain in the network as an opportunity to provide customers with business value, business efficiency, and new services and applications. We have systematically focused on how we innovate in silicon, systems, and software to provide a range of solutions in high-performance networking that can solve unique problems for customers.



In each of the past three fiscal years, routing, switching, security, and services each accounted for more than 10% of our consolidated net revenues. The following is an overview of our major product families within each of our segments:

See Item 7, "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations," in Part II of this Report, for an analysis of net product revenues by segment.



Platform Strategy



In addition to our major product families, our extended software portfolio, known as Junos Platform, is a key technology element in our strategy to be the leader in high-performance networking. The Junos Platform enables our customers to expand network software into the application space, deploy software clients to control delivery, and accelerate the pace of innovation with an ecosystem of developers. The Junos Platform includes the following products:



•Junos OS:At the heart of the Junos Platform is Junos OS. We believe Junos OS is fundamentally superior to other network operating systems in not only its design, but also in its development capabilities. The advantages of Junos OS include:



◦One modular operating system with single source base of code and a single, consistent implementation for each control plane feature;



◦One software release train extended through a highly disciplined and firmly scheduled development process; and



◦One common modular software architecture that scales across all Junos-based platforms.











Junos OS is designed to maintain continuous systems and improve the availability, performance, and security of business applications running across the network. Junos OS helps to automate network operations by providing a single consistent implementation of features across the network in a single release train that seeks to minimize the complexity, cost, and risk associated with implementing network features and upgrades. This operational efficiency allows network administrators more time to innovate and deliver new revenue-generating applications, helping to advance the economics of high-performance networking.



The security and stability of Junos OS, combined with its modular architecture and single source code base, provides a foundation for delivering performance, reliability, security, and scale at a lower total cost of ownership than multiple operating code base environments. With an increasing number of our platforms able to leverage Junos OS, including routing, switching, and security products, we believe Junos OS provides us a competitive advantage over other major network equipment vendors.



•Junos Space:Our Junos Space network management platform offers an open, Service-Oriented Architecture-based ("SOA") platform for creating organic and third-party network management applications to drive network innovation. Junos Space includes applications for network infrastructure management and automation that help customers reduce operational cost and complexity and scale services. These include Network Activate, Ethernet Design, Route Insight, Security Design, Virtual Control, Service Now, and Service Insight.



Major Product Development Projects



We continue to invest in innovation and strengthening our product portfolio, which resulted in new product offerings during 2012, including a smaller version of our QFabric solutions, the latest QFX3000-M QFabric System, T4000 Core Routers, and PTX Series Packet Transport switches. Additionally, we experienced new customer wins contributing to the growth in the EX Series, MX Series, and SRX Series. We launched the new ACX Series router with support for both Ethernet access/aggregation and MPLS, which extends network intelligence closer to the subscriber and features an open, standards-based management system with software development kit ("SDK")-enabled programmability to enable rapid third-party innovation. We also announced new products and features in our Simply Connected portfolio, including SRX Series Services Gateways and WLA Series Wireless LAN Access Points, which simplify and secure mobile device access to enterprise networks. Furthermore, we acquired Mykonos Web Security Software, in February 2012, to complement our network security applications portfolio.



Additionally, we announced innovative products to enable service providers to rapidly deliver and expand new consumer and business services. These products include our MX2020 and MX2010 3D Universal Edge Routers and new JunosV App Engine, which enable service providers to transform the network edge into a platform for rapid service deployment. We also launched the Junos Content Encore with MX Application Services Modular Line Card, which enables the delivery of premium content services over broadband connections across multiple device types. Furthermore, we announced a technology partnership with Riverbed Technology, Inc. ("Riverbed") that provides us with new capabilities for application delivery control, in exchange for Juniper providing WAN acceleration technology to Riverbed, along with promoting Riverbed as its WAN optimization provider of choice going forward.



Customer Service



In addition to our PSD and SSD products, we offer support, professional, and educational services. We deliver these services directly to our channel partners and to end-users and utilize a multi-tiered support model, leveraging the capabilities of our partners, and third-party organizations, as appropriate.



We also train our channel partners in the delivery of support, professional, and educational services to ensure these services are locally delivered.



As ofDecember 31, 2012, we employed1,301people in our worldwide customer service and support organization. We believe that a broad range of support services is essential to the successful customer deployment and ongoing support of our products, and we have hired support engineers with proven network experience to provide those services.



Manufacturing and Operations



As ofDecember 31, 2012, we employed318people in worldwide manufacturing and operations who primarily manage relationships with our contract manufacturers, manage our supply chain, and monitor and manage product testing and quality.











As ofDecember 31, 2012, we have subcontracted the majority of our manufacturing activity with Celestica Incorporated, Flextronics International LTD, Plexus Corporation ("Plexus"), and Accton Technology. During the fourth quarter of 2012, we confirmed an initiative to reduce the number of our contract manufacturers. In this regard, we confirmed the disengagement of Plexus as a contract manufacturer, which we expect to complete in 2013.



Our manufacturing is primarily conducted through contract manufacturers in the United States ("U.S."), China, Malaysia, Mexico, and Taiwan. Our contract manufacturers in all locations are responsible for all phases of manufacturing from prototypes to full production and assist with activities such as material procurement, final assembly, test, control, shipment to our customers, and repairs. Together with our contract manufacturers, we design, specify, and monitor the tests that are required to meet internal and external quality standards. These arrangements provide us with the following benefits:



•We can quickly deliver products to customers with turnkey manufacturing and drop-shipment capabilities;



•We gain economies of scale by leveraging our buying power with our contract manufacturers when we purchase large quantities of components;



•We operate with a minimum amount of dedicated space for manufacturing operations; and



•We can reduce our costs by reducing what would normally be fixed overhead expenses.



Our contract manufacturers build our products based on our rolling product demand forecasts. Each contract manufacturer procures components necessary to assemble the products in our forecast and tests the products according to our specifications. Products are then shipped to our distributors, VARs, or end-users. Generally, we do not own the components, and title to the products transfers from the contract manufacturers to us and immediately to our customers upon delivery at a designated shipment location. If the components remain unused or the products remain unsold for specified period, we may incur carrying charges or obsolete material charges for components that our contract manufacturers purchased to build products to meet our forecast or customer orders.



Although we have contracts with our contract manufacturers, those contracts merely set forth a framework within which the contract manufacturer may accept purchase orders from us. The contracts do not require them to manufacture our products on a long-term basis.



We also purchase and hold inventory for strategic reasons and to mitigate the risk of shortages of certain critical component supplies. The majority of our inventory is production components. As a result, we may incur additional holding costs and obsolescence charges, particularly in light of current macroeconomic conditions and the resulting uncertainties in future product demand.



Our ASICs are manufactured primarily by sole or limited sources, such as International Business Machines Corporation (“IBM”), each of which is responsible for all aspects of ASICs production using our proprietary designs.



By working collaboratively with our suppliers, we have the opportunity to promote socially responsible business practices beyond our company and into our worldwide supply chain. To this end, we have adopted a supplier code of conduct and promote compliance with such code of conduct to our suppliers. One element of our supplier code of conduct is adoption and compliance with the Electronic Industry Code of Conduct (“EICC”). The EICC outlines standards to promote ethical business practices, eliminate human trafficking, and ensure that working conditions in the electronics industry supply chain are safe, workers are treated with respect and dignity, and manufacturing processes are environmentally responsible.



Research and Development



We have assembled a team of skilled engineers with extensive experience in the fields of high-end computing, network system design, ASIC design, security, routing protocols, software applications and platforms, and embedded operating systems. As ofDecember 31, 2012, we employed4,081people in our worldwide R&D organization.



We believe that strong product development capabilities are essential to our strategy of enhancing our core technology, developing additional applications, integrating that technology, and maintaining the competitiveness and innovation of our product and service offerings. In our PSD and SSD products, we are leveraging our software ASIC and systems technology, developing additional network interfaces targeted to our customers' applications, and continuing to develop technology to support the anticipated growth in IP network requirements. We continue to expand the functionality of our products to improve performance reliability and scalability, and to provide an enhanced user interface.









Our R&D process is driven by the availability of new technology, market demand, and customer feedback. We have invested significant time and resources in creating a structured process for all product development projects. Following an assessment of market demand, our R&D team develops a full set of comprehensive functional product specifications based on inputs from the product management and sales organizations. This process is designed to provide a framework for defining and addressing the steps, tasks, and activities required to bring product concepts and development projects to market. Expenditures for R&D were $1,101.6 million,$1,026.8 million, and$917.9 millionin2012,2011, and2010, respectively.



Sales and Marketing



As ofDecember 31, 2012, we employed2,680people in our worldwide sales and marketing organization. These sales and marketing employees operate in different locations around the world in support of our customers.



Our sales organization, with its structure of sales professionals, system engineers, and marketing and channel teams, is generally split between service provider and enterprise customers. Within each team, sales team members serve the following three geographic regions: (i) Americas (including United States, Canada, Mexico, Caribbean and Central and South America), (ii) EMEA, and (iii) APAC. Within each region, there are regional and country teams, as well as major account teams, to ensure we operate close to our customers.

See Note 13,Segments, in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II of this Report, for information concerning our revenues by geographic regions and by significant customers, which is incorporated herein by reference. Our international operations subject us to certain risks and uncertainties. See Item 1A of Part I, “Risk Factors,” for more information.



Our sales teams operate in their respective regions and generally either engage customers directly or manage customer opportunities through our distribution and reseller relationships or channels as described below.



In the United States and Canada, we sell to several service providers directly and sell to other service providers and enterprise customers primarily through distributors and resellers. Almost all of our sales outside the United States and Canada are made through our channel partners.



Direct Sales Structure



Our sales team engages with end-user customers with which we have direct relationships. The terms and conditions of these arrangements are governed either by customer purchase orders and our acknowledgment of those orders or by purchase contracts. The direct contracts with these customers set forth only general terms of sale and generally do not require customers to purchase specified quantities of our products. We directly receive and process customer purchase orders.



Channel Sales Structure



A critical part of our sales and marketing efforts are our channel partners through which we conduct the majority of our sales. We employ various channel partners, including but not limited to:



•A global network of strategic distributor relationships, as well as region-specific or country-specific distributors who in turn sell to local VARs who sell to end-user customers. Our distribution channel partners sell our SSD product lines in addition to the majority of our PSD product lines, including infrastructure products that are often purchased by our enterprise customers. These distributors tend to be focused on particular regions or countries within regions. For example, we have substantial distribution relationships with Ingram Micro in the Americas and Hitachi in Japan. Our agreements with these distributors are generally non-exclusive, limited by region, and provide product discounts and other ordinary terms of sale. These agreements do not require our distributors to purchase specified quantities of our products.



•VARs and Direct value-added resellers ("DVARs"), including our strategic worldwide resellers referenced below, resell our products to end-users around the world. These channel partners either buy our products and services through distributors (VARs), or directly from us and have expertise in designing, selling, and deploying complex networking solutions in their respective markets. Our agreements with these channel partners are generally non-exclusive, limited by region, and provide product discounts and other ordinary terms of sale. These agreements do not require these channel partners to purchase specified quantities of our products. Increasingly, our service provider customers also resell our products to their customers or purchase our products for the purpose of providing managed services to their customers.









•Strategic worldwide reseller relationships with Nokia Siemens Networks B.V. ("NSN"), Ericsson Telecom A.B. (“Ericsson”), and IBM. These companies each offer services and products that complement our own product offerings and act as a reseller, and in some instances integration partners for our products. Our arrangements with these partners allow them to resell our products on a worldwide, non-exclusive basis, provide for product discounts, and specify other general terms of sale. These agreements do not require these partners to purchase specified quantities of our products.



We have a “direct touch” sales team that works directly with channel partners on key accounts in order to maintain a relationship with certain strategic end-user customers while at the same time supporting the ultimate fulfillment of product through our channel partners.



Backlog



Our sales are made primarily pursuant to purchase orders under framework agreements with our customers. At any given time, we have backlog orders for products that have not shipped. Because customers may cancel purchase orders or change delivery schedules without significant penalty, we believe that our backlog at any given date may not be a reliable indicator of future operating results. As ofDecember 31, 2012and2011, our total product backlog was approximately$410.5 millionand$300.7 million, respectively. Our product backlog consists of confirmed orders for products scheduled to be shipped to customers, generally within the next six months, and excludes orders from distributors as we recognize product revenue on sales made through distributors upon sell-through to end-users, certain future revenue adjustments for items such as product revenue deferrals, sales return reserves, service revenue allocations, and early payment discounts.



Seasonality



We, as do many companies in our industry experience seasonal fluctuations in customer spending patterns, particularly in the first and third quarters. Historically, we have experienced stronger customer demand in the fourth quarter. This historical pattern should not be considered a reliable indicator of our future net revenues or financial performance.



Competition



PSD Business



In the network infrastructure business, Cisco Systems, Inc. ("Cisco") has historically been the dominant player in the market. However, our principal competitors also include Alcatel-Lucent, Brocade Communications Systems, Inc. ("Brocade"), Extreme Networks, Inc. ("Extreme Networks"), Hewlett Packard Company ("HP"), and Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd. ("Huawei").



Many of our current and potential competitors, such as Cisco, Alcatel-Lucent, HP, and Huawei bundle their products with other networking products in a manner that may discourage customers from purchasing our products. In addition, consolidation among competitors, or the acquisition of our partners and resellers by competitors, can increase the competitive pressure faced by us due to their increased size and breadth of their product portfolios. Many of our current and potential competitors have greater name recognition and more extensive customer bases that they may leverage to compete more effectively. Increased competition could result in price reductions, fewer customer orders, reduced gross margins, and loss of market share, negatively affecting our operating results.



SSD Business



In the market for SSD products, Cisco generally is our primary competitor with its broad range of products. In addition, there are a number of other competitors for each of the product lines within SSD, including Check Point Software Technologies, Ltd. ("Check Point"), F5 Networks, Inc. ("F5 Networks"), Fortinet, Inc. ("Fortinet"), and Palo Alto Networks, Inc. ("Palo Alto Networks"). These additional competitors tend to be focused on single product line solutions and, therefore, may be considered specialized compared to our broader product line. In addition, a number of public and private companies have announced plans for new products to address the same needs that our products address. We believe that our ability to compete with Cisco and others depends upon our ability to demonstrate that our products are superior in meeting the needs of our current and potential customers.



For both product groups, we expect that over time, large companies with significant resources, technical expertise, market experience, customer relationships, and broad product lines, such as Cisco, Alcatel-Lucent, and Huawei, will introduce new products designed to compete more effectively in the market. There are also several other companies that claim to have products with greater capabilities than our products. There continues to be consolidation in this industry, with smaller









companies being acquired by larger, established suppliers of network infrastructure products. We believe this trend is likely to continue.



As a result, we expect to face increased competition in the future from larger companies with significantly more resources than we have. Although we believe that our technology and the purpose-built features of our products make them unique and will enable us to compete effectively with these companies, we cannot guarantee that we will be successful.



Environment



We are subject to regulations that have been adopted with respect to environmental matters, such as the Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (“WEEE”), Restriction of the Use of Certain Hazardous Substances in Electrical and Electronic Equipment (“RoHS”), and Registration, Evaluation, Authorization, and Restriction of Chemicals (“REACH”) regulations adopted by the European Union and China. In addition, we participate in the Carbon Disclosure Project (“CDP”). CDP is a global standardized mechanism by which companies report their greenhouse gas emissions to institutional investors. It hosts one of the largest registries of corporate greenhouse gas data in the world at www.cdproject.net. We continue to invest in the infrastructure and systems required to be able to inventory and measure our carbon footprint on a global basis. We believe we have made significant strides in improving our energy efficiency around the world.



To date, compliance with federal, state, local, and foreign laws enacted for the protection of the environment has had no material effect on our capital expenditures, earnings, or competitive position.



In addition, we are committed to the environment by our effort in improving the energy efficiency of key elements in our high-performance network product offerings. In 2012, we launched a set of carrier-class MPLS switches, the PTX5000 series. In addition to filling the capacity and density requirement for Internet core growth, PTX5000 also features record energy efficiency of 1.5W per Gigabit of throughput. The environment will remain a focus area across multiple aspects of our business.



Intellectual Property



Our success and ability to compete are substantially dependent upon our internally developed technology and expertise.



While we rely on patent, copyright, trade secret, and trademark law to protect our technology, we also believe that factors such as the technological and creative skills of our personnel, new product developments, frequent product enhancements, and reliable product maintenance are essential to establishing and maintaining a technology leadership position. There can be no assurance that others will not develop technologies that are similar or superior to our technology.



In addition, we integrate licensed third-party technology into certain of our products. From time to time, we license additional technology from third parties to develop new products or product enhancements. There can be no assurance that third-party licenses will be available or continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable terms. Our inability to maintain or re-license any third-party licenses required in our products or our inability to obtain third-party licenses necessary to develop new products and product enhancements could require us to obtain substitute technology of lower quality or performance standards or at a greater cost, any of which could harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations.



Our success will depend in part upon our ability to obtain necessary intellectual property rights and protect our intellectual property rights. We cannot be certain that patents will be issued on the patent applications that we have filed, that we will be able to obtain the necessary intellectual property rights, or that other parties will not contest our intellectual property rights.



As ofDecember 31, 2012, our worldwide patent portfolio included over 1,700 patents. Patents generally have a term of twenty years from filing.  As our patent portfolio has been built over time, the remaining terms on the individual patents vary.



Employees



As ofDecember 31, 2012, we had9,234full-time employees. We have not experienced any work stoppages, and we consider our relations with our employees to be good. Competition for qualified personnel in our industry is intense. We believe that our future success depends in part on our continued ability to hire, motivate, and retain qualified personnel. We believe that we have been successful in recruiting qualified employees, but there is no assurance that we will continue to be successful in the future.









Our future performance depends significantly upon the continued service of our key technical, sales, and senior management personnel, none of whom are bound by an employment agreement requiring service for any defined period of time. The loss of one or more of our key employees could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Our future successes also depend on our continuing ability to attract, train, and retain highly qualified technical, sales, and managerial personnel. Competition for such key personnel is intense, and in order to attract and retain these personnel, we must provide a competitive compensation package, including cash and share-based compensation. Our share-based incentive awards include stock options, restricted stock units ("RSUs"), restricted stock awards ("RSAs"), and performance share awards ("PSAs"), some of which contain conditions relating to our long-term financial performance that make the future value of those awards uncertain. If the anticipated value of such share-based incentive awards does not materialize, if our share-based compensation otherwise ceases to be viewed as a valuable benefit, or if our total compensation package is not viewed as being competitive, our ability to attract, retain, and motivate key personnel could be weakened. There can be no assurance that we can retain our key personnel in the future.
