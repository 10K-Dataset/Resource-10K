ITEM 1.BUSINESS

General Information

The Bancorp, an Ohio corporation organized in 1975, is a bank holding company as defined by the Bank Holding Company Act
of 1956, as amended (the “BHCA”), and is registered as such with the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the “FRB”). The Bancorp’s principal office is located in Cincinnati, Ohio.

The Bancorp’s subsidiaries provide a wide range of financial products and services to the retail, commercial,
financial, governmental, educational and medical sectors, including a wide variety of checking, savings and money market accounts, and credit products such as credit cards, installment loans, mortgage loans and leases. Fifth Third Bank has deposit
insurance provided by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the “FDIC”) through the Deposit Insurance Fund. Refer to Exhibit 21 filed as an attachment to this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a list of subsidiaries of the Bancorp as of
December 31, 2012.

The Bancorp derives the majority of its revenues from the U.S. Revenue from foreign
countries and external customers domiciled in foreign countries is immaterial to the Bancorp’s Consolidated Financial Statements.

Additional information regarding the Bancorp’s businesses is included in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.

Competition

The Bancorp
competes for deposits, loans and other banking services in its principal geographic markets as well as in selected national markets as opportunities arise. In addition to the challenge of attracting and retaining customers for traditional banking
services, the Bancorp’s competitors include securities dealers, brokers, mortgage bankers, investment advisors and insurance companies. These competitors, with focused products targeted at highly profitable customer segments, compete across
geographic boundaries and provide customers increasing access to meaningful alternatives to banking services in nearly all significant products. The increasingly competitive environment is a result primarily of changes in regulation, changes in
technology, product delivery systems and the accelerating pace of consolidation among financial service providers. These competitive trends are likely to continue.

Acquisitions

The Bancorp’s strategy for growth includes strengthening
its presence in core markets, expanding into contiguous markets and broadening its product offerings while taking into account the integration and other risks of growth. The Bancorp evaluates strategic acquisition opportunities and conducts due
diligence activities in connection with possible transactions. As a result, discussions, and in some cases, negotiations may take place and future acquisitions involving cash, debt or equity securities may occur. These typically involve the payment
of a premium over book value and current market price, and therefore, some dilution of book value and net income per share may occur with any future transactions.

Regulation and Supervision

In addition to the generally applicable state
and federal laws governing businesses and employers, the Bancorp and its banking subsidiary are subject to extensive regulation by federal and state laws and regulations applicable to financial institutions and their parent companies. Virtually all
aspects of the business of the Bancorp and its banking subsidiary are subject to specific





164Fifth Third Bancorp




requirements or restrictions and general regulatory oversight. The principal objectives of state and federal banking laws and regulations and the supervision, regulation and examination of banks
and their parent companies (such as the Bancorp) by bank regulatory agencies are the maintenance of the safety and soundness of financial institutions, maintenance of the federal deposit insurance system and the protection of consumers or classes of
consumers, rather than the specific protection of shareholders of a bank or the parent company of a bank. To the extent the following material describes statutory or regulatory provisions, it is qualified in its entirety by reference to the
particular statute or regulation.

Regulators

The Bancorp and/or its banking subsidiary are subject to regulation and supervision primarily by the FRB, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (the “CFPB”) and the Ohio Division of Financial
Institutions (the “Division”) and additionally by certain other functional regulators and self-regulatory organizations. The Bancorp is also subject to regulation by the SEC by virtue of its status as a public company and due to the nature
of some of its businesses. The Bancorp’s banking subsidiary is subject to regulation by the FDIC, which insures the bank’s deposits as permitted by law.

The federal and state laws and regulations that are applicable to banks and to some extent bank holding companies
regulate, among other matters, the scope of their business, their activities, their investments, their reserves against deposits, the timing of the availability of deposited funds, the amount of loans to individual and related borrowers and the
nature, amount of and collateral for certain loans, and the amount of interest that may be charged on loans. Various federal and state consumer laws and regulations also affect the services provided to consumers.

The Bancorp and/or its subsidiary are required to file various reports with, and is subject to examination by
regulators, including the FRB and the Division. The FRB, Division and the CFPB have the authority to issue orders to bank holding companies and/or banks to cease and desist from certain banking practices and violations of conditions imposed by, or
violations of agreements with, the FRB, Division and CFPB. Certain of the Bancorp’s and/or its banking subsidiary regulators are also empowered to assess civil money penalties against companies or individuals in certain situations, such as when
there is a violation of a law or regulation. Applicable state and federal law also grant certain regulators the authority to impose additional requirements and restrictions on the activities of the Bancorp and or its banking subsidiary and, in some
situations, the imposition of such additional requirements and restrictions will not be publicly available information.

Acquisitions

The BHCA requires the prior approval of the FRB for a bank holding company to acquire substantially all the assets of a
bank or to acquire direct or indirect ownership or control of more than 5% of any class of the voting shares of any bank, bank holding company or savings association, or to increase any such non-majority ownership or control of any bank, bank
holding company or savings association, or to merge or consolidate with any bank holding company.

The BHCA
prohibits a bank holding company from acquiring a direct or indirect interest in or control of more than 5% of any class of the voting shares of a company that is not a bank or a bank holding company and from engaging directly or

indirectly in activities other than those of banking, managing or controlling banks or furnishing services to its banking subsidiaries, except that it may engage in and may own shares of
companies engaged in certain activities the FRB has determined to be so closely related to banking or managing or controlling banks as to be proper incident thereto.

Financial Holding Companies

Dividends

The Bancorp depends in part upon dividends received from its direct and indirect subsidiaries, including its indirect banking subsidiary,
to fund its activities, including the payment of dividends. The Bancorp and its banking subsidiary are subject to various federal and state restrictions on their ability to pay dividends. The FRB has authority to prohibit bank holding companies from
paying dividends if such payment is deemed to be an unsafe or unsound practice. The FRB has indicated generally that it may be an unsafe or unsound practice for bank holding companies to pay dividends unless a bank holding company’s net income
is sufficient to fund the dividends and the expected rate of earnings retention is consistent with the organization’s capital needs, asset quality and overall financial condition. The ability to pay dividends may be further limited by
provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act and implanting regulations (see the “Regulatory Reform” section).

Source of Strength

Under long-standing FRB policy and now as codified in the Dodd-Frank Act, a bank holding company is expected to act as a
source of financial and managerial strength to each of its banking subsidiaries and to commit resources to their support. This support may be required at times when the bank holding company may not have the resources to provide it.

FDIC Assessments

As
contemplated by the Dodd-Frank Act the FDIC has revised the framework by which insured depository institutions with more





Fifth Third Bancorp165




than $10 billion in assets (“large IDIs”) are assessed for purposes of payments to the Deposit Insurance Fund (the “DIF”). The final rule implementing revisions to the
assessment system was released on February 7, 2011, and took effect for the quarter beginning April 1, 2011.

Prior to the passage of the Dodd-Frank Act, a large IDI’s DIF premiums principally were based on the size of an IDI’s domestic deposit base. The Dodd-Frank Act changed the assessment base from a
large IDI’s domestic deposit base to its total assets less tangible equity. In addition to potentially greatly increasing the size of a large IDI’s assessment base, the expansion of the assessment base affords the FDIC much greater
flexibility to vary its assessment system based upon the different asset classes that large IDIs normally hold on their balance sheets.

To implement this provision, the FDIC created an assessment scheme vastly different from the deposit-based system. Under the new system, large IDIs are assessed under a complex “scorecard”
methodology that seeks to capture both the probability that an individual large IDI will fail and the magnitude of the impact on the DIF if such a failure occurs.

Transactions with Affiliates

Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve
Act, restrict transactions between a bank and its affiliates (as defined in Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act), including a parent bank holding company. The Bancorp’s banking subsidiary is subject to certain restrictions,
including but not limited to restrictions on loans to its affiliates, on investments in the stock or securities thereof, on the taking of such stock or securities as collateral for loans to any borrower, and on the issuance of a guarantee or letter
of credit on their behalf. Among other things, these restrictions limit the amount of such transactions, require collateral in prescribed amounts for extensions of credit, prohibit the purchase of low quality assets and require that the terms of
such transactions be substantially equivalent to terms of comparable transactions with non-affiliates. Generally, the Bancorp’s banking subsidiary is limited in its extension of credit to any affiliate to 10% of the banking subsidiary’s
capital stock and surplus and its extension of credit to all affiliates to 20% of the banking subsidiary’s capital stock and surplus.

Community Reinvestment Act

The CRA generally requires insured depository institutions to identify the communities they serve and to make loans and investments and
provide services that meet the credit needs of those communities. Furthermore, the CRA requires the FRB to evaluate the performance of the Bancorp’s banking subsidiary in helping to meet the credit needs of its communities. As a part of the CRA
program, the banking subsidiary is subject to periodic examinations by the FRB, and must maintain comprehensive records of their CRA activities for this purpose. During these examinations, the FRB rates such institutions’ compliance with the
CRA as “Outstanding,” “Satisfactory,” “Needs to Improve” or “Substantial Noncompliance.” Failure of an institution to receive at least a “Satisfactory” rating could inhibit such institution or its
holding company from undertaking certain activities, including engaging in activities permitted as a financial holding company under the GLBA and acquiring other financial institutions. The FRB must take into account the record of performance of
banks in meeting the credit needs of the entire community served, including low- and moderate-income neighborhoods. Fifth Third Bank received a “Satisfactory” CRA rating in its most recent CRA examination.

Capital

The FRB has established capital guidelines for bank holding companies and FHCs. The FRB, the Division and the FDIC have also issued regulations establishing capital requirements for banks. Failure to meet
capital requirements could subject the Bancorp and its banking subsidiary to a variety of restrictions and enforcement actions. In addition, as discussed previously, the Bancorp and its banking subsidiary must remain well capitalized and well
managed for the Bancorp to retain its status as a FHC. See the “Regulatory Reform” section for additional information on capital requirements impacting the Bancorp.

Privacy

The FRB, FDIC and other bank regulatory agencies have adopted
final guidelines (the “Guidelines) for safeguarding confidential, personal customer information. The Guidelines require each financial institution, under the supervision and ongoing oversight of its Board of Directors or an appropriate
committee thereof, to create, implement and maintain a comprehensive written information security program designed to ensure the security and confidentiality of customer information, protect against any anticipated threats or hazards to the security
or integrity of such information and protect against unauthorized access to or use of such information that could result in substantial harm or inconvenience to any customer. The Bancorp has adopted a customer information security program that has
been approved by the Bancorp’s Board of Directors (the “Board).

The GLBA requires financial
institutions to implement policies and procedures regarding the disclosure of nonpublic personal information about consumers to non-affiliated third parties. In general, the statute requires explanations to consumers on policies and procedures
regarding the disclosure of such nonpublic personal information, and, except as otherwise required by law, prohibits disclosing such information except as provided in the banking subsidiary’s policies and procedures. The Bancorp’s banking
subsidiary has implemented a privacy policy.

Anti-Money Laundering

The Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001 (the
“Patriot Act”), designed to deny terrorists and others the ability to obtain access to the United States financial system, has significant implications for depository institutions, brokers, dealers and other businesses involved in the
transfer of money. The Patriot Act, as implemented by various federal regulatory agencies, requires financial institutions, including the Bancorp and its subsidiaries, to implement new policies and procedures or amend existing policies and
procedures with respect to, among other matters, anti-money laundering, compliance, suspicious activity and currency transaction reporting and due diligence on customers. The Patriot Act and its underlying regulations also permit information sharing
for counter-terrorist purposes between federal law enforcement agencies and financial institutions, as well as among financial institutions, subject to certain conditions, and require the FRB (and other federal banking agencies) to evaluate the
effectiveness of an applicant in combating money laundering activities when considering applications filed under Section 3 of the BHCA or the Bank Merger Act. The Bancorp’s Board has approved policies and procedures that are believed to be
compliant with the Patriot Act.





166Fifth Third Bancorp




Exempt Brokerage Activities

The GLBA amended the federal securities laws to eliminate the blanket exceptions that banks traditionally have had from the definition of “broker” and “dealer.” The GLBA also required
that there be certain transactional activities that would not be “brokerage” activities, which banks could effect without having to register as a broker. In September 2007, the FRB and SEC approved Regulation R to govern bank securities
activities. Various exemptions permit banks to conduct activities that would otherwise constitute brokerage activities under the securities laws. Those exemptions include conducting brokerage activities related to trust, fiduciary and similar
services, certain services and also conducting a de minimis number of riskless principal transactions, certain asset-backed transactions and certain securities lending transactions. The Bancorp only conducts non-exempt brokerage activities through
its affiliated registered broker-dealer.

Regulatory Reform

Financial Stability Oversight Council

The Dodd-Frank Act creates the Financial Stability Oversight Council (“FSOC”), which is chaired by the Secretary of the Treasury and composed of expertise from various financial services
regulators. The FSOC has responsibility for identifying risks and responding to emerging threats to financial stability. On March 15, 2012, the Department of Treasury issued a final rule to establish an assessment schedule for the collection of
fees from bank holding companies with at least $50 billion in assets and foreign banks with at least $50 billion in assets in the U.S. to cover the expenses of the Office of Financial Research and FSOC. The fees would also cover certain expenses
incurred by the FDIC. The initial assessment period commenced July 21, 2012 and ends March 31, 2013. The Bancorp paid approximately $1 million for the initial assessment period. The next scheduled assessment is set to occur on
September 16, 2013.

Executive Compensation

The Dodd-Frank Act provides for a say on pay for shareholders of all public companies. Under the Dodd-Frank Act, each company must give its shareholders the opportunity to vote on the compensation of its
executives at least once every three years. The Dodd-Frank Act also adds disclosure and voting requirements for golden parachute compensation that is payable to named executive officers in connection with sale transactions.

Pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, in June 2012, the SEC adopted a final rule directing the stock exchanges to prohibit
listing classes of equity securities if a company’s compensation committee members are not independent. The rule also provides that a company’s compensation committee may only select a compensation consultant, legal counsel or other
advisor after taking into consideration factors to be identified by the SEC that affect the independence of a compensation consultant, legal counsel or other advisor.

The SEC is required under the Dodd-Frank Act to issue rules obligating companies to disclose in proxy materials for
annual meetings of shareholders information that shows the relationship between executive compensation actually paid to their named executive officers and their financial performance, taking into account any change in the value of the shares of a
company’s stock and dividends or distributions.

The Dodd-Frank Act provides that the SEC must issue
rules directing the stock exchanges to prohibit listing any security of a company unless the company develops and implements a policy providing for disclosure of the policy of the company on incentive-based compensation that is based on financial
information required to be reported under the securities laws and that, in the event the company is required to prepare an accounting restatement due to the material noncompliance of the company with any financial reporting requirement under the
securities laws, the company will recover from any current or former executive officer of the company who received incentive-based compensation during the three-year period preceding the date on which the company is required to prepare the
restatement based on the erroneous data, any exceptional compensation above what would have been paid under the restatement.

The Dodd-Frank Act requires the SEC to adopt a rule to require that each company disclose in the proxy materials for its annual meetings whether an employee or board member is permitted to purchase
financial instruments designed to hedge or offset decreases in the market value of equity securities granted as compensation or otherwise held by the employee or board member.

Corporate Governance

The Dodd-Frank Act clarifies that the SEC may, but is
not required to promulgate rules that would require that a company’s proxy materials include a nominee for the board of directors submitted by a shareholder. Although the SEC promulgated rules to accomplish this, these rules were invalidated by
a federal appeals court decision. The SEC has said that they will not challenge the ruling, but has not ruled out the possibility that new rules could be proposed.

The Dodd-Frank Act requires stock exchanges to have rules prohibiting their members from voting securities that they do
not beneficially own (unless they have received voting instructions from the beneficial owner) with respect to the election of a member of the board of directors (other than an uncontested election of directors of an investment company registered
under the Investment Company Act of 1940), executive compensation or any other significant matter, as determined by the SEC by rule.

Credit Ratings

The Dodd-Frank Act includes a number of provisions that are targeted at improving the reliability of credit ratings. The SEC has been charged with adopting various rules in this regard.

Consumer Issues

The
Dodd-Frank Act created a new bureau, the CFPB, which has the authority to implement regulations pursuant to numerous consumer protection laws and has supervisory authority, including the power to conduct examination and take enforcement actions,
with respect to depository institutions with more than $10 billion in consolidated assets. The CFPB also has authority, with respect to consumer financial services to, among other things, restrict unfair, deceptive or abusive acts or practices,
enforce laws that prohibit discrimination and unfair treatment and to require certain consumer disclosures.

Debit Card Interchange Fees

The Dodd-Frank Act provides for a set of new rules requiring that interchange transaction fees for electric debit
transactions be “reasonable” and proportional to certain costs associated with processing the transactions. The FRB was given authority to, among other things, establish standards for assessing whether interchange fees are reasonable and
proportional. In June 2011, the FRB issued a final rule establishing certain standards and prohibitions pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, including establishing standards for debit card interchange fees and allowing for an upward adjustment if the
issuer develops and implements policies and procedures reasonably designed to prevent fraud. The provisions regarding debit card interchange fees and the fraud adjustment became effective October 1, 2011. The rules impose requirements on the
Bancorp and its banking subsidiary and may negatively impact our revenues and results of operations.

FDIC Matters and Resolution Planning

The Dodd-Frank Act creates an orderly liquidation process that the FDIC can employ for failing financial companies that
are not insured depository institutions. The Dodd-Frank Act gives the FDIC new authority to create a widely available emergency financial stabilization program to guarantee the obligations of solvent depository institutions and their holding
companies and affiliates during times of severe economic stress. Additionally, the Dodd-Frank Act also codifies many of the temporary changes that had already been implemented, such as permanently increasing the amount of deposit insurance to
$250,000.

In September 2011, the FDIC approved an interim final rule that requires an insured depository
institution with $50 billion or more in total assets to submit periodic contingency plans to the FDIC for resolution in the event of the institution’s failure. The rule became effective in January 2012, however, submission of plans will be
staggered over a period of time. The Bancorp’s banking subsidiary is subject to this rule.

In October
2011, the FRB issued a final rule implementing resolution planning requirements in the Dodd-Frank Act. The final rule requires bank holding companies with assets of $50 billion or more and nonbank financial firms designated by FSOC for supervision
by the FRB to annually submit resolution plans to the FDIC and FRB. Each plan shall describe the company’s strategy for rapid and orderly resolution in bankruptcy during times of financial distress. Under the final rule, companies will

submit their initial resolution plans on a staggered basis. The Bancorp will be required to submit a resolution plan pursuant to this rule.

Proprietary Trading and Investing in Certain Funds

Derivatives

The
Dodd-Frank Act includes measures to broaden the scope of derivative instruments subject to regulation by requiring clearing and exchange trading of certain derivatives, imposing new capital and margin requirements for certain market participants and
imposing position limits on certain over-the-counter derivatives. To the extent that the Bancorp acts in certain capacities in trading derivatives or trades a certain amount of certain derivatives instruments, then certain affiliates of the Bancorp
may be required to register with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission or the SEC. As with the Volcker Rule, the Bancorp will be required to demonstrate that it has a satisfactory compliance program to monitor the activities of any swap dealer or
major swap participant registered under the new regulations. Although final rules defining certain key terms were adopted in June, 2012, the ultimate impact of these derivatives regulations, and the time it will take to comply, continues to remain
uncertain. The final regulations will impose additional operational and compliance costs on us and may require us to restructure certain businesses and negatively impact our revenues and results of operations.

Interstate Bank Branching

The Dodd-Frank Act includes provisions permitting national and insured state banks to engage inde novointerstate branching if,
under the laws of the state where the new branch is to be established, a state bank chartered in that state would be permitted to establish a branch.





168Fifth Third Bancorp




Systemically Significant Companies and Capital

The Dodd-Frank Act creates a new regulatory regime for entities that are deemed to be “systemically significant financial
companies.” The Dodd-Frank Act sets a $50 billion consolidated asset floor for a bank holding company to be subject to the heightened oversight and regulation, although the FRB can adjust those amounts upward for some of the heightened
standards under certain circumstances. Dodd-Frank establishes a broad framework for identifying, applying heightened supervision and regulation to, and (as necessary) limiting the size and activities of systemically significant financial companies.

The Dodd-Frank Act instructs the FRB to impose enhanced capital and risk-management standards on large
financial firms and mandates the FRB to conduct annual stress tests on all bank holding companies with $50 billion or more in assets to determine whether they have the capital needed to absorb losses in baseline, adverse, and severely adverse
economic conditions. In November 2011, the FRB adopted final rules requiring bank holding companies with $50 billion or more in consolidated assets to submit capital plans to the FRB on an annual basis. Under the final rules, the FRB annually will
evaluate an institutions capital adequacy, internal capital adequacy, assessment processes and plans to make capital distributions such as dividend payments and stock repurchases.

In November 2012, the FRB provided instructions on the 2013 Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review
(“CCAR”). The 2013 CCAR required bank holding companies with consolidated assets of $50 billion or more to submit a capital plan to the FRB by January 7, 2013. The mandatory elements of the capital plan are an assessment of the
expected use and sources of capital over the planning horizon, a description of all planned capital actions over the planning horizon, a discussion of any expected changes to the Bancorp’s business plan that are likely to have a material impact
on its capital adequacy or liquidity, a detailed description of the Bancorp’s process for assessing capital adequacy and the Bancorp’s capital policy.

In December 2011, the FRB issued proposed rules to strengthen regulation and supervision of large bank holding companies
and systemically important nonbank financial firms. The proposed rules would generally apply to all U.S. bank holding companies with consolidated assets of $50 billion or more, such as the Bancorp, and any nonbank financial firms that may be
designated by the FSOC as systemically important companies. The proposal, which is mandated by the Dodd-Frank Act, includes a wide range of measures addressing such issues as capital, liquidity, credit exposure, stress testing, risk management and
early remediation requirements. In particular, the proposal includes proposed risk-based capital and leverage requirements that would be implemented in two phases, the first phase would be subject to the FRB’s capital plan rule issued in
November 2011. The second phase would involve the FRB issuing a proposal to implement a risk-based capital surcharge based on the framework and methodology developed by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (the “Basel Committee”),
the current version referred to as “Basel III.”

Basel III is designed to materially improve the
quality of regulatory capital and introduces a new minimum common equity requirement. Basel III also raises the numerical minimum capital requirements and introduces capital conservation and countercyclical buffers to induce banking organizations to
hold capital in excess of regulatory minimums. In addition, Basel III

establishes an international leverage standard for internationally active banks. The FRB is working with other U.S. banking regulators to implement the Basel III capital reforms in the United
States. On June 12, 2012, the federal banking agencies, including the FRB, issued a joint release announcing three separate notices of proposed rulemaking (“NPRs”) seeking comment on proposed rules that would revise and replace their
current capital rules in a manner consistent both with relevant provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act as well as the implementation of Basel III. Also on June 12, 2012, these agencies announced the finalization of their market risk capital rule
proposed in 2011. The NPRs indicated that the final rule would become effective on January 1, 2013, and the changes set forth in the final rules would be phased in from January 1, 2013 through January 1, 2019. However, in November
2012, the agencies announced that the effective date would be delayed.
