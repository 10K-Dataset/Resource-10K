Sales to international customers accounted for approximately 44% of total sales in 2019, compared with 47% in 2018 and 46% in 2017.  In 2019, we sold products to customers in over 100 foreign countries. Approximately 90% of our sales to foreign-based customers were made to customers in 25 foreign countries.  In 2019, the top five countries for international sales were China, the United Kingdom, Germany, Japan and South Korea and represented approximately 21% of our total sales.







Approximately 24%, 23% and 24% of our total net sales for 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively, were derived from contracts with agencies of, and prime contractors to, the U.S. Government. Information on our sales to the U.S. Government, including direct sales as a prime contractor and indirect sales as a subcontractor, is as follows (in millions):

U.S. Government sales by segment:201920182017Instrumentation$80.4$68.3$65.2Digital Imaging107.490.585.7Aerospace and Defense Electronics225.3177.2157.2Engineered Systems346.7319.3311.6Total U.S. Government sales$759.8$655.3$619.7

Our principal U.S. Government customer is the U.S. Department of Defense, which totaled $545.5 million, $494.9 million and $479.7 million of our total net sales for 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.  In 2019 and 2017, our largest program with the U.S. Government was the Mission Operations and Integration contract with the NASA Marshall Space Flight Center, which represented 1.4% and 1.5% of our total net sales, respectively.

Seasonality

No material portion of our business is considered to be seasonal.

Raw Materials and Suppliers

Generally, our businesses have experienced minimal fluctuations in the supply of raw materials, but not without some price volatility.  While some of our businesses provide services, for those businesses that sell hardware and product, a portion of the value that we provide is labor-oriented, such as design, engineering, assembly and test activities.  In manufacturing our products, we use our own production capabilities and third-party suppliers and subcontractors, including international sources.  Some of the items we use for the manufacture of our products, including certain gyro components for some marine navigation applications, certain magnets and helix wire for our traveling wave tubes, certain infrared detectors substrates and certain ceramics and molding compounds used in our sonar systems, as well as certain scintillator materials used in the production of our X-ray detectors, are purchased from limited or single sources, including international sources, due to technical capability, price and other factors.  At times we have experienced difficulty in procuring raw materials, components, sub-assemblies and other supplies required in our manufacturing processes due to shortages and supplier-imposed allocation of components.

Sales and Marketing

Our sales and marketing approach varies by segment and by products within our segments.  A shared fundamental tenet is the commitment to work closely with our customers to understand their needs, with an aim to secure preferred supplier and longer-term relationships.

Our segments use a combination of internal sales forces, third-party distributors and third-party commissioned sales representatives to market and sell our products and services.  Our businesses have been working over the years to consolidate or share internal sales and servicing efforts.  Several Teledyne businesses have been marketing and selling products collaboratively to similar customers to promote “one-stop” shopping under singular “brand” names, including Teledyne Marine, Teledyne Oil & Gas, Teledyne Defense Electronics, Teledyne Microwave Solutions, Teledyne HiRel Electronics and Teledyne Advanced Chemistry Systems.

Products are also advertised in trade journals and by means of various websites.  To promote our products and other capabilities, our personnel regularly participate in trade shows and professional associations.

Many of our government contracts are awarded after a competitive bidding process in which we seek to emphasize our ability to provide superior products and technical solutions in addition to competitive pricing.





Through Teledyne Technologies International Corp. and other subsidiaries, we have established offices in foreign countries to facilitate international sales for various businesses. Locations include Brazil, China, France, Germany, India, Italy, Japan, Malaysia, Singapore, South Korea and the United Arab Emirates.

Competition

We believe that technological capabilities and innovation and the ability to invest in the development of new and enhanced products are critical to obtaining and maintaining leadership in our markets and the industries in which we compete.  Although we have certain advantages that we believe help us compete effectively in our markets, each of our markets is highly competitive.  With regard to our defense businesses, it is common in the defense industry for work on programs to be shared among several companies, including competitors.  In any event, because of the diversity of products sold and the number of markets we serve, we encounter a wide variety of competitors, none of which we believe offer the same product and service lines or serve all of the same markets as we do.  Our businesses vigorously compete on quality, product performance and reliability, technical expertise, price and service. Many of our competitors have, and potential competitors could have, greater name recognition, a larger installed base of products, more extensive engineering, manufacturing, marketing and distribution capabilities and greater financial, technological and personnel resources than we do.



Intellectual Property

While we own and control various intellectual property rights, including patents, trade secrets, confidential information, trademarks, trade names, and copyrights, which, in the aggregate, are of material importance to our business, we believe that our business as a whole is not materially dependent upon any one intellectual property or related group of such properties.  We own several hundred active patents and are licensed to use certain patents, technology and other intellectual property rights owned and controlled by others.  Similarly, other companies are licensed to use certain patents, technology and other intellectual property rights owned and controlled by us.

Patents, patent applications and license agreements will expire or terminate over time by operation of law, in accordance with their terms or otherwise.  We do not expect the expiration or termination of these patents, patent applications and license agreements to have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.

We provide a broad range of precision measurement technologies for environmental monitoring and climate research.   Our sensors and instruments are deployed everywhere, from pole to pole, in space, on aircraft and drones, on land, on the sea surface, in the water column, and on the seafloor.   They operate around the clock, measuring greenhouse gases from space, precisely monitoring air and water quality throughout the world, and continuously profiling all of Earth’s oceans.  Applications of our instruments provide scientists information that spans time from the origin of the universe to providing real-time data to quality of air pollution and dangerous storms, such as time-critical warning of hurricanes and tsunamis.

More specific examples of our contributions to global environmental and climate science include the following:

•We provide sophisticated water samplers and flowmeters to monitor wastewater, irrigation flow, storm water, industrial discharge, construction site run-off and municipal wastewater collection, treatment and reuse.

•Our hazardous gas detection monitors are making industrial workplaces safer around the world.

•We build precision air quality instruments that measure common air pollutants (NOX, SO2, CO, ozone, PM10 and PM2.5) that are considered hazardous to human health and the environment.  Our instruments enable government agencies around the world to detect and monitor the quality of the air we breathe in real-time to assess their compliance with air quality regulations and ultimately reduce air pollution.  We provide the visible and infrared imaging sensors that enable NASA’s Orbiting Carbon Observatory 2 and GeoCarb missions that measure carbon dioxide and methane in the Earth’s atmosphere,

•Our floats, gliders and instruments assist climate research by providing access to accurate data, including subsurface temperatures and velocities of currents throughout the world’s oceans.  On a shorter timescale, scientists are employing our instruments and in particular our ocean gliders to provide essential inputs for computer models of dangerous storms, providing real-time information to save lives.  Our instruments enable scientists to forecast more accurately floods or droughts thereby allowing farmers to better plan for planting crops and providing irrigation.

•We work with maritime agencies around the world, preserving free and safe navigation of the world’s oceans.

•The oceans are increasingly threatened by floating plastics that are constantly moving.  We support ocean cleanup agencies with both airborne and space-based instruments that track and analyze the debris.

•We have products designed to improve the efficiency of motors, motor drives and industrial automation systems to reduce energy consumption.  Our line of motor drive analyzers measure performance dynamically.  The high-





resolution display and sensitive software tools enable engineers to look inside the motor and motor drive to optimize performance and energy efficiency.

Pursuant to the mandate in their respective charters, the audit committee of our board regularly reviews matters related to compliance with environmental laws and the health and safety of employees, and the nominating and governance committee of our board reviews and evaluates our policies and practices and monitors our efforts in areas of legal and social responsibility, diversity and sustainability.

Employees

We consider our relations with our employees to be good.  At December 29, 2019, our total workforce consisted of approximately 11,790 employees, of which approximately 7,150 employees were in the United States.

Ten current members of management have entered into change of control severance agreements. The agreements have a three-year, automatically renewing term, except as noted below. The executive is entitled to severance benefits if (1) there is a change in control of the Company and (2) within three months before or 24 months after the change in control, either we terminate the executive’s employment for reasons other than cause or the executive terminates the employment for good reason. “Severance benefits” currently consist of:

•A cash payment equal to three times in the case of Dr. Mehrabian or two times in the other cases the sum of (i) the executive’s highest annual base salary within the year preceding the change in control and (ii) the Annual Incentive Plan bonus target for the year in which the change in control occurs or the average actual bonus payout for the three years immediately preceding the change in control, whichever is higher.

•A cash payment for the current AIP bonus cycle based on the fraction of the year worked times the AIP target objectives at 100%.





•Payment in cash for unpaid performance share program awards, assuming applicable goals are met, at 120% of performance targets (100% of performance targets in some agreements).

•Continued equivalent health and welfare (e.g., medical, dental, vision, life insurance and disability) benefits at our expense for a period of up to 36 months (including Dr. Mehrabian) (24 months in some agreements, including Mr. Pichelli) after termination (with the executive bearing any portion of the cost the executive bore prior to the change in control); provided, however, such benefits would be discontinued to the extent the executive receives similar benefits from a subsequent employer.

•Removal of restrictions on restricted stock issued under our restricted stock award programs.

•Full vesting under the Company’s pension plans (within legal parameters) such that the executive shall be entitled to receive the full accrued benefit under all such plans in effect as of the date of the change in control, without any actuarial reduction for early payment.

•Up to $25,000 (including Dr. Mehrabian) ($15,000 in some agreements, including Mr. Pichelli) reimbursement for actual professional outplacement services.

•Immediate vesting of all stock options, with options being exercisable for the full remainder of the term.

•There is no “gross up payment” to hold the executive harmless against the impact, if any, of federal excise taxes imposed on executive as a result of “excess parachute” payments as defined in Section 280G of the Internal Revenue Code. The executive will receive the better of, on an after-tax basis, (a) the unreduced excess parachute payment with no tax gross up payment, or (b) a parachute payment reduced to a level below which an excise tax is imposed.

•Certain payments are deferred for six months following a separation of service to assure compliance with Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code.

The Company has entered into individual Indemnification Agreements with directors and certain officers and executives of Teledyne, including those members of Executive Management listed above. The Indemnification Agreements provide the directors and executives who are parties to the agreements with a stand-alone contractual right to indemnification and expense advancement to the greatest extent allowable under Delaware law. The Indemnification Agreements also provide:

•In a third-party proceeding, an indemnitee is entitled to indemnification if the indemnitee acted in good faith and in a manner he or she reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Company and, if in a criminal action or proceeding, if the indemnitee had no reason to believe that his or her conduct was unlawful. In a third-party proceeding, the indemnification obligation covers reasonable expenses, judgment fines, and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by the indemnity.

•In proceedings by or in the name of the Company (e.g., derivative suits), an indemnitee is entitled to indemnification if the indemnitee acted in good faith and in a manner he or she reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Company. In derivative suits, the indemnification obligation covers reasonable expenses, but in proceedings where the Company is alleging harm caused by the indemnitee, the indemnitee would generally not be entitled to be indemnified for judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement (otherwise the Company would effectively not recover any damages), unless a Delaware or other court determines otherwise despite the finding of liability.

•The Company has an obligation to advance, on an unsecured and interest free basis, reasonable expenses incurred by the indemnitee within 30 days of the indemnitee’s request. The indemnitee does not need to meet any standard of conduct to be entitled to advancement of expenses and there is no determination requirement to be made by the Board in connection with the advancements of expenses. An indemnity must repay any amounts advanced if it ultimately determined that the indemnity is not entitled to indemnification.

Our indemnification obligations do not cover the following situations: (1) where indemnification payments have been made under director’s and officer’s insurance or other indemnification provisions; (2) where the claim is based on disgorgement of short-swing profits under Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act; (3) where the claim is based on reimbursement by the indemnitee to the Company of a bonus or other incentive-based or equity-based compensation if required under the Exchange Act (e.g., in connection with a restatement as a result of the Company’s noncompliance with the financial reporting requirements required by Section 304 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act); or (4) where the proceeding is initiated by the indemnitee (other than proceedings that are consented to by the Board or that the indemnitee initiates against the Company to enforce the Agreement).

Under the Indemnification Agreements, in the event of a change in control or we reduce or do not renew our director’s and officer’s insurance coverage, we are required to purchase (or cause the acquirer or successor to the Company to purchase or maintain) a six-year tail policy, subject to a 200% premium cap. The agreements continue until the later of (i) 10 years after the indemnitee ceases to serve as a director or officer, and (ii) one year following the final termination of any proceeding subject to the agreement.
