Our Business Segments

Our businesses are divided into four segments: Instrumentation, Digital Imaging, Aerospace and Defense Electronics, and Engineered Systems. Financial information about our business segments can be found in Note 13 to our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Instrumentation

Our Instrumentation segment provides monitoring and control instruments for marine, environmental, industrial and other applications, as well as electronic test and measurement equipment.  We also provide power and communications connectivity devices for distributed instrumentation systems and sensor networks deployed in mission critical, harsh environments.









Marine Instrumentation

We offer a variety of products designed for use in harsh underwater environments, instruments that measure currents and other physical properties in the water column, systems that create acoustic images of objects beneath the water’s surface, including the bottom of a body of water, and sensors that determine the geologic structure below the bottom.  We also design and manufacture vehicles that utilize and transport these sensors over and beneath the water’s surface.

We design and manufacture geophysical streamer cables, hydrophones, seismic energy sources and specialty products used in offshore hydrocarbon exploration to locate oil and gas reserves beneath the ocean floor. Through our 2014 acquisition of Bolt, we are now a leading supplier of marine seismic energy sources and replacement parts for offshore energy exploration. Our Acoustic Doppler Current profilers (“ADCPs”) precisely measure currents at varying depths in oceans and rivers, and our Doppler Velocity Logs (“DVLs”) are used for navigation by civilian and military surface ships, unmanned underwater vehicles and naval divers. In addition to our DVLs, which are acoustic navigation devices, we design and manufacture inertial sensing and navigation products, as well as subsea pipe and cable detection systems for offshore energy, oceanographic and military marine markets.  With the 2013 acquisition of CDL Limited (“CDL”), we obtained additional subsea inertial sensing and navigation products, and our goal is to accelerate the development and deployment of real-time motion sensing and communication systems for our subsea oceanographic and oil and gas customers. With the 2014 acquisition of Oceanscience, we design and manufacture remotely-controlled and tethered instrumentation deployment vehicles used for current measurement, seafloor mapping and measurement of physical parameters such as salinity.

Additionally, we design and manufacture hydrographic survey instrumentation used in port surveys, dredging, pre- and post-installation of offshore energy infrastructure and other challenging underwater applications. Our multibeam sonar systems range from portable high-resolution systems used on autonomous underwater vehicles (“AUVs”) to full ocean depth vessel-mounted oceanographic systems. We offer 3D imaging systems for use from aircraft, fixed platforms, surface vessels and subsurface vessels over a wide range of distances and water depths.  Our multibeam sonar systems are used for creating highly accurate maps of underwater offshore constructions, wrecks or quay walls in harbors.  In particular, the multibeam sonars are used to produce high quality maps of the seafloor. With advanced imaging capabilities, our sonars create images of hidden structures on the seafloor and are also used for detecting underwater mineral deposits, gas and oil seeps streaming from the seabed. Sonars are used to create real-time images of the environment in the oceans and enable precise navigation of AUVs, which are essentially advanced robots navigating through the oceans autonomously.  Our products are being utilized in both commercial and defense applications where we provide systems for detecting mines in the water.

We provide a broad range of end-to-end undersea interconnect solutions to the offshore oil and gas, naval defense, oceanographic and telecom markets. We manufacture subsea, wet-mateable electrical and fiber-optic interconnect systems and subsea pressure vessel penetrators and connector systems with glass-to-metal seals. Our water-proof and splash-proof neoprene and glass reinforced epoxy connectors and cable assemblies are used in underwater equipment and submerged monitoring systems. Bolt, acquired in 2014, added high-reliability underwater cables and connectors, as well as related electronic controllers, monitoring systems and other auxiliary equipment. We also manufacture subsea and topside pipeline corrosion and erosion monitoring detectors as well as flow integrity monitoring solutions for the oil and gas industry. These flow assurance sensors and equipment rely on our wet-mateable interconnect systems and our sensor feed-through systems. Our Teledyne Oil & Gas group and Teledyne Scientific Company continue to work collaboratively to improve the reliability of materials exposed to ultra deep-sea conditions.

We offer a variety of marine instrumentation products used by the U.S. Navy and in energy exploration, oceanographic research and port and harbor security services. Our products include acoustic modems for networked underwater communication and sidescan and sub-bottom profiling sonar systems. Using our acoustic technology, we also provide quality control and package integrity systems under the Taptone®  brand to the food and beverage, personal care and pharmaceutical industries.

We manufacture complete autonomous underwater vehicle systems. Our marine gliders use a silent buoyancy engine for propulsion that takes advantage of changes in buoyancy in conjunction with wings and tail steering to convert vertical motion to horizontal displacement, thereby propelling the system on a programmed route with very low power consumption. Glider applications range from oceanographic research to military persistent surveillance systems as part of a mobile underwater sensing and communication network. The modular design of our battery-powered, man-portable Gavia™  AUV allows for rapid sensor bay reconfiguration and battery replacement capability. Our Slocum gliders, as well as our ADCPs, are being used as part of the National Science Foundation’s Ocean Observatories Initiative to collect physical, chemical, geological and biological data from the ocean and the seafloor on coastal, regional and global scales. Through the SeaBotix business, we design and manufacture Mini ROVs used in maritime security, search and rescue, aquaculture, and scientific research applications.









Environmental Instrumentation

We offer a wide range of products used for environmental monitoring, instruments that enable measurement and monitoring of key air environmental parameters as well as gas purity and content for industrial and manufacturing applications, sensors for the measurement and monitoring of the physical and chemical properties of untreated water, and laboratory systems that improve sample acquisition, handling, and preparation for analysis.

Test and Measurement Instrumentation

Since our August 2012 acquisition of LeCroy Corporation (“LeCroy”), we develop, manufacture, sell and license high-performance oscilloscopes and high speed protocol analyzers for various computer communication links.  We also provide related test and measurement equipment, probes, accessories and application solutions.  To a lesser extent, we provide extended warranty contracts, maintenance contracts and repairs and calibrations on our instruments after their warranties expire.

Our oscilloscopes are tools used by designers and engineers to measure and analyze complex electronic signals in order to develop high-performance systems, validate electronic designs and improve time to market. We offer eight families of real-time oscilloscopes, which address different needs: HDO4000/HDO6000, our 12-bit, high definition oscilloscopes; LabMaster 10 Zi-A; WaveMaster, our industry leading high-end oscilloscope family; WavePro, which is targeted at the mid-to high-range performance sector; WaveRunner, designed for the general purpose and bench-top sector; WaveSurfer designed for users in the lower bandwidth bench-top sector of the market; WaveJet, designed for value-oriented users in the  economy sector of the market; and WaveAce, our entry-level oscilloscope products. In addition to our real-time oscilloscopes, we have the WaveExpert family of sampling oscilloscopes and modules.  In 2014, we released the world’s first 100GHz real-time scope, aimed at applications such as high speed optical communications, and we extended our line of 12 bit oscilloscopes to include an eight channel product with specialized capabilities for analyzing power and efficiency of motors and the associated drive circuitry. In collaboration with Teledyne Scientific Company, we also completed the design of a next generation indium phosphide (“InP”) chip.  The integrated circuit represents the first device in an expansive chip set planned for future generations of high speed oscilloscopes.

Our protocol analyzers are used by designers and engineers to reliably and accurately monitor communications traffic and diagnose operational problems in a variety of communications devices to ensure that they comply with industry standards.









Our test and measurement products are sold into a broad range of industry sectors, including computer, semiconductor, consumer electronics, data storage, automotive, industrial, military, aerospace and telecommunications. We believe designers in all of these industry sectors are developing products which rely on increasingly complex electronic signals to provide the features and performance their customers require.

Digital Imaging

Our Digital Imaging segment includes high performance sensors, cameras and systems, within the visible, infrared, ultraviolet and X-ray spectra for use in industrial, government and medical applications, as well as micro electro-mechanical systems (“MEMS”). It also includes our sponsored and centralized research laboratories benefiting government programs and businesses.

We design, develop and manufacture image capture products, primarily consisting of high performance image sensors and digital cameras for use in industrial, scientific, medical and professional applications. We also design, develop and manufacture image processing products, primarily consisting of hardware and software for image processing in industrial and medical applications.   We continue to develop high-resolution, low dose X-ray sensors for medical, dental and industrial applications.  Our high performance image sensors utilize both charge coupled device (“CCD”) and complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (“CMOS”) technology.  In particular, our CMOS image sensing technology is used in our large flat panel detectors for X-ray imaging and in some of our sensors used for industrial machine vision applications.  Our image processing software allows original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”) and systems integrators to develop vision applications using our image acquisition and processing hardware. Our smart camera products are user-friendly, cost-effective vision appliances for task-specific factory floor applications such as gauging, high-precision alignment, inspection, assembly verification and machine guidance. Unlike our OEM imaging products, this category of cameras is designed to be quickly deployed by technicians on the factory floor.

Additionally, we produce and provide manufacturing services for MEMS and high voltage CMOS devices and complete integrated circuit (“IC”) products. The majority of our semiconductor manufacturing capacity is consumed by external customers with the remaining capacity applied towards supplying unique CCD and microbolometer fabrication services for our internal image sensor requirements.

Our Digital Imaging segment also provides Light Detection and Ranging (“LIDAR”) systems for airborne terrestrial mapping, mobile mapping, bathymetry and laser-based 3D imaging applications through our majority-owned subsidiary, Optech.  These imaging and mapping systems are used by commercial and government customers serving energy, natural resources and infrastructure applications.

We provide research and engineering capabilities primarily in the areas of electronics, materials, optical systems, and information science to military, aerospace and industrial customers, as well as to various businesses throughout Teledyne. We receive funding from the Defense Advanced Research Products Agency (“DARPA”), the Intelligence Advanced Projects Research Activity (“IARPA”), and various other U.S. Department of Defense funding agencies, and we collaborate with researchers at universities and national laboratories to stay at the forefront of emerging technologies. We have developed high speed electronics, MEMS sensors and actuators, advanced functional and structural materials, liquid-crystal based optical devices, and image processing algorithms.

We produce advanced focal plane arrays, sensors, and subsystems that cover a broad spectrum of frequencies from X-ray wavelengths to 18 micron long-wave infrared wavelengths. We develop imaging process algorithms and manufacture compact mid-wave and short-wave infrared camera systems.  We are a leader in the development and production of large format focal plane array sensors for both military and space science markets.

We deliver advanced imaging solutions to the U.S. Department of Defense, NASA, prime system integrators, foreign space agencies and commercial customers.  Our sensor technologies are on the Hubble Space Telescope and weather satellites, are orbiting the moon and Mars, are on the way to Pluto and asteroid missions, and can be found at major ground-based telescopes.  In the U.S. defense arena, our sensors are integrated into several major systems for space surveillance, persistent surveillance, chemical detection and target identification, among others.  We have developed various sensors, subassemblies and cameras for air- and ground-based applications.  We have developed infrared cameras and hyperspectral sensors for unmanned aerial vehicles. We also design and manufacture advanced military laser protection eyewear.  Finally, we develop low-noise, high performance cameras for use in laboratory instruments.











Aerospace and Defense Electronics

Our Aerospace and Defense Electronics segment provides sophisticated electronic components and subsystems and communications products, including defense electronics, harsh environment interconnects, data acquisition and communications equipment for aircraft, and components and subsystems for wireless and satellite communications, as well as general aviation batteries.

Over the years, principally through focused acquisitions, we have expanded our microwave components and subsystems business with a goal of providing more highly integrated microwave subsystems and solutions to our customers. Historically, we designed and manufactured helix traveling wave tubes, commonly called TWTs, used to provide broadband power amplification of microwave signals. Military applications include radar, electronic warfare and satellite communication. We make TWTs for commercial applications as well, such as electromagnetic compatibility test equipment and satellite communication terminals. More recently, we have designed and delivered high power solid state TWT replacement amplifiers and complete amplifiers that incorporate a TWT and a power supply.

We design and manufacture solid state radio frequency (“RF”) and microwave components and subassemblies used in a wide variety of applications.  As components which form the building blocks for electronic systems, we produce amplifiers, voltage-controlled oscillators, YIGs, BAWs, low noise amplifiers (“LNAs”), microwave mixers, and detectors using LDMOS, GaAs, GaN, InP, and SiC technologies.  These components form the basis for our line of solid state power amplifiers, RF converters, and modems which are used in systems that provide communications links between ground stations, mobile units, UAVs, and orbiting satellites. Such products are also used in mobile telephone, TV broadcast and commercial data communications networks.  In addition, some of our products are modified to design and manufacture higher level subsystems including: UAV, mobile, and fixed location radar transmitters and receivers; test and measurement systems; and Instantaneous Frequency Measurement (“IFM”)-based systems and subsystems.  The latter includes integrated frequency locked sources and set-on receiver jammers used for the U.S. Navy and Air Force training.

We supply a variety of connectors and cable assemblies, including specialized high voltage connectors and subassemblies and coax microwave cable and connectors, for defense, aerospace and industrial applications. We also provide custom, high-reliability bulk wire and cable assemblies to a number of marine, environmental and industrial markets. Additionally, we produce pilot helmet mounted display components and subsystems for the Joint Helmet Mounted Cueing System (“JHMCS”) used in the F-15, F-16 and F-18 aircrafts. The JHMCS system is a multi-role system designed to enhance pilot situational awareness and provides visual control of aircraft targeting systems and sensors. We manufacture microprocessor-controlled aircraft ejection seat sequencers and related support elements to military aircraft programs. We continue to pursue the development of electronic safe and arm devices for use in a number of military applications.

We provide specialty electronic manufacturing services. We develop and manufacture custom microelectronic modules that provide both high reliability and extremely dense packaging for military applications.

We also continue to work on advanced technology for small turbine engines and components for programs sponsored by the U.S. Air Force Research Laboratory.









Customers

We have hundreds of customers in the various industries we serve. No commercial customer accounted for more than 10% of our total sales, nor more than 10% of any segment sales, during2014,2013or2012.  Our largest commercial customer, a customer of our Instrumentation segment, accounted for2.8%,3.6%and3.4%of total sales in2014,2013and2012, respectively.

Sales to international customers accounted for approximately45%of total sales in2014, compared with44%in2013and39%in2012. In2014, we sold products to customers in over 100 foreign countries. Approximately 90% of our sales to foreign-based customers were made to customers in 24 foreign countries. The2014top five countries for international sales were theUnited Kingdom,Norway,China,GermanyandSouth Koreaand constituted approximately21%of our total sales.

Approximately25%,27%and32%of our total sales for2014,2013and2012, respectively, were derived from contracts with agencies of, and prime contractors to, the U.S. Government. Information on our sales to the U.S. Government, including direct sales as a prime contractor and indirect sales as a subcontractor, is as follows (in millions):

201420132012Instrumentation$38.6$40.6$39.9Digital Imaging102.2120.2128.8Aerospace and Defense Electronics245.3260.2269.9Engineered Systems221.8209.2245.4Total U.S. Government sales$607.9$630.2$684.0

Our principal U.S. Government customer is the U.S. Department of Defense. These sales represented20%,21%and26%of our total sales for2014,2013and2012, respectively. In 2014 and 2013, our largest program with the U.S. Government was the Objective Simulation Framework contract with the Missile Defense Agency, which represented 1.3% and 1.4% of our total sales, respectively.  In 2012, our largest program with the U.S. Government was the Systems Development and Operations Support contract with NASA’s Marshall Space Flight Center, which represented 1.9% of our total sales in 2012.

As described under risk factors, there are risks associated with doing business with the U.S. Government. In2014, approximately58%of our U.S. Government prime contracts and subcontracts were fixed-price type contracts, compared to60%in2013and59%in2012. Under these types of contracts, we bear the inherent risk that actual performance cost may exceed the fixed contract price. Such contracts are typically not subject to renegotiation of profits if we fail to anticipate technical problems, estimate costs accurately or control costs during performance. Additionally, U.S. Government contracts are subject to termination by the U.S. Government at its convenience, without identification of any default. When contracts are terminated for convenience, we typically recover costs incurred or committed, settlement expenses and profit on work completed prior to termination. We hadthreeU.S. Government contracts terminated for convenience in2014, compared withfourin2013andsixin2012.

Our total backlog of confirmed orders was approximately$944.6 millionatDecember 28, 2014, compared with$941.2 millionatDecember 29, 2013, and$952.5 millionatDecember 30, 2012. We expect to fulfill99%of such backlog of confirmed orders during2015.

Raw Materials and Suppliers

Generally, our businesses have experienced minimal fluctuations in the supply of raw materials, but not without some price volatility. While some of our businesses provide services, for those businesses that sell hardware and product, a portion of the value that we provide is labor oriented, such as design, engineering, assembly and test activities. In manufacturing our products, we use our own production capabilities and also third party suppliers and subcontractors, including international sources. Some of the items we use for the manufacture of our products, including certain gyro components for some marine navigation applications, certain magnets and helix wire for our traveling wave tubes and certain infrared detectors substrates, certain ceramics and molding compounds used in our sonar systems, as well as certain scintillator materials use in the production of our X-ray detectors, are purchased from limited or single sources, including international sources, due to technical capability, price and other factors. While over the years we have not experienced much difficulty in procuring raw materials, components, sub-assemblies and other supplies required in our manufacturing processes, disruption in the global economy and financial markets could trigger increased pricing or otherwise affect our suppliers and negatively impact our ability to procure such supplies.









Sales and Marketing

Our sales and marketing approach varies by segment and by products within our segments. A shared fundamental tenet is the commitment to work closely with our customers to understand their needs, with an aim to secure preferred supplier and longer-term relationships.

Our segments use a combination of internal sales forces, distributors and commissioned sales representatives to market and sell our products and services.  Our Teledyne Instruments companies and other businesses have been working over the years to consolidate or share internal sales and servicing efforts.  Several Teledyne businesses have been marketing and selling products collaboratively to similar customers to promote “one-stop” shopping under singular “brand” names, including Teledyne Oil & Gas, Teledyne Marine, Teledyne Nuclear, Teledyne Water Quality and Teledyne Microwave Solutions.

Products are also advertised in appropriate trade journals and by means of various websites. To promote our products and other capabilities, our personnel regularly participate in relevant trade shows and professional associations.

Many of our government contracts are awarded after a competitive bidding process in which we seek to emphasize our ability to provide superior products and technical solutions in addition to competitive pricing.

Through Teledyne Technologies International Corp. and other subsidiaries, we have established offices in foreign countries to facilitate international sales for various businesses. Locations include Brazil, China, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Malaysia, Singapore, South Korea, Switzerland and the United Arab Emirates.

Competition

We believe that technological capabilities and innovation and the ability to invest in the development of new and enhanced products are critical to obtaining and maintaining leadership in our markets and the industries in which we compete. Although we have certain advantages that we believe help us compete effectively in our markets, each of our markets is highly competitive.  Because of the diversity of products sold and the number of markets we serve, we encounter a wide variety of competitors, none of which we believe offer all of the same product and service lines or serve all of the same markets as we do.  Our businesses vigorously compete on the basis of quality, product performance and reliability, technical expertise, price and service. Many of our competitors have, and potential competitors could have, greater name recognition, a larger installed base of products, more extensive engineering, manufacturing, marketing and distribution capabilities and greater financial, technological and personnel resources than we do.

Research and Development

Our research and development efforts primarily involve engineering and design related to improving existing products and developing new products and technologies in the same or similar fields. We spent a total of$428.8 millionin2014,$388.2 millionin2013and$364.2 millionin2012on research and development and bid and proposal costs. Customer-funded research and development, most of which was attributable to work under contracts with the U.S. Government, represented approximately61%of total research and development costs for2014, compared with57%of total research and development costs for2013and64%in2012.

Thirteen current members of management (including the named executives) have entered into change of control severance agreements. The agreements have a three-year, automatically renewing term, except as noted below. The executive is entitled to severance benefits if (1) there is a change in control of the Company and (2) within three months before or 24 months after the change in control, either we terminate the executive’s employment for reasons other than cause or the executive terminates the employment for good reason. “Severance benefits” currently consist of:



•A cash payment equal to three times in the case of Dr. Mehrabian or two times in the other cases the sum of (i) the executive’s highest annual base salary within the year preceding the change in control and (ii) the Annual Incentive Plan bonus target for the year in which the change in control occurs or the average actual bonus payout for the three years immediately preceding the change in control, whichever is higher.

•A cash payment for the current Annual Incentive Plan bonus cycle based on the fraction of the year worked times the Annual Incentive Plan target objectives at 100%.

•Payment in cash for unpaid performance share program awards, assuming applicable goals are met at 120% of performance targets.

•Continued equivalent health and welfare (e.g., medical, dental, vision, life insurance and disability) benefits at our expense for a period of up to 36 months (24 months in some agreements) after termination (with the executive bearing any portion of the cost the executive bore prior to the change in control); provided, however, such benefits would be discontinued to the extent the executive receives similar benefits from a subsequent employer.

•Removal of restrictions on restricted stock issued under our restricted stock award programs.

•Full vesting under the Company’s pension plans (within legal parameters) such that the executive shall be entitled to receive the full accrued benefit under all such plans in effect as of the date of the change in control, without any actuarial reduction for early payment.









•Up to $25,000 ($15,000 in some agreements) reimbursement for actual professional outplacement services.

•Immediate vesting of all stock options, with options being exercisable for the full remainder of the term.

•There is no “gross up payment” to hold the executive harmless against the impact, if any, of federal excise taxes imposed on executive as a result of “excess parachute” payments as defined in Section 280G of the Internal Revenue Code. The executive will receive the better of, on an after-tax basis, (a) the unreduced excess parachute payment with no tax gross up payment, or (b) a parachute payment reduced to a level below which an excise tax is imposed.

•Certain payments are deferred for six months following a separation of service to assure compliance with Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code.

The Company has entered into individual Indemnification Agreements with directors and certain officers and executives of Teledyne, including those members of Executive Management listed above. The Indemnification Agreements provide the directors and executives who are parties to the agreements with a stand-alone contractual right to indemnification and expense advancement to the greatest extent allowable under Delaware law. The Indemnification Agreements also provide:

•In a third-party proceeding, an indemnitee is entitled to indemnification if the indemnitee acted in good faith and in a manner he or she reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Company and, if in a criminal action or proceeding, if the indemnitee had no reason to believe that his or her conduct was unlawful. In a third party proceeding, the indemnification obligation covers reasonable expenses, judgment fines, and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by the indemnity.

•In proceedings by or in the name of the Company (e.g., derivative suits), an indemnitee is entitled to indemnification if the indemnitee acted in good faith and in a manner he or she reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Company. In derivative suits, the indemnification obligation covers reasonable expenses, but in proceedings where the Company is alleging harm caused by the indemnitee, the indemnitee would generally not be entitled to be indemnified for judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement (otherwise the Company would effectively not recover any damages), unless perhaps a Delaware or other court determines otherwise despite the finding of liability.

•The Company has an obligation to advance, on an unsecured and interest free basis, reasonable expenses incurred by the indemnitee within 30 days of the indemnitee’s request. The indemnitee does not need to meet any standard of conduct to be entitled to advancement of expenses and there is no determination requirement to be made by the Board in connection with the advancements of expenses. An indemnity must repay any amounts advanced if it ultimately determined that the indemnity is not entitled to indemnification.

Our indemnification obligations do not cover the following situations: (1) where indemnification payments have been made under director’s and officer’s insurance or other indemnification provisions; (2) where the claim is based on disgorgement of short-swing profits under Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act; (3) where the claim is based on reimbursement by the indemnitee to the Company of a bonus or other incentive-based or equity-based compensation if required under the Exchange Act (e.g., in connection with a restatement as a result of the company’s noncompliance with the financial reporting requirements required by Section 304 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act); or (4) where the proceeding is initiated by the indemnitee (other than proceedings that are consented to by the Board or that the indemnitee initiates against the Company to enforce the Agreement).

Under the Indemnification Agreements, in the event of a change in control or we reduce or do not renew our director’s and officer’s insurance coverage, we are required to purchase (or cause the acquirer or successor to the Company to purchase or maintain) a six-year tail policy, subject to a 200% premium cap. The agreements continue until the later of (i) 10 years after the indemnitee ceases to serve as a director or officer, and (ii) one year following the final termination of any proceeding subject to the agreement.
