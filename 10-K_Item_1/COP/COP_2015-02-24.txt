Items 1 and 2. BUSINESS AND PROPERTIES

CORPORATE STRUCTURE

ConocoPhillips is the world’s largest independent exploration and production (E&P) company, based on proved reserves and production of liquids and
natural gas. ConocoPhillips was incorporated in the state of Delaware on November 16, 2001, in connection with, and in anticipation of, the merger between Conoco Inc. and Phillips Petroleum Company. The merger between Conoco and Phillips was
consummated on August 30, 2002.

In April 2012 the ConocoPhillips Board of Directors approved the separation of our downstream business into an
independent, publicly traded energy company, Phillips 66. Each ConocoPhillips stockholder received one share of Phillips 66 stock for every two shares of ConocoPhillips stock held at the close of business on the record date of April 16, 2012.
The separation was completed on April 30, 2012, and activities related to Phillips 66 have been treated as discontinued operations for all periods prior to the separation.

In 2012 we agreed to sell our interest in the North Caspian Sea Production Sharing Agreement (Kashagan) and our Nigeria and Algeria businesses
(collectively, the “Disposition Group”). We sold our Nigeria business in the third quarter of 2014, and we sold Kashagan and our Algeria business in the fourth quarter of 2013. Results for the Disposition Group have been reported as
discontinued operations in all periods presented. For additional information on all discontinued operations, see Note 2—Discontinued Operations, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Headquartered in Houston, Texas, we have operations and activities in 27 countries. Our key focus areas include safely operating producing assets, executing
major developments and exploring for new resources in promising areas. Our portfolio includes resource-rich North American shale and oil sands assets; lower-risk legacy assets in North America, Europe, Asia and Australia; several major international
developments; and a growing inventory of global conventional and unconventional exploration prospects.

At December 31, 2014, ConocoPhillips
employed approximately 19,100 people worldwide.







SEGMENT AND GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION

For operating segment and geographic information, see Note 23—Segment Disclosures and Related Information, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements, which is incorporated herein by reference.

We explore for, produce, transport and market crude oil, bitumen, natural gas, liquefied natural
gas (LNG) and natural gas liquids on a worldwide basis. At December 31, 2014, our continuing operations were producing in the United States, Norway, the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, Timor-Leste, Indonesia, China, Malaysia, Qatar, Libya
and Russia.

The information listed below appears in the “Oil and Gas Operations” disclosures following the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements and is incorporated herein by reference:



•Proved worldwide crude oil, natural gas liquids, natural gas and bitumen reserves.

•Net production of crude oil, natural gas liquids, natural gas and bitumen.

•Average sales prices of crude oil, natural gas liquids, natural gas and bitumen.

•Average production costs per barrel of oil equivalent (BOE).

•Net wells completed, wells in progress and productive wells.

•Developed and undeveloped acreage.

The following table is a summary of the proved reserves information
included in the “Oil and Gas Operations” disclosures following the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Approximately 84 percent of our proved reserves are located in politically stable countries that belong to the Organization for
Economic Cooperation and Development. Natural gas reserves are converted to BOE based on a 6:1 ratio: six thousand cubic feet of natural gas converts to one BOE. See Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations for a discussion of factors that will enhance the understanding of the following summary reserves table.

Total production from continuing operations, including Libya, was 1,540 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day
(MBOED) in 2014, compared with 1,502 MBOED in 2013, an increase of 3 percent. Average liquids production increased 4 percent over the same period. The increase in total average production in 2014 primarily resulted from additional production from
major developments, mainly from shale plays in the Lower 48 and the ramp up of production from Jasmine in the United Kingdom and Christina Lake in Canada, and increased drilling programs, mostly in the Lower 48, western Canada and Norway. These
increases were largely offset by normal field decline, higher planned downtime, shut-in Libya production due to the closure of the Es Sider crude oil export terminal, and unfavorable market impacts. Excluding Libya, production from continuing
operations was 1,532 MBOED in 2014, compared with 1,472 MBOED in 2013, an increase of 60 MBOED, or 4 percent.

Our total average realized price
from continuing operations was $64.59 per BOE in 2014, a decrease of 4 percent compared with $67.62 per BOE in 2013, which reflected lower average realized prices for crude oil and natural gas liquids, partly offset by higher bitumen and
natural gas prices. Our worldwide annual average crude oil sales price from continuing operations decreased 10 percent in 2014, from $103.32 per barrel in 2013 to $92.80 per barrel in 2014. Additionally, our worldwide average annual natural gas
liquids prices from continuing operations decreased 6 percent, from $41.42 per barrel in 2013 to $38.99 per barrel in 2014. Our average annual worldwide natural gas sales price from continuing operations increased 8 percent, from $6.11 per
thousand cubic feet in 2013 to $6.57 per thousand cubic feet in 2014. Average annual bitumen prices increased 3 percent, from $53.27 per barrel in 2013 to $55.13 per barrel in 2014.







ALASKA

The Alaska segment primarily explores for, produces, transports and markets crude oil, natural gas liquids, natural gas and LNG. We are the largest crude
oil and natural gas producer in Alaska and have major ownership interests in two of North America’s largest oil fields located on Alaska’s North Slope: Prudhoe Bay and Kuparuk. We also have a significant operating interest in the Alpine
Field, located on the Western North Slope. Additionally, we are one of Alaska’s largest owners of state and federal exploration leases, with approximately 0.9 million net undeveloped acres at year-end 2014. Approximately 0.4 million
of these acres are located in the National Petroleum Reserve—Alaska (NPRA) and 0.3 million are located in the Chukchi Sea. In 2014 Alaska operations contributed 20 percent of our worldwide liquids production and 1 percent of our natural
gas production.

*Thousandsof barrels per day.

**Millionsof cubic feet per day.

Greater Prudhoe Area

The Greater Prudhoe Area includes the Prudhoe Bay Field and five satellite fields, as well as the Greater Point McIntyre Area fields. Prudhoe Bay, the
largest oil field on Alaska’s North Slope, is the site of a large waterflood and enhanced oil recovery operation, as well as a gas plant which processes natural gas for reinjection into the reservoir. Prudhoe Bay’s satellites are Aurora,
Borealis, Polaris, Midnight Sun and Orion, while the Point McIntyre, Niakuk, Raven and Lisburne fields are part of the Greater Point McIntyre Area.

Greater Kuparuk Area

We operate the Greater
Kuparuk Area, which consists of the Kuparuk Field and four satellite fields: Tarn, Tabasco, Meltwater and West Sak. Kuparuk is located 40 miles west of Prudhoe Bay. Field installations include three central production facilities which separate oil,
natural gas and water, as well as a separate seawater treatment plant. Development drilling at Kuparuk consists of rotary-drilled wells and horizontal multi-laterals from existing well bores utilizing coiled-tubing drilling.

The successful Shark Tooth delineation well extended the known Kuparuk accumulation to the southwestern area of the Kuparuk Field where construction of
Drill Site 2S is progressing. The project was sanctioned in October 2014. First production is estimated in late 2015, with net peak production estimated at 5 MBOED in 2017.

In 2014 we received regulatory approvals to advance oil development targeting the West Sak reservoir in the Kuparuk River Unit. Pending a final investment
decision, the development, 1H Northeast West Sak (NEWS), will include a nine-acre extension to an existing drill site allowing for new wells and associated facilities. We anticipate first production in 2017.

Western North Slope

On the Western North
Slope, we operate the Colville River Unit, which includes the Alpine Field and three satellite fields: Nanuq, Fiord and Qannik. Alpine is located 34 miles west of Kuparuk. Construction is progressing on Alpine West CD5, a new drill site which will
extend the Alpine reservoir west into the NPRA. Initial production is anticipated in late 2015, with net peak production estimated at 10 MBOED in 2016.







The Greater Mooses Tooth Unit, the first unit established entirely within the NPRA, was formed in 2008. In 2014
we progressed development planning for the Greater Mooses Tooth #1 (GMT1) drill site. Delays in federal permitting and requirements, in addition to the current low commodity price environment, have resulted in deferral of the final investment
decision. We plan to shoot seismic and continue engineering in 2015. GMT1 is planned to be connected by road to the CD5 drill site, and production will be transported by pipeline to the existing Alpine facilities for processing. We are evaluating
further exploration and development potential in the NPRA.

Cook Inlet Area

We operate the North Cook Inlet Unit, the Beluga River Unit, and the Kenai LNG Facility in the Cook Inlet Area. We have a 100 percent interest in the North
Cook Inlet Unit and the Kenai LNG Facility, while we own 33.3 percent of the Beluga River Unit. Our share of production from the units is primarily sold to local utilities and is also used to supply feedstock to the Kenai LNG Plant.

The Kenai LNG Facility includes a 1.6 million-tons-per-year capacity plant, as well as docking and loading facilities for LNG tankers. LNG from the
plant has historically been transported and sold to utility companies in Japan. The plant was idled in late-2012; however, due to a change in market conditions, including additional gas supplies, we were granted a two-year export license from the
U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) in April 2014 to export up to 40 billion cubic feet of LNG from the facility. As a result, we shipped 5 cargoes of LNG from the Kenai Facility to Asia in 2014.

Point Thomson

We own a 5 percent interest in
the Point Thomson Unit, which is located approximately 60 miles east of Prudhoe Bay. An initial production system is anticipated to be online by 2016, which is estimated to send 400 net BOED of condensate through the Trans-Alaska Pipeline
System (TAPS).

Alaska LNG (AKLNG)

During
2012 we, along with affiliates of Exxon Mobil Corporation, BP p.l.c. and TransCanada Corporation (collectively, the “AKLNG co-venturers”), began evaluating a potential LNG project which would liquefy and export natural gas from
Alaska’s North Slope and deliver it to market. The AKLNG Project concept is an integrated LNG project consisting of a liquefaction plant, including marine terminal facilities and auxiliary marine vessels, located in south-central Alaska; a
natural gas treatment plant, located on the North Slope; and an estimated 800-mile natural gas pipeline, which would connect the two plants.

Significant engineering, technical, regulatory, fiscal, commercial and permitting issues would need to be resolved prior to a
final investment decision on the potential $45 billion to $65 billion (gross) project.







Exploration

In 2014 we drilled two exploration wells within the Greater Mooses Tooth Unit: the Rendezvous 3 and Flattop-1. Potential development of the Rendezvous 3 area
is under evaluation. Flattop-1 encountered hydrocarbons but was expensed. The well is temporarily abandoned and available for testing in the future. In 2013 we drilled in the Cassin Prospect, located in the Bear Tooth Unit in the northeast NPRA, and
we are continuing to evaluate development options. The Moraine Prospect, located on the western flank of the Kuparuk Field, was tested in 2013 and began producing in 2014.

Transportation

We transport the petroleum
liquids produced on the North Slope to south-central Alaska through an800-milepipeline that is part of TAPS. We have a 29.1 percent ownership interest in TAPS, and we also have ownership interests in
the Alpine, Kuparuk and Oliktok pipelines on the North Slope.

Our wholly owned subsidiary, Polar Tankers, Inc., manages the marine transportation of
our North Slope production, using five company-owned, double-hulled tankers, and charters third-party vessels as necessary. The tankers primarily deliver oil from Valdez, Alaska, to refineries on the west coast of the United States.

LOWER 48

The Lower 48 segment
consists of operations located in the U.S. Lower 48 states and exploration activities in the Gulf of Mexico. The Lower 48 business is organized within four regions covering the Gulf Coast, Mid-Continent, Rockies and San Juan. As a result of
increasing shale opportunities, we have directed our investments toward certain higher-margin, liquids-rich plays. We hold 15 million net onshore and offshore acres in the Lower 48. In 2014 the Lower 48 contributed 32 percent of our worldwide
liquids production and 38 percent of our natural gas production.

Onshore

We hold 13 million net acres of onshore conventional and unconventional acreage in the Lower 48, the majority of which is either held by production or
owned by the Company. Our unconventional holdings total approximately 2.7 million net acres in the following areas:



•900,000 net acres in the San Juan Basin, located in northwestern New Mexico and southwestern Colorado;

•619,000 net acres in the Bakken, located in North Dakota and Eastern Montana;

•216,000 net acres in the Eagle Ford, located in South Texas;

•186,000 net acres in the Permian, located in West Texas and southeastern New Mexico;

•123,000 net acres in the Niobrara, located in northeastern Colorado;

•65,000 net acres in the Barnett, located in north central Texas; and

•578,000 net acres in other unconventional exploration plays.

The majority of our 2014 onshore production
originated from the Eagle Ford, San Juan, Permian and Bakken. Onshore activities in 2014 were centered mostly on continued development and optimization of emerging and existing assets, with an emphasis on areas with higher-margin, liquids-rich
production, particularly in growing unconventional plays. Our major focus areas in 2014 included the following:



•Eagle Ford—The Eagle Ford transitioned into full field development in 2014, with the majority of the development program being drilled on multi-well pads. We operated 12 rigs throughout the majority of 2014,
resulting in 196 operated wells drilled and 199 operated wells connected. In 2014 we also increased production by 30 percent compared with 2013, and we achieved net peak production of 179 MBOED, compared with 141 MBOED in 2013.

•Bakken—The Bakken continued to experience a significant increase in activity in 2014, as we drilled 129 operated wells during the year and brought 137 operated wells online. We also operated 10 or more drilling
rigs throughout the year and improved our efficiency with pad drilling. As a result, we achieved net peak production of more than 63 MBOED in 2014, compared with 43 MBOED in 2013.

•San Juan Basin—The San Juan Basin includes significant conventional gas production, which yields approximately 30 percent natural gas liquids, as well as the majority of our U.S. coalbed methane (CBM) production.
We hold approximately 1.3 million net acres of oil and gas leases by production in San Juan, where we continue to pursue select conventional development opportunities. This also includes approximately 900,000 net unconventional acres of lease
rights.

•Permian Basin—The Permian Basin is another area where we are leveraging our conventional legacy position by utilizing new technology to improve the ultimate recovery and value from these fields. This technology
should also identify new, unconventional plays across the region. We hold approximately 1.1 million net acres in the Permian, which includes 186,000 net unconventional acres.

Gulf of Mexico

At year-end 2014, our
portfolio of producing properties in the Gulf of Mexico primarily consisted of one operated field and three fields operated by co-venturers, including:



•75 percent operated working interest in the Magnolia Field in Garden Banks Blocks 783 and 784.

•15.9 percent nonoperated working interest in the unitized Ursa Field located in the Mississippi Canyon Area.

•15.9 percent nonoperated working interest in the Princess Field, a northern, subsalt extension of the Ursa Field.

•12.4 percent nonoperated working interest in the unitized K2 Field, comprised of seven blocks in the Green Canyon Area.







Exploration



•Conventional Exploration

At December 31, 2014, we
held approximately 2.1 million net acres in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico.

We own a 30 percent nonoperated working interest in the
Shenandoah discovery. The results of the first Shenandoah appraisal well were announced in 2013 and confirmed Shenandoah as a significant oil discovery. The second Shenandoah down dip appraisal well was spud in 2014 and expensed as a dry hole.
Planning is underway for the next appraisal well, which is expected to spud in the second quarter of 2015.

As of December 2014, we
owned a 35 percent nonoperated interest in the Gila Prospect and a 100 percent interest in one Gibson Prospect block, both located in the Keathley Canyon area of the Gulf of Mexico. In January 2015 we entered into an exchange agreement with
Chevron Corporation and BP p.l.c. to align working interests in order to progress a hub development. As a result, our interests in both the Gila and the Gibson prospects were adjusted to 30 percent. The Gila exploration well was announced as a
discovery in 2013 and is currently being appraised.

Other ongoing drilling activities at the end of 2014 included a Tiber appraisal
well, in which we own an 18 percent working interest.

The nonoperated Coronado wildcat and appraisal wells and the Deep Nansen wildcat
well were declared dry holes in 2014.

In support of our Gulf of Mexico exploration program, we secured access to two new-build
deepwater drillships. The first drillship commenced drilling on our operated Harrier Prospect in February 2015, and we anticipate delivery of the second drillship during 2015. Both will provide rig availability for our operated drilling program. We
expect to drill two wells in 2015 utilizing the first drillship.



•Unconventional Exploration

In 2014 we actively pursued the exploration and
appraisal of our existing unconventional resource plays, including the Niobrara play in the Denver-Julesburg Basin, and the Wolfcamp and Bone Springs plays in the Delaware Basin. During 2014 we acquired approximately 13,000 net additional acres in
various resource plays across the Lower 48, which included the Permian, Niobrara and Eagle Ford plays, maintaining our significant acreage position in Lower 48 shale plays of approximately 2.7 million net acres. During 2014 we drilled a total
of 36 unconventional exploration wells in the Niobrara play and the Delaware Basin.

In 2015 we plan to continue to explore and appraise
certain unconventional plays and assess new unconventional opportunities, but at a slower pace in anticipation of weak 2015 commodity prices.

Facilities

Freeport LNG Terminal

In July 2013 we agreed with Freeport LNG Development, L.P. to terminate our long-term agreement to use 0.9 billion cubic feet per day of regasification
capacity at Freeport’s 1.5-billion-cubic-feet-per-day LNG receiving terminal in Quintana, Texas. The termination agreement was subject to Freeport LNG obtaining regulatory approval and project financing for an LNG liquefaction and export
facility in Texas, in which we are not a participant. These conditions were satisfied in the fourth quarter of 2014, and we paid Freeport LNG a termination fee of $522 million. Freeport LNG repaid the outstanding ConocoPhillips loan used by Freeport
LNG to partially fund the original construction of the terminal. These transactions, plus miscellaneous items, resulted in a one-time net cash outflow of $63 million for us. In addition, we recognized an after-tax charge to earnings of $540
million in the fourth quarter of 2014, and our terminal regasification capacity has been reduced from 0.9 billion cubic feet per day to 0.4 billion cubic feet per day, until July 1, 2016, at which time it







will be reduced to zero. As a result of this transaction, we anticipate saving approximately $50 to $60 million per year in costs over the next 18 years. For additional information, see Note
3—Variable Interest Entities (VIEs), in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Golden Pass LNG Terminal

We have a 12.4 percent ownership interest in the Golden Pass LNG Terminal and affiliated Golden Pass Pipeline, with a combined net book value of
approximately $290 million at December 31, 2014. It is located adjacent to the Sabine-Neches Industrial Ship Channel northwest of Sabine Pass, Texas. The terminal became commercially operational in May 2011. We hold terminal and pipeline
capacity for the receipt, storage and regasification of the LNG purchased from Qatargas 3 and the transportation of regasified LNG to interconnect with major interstate natural gas pipelines. Utilization of the terminal has been and is expected to
be limited, as market conditions currently favor the flow of LNG to European and Asian markets. As a result, we are evaluating opportunities to optimize the value of the terminal facilities.

Great Northern Iron Ore Properties Trust

ConocoPhillips holds the reversionary interest in the Great Northern Iron Ore Properties trust (the Trust), a grantor trust that owns mineral interests in
the Mesabi Iron Range in northeastern Minnesota and certain other personal property. Pursuant to the terms of the Trust Agreement, the Trust terminates on April 6, 2015. At the end of the wind-down period, documents memorializing
ConocoPhillips’ ownership of certain Trust property, including all of the Trust’s mineral properties and active leases, will be delivered to ConocoPhillips. The Trustees currently anticipate the wind-down process, final distribution
and dissolution of the Trust will be completed by the end of 2016. At that time, we expect to recognize the fair value of the Trust’s net assets transferred to us.

Other



•San Juan Gas Plant—We operate and own a 50 percent interest in the San Juan Gas Plant, a 550 million cubic-feet-per-day capacity natural gas processing plant in Bloomfield, New Mexico.

•Lost Cabin Gas Plant—We operate and own a 46 percent interest in the Lost Cabin Gas Plant, a 313 million cubic-feet-per-day capacity natural gas processing facility in Lysite, Wyoming.

•Helena Condensate Processing Facility—We operate and own the Helena Condensate Processing Facility, a 90,000 barrel-per-day condensate processing plant located in Kenedy, Texas.

•Sugarloaf Condensate Processing Facility—We operate and own an 87.5 percent interest in the Sugarloaf Condensate Processing Facility, a 30,000 barrel-per-day condensate processing plant located near Pawnee, Texas.

•Bordovsky Condensate Processing Facility—We operate and own the Bordovsky Condensate Processing Facility, a 15,000 barrel-per-day condensate processing plant located in Kenedy, Texas.

•Wingate Fractionator—We sold the Wingate Fractionator in 2014.







CANADA

Our Canadian operations mainly consist of natural gas fields in western Canada and oil sands developments in the Athabasca Region of northeastern Alberta.
In 2014 operations in Canada contributed 19 percent of our worldwide liquids production and 18 percent of our natural gas production.

Western Canada

Our operations in western Canada extend across Alberta, British Columbia and Saskatchewan. We operate or have ownership interests in approximately 80 natural
gas processing plants in the region, and, as of December 31, 2014, held leasehold rights in 5.7 million net acres in western Canada. Our investments in 2014 were focused mainly on higher-margin, liquids-rich opportunities in the following
three core development areas:



•Deep Basin—We hold leasehold rights in 1.4 million net acres in the Deep Basin, located in northwest Alberta and northeast British Columbia. In 2014 Deep Basin achieved average net production of 44 MBOED,
and we drilled 12 horizontal wells.

•Kaybob-Edson—We hold leasehold rights in 0.9 million net acres in the Kaybob-Edson Area, located south of the Deep Basin in west-central Alberta. Net production for Kaybob-Edson averaged 41 MBOED in 2014,
and we drilled 36 horizontal wells.

•Clearwater—Located in west-central Alberta, south of Kaybob-Edson, we hold 0.8 million net acres of leasehold rights. In 2014 average net production for Clearwater was 41 MBOED, and we drilled
39 horizontal wells.

Assets located outside the three core development areas are focused on production optimization and consist of
2.6 million net acres of leasehold rights. These assets averaged 29 MBOED of net production in 2014.

Oil Sands

We hold approximately 0.9 million net acres of land in the Athabasca Region of northeastern Alberta. Our bitumen resources in Canada are produced via an
enhanced thermal oil recovery method called steam-assisted gravity drainage (SAGD), whereby steam is injected into the reservoir, effectively liquefying the heavy bitumen, which is recovered and pumped to the surface for further processing.



•Surmont—The Surmont oil sands leases are located approximately 35 miles south of Fort McMurray, Alberta. Surmont is a 50/50 joint venture with Total S.A. Surmont 2 construction began in 2010, with first steam
targeted for mid-2015. Following startup, Surmont’s gross production capacity is estimated to be 150 MBOED, with peak production anticipated by 2017.

•FCCL— FCCL Partnership, a Canadian upstream general partnership, is a 50/50 heavy oil business venture with Cenovus Energy Inc. FCCL’s
assets are operated by Cenovus and include the Foster Creek, Christina Lake and Narrows Lake SAGD bitumen developments. FCCL continues to progress







expansion plans which would potentially increase total gross production capacity to approximately 750 MBOED. In light of current market conditions for oil prices, FCCL plans to spread the capital
investment in its oil sands projects over a longer period of time, which will slow the pace of certain developments.



oFoster Creek

Foster Creek is located approximately 200 miles northeast of
Edmonton, Alberta. There are six producing phases at Foster Creek, Phases A through F, with one more under construction, Phase G. First production for Phase F was achieved in the third quarter of 2014, and first production for Phase G is anticipated
in 2016. Due to the substantial decline in crude oil prices, construction on Phase H has been deferred in order to preserve cash. Phases G and H are each expected to add 30 MBOED of gross production capacity, with an additional 50 MBOED from
potential optimization. In the fourth quarter of 2014, regulatory approval was received for Phase J, which should add approximately 50 MBOED of gross production capacity. With the additional phases and potential optimization, Foster Creek has the
potential to reach approximately 310 MBOED of total gross production capacity.



oChristina Lake

Christina Lake is located approximately 75 miles south of
Fort McMurray, Alberta. There are five producing phases at Christina Lake, Phases A through E, with plans underway for Phase F. Gross production at Christina Lake increased approximately 40 percent in 2014, mostly as a result of Phase E reaching
full capacity in the second quarter of 2014, in addition to strong facility uptime and strong well performance. During 2014 construction continued on Phases F and G. Phase F is expected to commence production in the second half of 2016 and add
another 50 MBOED of gross production capacity. Further construction on Phase G has been deferred to preserve cash. An application for Phase H was submitted for regulatory review in 2013. With the additional expansion phases and optimization work,
total gross production capacity from Christina Lake has the potential to reach approximately 310 MBOED.



oNarrows Lake

Narrows Lake is located near Christina Lake. Plant construction
on Phase A continued in 2014; however, further work at Narrows Lake has been deferred to preserve cash. Narrows Lake is estimated to reach 130 MBOED of total gross production capacity.

Amauligak

We have a 55 percent operating
interest in the Amauligak discovery, which lies approximately 30 miles offshore in shallow water in the Beaufort Sea. In 2014 we decided not to pursue future development of the Amauligak discovery. Accordingly, we recorded a $109 million after-tax
impairment of undeveloped leasehold costs associated with the offshore Amauligak discovery, Arctic Islands and other Beaufort properties. We, however, remain committed to the potential of the area, should technology and commodity prices improve.

Exploration

We hold exploration acreage
in four areas of Canada: onshore western Canada, offshore eastern Canada, the Mackenzie Delta/Beaufort Sea Region and the Arctic Islands. Our primary exploration focus is on liquids-rich unconventional plays in western Canada and conventional
exploration offshore eastern Canada.



•Conventional Exploration

During 2014 we entered into a farm-in agreement to
acquire a 30 percent nonoperated interest in six exploration licenses covering approximately five million gross acres in the deepwater Shelburne Basin, offshore Nova Scotia. Pending regulatory approval, we anticipate drilling will begin in the
second half of 2015. In December 2014 we participated in a successful bid for one exploration license covering 0.7 million gross acres located in the Flemish Pass Basin, offshore Newfoundland. In January 2015 we were awarded the license, in
which we hold a 30 percent nonoperated interest.







•Unconventional Exploration

We hold approximately 0.7 million net acres in
the emerging Montney, Muskwa, Duvernay and Canol unconventional plays in Alberta, northeastern British Columbia and the Northwest Territories. During 2014 we continued to drill unconventional test wells in the Duvernay, located in Alberta; the Canol
shale, located in the Northwest Territories; and the Montney play, which extends from British Columbia into Alberta.

EUROPE

The Europe segment consists of operations principally located in the Norwegian and U.K. sectors of the North Sea, as well as exploration activities in
the Barents Sea, offshore Norway; Central North Sea and west of Shetland, offshore United Kingdom; and Baffin Bay and Greenland Sea, offshore Greenland. In 2014 operations in Europe contributed 15 percent of our worldwide liquids production and

The Greater Ekofisk Area is located approximately 200 miles offshore Stavanger, Norway in the North Sea, and comprises
four producing fields: Ekofisk, Eldfisk, Embla and Tor. Crude oil is exported to Teesside, England, and the natural gas is exported to Emden, Germany. Ekofisk South achieved first production in 2013 and continued to ramp up during 2014, while
Eldfisk II achieved startup in January 2015. Ekofisk South, along with Eldfisk II and other developments offshore Norway, will contribute additional production over the coming years, as additional wells come online.

The Alvheim development is located in the northern part of the North Sea and consists of a floating production, storage and offloading (FPSO) vessel and
subsea installations. Produced crude oil is exported via shuttle tankers, and natural gas is transported to the United Kingdom via a pipeline to the Beryl-Sage system.

The Heidrun Field is located in the Norwegian Sea. Produced crude oil is transported to Mongstad in Norway and Tetney in the United Kingdom by double-hulled
shuttle tankers. Part of the natural gas is currently injected into the reservoir for optimization of crude oil production, while the remainder is used as feedstock in a methanol plant in Norway, in which we own an 18.3 percent interest.

We also have varying ownership interests in five other producing fields in the Norway sector of the North Sea and in the Norwegian Sea, as well as the Aasta
Hansteen development. The operator is targeting first gas for Aasta Hansteen by late 2017.

Exploration

During 2014 we participated in two nonoperated wildcat wells in the Barents Sea; both were declared dry holes. In the Visund area of the North Sea, we
participated in the Helene/Methone nonoperated exploration well, which was a gas discovery and is currently being evaluated for development. We also participated in the







Barents Sea 3-D seismic group study over the recently opened southeast Barents area. In 2014 we were awarded
two new North Sea licenses from the 2013 Awards in Pre-defined Areas licensing round: PL044B and PL736S, in which we will own a 41.88 percent operating interest and a 20 percent nonoperated interest, respectively.

Australia Pacific LNG

Australia Pacific LNG Pty Ltd (APLNG), our joint venture with Origin Energy Limited and China Petrochemical Corporation (Sinopec), is focused on producing
CBM from the Bowen and Surat basins in Queensland, Australia, and converting the CBM into LNG. Natural gas is currently sold to domestic customers, while progress continues on the development of the LNG processing and export sales business. Origin
operates APLNG’s upstream production and pipeline system, and we will operate the downstream LNG facility, located on Curtis Island near Gladstone, Queensland.

Two fully subscribed 4.5-million-tonnes-per-year LNG trains have been sanctioned. Approximately 3,900 net wells are ultimately envisioned to supply both the
domestic gas market and the LNG sales contracts. The wells will be supported by gathering systems, central gas processing and compression stations, water treatment facilities, and a new export pipeline connecting the gas fields to the LNG
facilities. First LNG is expected in mid-2015 from Train 1. Following commissioning, the LNG will be sold to Sinopec under a 20-year sales agreement for up to 4.3 million metric tonnes of LNG per year. Startup of the second LNG train is
expected to







occur six-to-nine months following the startup of Train 1. The resulting LNG exports from Train 2 will commence shortly thereafter. Sinopec has agreed to purchase an additional 3.3 million
metric tonnes of LNG per year through 2035, and Japan-based Kansai Electric Power Co., Inc. has agreed to purchase approximately 1 million metric tonnes of LNG per year for 20 years.

APLNG has an $8.5 billion project finance facility, of which $8.1 billion had been drawn from the facility at December 31, 2014. In connection with the
execution of the project financing, we provided a completion guarantee for our pro-rata share of the project finance facility until the project achieves financial completion. For additional information, see Note 3—Variable Interest Entities
(VIEs), Note 6—Investments, Loans and Long-Term Receivables, and Note 11—Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Bayu-Undan

The Bayu-Undan gas condensate
field is located in the Timor Sea Joint Petroleum Development Area between Timor-Leste and Australia. We also operate and own a 56.9 percent interest in the associated Darwin LNG Facility, located at Wickham Point, Darwin.

The Bayu-Undan natural gas recycle facility processes wet gas; separates, stores and offloads condensate, propane and butane; and re-injects dry gas back
into the reservoir. In addition, a 500-kilometer natural gas pipeline connects the facility to the 3.5-million-tonnes-per-year capacity Darwin LNG Facility. Produced natural gas is piped to the Darwin LNG Plant, where it is converted into LNG before
being transported to international markets. In 2014 we sold 154 billion gross cubic feet of LNG to utility customers in Japan.

The Bayu-Undan Phase
Three Development consists of two standalone, subsea horizontal wells tied back to the existing drilling, production and processing platform. In 2014 we completed the fabrication and installation of platform risers, topsides piping, wellheads and
trees. Development drilling commenced in the second half of 2014, with initial production estimated in the first quarter of 2015. The development is expected to average an additional 100 MMCFD gross over two years.

ConocoPhillips served a Notice of Arbitration on the Timor-Leste Minister of Finance in October 2012 for outstanding disputes related to a series of tax
assessments. The arbitration hearing was conducted in June 2014, and we are currently awaiting the Tribunal’s decision. For additional information, see Note 12—Contingencies and Commitments, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial

Greater Sunrise

We have a 30 percent interest
in the Greater Sunrise gas and condensate field located in the Timor Sea. In May 2013 the Timor-Leste Government referred a dispute with the Australian Government relating to the treaty on Certain Maritime Arrangements in the Timor Sea (CMATS) to
international arbitration. Following agreement between the governments in September 2014, this arbitration is currently suspended until March 2015. The CMATS arbitration does not directly impact our underlying interests in Sunrise; however, we
and the Sunrise co-venturers are unable to commit to further commercial and technical work activities due to the uncertainty created by the lack of government alignment. Accordingly, current activities are restricted to compliance and social
investment, as well as maintaining relationships and development options for Sunrise.

Our Health, Safety and Environment (HSE) organization provides tools and support to our business units and staff groups to help them ensure world class
health, safety and environmental performance. The framework through which we safely manage our operations, the HSE Management System Standard, emphasizes process safety, risk management, emergency preparedness and environmental performance, with an
intense focus on occupational safety. In support of the goal of zero incidents, our HSE Excellence Process requires the business units to measure performance and drive continuous improvement. Assessments are conducted annually to capture progress
and set new targets. We also have detailed processes in place to address sustainable development in our economic, environmental and social performance. Our processes, related tools and requirements focus on water, biodiversity and climate change, as
well as social and stakeholder issues.
