Items 1 and 2. BUSINESS AND PROPERTIES

CORPORATE STRUCTURE

ConocoPhillips is the world’s largest independent exploration and production (E&P) company, based on proved reserves and production of liquids and
natural gas. ConocoPhillips was incorporated in the state of Delaware on November 16, 2001, in connection with, and in anticipation of, the merger between Conoco Inc. and Phillips Petroleum Company. The merger between Conoco and Phillips was
consummated on August 30, 2002.

In April 2012, the ConocoPhillips Board of Directors approved the separation of our downstream business into an
independent, publicly traded energy company, Phillips 66. Each ConocoPhillips stockholder received one share of Phillips 66 stock for every two shares of ConocoPhillips stock held at the close of business on the record date of April 16, 2012.
The separation was completed on April 30, 2012, and activities related to Phillips 66 have been treated as discontinued operations for all periods prior to the separation.

In 2012, we agreed to sell our interest in the North Caspian Sea Production Sharing Agreement (Kashagan) and our Nigeria and Algeria businesses (collectively,
the “Disposition Group”). We sold our Nigeria business in the third quarter of 2014, and we sold Kashagan and our Algeria business in the fourth quarter of 2013. Results for the Disposition Group have been reported as discontinued
operations in the applicable periods presented. For additional information on the sale of our Nigeria business, see Note 3—Discontinued Operations, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Headquartered in Houston, Texas, we have operations and activities in 17 countries. Our key focus areas include safely operating producing assets, executing
major developments and exploring for new resources in promising areas. Our portfolio includes resource-rich North American tight oil and oil sands assets; lower-risk conventional assets in North America, Europe, Asia and Australia; several liquefied
natural gas (LNG) developments; and an inventory of global conventional and unconventional exploration prospects.

At December 31, 2016,
ConocoPhillips employed approximately 13,300 people worldwide.

In November 2016, we announced our planned $5 billion to $8 billion asset disposition
program, primarily associated with North American natural gas assets, over the next two years. For additional information on asset sales, see the “Outlook” section of Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations, and Note 6—Assets Held for Sale or Sold, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.







SEGMENT AND GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION

For operating segment and geographic information, see Note 24—Segment Disclosures and Related Information, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements, which is incorporated herein by reference.

We explore for, produce, transport and market crude oil, bitumen, natural gas, LNG and natural gas
liquids on a worldwide basis. At December 31, 2016, our operations were producing in the United States, Norway, the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, Timor-Leste, Indonesia, China, Malaysia, Qatar and Libya.

The information listed below appears in the “Oil and Gas Operations” disclosures following the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and is
incorporated herein by reference:



•Proved worldwide crude oil, natural gas liquids, natural gas and bitumen reserves.

•Net production of crude oil, natural gas liquids, natural gas and bitumen.

•Average sales prices of crude oil, natural gas liquids, natural gas and bitumen.

•Average production costs per barrel of oil equivalent (BOE).

•Net wells completed, wells in progress and productive wells.

•Developed and undeveloped acreage.







The following table is a summary of the proved reserves information included in the “Oil and Gas
Operations” disclosures following the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Approximately 81 percent of our proved reserves are located in politically stable countries that belong to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and
Development. Natural gas reserves are converted to BOE based on a 6:1 ratio: six thousand cubic feet (MCF) of natural gas converts to one BOE. See Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for a
discussion of factors that will enhance the understanding of the following summary reserves table.

Total production, including Libya, of 1,569 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day (MBOED) decreased 1 percent
in 2016 compared with 2015. The decrease in total average production primarily resulted from normal field decline and the loss of 72 MBOED mainly attributable to the 2015 dispositions of several non-core assets in the Lower 48, western Canada and
the sale of our interest in the Polar Lights Company in Russia. The decrease in production was partly offset by additional production from major developments, including tight oil plays in the Lower 48; APLNG in Australia; the Western North Slope in
Alaska; the Kebabangan gas field in Malaysia; and the Greater Ekofisk Area in Norway. Improved drilling and well performance in Canada, Norway, the Lower 48, and China, as well as lower unplanned downtime in the Lower 48 also partly offset the
decrease in production. Assets sold in 2016 produced 27 MBOED and 36 MBOED in 2016 and 2015, respectively.

Our worldwide annual average realized
price was $28.35 per BOE in 2016, a decrease of 17 percent compared with $34.34 per BOE in 2015, which reflected lower average realized prices across all commodities. Our worldwide annual average crude oil price decreased 15 percent in 2016, from
$48.26 per barrel in 2015 to $40.86 per barrel in 2016. Additionally, our worldwide annual average natural gas liquids prices decreased 6 percent, from $17.79 per barrel in 2015 to $16.68 per barrel in 2016. Our worldwide annual average natural
gas price decreased 24 percent, from $3.96 per MCF in 2015 to $3.00 per MCF in 2016. Average annual bitumen prices also decreased 18 percent, from $18.72 per barrel in 2015 to $15.27 per barrel in 2016.







ALASKA

The Alaska segment primarily explores for, produces, transports and markets crude oil, natural gas liquids, natural gas and LNG. We are the largest crude oil
producer in Alaska and have major ownership interests in two of North America’s largest oil fields located on Alaska’s North Slope: Prudhoe Bay and Kuparuk. We also have a significant operating interest in the Alpine Field, located on the
Western North Slope. Additionally, we are one of Alaska’s largest owners of state, federal and fee exploration leases, with approximately 0.5 million net undeveloped acres at year-end 2016. Following the impairment of our Chukchi Sea
leases in the fourth quarter of 2015, we surrendered 0.3 million acres in the Chukchi Sea in May 2016. In 2016, Alaska operations contributed 19 percent of our worldwide liquids production and less than 1 percent of our natural gas production.

*Thousands of barrels per day.

**Millions of cubic feet per day.

Greater Prudhoe Area

The Greater Prudhoe Area
includes the Prudhoe Bay Field and five satellite fields, as well as the Greater Point McIntyre Area fields. Prudhoe Bay, the largest oil field on Alaska’s North Slope, is the site of a large waterflood and enhanced oil recovery operation, as
well as a gas plant which processes natural gas to recover natural gas liquids before reinjection into the reservoir. Prudhoe Bay’s satellites are Aurora, Borealis, Polaris, Midnight Sun and Orion, while the Point McIntyre, Niakuk, Raven,
Lisburne and North Prudhoe Bay State fields are part of the Greater Point McIntyre Area.

Greater Kuparuk Area

We operate the Greater Kuparuk Area, which consists of the Kuparuk Field and four satellite fields: Tarn, Tabasco, Meltwater and West Sak. Kuparuk is located
40 miles west of Prudhoe Bay. Field installations include three central production facilities which separate oil, natural gas and water, as well as a separate seawater treatment plant. Development drilling at Kuparuk consists of rotary-drilled wells
and horizontal multi-laterals from existing well bores utilizing coiled-tubing drilling.

Drill Site 2S, in the southwestern area of the Kuparuk Field,
was sanctioned in October 2014. First oil was achieved in October 2015, and completion of the first phase of the project was achieved in 2016.

The 1H
Northeast West Sak (NEWS) oil development targeting the West Sak reservoir in the Kuparuk River Unit, was sanctioned in March 2015. First production is anticipated in 2018.

Western North Slope

On the Western North Slope,
we operate the Colville River Unit, which includes the Alpine Field and three satellite fields: Nanuq, Fiord and Qannik. Alpine is located 34 miles west of Kuparuk. In October 2015, first oil was achieved at Alpine West CD5, a new drill site which
extends the Alpine reservoir west into the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska (NPR-A). During the year, we approved drilling an additional 18 wells, bringing CD5 up to its full permit capacity.







The Greater Mooses Tooth Unit, the first unit established entirely within the NPR-A, was formed in 2008. In 2017,
we began construction in the unit, which is currently planned to have two drill sites; Greater Mooses Tooth #1 and #2, with expected first oil in 2018 and 2020, respectively.

Cook Inlet Area

We have a 100 percent interest
and are the operator of the Kenai LNG Facility in the Cook Inlet Area. The Kenai LNG Facility includes a 1.6 million-tons-per-year capacity plant, as well as docking and loading facilities for LNG tankers. LNG from the plant has historically
been transported and sold to utility companies in Japan. In February 2016, our export license was renewed for an additional two years. However, there was no LNG export program in 2016 due to market conditions. We are currently marketing this
facility.

In April and October 2016, we sold our interests in the Beluga River Unit natural gas field and the North Cook Inlet Unit, respectively, both
in the Cook Inlet Area. The full-year 2016 production from the assets sold was 2 MBOED.

Point Thomson

We own a 4.9 percent interest in the Point Thomson Unit, which is located approximately 60 miles east of Prudhoe Bay. An Initial Production System (IPS) was
brought online in April 2016, and achieved full production of 400 BOED net of condensate in December.

Alaska North Slope Gas

In 2016, we, along with affiliates of Exxon Mobil Corporation, BP p.l.c. and Alaska Gasline Development Corporation (AGDC), a state-owned corporation
(collectively, the “AKLNG co-venturers”), completed preliminary front-end engineering and design (pre-FEED) technical work for a potential LNG project which would liquefy and export natural gas from Alaska’s North Slope and deliver it
to market. In September 2016, we, along with the affiliates of ExxonMobil and BP, indicated our intention not to progress into the next phase of the project due to changes in the economic environment. Given AGDC’s intention to continue
efforts to advance a North Slope Gas project, the AKLNG co-venturers executed certain agreements to enhance AGDC’s ability to do so. We remain supportive of AGDC’s efforts to progress a project.

Exploration

In 2016, we drilled three exploration
wells in the NPR-A. Two of these wells, Tinmiaq 2 and 6, form the Willow discovery, which is located in the northeast portion of the NPR-A. The third exploration well was recorded to dry hole expense in the fourth quarter of 2016. Appraisal of the
Willow discovery commenced in January 2017 with the acquisition of 3-D seismic. In a follow-up to the Willow discovery, we were successful in December’s state and federal lease sales on the Western North Slope, where we were the high
bidder on 139 tracts for a total of 737,252 gross acres.

Transportation

We transport the petroleum liquids produced on the North Slope to south central Alaska through an800-milepipeline
that is part of Trans-Alaska Pipeline System (TAPS). We have a 29.1 percent ownership interest in TAPS, and we also have ownership interests in the Alpine, Kuparuk and Oliktok pipelines on the North Slope.

Our wholly-owned subsidiary, Polar Tankers, Inc., manages the marine transportation of our North Slope production, using five company-owned, double-hulled
tankers, and charters third-party vessels as necessary. The tankers deliver oil from Valdez, Alaska, primarily to refineries on the west coast of the United States.







LOWER 48

The Lower 48 segment consists of operations located in the U.S. Lower 48 states and the Gulf of Mexico. The Lower 48 business is organized within three
regions covering the Gulf Coast, Mid-Continent and Rockies. As a result of tight oil opportunities, we have directed our investments toward certain shorter cycle time, low cost-of-supply plays. In July 2015, we announced our plan to reduce future
deepwater exploration spending. We have subsequently terminated our Gulf of Mexico deepwater drillship contracts. We hold 12.4 million net onshore and offshore acres in the Lower 48. In 2016, the Lower 48 contributed 30 percent of our
worldwide liquids production and 32 percent of our natural gas production.

Onshore

We hold
12.3 million net acres of onshore conventional and unconventional acreage in the Lower 48, the majority of which is either held by production or owned by the company. Our unconventional holdings total approximately 2.6 million net acres in
the following areas:



•900,000 net acres in the San Juan Basin, located in northwestern New Mexico and southwestern Colorado.

•620,000 net acres in the Bakken, located in North Dakota and eastern Montana.

•213,000 net acres in the Eagle Ford, located in South Texas.

•104,000 net acres in the Niobrara, located in northeastern Colorado.

•123,500 net acres in the Permian, located in West Texas and southeastern New Mexico.

•68,000 net acres in the Barnett, located in north central Texas.

•591,000 net acres in other unconventional exploration plays.







The majority of our 2016 onshore production originated from the Eagle Ford, San Juan, Permian and Bakken. Onshore
activities in 2016 were centered mostly on continued development of emerging and existing assets, with an emphasis on areas with low cost of supply, particularly in growing unconventional plays. The 2016 drilling activity levels declined relative to
2015 due to reduced capital spending in the low commodity price environment. Our major focus areas in 2016 included the following:



•Eagle Ford—The Eagle Ford scaled down full-field development in 2016. We operated three rigs on average in 2016, resulting in 69 operated wells drilled and 80 operated wells brought online. Production decreased 7
percent in 2016 compared with 2015, and reached a net peak of 176 MBOED, compared with 190 MBOED in 2015.

•Bakken—We operated two rigs on average throughout the year in the Bakken. We continued our pad drilling efficiency, drilling 34 operated wells during the year and bringing 37 operated wells online. We achieved net
peak production of 72 MBOED in 2016, compared with 80 MBOED in 2015.

•San Juan Basin—The San Juan Basin includes significant conventional gas production, which yields approximately 20 percent natural gas liquids, as well as the majority of our U.S. coalbed methane (CBM) production.
We hold approximately 1.3 million net acres of oil and gas leases by production in San Juan, including approximately 900,000 net unconventional acres of lease rights.

•Permian Basin—The Permian Basin is an area where we are leveraging our conventional legacy position by utilizing new technology to improve the ultimate recovery and value from these fields. This technology should
also identify new, unconventional plays across the region. We hold approximately 1.0 million net acres in the Permian, which includes 123,500 net unconventional acres. The Permian Basin produced 64 MBOED in 2016, which includes 15 MBOED of
unconventional production.

In 2015, we completed the sale of certain non-core assets in East Texas and North Louisiana and South Texas.
Production from the assets sold was 33 MBOED, approximately 6 percent of the total Lower 48 segment production in 2015. In the second quarter of 2016, we completed the sale of certain non-core assets in the Delaware basin. The full-year 2016
production from the assets sold was 1 MBOED.

Gulf of Mexico

At year-end 2016, our portfolio of producing properties in the Gulf of Mexico primarily consisted of one operated field and three fields operated by
co-venturers, including:



•75 percent operated working interest in the Magnolia Field in Garden Banks Blocks 783 and 784.

•15.9 percent nonoperated working interest in the unitized Ursa Field located in the Mississippi Canyon Area.

•15.9 percent nonoperated working interest in the Princess Field, a northern subsalt extension of the Ursa Field.

•12.4 percent nonoperated working interest in the unitized K2 Field, comprised of seven blocks in the Green Canyon Area.

Exploration



•Conventional Exploration

At December 31, 2016, we held approximately
73,000 net acres in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico.

We own a 30 percent nonoperated working interest in the Shenandoah discovery, which was
announced in 2009, and had a net book value of $286 million at December 31, 2016. Appraisal drilling continued in 2016 with the fifth Shenandoah well reaching total depth in the third quarter. In February 2017, the sixth Shenandoah well,
Shenandoah WR52-3, reached total depth. Drilling of a sidetrack well from Shenandoah WR52-3 also commenced in February.







As part of our continued phased exit from deepwater exploration, in 2016, we decided not to
pursue further development of the nonoperated Gibson and Tiber wells, collectively known as the Tigris project. Accordingly, we recorded dry hole expenses for previously suspended Gibson and Tiber wells, and impairment charges for the applicable
leaseholds.

We recorded dry hole and associated leasehold impairment expense in the first quarter of 2016 for the Melmar exploration
well.



•Unconventional Exploration

In 2016, we drilled a total of five operated
unconventional wells, primarily in the Eagle Ford. Our onshore focus areas include the Permian in the Delaware Basin and the Niobrara in the Denver-Julesburg Basin, as well as several emerging plays. We continue to assess and appraise these and
other unconventional opportunities.

Facilities

Freeport LNG Terminal

In July 2013, we agreed with
Freeport LNG Development, L.P. to terminate our long-term agreement to use 0.9 billion cubic feet per day of regasification capacity at Freeport’s 1.5 billion cubic-feet-per-day LNG receiving terminal in Quintana, Texas. The termination
agreement conditions were satisfied in 2014. Our terminal regasification capacity was reduced to zero on July 1, 2016. For additional information, see Note 7—Investments, Loans and Long-Term Receivables, in the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements.

Golden Pass LNG Terminal

We have a 12.4 percent ownership interest in the Golden Pass LNG Terminal and affiliated Golden Pass Pipeline, with a combined net book value of approximately
$260 million at December 31, 2016. It is located adjacent to the Sabine-Neches Industrial Ship Channel northwest of Sabine Pass, Texas. The terminal became commercially operational in May 2011. We hold terminal and pipeline capacity for the
receipt, storage and regasification of the LNG purchased from Qatar Liquefied Gas Company Limited (3) (QG3) and the transportation of regasified LNG to interconnect with major interstate natural gas pipelines. Utilization of the terminal has
been and is expected to be limited, as market conditions currently favor the flow of LNG to European and Asian markets. As a result, we are evaluating opportunities to optimize the value of the terminal facilities.

Greater Northern Iron Ore Properties Trust

We
held the reversionary interest in the Greater Northern Iron Ore Properties trust (the Trust), a grantor trust that owns mineral and surface interests in the Mesabi Iron Range in northeastern Minnesota and certain other personal
property. Pursuant to the terms of the Trust Agreement, the Trust terminated on April 6, 2015. On November 3, 2016, the end of the wind-down period, documents memorializing our ownership of certain Trust property, including all the
Trust’s mineral properties and active leases, were delivered to us. The $144 million fair value of the Trust’s net assets transferred to us and a gain of $88 million were both recorded in the fourth quarter of 2016. On
December 8, 2016, we closed on a sale of the Trust’s and certain other assets for net proceeds of $148 million. For additional information, see Note 6—Assets Held for Sale or Sold, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements.

Western Canada

Our operations in western Canada extend across Alberta and British Columbia. We operate or have ownership interests in approximately 30 natural gas processing
plants in the region, and, as of December 31, 2016, held leasehold rights in 3.1 million net acres in western Canada. Our investments in 2016 were focused mainly on opportunities in the following three core development areas:



•Deep Basin—We hold leasehold rights in 1.3 million net acres in the Deep Basin, located in northwest Alberta and northeast British Columbia. In 2016, Deep Basin achieved average net production of
46 MBOED, and we drilled eight horizontal wells.

•Kaybob-Edson—We hold leasehold rights in 0.7 million net acres in the Kaybob-Edson Area, located south of the Deep Basin in west central Alberta. Net production for Kaybob-Edson averaged 37 MBOED in 2016,
and we drilled 15 horizontal wells.

•Clearwater—We hold leasehold rights in 0.8 million net acres in the Clearwater area, located in west central Alberta, south of Kaybob-Edson. In 2016, average net production for Clearwater was 34 MBOED.

Oil Sands

Our bitumen
resources in Canada are produced via an enhanced thermal oil recovery method called steam-assisted gravity drainage (SAGD), whereby steam is injected into the reservoir, effectively liquefying the heavy bitumen, which is recovered and pumped to the
surface for further processing. We hold approximately 0.9 million net acres of land in the Athabasca Region of northeastern Alberta.



•Surmont—The Surmont oil sands leases are located approximately 35 miles south of Fort McMurray, Alberta. Surmont is a 50/50 joint venture with Total S.A. The Surmont 2 project achieved first production in 2015, and
production continued to ramp up in 2016. Net production at Surmont increased 21 MBOED in 2016.







•FCCL—FCCL Partnership, a Canadian upstream general partnership, is a 50/50 business venture with Cenovus Energy Inc. FCCL’s assets are operated by Cenovus and include the Foster Creek, Christina Lake and
Narrows Lake SAGD bitumen developments. FCCL continues to progress development plans for each of these assets.



¡Foster Creek

Foster Creek is located approximately 200 miles northeast of
Edmonton, Alberta. With the achievement of first production at Phase G in 2016, there are seven producing phases at Foster Creek, Phases A through G. Net production at Foster Creek increased approximately 5 MBOED in 2016.



¡Christina Lake

Christina Lake is located approximately 75 miles south of Fort
McMurray, Alberta. Christina Lake Phase F achieved first production in 2016. There are now six producing phases at Christina Lake. Construction on Phase G, which has a design capacity of 50 MBOED gross, will resume in 2017 after being deferred since
2014. First production from Phase G is expected in the second half of 2019. Net production at Christina Lake increased approximately 6 MBOED in 2016.



¡Narrows Lake

Narrows Lake Phase A, was sanctioned in late 2012 and is expected
to have 45 MBOED of gross design production capacity. Construction has been deferred, however, we expect to progress engineering activity in 2017.

Exploration

We hold exploration acreage in four
areas of Canada: onshore western Canada, offshore eastern Canada, the Mackenzie Delta/Beaufort Sea Region and the Arctic Islands. Our primary exploration focus is on unconventional plays in western Canada.



•Conventional Exploration

During 2014, we entered into a farm-in agreement to
acquire a 30 percent nonoperated interest in six exploration licenses covering approximately five million gross acres in the deepwater Shelburne Basin, offshore Nova Scotia. In 2016, we recorded dry hole expenses associated with two wells in the
Shelburne Basin, and an impairment charge for the undeveloped leasehold costs. Other related costs have been accrued.

In August 2016, we
sold our Newfoundland Partnership, which held a 30 percent nonoperated interest in the exploration license in the Flemish Pass Basin, offshore Newfoundland.



•Unconventional Exploration

We hold approximately 0.7 million net acres in
the emerging Montney, Muskwa, Duvernay and Canol unconventional plays in Alberta, northeastern British Columbia and the Northwest Territories. During 2016, we completed a lease swap for unproved lands in the Blueberry area and continued to drill
exploration and appraisal wells in the Montney play, which extends from British Columbia into Alberta. Full-year 2016 production from the assets swapped was 5 MBOED. For additional information, see Note 6—Assets Held for Sale or Sold, in the
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.







EUROPE AND NORTH AFRICA

The Europe and North Africa segment consists of operations and exploration activities in Norway, the United Kingdom and Libya. In 2016, operations in Europe
and North Africa contributed 14 percent of our worldwide liquids production and 12 percent of natural gas production.

The Greater Ekofisk Area is located approximately 200 miles offshore Stavanger, Norway, in the North Sea, and comprises
three producing fields: Ekofisk, Eldfisk and Embla. Crude oil is exported to Teesside, England, and the natural gas is exported to Emden, Germany. Ekofisk South achieved first production in 2013, while Eldfisk II achieved startup in January 2015.
Continued development drilling in the Greater Ekofisk Area will contribute additional production over the coming years, as additional wells come online.

The Alvheim development is located in the northern part of the North Sea and consists of a floating production, storage and offloading (FPSO) vessel and
subsea installations. Produced crude oil is exported via shuttle tankers, and natural gas is transported to the Scottish Area Gas Evacuation (SAGE) terminal at St. Fergus, Scotland, through the SAGE pipeline.

The Heidrun Field is located in the Norwegian Sea. Produced crude oil is stored in a floating storage unit and exported via shuttle tankers. Part of the
natural gas is currently injected into the reservoir for optimization of crude oil production, some gas is exported to the Continent via gas processing terminals in Norway, while the remainder is exported for use as feedstock in a methanol plant in
Norway, in which we own an 18 percent interest.

We also have varying ownership interests in five other producing fields in the Norway sector of the North
Sea and in the Norwegian Sea, as well as the Aasta Hansteen development. The operator is targeting first gas for Aasta Hansteen by late 2018.

Exploration

We participated in two nonoperated
exploration wells in the Oseberg and Alvheim areas. Both wells were discoveries and are currently undergoing evaluation. We were awarded three licenses in 2016, including the PL845 and PL782SB, both with interests of 40 percent, and PL859, which has
a 15 percent interest.

Transportation

We own
a 35.1 percent interest in the Norpipe Oil Pipeline System, a 220-mile pipeline which carries crude oil from Ekofisk to a crude oil stabilization and natural gas liquids processing facility in Teesside, England.

the Britannia platform. Project startups for the Brodgar H3 susbsea well, and Enochdhu, a single well tie back to Callanish, were achieved in 2015. First gas was achieved from Alder, a single well tie back to Britannia, in the fourth quarter of
2016.

The J-Area consists of the Judy/Joanne, Jade and Jasmine fields, located in the U.K. Central North Sea. The Jasmine Field is a high-pressure,
high-temperature gas condensate reservoir located approximately six miles west of the Judy Platform. The development includes a 24-slot wellhead platform with a bridge-linked accommodation and utilities platform, a six-mile, 16-inch multi-phase
pipeline bundle, and a riser and processing platform bridge-linked to the existing Judy Platform.

We have various ownership interests in several
producing gas fields in the Rotliegendes and Carboniferous areas of the Southern North Sea. Decommissioning activity in the Southern North Sea is ongoing, with final production from the Viking transportation system and associated satellites achieved
in early 2016. Our interests in the East Irish Sea include the Millom, Dalton and Calder fields, which are operated on our behalf by a third party.

We
own a 24 percent interest in the Clair Field, located in the Atlantic Margin. Clair Ridge is the second phase of development for the Clair Field and is comprised of a 36-slot drilling and production facility with a bridge-linked accommodation and
utilities platform. The new facilities will tie into existing oil and gas export pipelines to the Shetland Islands. Initial production for Clair Ridge is targeted for 2018.

Exploration

In 2016, we recorded dry hole expense
for the fully-owned Temple Wood well in the Greater Britannia Area, which was permanently plugged and abandoned.

Transportation

We operate the Teesside oil and Theddlethorpe gas terminals in which we have 29.3 percent and 50 percent ownership interests, respectively. We also
have a 100 percent ownership interest in the Rivers Gas Terminal, operated by a third party.

The Waha Concession consists of multiple concessions and encompasses nearly 13 million gross acres in the Sirte Basin.
Our production operations in Libya and related oil exports were interrupted in mid-2013, as a result of the shutdown of the Es Sider crude oil export terminal at the end of July 2013. The Es Sider Terminal briefly reopened in the third quarter of
2014 and production and liftings resumed temporarily; however, further disruptions occurred in December 2014, and production was shut in again. Production resumed in Libya in October 2016, with three crude liftings from Es Sider in January
2017. We expect a gradual ramp-up in activity.

ASIA PACIFIC AND MIDDLE EAST

The Asia Pacific and Middle East segment has exploration and production operations in China, Indonesia, Malaysia and Australia; producing operations in Qatar
and Timor-Leste; and exploration activities in Brunei. In 2016, operations in the Asia Pacific and Middle East segment contributed 14 percent of our worldwide liquids production and 42 percent of natural gas production.

Australia Pacific LNG

Australia Pacific LNG Pty Ltd (APLNG), our joint venture with Origin Energy Limited and China Petrochemical Corporation (Sinopec), is focused on producing CBM
from the Bowen and Surat basins in Queensland, Australia, and converting the coalbed methane into LNG. Natural gas is sold to domestic customers, while LNG is exported. Origin operates APLNG’s upstream production and pipeline system, and we
operate the downstream LNG facility, located on Curtis Island near Gladstone, Queensland, as well as the LNG export sales business.







Two fully subscribed 4.5 million tonnes-per-year LNG trains have been completed. Approximately 3,900 net
wells are ultimately envisioned to supply both the domestic gas market and the LNG sales contracts. The wells are supported by gathering systems, central gas processing and compression stations, water treatment facilities, and an export pipeline
connecting the gas fields to the LNG facilities. The first APLNG Train 1 cargo sailed in January 2016, and LNG sales continued throughout the year. Train 1 LNG is being sold to Sinopec under a 20-year sales agreement for up to 4.3 million
metric tonnes of LNG per year. APLNG Train 2 achieved first production in the third quarter of 2016. The LNG from Train 2 is being sold to Sinopec under a 20-year sales agreement for an additional 3.3 million metric tonnes of LNG per year
through 2035, and Japan-based Kansai Electric Power Co., Inc. under a 20-year sales agreement for approximately 1 million metric tonnes of LNG per year.

APLNG has an $8.5 billion project finance facility, of which $8.5 billion had been drawn from the facility at December 31, 2016. In connection with the
execution of the project financing, we provided a completion guarantee for our pro-rata share of the project finance facility until the project achieves financial completion. In October 2016, we reached financial completion for Train 1, which
reduced our associated guarantee by 60 percent. For additional information, see Note 4—Variable Interest Entities (VIEs), Note 7—Investments, Loans and Long-Term Receivables, and Note 12—Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements.

Bayu-Undan

The
Bayu-Undan gas condensate field is located in the Timor Sea Joint Petroleum Development Area between Timor-Leste and Australia. We also operate and own a 56.9 percent interest in the associated Darwin LNG Facility, located at Wickham Point, Darwin.

The Bayu-Undan natural gas recycle facility processes wet gas; separates, stores and offloads condensate, propane and butane; and re-injects dry gas back
into the reservoir. In addition, a 310-mile natural gas pipeline connects the facility to the 3.5 million tonnes-per-year capacity Darwin LNG Facility. Produced natural gas is piped to the Darwin LNG Plant, where it is converted into LNG before
being transported to international markets. In 2016, we sold 168 billion gross cubic feet of LNG primarily to utility customers in Japan.

The Bayu-Undan
Phase Three Development consists of two standalone, subsea horizontal wells tied back to the existing drilling, production and processing platform. The first subsea horizontal well was tied back to the existing drilling, production and processing
platform, and commenced production in 2015, while the second well was suspended due to insufficient deliverability to the platform. A continuation of the Bayu-Undan Phase Three Development is being evaluated with the front-end engineering and design
phase approaching completion. The current premise is that drilling of one subsea and two platform wells will commence in 2018, pending internal, joint venture and regulatory approval.

ConocoPhillips served a Notice of Arbitration on the Timor-Leste Minister of Finance in October 2012 for outstanding disputes related to a series of tax
assessments. The arbitration hearing was conducted in Singapore in June 2014 under the United Nations Commission on International Trade Laws (UNCITRAL) arbitration rules, pursuant to the terms of the Tax Stability Agreement with the Timor-Leste
government. We reached a settlement with the Timor-Leste government on these disputes in 2016.

Athena/Perseus

The Athena production license (WA-17-L) is located offshore Western Australia and contains part of the Perseus Field, which straddles the boundary with WA-1-L,
an adjoining license area. Natural gas is produced from these licenses.

Greater Sunrise

We have a 30 percent interest in the Greater Sunrise gas and condensate field located in the Timor Sea. In April 2016, the Timor-Leste Government initiated
conciliation under the United Nations Convention of the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) in an attempt to negotiate permanent maritime boundaries. The conciliation ison-goingbetween the governments of Timor-Leste and
Australia.







The UNCLOS conciliation does not directly impact our underlying interests in Sunrise; however, we and the Sunrise
co-venturers are unable to commit to further commercial and technical work activities due to the uncertainty created by the lack of government alignment. Accordingly, current activities are restricted to compliance and social investment, as
well as maintaining relationships and development options for Sunrise.

Exploration



•Conventional Exploration

We operate three exploration permits in the Browse
Basin, offshore northwest Australia, in which we own a 40 percent interest in permits WA-315-P, WA-398-P and TP 28, of the Greater Poseidon Area. The TP 28 Western Australia State exploration permit was granted for five years from January 2017, with
a 40 percent working interest and was excised from the existing permits as agreed between state and federal regulators. Phase I of the Browse Basin drilling campaign in 2009/2010 resulted in three discoveries in the Greater Poseidon Area:
Poseidon-1, Poseidon-2 and Kronos-1. Phase II of the drilling campaign resulted in five additional discoveries: Boreas-1, Zephyros-1, Proteus-1 SD2, Poseidon-North-1 and Pharos-1. All wells have been completed, plugged and abandoned.

We operate two retention leases in the Bonaparte Basin, offshore northern Australia, where we own a 37.5 percent interest in leases NT/RL5 and

which is currently proceeding before an arbitral tribunal under the World Bank’s International Centre for Settlement for Investment Disputes (ICSID). The ICSID Tribunal is determining the damages owed to ConocoPhillips as a result of
Venezuela’s unlawful expropriation of ConocoPhillips’ significant oil investments in the Petrozuata and Hamaca heavy crude oil projects and the offshore Corocoro development project in June 2007. In October 2016, ConocoPhillips brought
fraudulent transfer actions in the U.S. District Court of Delaware against PDVSA, alleging that PDVSA has taken actions to improperly expatriate assets from the United States to Venezuela in an effort to avoid judgment creditors. For additional
information, see Note 13—Contingencies and Commitments, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Ecuador

In December 2012, an ICSID Tribunal issued a decision on liability in favor of Burlington Resources, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of ConocoPhillips,
finding that Ecuador’s seizure of Blocks 7 and 21 was an unlawful expropriation in violation of the Ecuador-U.S. Bilateral Investment Treaty. In February 2017, the tribunal unanimously awarded Burlington $380 million for Ecuador’s unlawful
expropriation and breach of theU.S.-Ecuadorbilateral investment treaty. The tribunal also issued a separate decision finding Ecuador to be entitled to $42 million for limited environmental and infrastructure
impacts associated with the operations of Burlington and its co-venturer. Ecuador recently filed a request for annulment of this decision with ICSID. The schedule for the annulment process has not yet been set. For additional information, see Note
