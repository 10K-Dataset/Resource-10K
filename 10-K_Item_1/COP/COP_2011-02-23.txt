Items 1 and 2. BUSINESS AND PROPERTIES



CORPORATE STRUCTURE

ConocoPhillips is an international, integrated energy company. ConocoPhillips was incorporated in
the state of Delaware on November 16, 2001, in connection with, and in anticipation of, the merger
between Conoco Inc. and Phillips Petroleum Company. The merger between Conoco and Phillips was
consummated on August 30, 2002.

Our business is organized into six operating segments:

•Exploration and Production (E&P)—This segment primarily explores for, produces,
transports and markets crude oil, bitumen, natural gas, liquefied natural gas (LNG) and
natural gas liquids on a worldwide basis.•Midstream—This segment gathers, processes and markets natural gas produced by
ConocoPhillips and others, and fractionates and markets natural gas liquids, predominantly
in the United States and Trinidad. The Midstream segment primarily consists of our 50
percent equity investment in DCP Midstream, LLC.•Refining and Marketing (R&M)—This segment purchases, refines, markets and transports
crude oil and petroleum products, mainly in the United States, Europe and Asia.•LUKOIL Investment—This segment consists of our investment in the ordinary shares of OAO
LUKOIL, an international, integrated oil and gas company headquartered in Russia. At
December 31, 2010, our ownership interest was 2.25 percent based on issued shares. See
Note 6—Investments, Loans and Long-Term Receivables, in the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements, for information on sales of LUKOIL shares.•Chemicals—This segment manufactures and markets petrochemicals and plastics on a
worldwide basis. The Chemicals segment consists of our 50 percent equity investment in
Chevron Phillips Chemical Company LLC (CPChem).•Emerging Businesses—This segment represents our investment in new technologies or
businesses outside our normal scope of operations.

At December 31, 2010, ConocoPhillips employed approximately 29,700 people.







SEGMENT AND GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION

For operating segment and geographic information, see Note 25—Segment Disclosures and Related
Information, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which is incorporated herein by

EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION (E&P)

At December 31, 2010, our E&P segment represented 63 percent of ConocoPhillips’ total assets. This
segment primarily explores for, produces, transports and markets crude oil, bitumen, natural gas
and natural gas liquids on a worldwide basis. Operations to liquefy natural gas and transport the
resulting LNG are also included in the E&P segment. At December 31, 2010, our E&P operations were
producing in the United States, Norway, the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, offshore Timor-Leste
in the Timor Sea, Indonesia, China, Vietnam, Libya, Nigeria, Algeria, Qatar and Russia.

The E&P segment does not include the financial results or statistics from our investment in the
ordinary shares of LUKOIL, which are reported in our LUKOIL Investment segment. As a result,
references to results, production, prices and other statistics throughout the E&P segment
discussion exclude amounts related to our investment in LUKOIL. However, our share of LUKOIL is
included in the “Oil and Gas Operations” disclosures, as well as in the following net proved
reserves table, for periods before we ceased using equity-method accounting for this investment,
which occurred at the end of the third quarter of 2010.

The information listed below appears in the “Oil and Gas Operations” disclosures following the
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and is incorporated herein by reference:

•Proved worldwide crude oil and natural gas liquids, natural gas, bitumen and synthetic
oil reserves.•Net production of crude oil and natural gas liquids, natural gas, bitumen and synthetic
oil.•Average sales prices of crude oil and natural gas liquids, natural gas, bitumen and
synthetic oil.•Average production costs per barrel of oil equivalent (BOE).•Net wells completed, wells in progress and productive wells.•Developed and undeveloped acreage.





The following table is a summary of the proved reserves information included in the “Oil and Gas
Operations” disclosures following the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Approximately 75
percent of our proved reserves are located in politically stable countries that belong to the
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. Natural gas reserves are converted to BOE
based on a 6:1 ratio: six thousand cubic feet of natural gas converts to one BOE. See Management’s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for a discussion of
factors that will enhance the understanding of the table below.

In 2010, E&P’s worldwide production, including its share of equity affiliates, averaged
1,752,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (BOED), compared with 1,854,000 BOED in 2009. During
2010, 686,000 BOED were produced in the United States, a 9 percent decrease from 755,000 BOED in
2009. Production from our international E&P operations averaged 1,066,000 BOED in 2010, a 3
percent decrease from 1,099,000 BOED in 2009. Worldwide production decreased primarily due to
field decline, the impact of higher prices on production sharing arrangements and the sale of our
Syncrude oil sands mining operation. These decreases were partially offset by production from
major projects in China, Canada, Qatar, the Lower 48 and Australia.

E&P’s worldwide annual average crude oil and natural gas liquids sales price increased 31 percent,
from $55.63 per barrel in 2009 to $72.77 per barrel in 2010. Worldwide bitumen prices increased 18
percent, from $44.84 per barrel in 2009 to $53.06 per barrel in 2010. E&P’s average annual
worldwide natural gas sales price increased 14 percent, from $4.37 per thousand cubic feet in 2009
to $4.98 per thousand cubic feet in 2010.

E&P—UNITED STATES

In 2010, U.S. E&P operations contributed 40 percent of E&P’s worldwide liquids production and 39
percent of natural gas production, compared with 40 and 41 percent in 2009, respectively.





AlaskaGreater Prudhoe AreaThe Greater Prudhoe Area includes the Prudhoe Bay Field and five satellite fields, as well as the
Greater Point McIntyre Area fields. Prudhoe Bay, the largest oil field on Alaska’s North Slope, is
the site of a large waterflood and enhanced oil recovery operation, as well as a gas processing
plant that processes and re-injects natural gas into the reservoir. Prudhoe Bay’s satellites are
Aurora, Borealis, Polaris, Midnight Sun and Orion, while the Point McIntyre, Niakuk, Raven and
Lisburne Fields are part of the Greater Point McIntyre Area. We have a 36.1 percent nonoperator
interest in all fields within the Greater Prudhoe Area. Net oil and natural gas liquids production
from the Greater Prudhoe Area averaged 113,000 barrels per day in 2010, compared with 119,000
barrels per day in 2009.

Greater Kuparuk AreaWe operate the Greater Kuparuk Area, which is made up of the Kuparuk Field and four satellite
fields: Tarn, Tabasco, Meltwater and West Sak. Kuparuk is located 40 miles west of Prudhoe Bay on
Alaska’s North Slope. Our ownership interest in the area is approximately 55 percent. Field
installations include three central production facilities that separate oil, natural gas and water.
The natural gas is either used for fuel or compressed for re-injection. Net oil production from
the area averaged 60,000 barrels per day in 2010, compared with 65,000 barrels per day in 2009.

Western North SlopeOn the Western North Slope we operate the Colville River Unit, which includes the Alpine Field and
three satellite fields: Nanuq, Fiord and Qannik. Alpine is located 34 miles west of Kuparuk. Our
ownership interest in the area is 78 percent. Net production in 2010 was 59,000 barrels of oil per
day, compared with 68,000 barrels per day in 2009. Further development of potential satellite
fields west of Alpine and into the National Petroleum Reserve—Alaska (NPRA) is contingent upon the
receipt of permit approvals and additional exploration appraisal work. Planned development of one
of these satellites, the Alpine West CD5 Project, was postponed due to the denial of a key permit
from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers in February 2010. We appealed their decision, and in
December 2010, a ruling on our appeal remanded the matter back to the agency’s district office in
Alaska for further review.

Cook Inlet AreaWe operate the North Cook Inlet Unit, the Beluga River Unit, and the Kenai LNG Plant in the Cook
Inlet Area. We have a 100 percent interest in the North Cook Inlet Unit, while we own 33.3 percent
of the Beluga River Unit. Net production in 2010 from the Cook Inlet Area averaged 73 million
cubic feet per day of natural gas, compared with 85 million cubic feet per day in 2009. Production
from the North Cook Inlet Unit is used primarily to supply our share of natural gas to the Kenai
LNG Plant and also as a backup supply to local utilities, while gas from the Beluga River Unit is
primarily sold to local utilities and is used as backup supply to the Kenai LNG Plant.

We have a 70 percent interest in the Kenai LNG Plant, which supplies LNG to two utility companies
in Japan. We sold 17 net billion cubic feet of LNG in 2010, compared with 21 billion cubic feet in
2009. On February 9, 2011, we announced that due to market conditions we will cease LNG exports
from the Kenai LNG Plant, effective in the second quarter of 2011, and will begin mothballing the
facility for potential future use.

ExplorationIn a February 2008 lease sale conducted by the U. S. Department of Interior (DOI) under the Outer
Continental Shelf (OCS) Lands Act, we successfully bid and were awarded 10-year-primary-term leases
on 98 blocks in the Chukchi Sea, for total bid payments of $506 million. Various special interest
groups have brought two separate lawsuits challenging (1) the DOI’s entire OCS leasing program, and
(2) the Chukchi Sea lease sale conducted by the DOI under that program. Due to continued pending
litigation and associated injunctions, our plans for drilling an exploration well on our Chukchi
Sea leases remain under review.

In January 2010, we exchanged a 25 percent working interest in 50 of our leases in the Chukchi Sea
for cash consideration and additional working interests in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico (GOM). In
late 2010, we entered into an agreement to farm-down an additional 10 percent of our working
interest in the same Chukchi





Sea leases, and that agreement is subject to regulatory approval. In
addition, we participated in two appraisal wells in the Point Thomson Unit, where development
options are currently being evaluated.

TransportationWe transport the petroleum liquids produced on the North Slope to south-central Alaska through an
800-mile pipeline that is part of the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System (TAPS). We have a 28.3 percent
ownership interest in TAPS, and we also have ownership interests in the Alpine, Kuparuk and Oliktok
Pipelines on the North Slope.

Our wholly owned subsidiary, Polar Tankers, Inc., manages the marine transportation of our North
Slope production, using five company-owned double-hulled tankers in addition to chartering
third-party vessels as necessary.

In 2008, ConocoPhillips and BP plc formed a limited liability company to progress the pipeline
project named Denali—The Alaska Gas Pipeline. The project would move natural gas from Alaska’s
North Slope to North American markets. Denali conducted an open season during 2010, a process in
which the pipeline company solicits customers to make long-term firm transportation commitments to
the project. There is a pipeline project competing with Denali that is structured under the Alaska
Gasline Inducement Act. Both projects are currently evaluating bids received from potential
customers during their respective open seasons and are engaged in confidential negotiations with
those bidders.

U.S. Lower 48Gulf of MexicoAt year-end 2010, our portfolio of producing properties in the GOM mainly consisted of one operated
field and three fields operated by co-venturers, including:

•75 percent operator interest in the Magnolia Field in Garden Banks Blocks 783 and 784.•16 percent nonoperator interest in the unitized Ursa Field located in the Mississippi
Canyon Area.•16 percent nonoperator interest in the Princess Field, a northern, sub-salt extension of
the Ursa Field.•12.4 percent nonoperator interest in the unitized K2 Field, comprised of seven blocks in
the Green Canyon Area.

Net production from our GOM properties averaged 18,000 barrels per day of liquids and 20 million
cubic feet per day of natural gas in 2010, compared with 21,000 barrels per day and 28 million
cubic feet per day in 2009.

OnshoreOur 2010 onshore production principally consisted of natural gas and associated liquids production,
with the majority of production located in the San Juan Basin, Permian Basin, Lobo Trend, Bossier
Trend, Fort Worth Basin, panhandles of Texas and Oklahoma and Williston Basin. We also have
operations in the Wind River and Anadarko Basins, as well as in East Texas and northern and
southern Louisiana.

Onshore activities in 2010 were centered mostly on continued optimization and development of
existing assets, with particular focus on areas with higher liquids production. Total net
production from all Lower 48 onshore fields in 2010 averaged 1,675 million cubic feet per day of
natural gas and 142,000 barrels per day of liquids, compared with 1,899 million cubic feet per day
and 145,000 barrels per day in 2009.

•Shale PlaysExploration and development continues in our shale positions in Eagle Ford, Bakken and
Barnett, which produced approximately 36,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2010. We
plan to drill approximately 150 exploration and development wells in the Eagle Ford in 2011
and, with subsequent investments, expect to achieve peak production in 2013 and long-term
average production of 65,000 to 70,000 barrels per day. We acquired approximately 90,000
additional acres in various resource plays across the Lower 48 during 2010, further
expanding our significant acreage position in Lower 48 shale plays.





•San JuanThe San Juan Basin, located in northwestern New Mexico and southwestern Colorado, includes
the majority of our U.S. coalbed methane (CBM) production. Additionally, we continue to
pursue development opportunities in three conventional formations in the San Juan Basin.
Net production
from San Juan averaged 799 million cubic feet per day of natural gas and 50,000 barrels per
day of liquids in 2010, compared with 903 million cubic feet per day and 49,000 barrels per
day in 2009.

ExplorationIn January 2010, we exchanged a 25 percent working interest in 50 of our leases in the Chukchi Sea
for cash consideration and additional working interests in the deepwater GOM. We were also the
successful bidder on 10 blocks in the March 2010 federal offshore lease sale. At year end, we had
interests in 274 lease blocks totaling 1.1 million net acres offshore GOM.

In May 2010, in response to the Deepwater Horizon incident in the GOM, the DOI issued a six-month
drilling moratorium on new deepwater wells in the OCS, which was scheduled to expire on November
30, 2010. On October 12, 2010, the DOI lifted the ban, citing new regulatory requirements which
would reduce the risks associated with deepwater drilling. The new rules are aimed at improving
safety and environmental standards and include strengthened requirements on safety equipment, well
control systems, blowout prevention practices and emergency response on offshore oil and gas
operations.

The new regulations have created delays in the permitting process and deepwater exploratory
drilling in the GOM. As a result, we have been unable to drill any GOM prospects or appraise the
Tiber and Shenandoah discoveries, which occurred in 2009. Although there are no material impacts
to our near-term production, the future effects of this incident, including any new or additional
regulations that may be adopted in response, are not clearly known at this time. We will continue
to evaluate the impact on our exploration prospects in the GOM.

Onshore, we actively pursued the appraisal of our existing shale plays in Eagle Ford in South
Texas, the Bakken in the Williston Basin and the Barnett in the Fort Worth Basin. We have seen
encouraging results in these liquids-rich plays and plan to continue appraisal and development in
2011.

TransportationWe own a 25 percent interest in the Rockies Express Pipeline (REX). REX is a 1,679-mile natural
gas pipeline stretching from northwestern Colorado to eastern Ohio, which became fully operational
in November 2009. REX has the capacity to deliver 1.8 billion cubic feet of natural gas per day to
eastern markets.

E&P—EUROPE

In 2010, E&P operations in Europe contributed 21 percent of E&P’s worldwide liquids production,
compared with 23 percent in 2009. European operations contributed 18 percent of natural gas
production in 2010 and 2009. Our European assets are principally located in the Norwegian and U.K.
sectors of the North Sea.

NorwayWe operate and hold a 35.1 percent interest in the Greater Ekofisk Area, located approximately 200
miles offshore Norway in the North Sea. The Greater Ekofisk Area is composed of four producing
fields: Ekofisk, Eldfisk, Embla and Tor. Net production in 2010 from the Greater Ekofisk Area was
80,000 barrels of liquids per day and 79 million cubic feet of natural gas per day, compared with
92,000 barrels per day and 89 million cubic feet per day in 2009.

We also have varying ownership interests in eight other producing fields in the Norwegian sector of
the North Sea and in the Norwegian Sea. Net production from these fields averaged 57,000 barrels
of liquids per day and 130 million cubic feet of natural gas per day in 2010, compared with 68,000
barrels per day and 128 million cubic feet per day in 2009.





ExplorationWe participated in two exploration wells during 2010. Both the Megalodon and Dalsnuten wells
failed to find commercial hydrocarbons and were expensed as dry holes.

TransportationWe have interests in the transportation and processing infrastructure in the Norwegian sector of
the North Sea, including interests in the Norpipe Oil Pipeline System and in Gassled, which owns
most of the Norwegian gas transportation system.

United KingdomIn addition to our 58.7 percent interest in the Britannia natural gas and condensate field, we own
50 percent of Britannia Operator Limited, the operator of the field. We also have an 83.5 percent
interest and a 75 percent interest in the Callanish and Brodgar Britannia satellite fields,
respectively. Net production from Britannia and its satellite fields averaged 302 million cubic
feet of natural gas per day and 39,000 barrels of liquids per day in 2010, compared with 304
million cubic feet per day and 40,000 barrels per day in 2009.

We operate and hold a 36.5 percent interest in the Judy/Joanne/Jasmine Fields, which together make
up J-Block, located in the U.K. central North Sea. Additionally, our operated Jade Field, in which
we hold a 32.5 percent interest, produces from a wellhead platform and pipeline tied to the J-Block
facilities. The Judy/Joanne/Jade Fields produced a net 11,000 barrels of liquids per day and 82
million cubic feet of natural gas per day in 2010, compared with 12,000 barrels per day and 96
million cubic feet per day in 2009. In 2010, we received government approval for the development
of the Jasmine Field, which is expected to startup in 2012, and achieve average net peak production
of 35,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day by 2013.

Our various ownership interests in 18 producing gas fields in the Rotliegendes and Carboniferous
Areas of the Southern North Sea yielded average net production in 2010 of 150 million cubic feet
per day of natural gas, compared with 185 million cubic feet per day in 2009.

The Millom, Dalton and Calder Fields in the East Irish Sea, in which we have a 100 percent
ownership interest, are operated on our behalf by a third party. Net production in 2010 averaged
61 million cubic feet of natural gas per day, compared with 60 million cubic feet per day in 2009.

In the Atlantic Margin, we have a 24 percent interest in the Clair Field. Net production in 2010
averaged 9,000 barrels of liquids per day, compared with 12,000 barrels per day in 2009.

We also have ownership interests in several other producing fields in the U.K. sector of the North
Sea. Net production from these fields averaged 15,000 barrels of liquids per day and 11 million
cubic feet of natural gas per day in 2010, compared with 16,000 barrels per day and 12 million
cubic feet per day in 2009.

ExplorationWe were awarded six blocks in the U.K. 26thLicensing Round. Three are in close
proximity to our producing J-Block infrastructure in the central North Sea, while one is adjacent
to our Britannia Field. The remaining blocks represent growth opportunities in the Dutch Bank
Basin of the North Sea.

TransportationWe have a 10 percent interest in the Interconnector Pipeline, which links the United Kingdom and
Belgium and facilitates marketing natural gas produced in the United Kingdom throughout Europe. We
have export capability to ship up to 220 million cubic feet of natural gas per day to markets in
continental Europe via the Interconnector, and our reverse-flow rights provide 85 million cubic
feet per day of import capability into the United Kingdom.

We operate the Teesside oil and Theddlethorpe gas terminals, in which we have 29.3 percent and 50
percent ownership interests, respectively. We also have a 100 percent ownership interest in the
Rivers Gas Terminal, operated by a third party, in the United Kingdom.





PolandExplorationWe are participating in a shale gas venture in Poland that provides us with the opportunity to
evaluate and earn a 70 percent interest in six exploration licenses in the Baltic Basin. We
drilled two wells in 2010 and plan to continue appraisal of the play in 2011.

E&P—CANADA

E&P operations in Canada contributed 11 percent of E&P’s worldwide liquids production in 2010 and
2009. Canadian operations contributed 21 percent of E&P’s worldwide natural gas production in
2010, compared with 22 percent in 2009.

Western CanadaOperations in western Canada encompass oil and gas properties throughout Alberta, northeastern
British Columbia, and southern Saskatchewan. Net production from western Canada averaged 984
million cubic feet per day of natural gas and 38,000 barrels per day of liquids in 2010, compared
with 1,062 million cubic feet per day and 40,000 barrels per day in 2009. Our 2010 drilling
program focused on the development and exploitation of several liquids-rich resource opportunities,
which included the Cardium Formation that lies primarily on our existing land base within the Deep
Basin and central Alberta. We initiated temporary production curtailments of approximately 150
million cubic feet equivalent per day from September through early December 2010, in response to
continued low natural gas prices in western Canada.

SurmontWe operate and have a 50 percent interest in the Surmont oil sands lease, located approximately 35
miles south of Fort McMurray, Alberta. An enhanced thermal oil recovery method called
steam-assisted gravity drainage (SAGD) is used at Surmont. The average net production of bitumen
during 2010 was 10,000 barrels per day, compared with 7,000 barrels per day in 2009. Surmont Phase
II construction began in 2010, with a targeted production startup in 2015. Surmont’s net
production is expected to increase to 50,000 barrels per day by 2017.

FCCLWe have two 50/50 North American heavy oil business ventures with Cenovus Energy Inc.: FCCL
Partnership, a Canadian upstream general partnership, and WRB Refining LP, a U.S. downstream
limited partnership. FCCL’s assets, operated by Cenovus, include the Foster Creek and Christina
Lake SAGD bitumen projects, both located in the eastern flank of the Athabasca oil sands in
northeastern Alberta. Our share of FCCL’s production increased to 49,000 barrels per day in 2010,
compared with 43,000 barrels per day in 2009. In the third quarter of 2010, FCCL received
regulatory approval for Phases F, G and H at Foster Creek. Construction of Christina Lake Phase C
continued in 2010, with first production expected in the second half of 2011. Construction of
Christina Lake Phase D also continued through 2010. See the “Refining and Marketing (R&M)” section
for information on WRB.

Syncrude Canada Ltd.We sold our 9.03 percent interest in the Syncrude Canada Ltd. joint venture in June 2010 for $4.6
billion. Syncrude had synthetic oil proved reserves of 248 million barrels at December 31, 2009.
Production averaged 12,000 barrels per day in 2010, compared with 23,000 barrels per day in 2009.

Parsons Lake/Mackenzie Gas ProjectWe are involved with three other energy companies, as members of the Mackenzie Delta Producers’
Group, on the development of the Mackenzie Valley Pipeline and gathering system, which is proposed
to transport onshore gas production from the Mackenzie Delta in northern Canada to established
markets in North America. We have a 75 percent interest in the Parsons Lake gas field, one of the
primary fields in the Mackenzie Delta, which would anchor the pipeline development. The project is
in the final stage of regulatory approval, anticipated in early 2011; however, detailed engineering
work continues to be deferred pending resolution with the Canadian government on the fiscal and
commercial framework.





ExplorationWe hold exploration acreage in four areas of Canada: offshore eastern Canada, onshore western
Canada, the Mackenzie Delta/Beaufort Sea Region, and the Arctic Islands. During 2010, we completed
drilling an exploration well in the Laurentian Basin, located offshore eastern Canada, which did
not find commercial quantities of hydrocarbons and was expensed as a dry hole. In western Canada,
we participated in 28 wells resulting in 20 discoveries.

E&P—SOUTH AMERICA

VenezuelaIn 2007, we announced we had been unable to reach agreement with respect to our migration to anempresa mixtastructure mandated by the Venezuelan government’s Nationalization Decree. As a
result, Venezuela’s national oil company, Petróleos de Venezuela S.A. (PDVSA), or its affiliates,
directly assumed control over ConocoPhillips’ interests in the Petrozuata and Hamaca heavy oil
ventures and the offshore Corocoro development project. In response to this expropriation, we
filed a request for international arbitration on November 2, 2007, with the World Bank’s
International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID). An arbitration hearing was
held during 2010 before ICSID. We are awaiting their decision.

EcuadorIn 2008, Burlington Resources, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of ConocoPhillips, initiated
arbitration before ICSID against The Republic of Ecuador and PetroEcuador, as a result of the
newly enacted Windfall Profits Tax Law and government-mandated renegotiation of our production
sharing contracts. Despite a restraining order issued by ICSID, Ecuador confiscated the crude oil
production of Burlington and its co-venturer and sold the illegally seized crude oil. In 2009,
Ecuador took over operations in Blocks 7 and 21, fully expropriating our assets. In June 2010, the
ICSID tribunal concluded it has jurisdiction to hear the expropriation claim. A hearing on case
merits is scheduled for March 2011. For additional information, see Note 10—Impairments, in the
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

ExplorationIn November 2010, Burlington Resources, Inc., and PetroEcuador signed termination agreements for
exploration Blocks 23 and 24, ending our participation in both blocks.

PeruExplorationDuring 2010, we executed two farm-downs that reduced our interests in Blocks 123, 124 and 129,
which are awaiting final government approval. We are currently completing the initial 2D seismic
program for Blocks 123 and 129 and plan to analyze the results in 2011. We also own a 35 percent
working interest in Block 39.

E&P—ASIA PACIFIC/MIDDLE EAST

In 2010, E&P operations in the Asia Pacific/Middle East Region contributed 15 percent of E&P’s
worldwide liquids production and 19 percent of natural gas production, compared with 13 percent and
16 percent in 2009, respectively.

Australia and Timor SeaAustralia Pacific LNGAustralia Pacific LNG (APLNG), our 50/50 joint venture with Origin Energy, is focused on producing
CBM from the Bowen and Surat Basins in Queensland, Australia. Gas is currently sold to domestic
customers, while progress continues on the development of an LNG processing and export sales
business. Once established, this will enhance our LNG position and serve as an additional LNG hub
targeting Asia Pacific markets. Two initial 4.2-million-tons-per-year LNG trains are anticipated,
with over 10,000 gross wells ultimately envisioned to supply both the domestic gas market and the
LNG development. The additional wells will be supported by expanded gas gathering systems,
centralized gas processing and compression stations, and water treatment facilities, in addition to
a new export pipeline from the gas fields to the LNG facilities.





Our share of the joint venture’s production in 2010 was 115 million cubic feet per day of natural
gas, compared with 84 million cubic feet per day in 2009. CBM field development work is ongoing in
parallel with front-end engineering associated with the planned LNG processing facilities.
Engagement with potential LNG buyers continues to progress, and a final investment decision on the
initial phase of the project is planned for mid-2011.

In November 2010, the APLNG LNG development project received environmental approval from
Australia’s Queensland state. In late February 2011, the project
received environmental approval from the Australian federal
government.

Bayu-UndanWe operate and hold a 57.2 percent ownership interest in the Bayu-Undan Field located in the Timor
Sea. Net production from the field averaged 31,000 barrels of liquids per day in 2010, compared
with 35,000 barrels per day in 2009. Our share of natural gas production was 198 million cubic
feet per day in 2010, compared with 216 million cubic feet per day in 2009. Produced natural gas
is used to supply the Darwin LNG Plant, in which we own a 57.2 percent interest. In 2010, we sold
147 billion gross cubic feet of LNG to utility customers in Japan, compared with 156 billion cubic
feet in 2009.

Greater SunriseWe have a 30 percent interest in the Greater Sunrise gas and condensate field located in the Timor
Sea. Although agreement has been reached between the governments of Australia and Timor-Leste
concerning sharing of revenues from the anticipated development of Greater Sunrise, key challenges
must be resolved before significant funding commitments can be made. These include gaining both
governments’ approval of the development concept selected by the co-venturers and establishing
fiscal stability arrangements.

Western AustraliaOur share of production from the Athena/Perseus (WA-17-L) gas field, located offshore Western
Australia, was 35 million cubic feet of natural gas per day in both 2010 and 2009.

ExplorationWe operate and own a 60 percent interest in three permits located in the Browse Basin, offshore
northwest Australia. During 2010, we continued the exploration and appraisal programs and drilled
two wells, Poseidon-2 and Kronos-1, both of which encountered hydrocarbons. We intend to carry out
a second phase of drilling in the Browse Basin during 2011 and 2012. Analysis of the
recently acquired seismic survey over the discovered resource area is ongoing.

QatarQatargas 3 (QG3) is an integrated project jointly owned by Qatar Petroleum (68.5 percent),
ConocoPhillips (30 percent) and Mitsui & Co., Ltd. (1.5 percent). The project comprises upstream
natural gas production facilities to produce approximately 1.4 billion gross cubic feet per day of
natural gas from Qatar’s North Field over a 25 year life. The project also includes a 7.8-million-gross-ton-per-year LNG facility, from which LNG is shipped in leased LNG carriers destined
for sale in the United States and other markets. First production was achieved in October 2010,
with eight LNG cargoes loaded and shipped in 2010.

We have a 12.4 percent ownership interest in the Golden Pass LNG Terminal and affiliated Golden
Pass Pipeline. The terminal is currently under construction adjacent to the Sabine-Neches
Industrial Ship Channel northwest of Sabine Pass, Texas. Definitive terminal and pipeline use
agreements have been reached, which will provide us with terminal and pipeline capacity for the
receipt, storage and regasification of the LNG purchased from QG3 and the transportation of
regasified LNG to interconnect with major interstate natural gas pipelines.

IndonesiaWe operate seven production sharing contracts (PSCs) in Indonesia. Three of these PSCs are in
various stages of development from which net production averaged 463 million cubic feet per day of
natural gas and 17,000 barrels per day of liquids in 2010, compared with 447 million
cubic feet per day and 19,000 barrels per day in 2009. Our producing assets are primarily
concentrated in two core areas:  South Natuna Sea and onshore South Sumatra.





South Natuna Sea Block BThe offshore South Natuna Sea Block B PSC, in which we have a 40 percent interest, has two
producing oil fields and 16 natural gas fields in various stages of development. Natural gas
production is sold under international sales agreements to Malaysia and Singapore.

South SumatraThese onshore blocks consist of the Corridor and South Jambi B PSCs. The Corridor PSC, in which we
have a 54 percent interest, has six oil fields and six natural gas fields in various stages of
development. Natural gas is supplied from the Grissik and Suban gas processing plants to the Duri
steamflood in central Sumatra and to markets in Singapore, Batam and West Java. Unitization of the
Suban natural gas field commenced in 2010, reflecting that approximately 8 percent of the field’s
proved reserves are now attributable to an adjacent PSC. The unitization is expected to be
finalized during 2011. We have a 45 percent interest in the South Jambi B PSC, which supplies
natural gas to Singapore.

ExplorationWe operate three offshore exploration PSCs: Amborip VI, Kuma and Arafura Sea, with interests
ranging from 60 to 100 percent. We began exploration drilling in the fourth quarter of 2010. The
first well drilled on these offshore PSCs was the Aru-1. We did not find recoverable resources
with the well, and it was expensed as a dry hole in the fourth quarter of 2010. We also operate
and own an 80 percent interest in the Warim onshore exploration PSC in Papua.

TransportationWe are a 35 percent owner of a consortium company that has a 40 percent ownership in PT
Transportasi Gas Indonesia, which owns and operates the Grissik to Duri and Grissik to Singapore
natural gas pipelines.

ChinaWe are the operator and have a 49 percent share of the Peng Lai 19-3 Field in Bohai Bay Block
11-05, as well as the nearby Peng Lai 19-9 and Peng Lai 25-6 Fields. As part of our Bohai Bay
Phase II Project, a floating production, storage and offloading (FPSO) vessel is used to
accommodate production from these fields. Net production averaged 56,000 barrels of oil per day in
2010, compared with 33,000 barrels per day in 2009. Production from the Peng Lai area is expected
to increase due to continued development of Peng Lai 19-3, with annual average net production of
60,000 barrels of oil per day anticipated in 2011.

The Xijiang development consisted of two fields located approximately 80 miles south of Hong Kong
in the South China Sea. Combined net production of oil from the Xijiang Fields averaged 1,000
barrels per day in 2010, compared with 5,000 barrels per day in 2009. Under the terms of the
contract, our ownership rights in the 24-3/1 Field ended in January 2010, and our rights in the
30-2 Field ended in November 2010. Our ownership in these fields was 24.5 percent and 12.3
percent, respectively.

We have a 24.5 percent interest in the offshore Panyu development, also located in the South China
Sea, which produced 11,000 net barrels of oil per day in both 2010 and 2009. We plan to expand the
scope and capacity of the existing two fields and anticipate government approval of the expansion
in the first half of 2011.

ExplorationIn 2009, we entered a pilot evaluation program in a CBM play in the onshore Qinshui Basin. The
pilot program was expected to last between 12-18 months and involved drilling and monitoring the
production performance of a series of horizontal wells. In the fourth quarter of 2010, we
terminated our involvement in this program.

VietnamOur ownership interest in Vietnam is centered around the Cuu Long Basin in the South China Sea and
consists of two primarily oil-producing blocks and one gas pipeline transportation system.

We have a 23.3 percent interest in Block 15-1, and our activities are focused around three
producing fields: Su Tu Den, Su Tu Den Northeast and Su Tu Vang; and two fields in development: Su
Tu Trang and Su Tu Nau. First production on the Su Tu Den Northeast Field occurred in May 2010,
averaging a net 4,000 barrels of oil





per day and 4 million cubic feet per day of natural gas. Net production from the three producing
fields averaged 18,000 barrels of oil per day in 2010, compared with 22,000 barrels per day in
2009.

We have a 36 percent interest in the Rang Dong Field in Block 15-2. Net production in 2010 was
6,000 barrels per day of liquids and 12 million cubic feet per day of natural gas, compared with
7,000 barrels per day and 15 million cubic feet per day in 2009.

TransportationWe own a 16.3 percent interest in the Nam Con Son natural gas pipeline. This 244-mile
transportation system links gas supplies from the Nam Con Son Basin to gas markets in southern
Vietnam.

MalaysiaWe own interests in three deepwater PSCs located off the eastern Malaysian state of Sabah: Block G,
Block J, and the Kebabangan Cluster. We have a 35 percent interest in Block G, 40 percent in Block
J, and 30 percent in the Kebabangan Cluster. Development of the Gumusut deepwater oil discovery in
Block J continues and includes the installation of a semi-submersible oil production platform.
First production for Gumusut is anticipated in 2013, with estimated net peak production of 29,000
barrels of liquids per day occurring in 2014.

ExplorationDuring 2010, we participated in the Ubah-4 appraisal well in Block G. The well was suspended in
order to evaluate development options for the area.

BangladeshExplorationWe were formally awarded two deepwater blocks offshore Bangladesh in 2009. PSC negotiations are
currently underway with government authorities.

Abu DhabiIn April 2010, we decided to end participation in development of the Shah Gas Field in Abu Dhabi,
United Arab Emirates.

E&P—AFRICA

During 2010, E&P operations in Africa contributed 8 percent of E&P’s worldwide liquids production
and 3 percent of natural gas production, compared with 7 percent and 2 percent, respectively, in
2009.

NigeriaWe have a 20 percent nonoperating interest in four onshore Oil Mining Leases (OMLs). In 2010, net
production from these leases was 20,000 barrels of liquids per day and 141 million cubic feet of
natural gas per day, compared with 19,000 barrels per day and 111 million cubic feet per day in
2009.

Natural gas is sourced from our proved reserves in the OMLs and provides fuel for a 480-megawatt
gas-fired power plant in Kwale, Nigeria. We have a 20 percent interest in this power plant, which
supplies electricity to Nigeria’s national electricity supplier. In 2010, the plant consumed 5
million net cubic feet per day of natural gas.

We have a 17 percent equity interest in Brass LNG Limited, which plans to construct an LNG facility
in the Niger Delta.

gross acres. Net oil production averaged 46,000 barrels per day in 2010, versus 45,000 barrels per
day in 2009.





AlgeriaOur activities in Algeria are centered around three fields in Block 405a: the Menzel Lejmat North
Field (MLN), the Ourhoud Field, and the EMK Field. We operate and have a 65 percent interest in
MLN, and we have a 3.7 percent interest in Ourhoud and a 16.9 percent interest in EMK. The El Merk
Project was sanctioned in 2009 to develop the EMK Field, and engineering, procurement and
construction is ongoing. Net production from MLN and Ourhoud averaged 13,000 barrels of oil per
day in 2010, compared with 14,000 barrels per day in 2009.

E&P—RUSSIA

NMNGWe have a 30 percent ownership interest with a 50 percent governance interest in OOO
Naryanmarneftegaz (NMNG), a joint venture with LUKOIL. NMNG achieved initial production of the
Yuzhno Khylchuyu (YK) Field in June 2008, and development was completed in 2010. Net production
averaged 45,000 barrels per day in 2010, compared with 46,000 barrels per day in 2009. Production from the NMNG
joint venture fields is transported via pipeline to LUKOIL’s terminal at Varandey Bay on the
Barents Sea and then shipped via tanker to international markets.

Polar LightsWe have a 50 percent equity interest in Polar Lights Company, an entity that owns producing fields
in the Timan-Pechora Basin in northern Russia. Net production averaged 7,000 barrels of oil per
day in 2010, compared with 9,000 barrels per day in 2009.

E&P—CASPIAN

In the Caspian Sea, we have an 8.4 percent interest in the Republic of Kazakhstan’s North Caspian
Sea Production Sharing Agreement, which includes the Kashagan Field. The first phase of field
development currently being executed includes construction of artificial drilling islands with
processing facilities and living quarters, and pipelines to carry production onshore. The initial
production phase of the contract lasts until 2041, with options to extend the agreement an
additional 20 years. A joint operating company, North Caspian Operating Company, oversees the
Kashagan development, and expects first production in late 2012.

TransportationThe Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan (BTC) Pipeline transports crude oil from the Caspian Region through
Azerbaijan, Georgia and Turkey for tanker loadings at the port of Ceyhan. We have a 2.5 percent
interest in BTC.

ExplorationWe have a 24.5 percent interest in the N Block, located offshore Kazakhstan. In the fourth quarter
of 2010, drilling operations were completed on the Rak More well. The well encountered oil and gas
but requires further evaluation to determine commerciality. Further exploration drilling is
planned in 2011 to determine development potential of a second area of interest within the block.
In addition, appraisal drilling and development studies continue for the next phase of Kashagan and
the satellite fields of Kalamkas, Kairan and Aktote.

E&P—OTHER

GreenlandExplorationWe were formally awarded a license in 2010 for oil and gas exploration in Baffin Bay, offshore
Greenland. We will serve as operator, with a 61.3 percent interest in the Qamut Block. Planned
activities in 2011 include field work, environmental assessments, and seismic data acquisition and
evaluation.

Marine Well Containment CompanyDuring 2010, we formed a non-profit organization with Exxon Mobil Corporation, Chevron
Corporation and Royal Dutch Shell plc to develop a new oil spill containment system and improve
industry spill response in the GOM. The





Marine Well Containment Company plans to build and deploy
a rapid response system that will be available to capture and contain oil in the event of a
potential future underwater well blowout in the deepwater GOM.

LNGWe have a long-term agreement with Freeport LNG Development, L.P. to use 0.9 billion cubic feet per
day of regasification capacity at Freeport’s 1.5-billion-cubic-feet-per-day LNG receiving terminal
in Quintana, Texas. Market conditions currently favor the flow of LNG to European and Asian
markets; therefore, our near-to-mid-term utilization of the Freeport Terminal is expected to be limited. We are responsible for
monthly process-or-pay payments to Freeport irrespective of whether we utilize the terminal for
regasification. The financial impact of this capacity underutilization is not expected to be
material to our future earnings or cash flows.

E&P—RESERVES

We have not filed any information with any other federal authority or agency with respect to our
estimated total proved reserves at December 31, 2010. No difference exists between our estimated
total proved reserves for year-end 2009 and year-end 2008, which are shown in this filing, and
estimates of these reserves shown in a filing with another federal agency in 2010.

DELIVERY COMMITMENTS

We sell crude oil and natural gas from our E&P producing operations under a variety of contractual
arrangements, some of which specify the delivery of a fixed and determinable quantity. Our
Commercial organization also enters into natural gas sales contracts where the source of the
natural gas used to fulfill the contract can be the spot market or a combination of our reserves
and the spot market. Worldwide, we are contractually committed to deliver approximately 6 trillion
cubic feet of natural gas, including approximately 700 billion cubic feet related to the
noncontrolling interests of consolidated subsidiaries, and 120 million barrels of crude oil in the
future. These contracts have various expiration dates through the year 2029. We expect to fulfill
the majority of these delivery commitments with proved developed reserves. In addition, we
anticipate using proved undeveloped reserves and spot market purchases to fulfill these
commitments. See the disclosure on “Proved Undeveloped Reserves” in the “Oil and Gas Operations”
section following the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for information on the
development of proved undeveloped reserves.



MIDSTREAM

At December 31, 2010, our Midstream segment represented 2 percent of ConocoPhillips’ total assets.
Our Midstream business is primarily conducted through our 50 percent equity investment in DCP
Midstream, LLC, a joint venture with Spectra Energy.

The Midstream business purchases raw natural gas from producers and gathers natural gas through
extensive pipeline gathering systems. The gathered natural gas is then processed to extract
natural gas liquids. The remaining “residue” gas is marketed to electrical utilities, industrial
users and gas marketing companies. Most of the natural gas liquids are fractionated—separated
into individual components such as ethane, butane and propane—and marketed as chemical feedstock,
fuel or blendstock. Total natural gas liquids extracted in 2010, including our share of DCP
Midstream, were 193,000 barrels per day, compared with 187,000 barrels per day in 2009.

DCP Midstream markets a portion of its natural gas liquids to us and CPChem under a supply
agreement whose volume commitments remain steady until December 31, 2014.
This purchase commitment is on an “if-produced, will-purchase” basis and is expected to have a
relatively stable purchase pattern over the remaining term of the contract. Under the agreement,
natural gas liquids are purchased at various published market index prices, less transportation and
fractionation fees.

DCP Midstream is headquartered in Denver, Colorado. At December 31, 2010, DCP Midstream owned or
operated 55 natural gas liquids extraction and 10 natural gas liquids fractionation plants, and its
gathering and





transmission systems included approximately 61,000 miles of pipeline. In 2010, DCP
Midstream’s raw natural gas throughput averaged 6.1 billion cubic feet per day, and natural gas
liquids extraction averaged

369,000
barrels per day, compared with 6.1 billion cubic feet per day and 358,000 barrels per day in 2009.
DCP Midstream’s assets are primarily located in the following producing regions of the United
States: Rocky Mountains, Midcontinent, Permian, East Texas/North Louisiana, South Texas, Central
Texas and Gulf Coast.

Outside of DCP Midstream, our U.S. natural gas liquids business includes the following:

•A 25,000-barrel-per-day capacity natural gas liquids fractionation plant in Gallup, New
Mexico.•A 22.5 percent equity interest in Gulf Coast Fractionators, which owns a natural gas
liquids fractionation plant in Mont Belvieu, Texas. Our net share of capacity is 24,300
barrels per day. In October 2010, Gulf Coast Fractionators announced plans to expand the
capacity of its fractionation facility to 145,000 barrels per day. The expansion is
expected to be operational in the second quarter of 2012.•A 40 percent interest in a fractionation plant in Conway, Kansas. Our net share of
capacity is 43,200 barrels per day.•A 12.5 percent equity interest in a fractionation plant in Mont Belvieu, Texas. Our net
share of capacity is 26,000 barrels per day.•Marketing operations that optimize the flow of natural gas liquids and markets propane
on a wholesale basis.

We also own a 39 percent equity interest in Phoenix Park Gas Processors Limited, which processes
natural gas in Trinidad and markets natural gas liquids throughout the Atlantic Basin. Its
facilities include a 2-billion-cubic-feet-per-day gas processing plant and a 70,000-barrel-per-day
natural gas liquids fractionator. Our share of natural gas liquids extracted averaged 9,000
barrels per day in 2010, compared with 8,000 barrels per day in 2009. Our share of fractionated
liquids averaged 18,000 barrels per day in 2010, compared with 17,000 barrels per day in 2009.





REFINING AND MARKETING (R&M)At December 31, 2010, our R&M segment represented 24 percent of ConocoPhillips’ total assets. Our
R&M segment primarily refines crude oil and other feedstocks into petroleum products (such as
gasolines, distillates and aviation fuels); buys, sells and transports crude oil; and buys,
transports, distributes and markets petroleum products. R&M has operations in the United States,
Europe and  Asia. The R&M segment does not include the results or statistics

MSLPMerey Sweeny, L.P. (MSLP) is a limited partnership that owns a 70,000-barrel-per-day delayed coker
and related facilities at the Sweeny Refinery. MSLP processes our long residue, which is produced
from heavy sour crude oil, for a processing fee. Fuel-grade petroleum coke is produced as a
by-product and becomes the property of MSLP. Prior to August 28, 2009, MSLP was owned 50/50 by us
and PDVSA. Under the agreements that govern the relationships between the partners, certain
defaults by PDVSA with respect to supply of crude oil to the Sweeny Refinery gave us the right to
acquire PDVSA’s 50 percent ownership interest in MSLP. On August 28, 2009, we exercised that
right. PDVSA has initiated arbitration with the International Chamber of Commerce challenging our
actions, and this arbitration is underway. We continue to use the equity method of accounting for
our investment in MSLP.





WRBWe have two 50/50 North American heavy oil business ventures with Cenovus Energy Inc.: FCCL
Partnership, a Canadian upstream general partnership, and WRB Refining LP, a U.S. downstream
limited partnership. WRB consists of the Wood River and Borger Refineries, located in Roxana,
Illinois, and Borger, Texas, respectively. We are the operator and managing partner of WRB. See
the “Exploration and Production (E&P)” section for additional information on FCCL.

WRB’s processing capability of heavy Canadian crude is currently 145,000 barrels per day. We
continue to progress the coker and refinery expansion (CORE) project at the Wood River Refinery,
with operational startup anticipated in the fourth quarter of 2011. Upon completion of the CORE
Project, total processing capability of heavy Canadian or similar crudes within WRB will increase
to 275,000 barrels per day. The majority of the existing asphalt production at Wood River will be
replaced with production of upgraded products.

Excel ParalubesWe own a 50 percent interest in the Excel Paralubes joint venture, which owns a hydrocracked
lubricant base oil manufacturing plant located adjacent to the Lake Charles Refinery. The facility
produces approximately 20,000 barrels per day of high-quality, clear hydrocracked base oils.

MarketingIn the United States, as of December 31, 2010, we marketed gasoline, diesel and aviation fuel
through approximately 8,300 marketer-owned outlets in 49 states. The majority of these sites
utilize thePhillips 66,Conocoor76brands.

WholesaleAt December 31, 2010, our wholesale operations utilized a network of marketers operating
approximately 7,150 outlets that provided refined product offtake from our refineries. A strong
emphasis is placed on the wholesale channel of trade because of its lower capital requirements. In
addition, we held brand-licensing agreements with approximately 400 sites. We also buy and sell
petroleum products in the spot market. Our refined products are marketed on both a branded and
unbranded basis.

In addition to automotive gasoline and diesel, we produce and market aviation gasoline, which is
used by smaller, piston engine aircraft. At December 31, 2010, aviation gasoline and jet fuel were
sold through independent marketers at approximately 750Phillips 66-branded locations in the United
States.

RetailIn June 2010, we sold our interest in CFJ Properties, a joint venture which owned and operated 110Flying J-branded truck travel plazas.

In December 2006, we announced plans to divest approximately 830 of our U.S. company-owned outlets.
This program was completed during 2010.

LubricantsWe manufacture and sell automotive, commercial and industrial lubricants which are marketed under
thePhillips 66, Conoco, 76andKendallbrands, as well as other private label brands.

TransportationWe distribute refined products to our customers via company-owned and common-carrier pipelines,
barges, railcars and trucks.

Pipelines and TerminalsAt December 31, 2010, R&M managed approximately 24,000 miles of common-carrier crude oil, raw
natural gas liquids, natural gas and petroleum products pipeline systems in the United States,
including those partially owned or operated by affiliates. In addition, we owned or operated 44
finished product terminals, 7 liquefied petroleum gas terminals, 5 crude oil terminals and 1 coke
exporting facility.





TankersAt December 31, 2010, we had 19 double-hulled crude oil tankers under charter, with capacities
ranging in size from 713,000 to 2,100,000 barrels. These tankers are primarily used to transport
feedstocks to certain of our U.S. refineries. In addition, we utilized four double-hulled product
tankers, with capacities ranging from 315,000 to 332,000 barrels, to transport our heavy and clean
products. The tankers discussed here exclude the operations of the company’s subsidiary, Polar
Tankers, Inc., which are discussed in the “Exploration and Production (E&P)” section, as well as an
owned tanker on lease to a third party for use in the North Sea.

Specialty BusinessesWe manufacture and sell a variety of specialty products including petroleum cokes, polypropylene,
pipeline flow improvers and anode material for high-power lithium-ion batteries. We also
manufacture and market high-quality graphite and anode-grade petroleum cokes in the United States

*Includes specialty coke.

We operate a crude oil and products storage complex consisting of 7.5 million barrels of
storage capacity and an offshore mooring buoy, located about 80 miles southwest of the Whitegate
Refinery in Bantry Bay, Ireland.

The project to expand the crude oil, conversion and treating unit capacity of the Melaka Refinery
was completed in the fourth quarter of 2010. As a result, effective January 1, 2011, our net share
of the refinery’s crude throughput capacity will increase from 61,000 to 76,000 barrels per day,
and clean product capacity for gasoline and distillates will increase to 17,500 and 47,000 barrels
per day, respectively.

In the second quarter of 2010, due to ongoing unfavorable market conditions and consistent with our
strategy of maintaining capital discipline and reducing our downstream portfolio over time, we
canceled plans for a project to upgrade our refinery in Wilhelmshaven, Germany. We are currently
evaluating offers to sell the facility. If sufficient value is not achievable from a sale, we plan
to operate the facility as a terminal. As a result, effective January 1, 2011, we will no longer
include Wilhelmshaven’s capacity in our stated refining capacities or our capacity utilization
metrics.

Also consistent with our strategy of reducing our downstream portfolio, in the first quarter of
2010, we ended our participation in a new refinery project in Yanbu Industrial City, Saudi Arabia.

MarketingAt December 31, 2010, R&M had marketing operations in five European countries. Our European
marketing strategy is to sell primarily through owned, leased or joint venture retail sites using a
low-cost, high-volume approach. We use theJETbrand name to market retail and wholesale products
in Austria, Germany and the United Kingdom. In addition, a joint venture in which we have an
equity interest markets products in Switzerland under theCoopbrand name. We also market aviation
fuels, liquid petroleum gases, heating oils, transportation fuels and marine bunkers to commercial
customers and into the bulk or spot market in the aforementioned countries and Ireland.

As of December 31, 2010, we had approximately 1,450 marketing outlets in our European operations,
of which approximately 890 were company-owned and 360 were dealer-owned. We also held
brand-licensing agreements with approximately 200 sites. Through our joint venture operations in
Switzerland, we also have interests in 245 additional sites.



LUKOIL INVESTMENT

At year-end 2009, we had a 20 percent ownership interest in OAO LUKOIL. In July 2010, we announced
our intention to sell our entire interest. During 2010, we sold approximately 151 million shares
of LUKOIL, and as a result of these sales, our ownership interest was 2.25 percent at December 31,
2010, based on authorized and issued shares. By the end of the third quarter of 2010, our
ownership interest declined to a level at which we were no longer able to exercise significant
influence over the operating and financial policies of LUKOIL. Accordingly, at the end of the
third quarter of 2010, we stopped reporting equity earnings, proved reserves and production related
to our LUKOIL investment. In the first quarter of 2011, we sold our remaining interest.

Statements, for more information.



CHEMICALS

At December 31, 2010, our Chemicals segment represented 2 percent of ConocoPhillips’ total assets.
The Chemicals segment consists of our 50 percent equity investment in CPChem, a joint venture with
Chevron Corporation, headquartered in The Woodlands, Texas.

CPChem’s business is structured around two primary operating segments: Olefins & Polyolefins (O&P)
and Specialties, Aromatics & Styrenics (SAS). The O&P segment produces and markets ethylene,
propylene, and other olefin products, which are primarily consumed within CPChem for the production
of polyethylene, normal alpha olefins, polypropylene and polyethylene pipe. The SAS segment
manufactures and markets aromatics products, such as benzene, styrene, paraxylene and cyclohexane,
as well as polystyrene and styrene-butadiene copolymers. SAS also manufactures and markets a
variety of specialty chemical products including organosulfur chemicals, solvents, catalysts,
drilling chemicals, mining chemicals and high-performance engineering plastics and compounds.

CPChem’s manufacturing facilities are located in Belgium, China, Colombia, Qatar, Saudi Arabia,
Singapore, South Korea and the United States.

CPChem owns a 49 percent interest in Qatar Chemical Company Ltd. (Q-Chem), a joint venture that
owns a major olefins and polyolefins complex in Mesaieed, Qatar. CPChem also owns a 49 percent
interest in Qatar Chemical Company II Ltd. (Q-Chem II), a joint venture that began construction of
a second complex in Mesaieed in 2005. The Q-Chem II facility is designed to produce polyethylene
and normal alpha olefins on a site adjacent to the Q-Chem complex. In connection with this
project, an ethylene cracker that provides ethylene feedstock via pipeline to the Q-Chem II plants
was developed in Ras Laffan Industrial City, Qatar. The ethylene cracker and pipeline are owned by
Ras Laffan Olefins Company, a joint venture of Q-Chem II and Qatofin Company Limited.
Collectively, Q-Chem II’s interest in the ethylene cracker and pipeline and the polyethylene and
normal alpha olefins plants are referred to as the “Q-Chem II Project.” Operational startup of the
Q-Chem II Project was achieved in 2010.

Saudi Chevron Phillips Company (SCP) is a 50-percent-owned joint venture of CPChem that owns and
operates an aromatics complex at Jubail Industrial City, Saudi Arabia. Jubail Chevron Phillips
Company, another 50-percent-owned joint venture of CPChem, owns and operates an integrated styrene
facility adjacent to the SCP aromatics complex.

Saudi Polymers Company (SPCo), a 35-percent-owned joint venture company of CPChem, is constructing
an integrated petrochemicals complex at Jubail Industrial City, Saudi Arabia. SPCo will produce
ethylene, propylene, polyethylene, polypropylene, polystyrene and 1-hexene. Construction began in
January 2008, and commercial production is scheduled to begin in late 2011.

CPChem plans to build a 1-hexene plant capable of producing in excess of 200,000 metric tons per
year at its Cedar Bayou Chemical Complex in Baytown, Texas. Project planning has begun, with
startup anticipated in 2014.



EMERGING BUSINESSES

At December 31, 2010, our Emerging Businesses segment represented 1 percent of ConocoPhillips’
total assets. The segment encompasses the development of new technologies and businesses outside
our normal operations. Activities within this segment are focused on power generation and new
technologies related to conventional and nonconventional hydrocarbon recovery, refining,
alternative energy, biofuels and the environment.





Power GenerationThe focus of our power business is on developing projects to support our E&P and R&M strategies.
While projects primarily in place to enable these strategies are included within their respective
segments, the following projects have a significant merchant component and are included in the
Emerging Businesses segment:

•The Immingham Combined Heat and Power Plant, a wholly owned 1,180-megawatt facility in
the United Kingdom, which provides steam and electricity to the Humber Refinery and steam
to a neighboring refinery, as well as merchant power into the U.K. market.•Sweeny Cogeneration LP, our 50 percent joint venture near the Sweeny Refinery complex.

In December 2010, we sold a gas-fired cogeneration plant located in Orange, Texas.

Technology DevelopmentOur Technology group focuses on developing new business opportunities designed to provide future
growth prospects for ConocoPhillips. Focus areas include advanced hydrocarbon processes, energy
efficiency technologies, new petroleum-based products, renewable fuels and carbon capture and
conversion technologies. We are progressing the technology development of second-generation
biofuels with Iowa State University, the Colorado Center for Biorefining and Biofuels and Archer
Daniels Midland. We have also established a relationship with the University of Texas Energy
Institute to collaborate on emerging technologies. Internally, we are continuing to evaluate wind,
solar and geothermal investment opportunities.

In early 2011, we announced we will partner with General Electric Capital and NRG Energy, Inc., to
form a new joint venture, Energy Technology Ventures (ETV), which will focus on development of next
generation energy technology. ETV will invest in, and offer commercial collaboration opportunities
to, venture- and growth-stage energy technology companies in the renewable power generation, smart
grid, energy efficiency, oil, natural gas, coal and nuclear energy, emission controls and biofuels
sectors.

In addition, we are equal co-venturers with General Electric Company in a Global Water
Sustainability Center in Qatar, which researches and develops water solutions for the petroleum,
petrochemical, municipal and agricultural sectors.

We offer a gasification technology (E-Gas™) that uses petroleum coke, coal, and other low-value
hydrocarbons as feedstock, resulting in high-value synthesis gas used for a slate of products,
including power, substitute natural gas (SNG), hydrogen and chemicals. This clean, efficient
technology facilitates carbon capture and storage, as well as minimizes criteria pollutant
emissions and reduces water consumption. E-Gas™ Technology has been utilized in commercial
applications since 1987 and is currently licensed to several third parties. We have also licensed
E-Gas™ to third parties in Asia and North America, and are pursuing several additional licensing
opportunities.



COMPETITION

We compete with private, public and state-owned companies in all facets of the petroleum and
chemicals businesses. Some of our competitors are larger and have greater resources. Each of our
segments is highly competitive. No single competitor, or small group of competitors, dominates any
of our business lines.

Our E&P segment competes with numerous other companies in the industry, including state-owned
companies, to locate and obtain new sources of supply and to produce oil and natural gas in an
efficient, cost-effective manner. Based on publicly available year-end 2009 reserves statistics,
we had the sixth-largest total of worldwide proved reserves of nongovernment-controlled companies.
We deliver our production into the worldwide commodity markets. Principal methods of competing
include geological, geophysical and engineering research and technology; experience and expertise;
economic analysis in connection with portfolio management; and operating efficient oil and gas
producing properties.





The Midstream segment, through our equity investment in DCP Midstream and our consolidated
