Items 1 and 2. BUSINESS AND PROPERTIES

CORPORATE STRUCTURE

ConocoPhillips is the world’s largest independent exploration and production (E&P) company, based on proved reserves and production of liquids and
natural gas. ConocoPhillips was incorporated in the state of Delaware on November 16, 2001, in connection with, and in anticipation of, the merger between Conoco Inc. and Phillips Petroleum Company. The merger between Conoco and Phillips was
consummated on August 30, 2002.

In April 2012, ConocoPhillips completed the separation of the downstream business into an independent, publicly
traded energy company, Phillips 66.

Headquartered in Houston, Texas, we have operations and activities in 17 countries. Our diverse portfolio includes
resource-rich North American tight oil and oil sands assets; lower-risk conventional assets in North America, Europe, Asia and Australia; several liquefied natural gas (LNG) developments; and an inventory of global conventional and unconventional
exploration prospects.

At December 31, 2017, ConocoPhillips employed approximately 11,400 people worldwide.

We operate in a commodity-price driven industry, subject to volatility. In line with this view, we set our operating plan for 2017, defining our cash
allocation priorities which would be reinforced and partly funded by sales of noncore assets during the year. In November 2016, we announced our plan to generate $5 billion to $8 billon of proceeds over two years by optimizing our
portfolio to focus on value-preserving, lowcost-of-supplyprojects that strategically fit our development plans. In 2017, our total consideration from asset
dispositions was approximately $16 billion. We disposed of assets including our 50 percent nonoperated interest in the Foster Creek Christina Lake (FCCL) Partnership, as well as the majority of our western Canada gas assets, and our
interest in the San Juan Basin gas asset. Proceeds from dispositions were directed towards our cash allocation priorities and for general corporate purposes. For additional information on our cash allocation priorities and our asset sales, see the
Business Environment and Executive Overview section within Management’s Discussion and Analysis and Note 4—Assets Held for Sale, Sold or Acquired, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, respectively.







SEGMENT AND GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION

For operating segment and geographic information, see Note 23—Segment Disclosures and Related Information, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements, which is incorporated herein by reference.

We explore for, produce, transport and market crude oil, bitumen, natural gas, LNG and natural gas
liquids on a worldwide basis. At December 31, 2017, our operations were producing in the United States, Norway, the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, Timor-Leste, Indonesia, China, Malaysia, Qatar and Libya.

The information listed below appears in the “Oil and Gas Operations” disclosures following the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and is
incorporated herein by reference:



•Proved worldwide crude oil, natural gas liquids, natural gas and bitumen reserves.

•Net production of crude oil, natural gas liquids, natural gas and bitumen.

•Average sales prices of crude oil, natural gas liquids, natural gas and bitumen.

•Average production costs per barrel of oil equivalent (BOE).

•Net wells completed, wells in progress and productive wells.

•Developed and undeveloped acreage.

The following table is a summary of the proved reserves information
included in the “Oil and Gas Operations” disclosures following the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Approximately 77 percent of our proved reserves are located in politically stable countries that belong to the Organization
for Economic Cooperation and Development. Natural gas reserves are converted to BOE based on a 6:1 ratio: six thousand cubic feet (MCF) of natural gas converts to one BOE. See Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations for a discussion of factors that will enhance the understanding of the following summary reserves table.

Total production, including Libya, of 1,377 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day (MBOED) decreased
12 percent in 2017 compared with 2016. The decrease in total average production primarily resulted from noncore asset dispositions, including our Canada and San Juan transactions in 2017 and the sale of our interest in the Block B production
sharing contract (PSC) in Indonesia in 2016, and normal field decline. The decrease in production was partly offset by production from major developments, including tight oil plays in the Lower 48; Malikai and the Kebabangan gas field in Malaysia;
Surmont in Canada; and APLNG in Australia. Improved drilling and well performance in Alaska, Norway and China also partly offset the decrease in production. Excluding Libya, our 2017 production was 1,356 MBOED. Adjusted for the impact of closed and
planned dispositions of 191 MBOED in 2017 and 434 MBOED in 2016 and Libya, underlying production increased 32 MBOED, or 3 percent, compared with 2016.

Our worldwide annual average realized price was $39.19 per BOE in 2017, an increase of 38 percent compared with $28.35 per BOE in 2016, reflecting higher
average realized prices across all commodities. Our worldwide annual average crude oil price increased 27 percent in 2017, from $40.86 per barrel in 2016 to $51.96 per barrel in 2017. Additionally, our worldwide annual average natural gas
liquids prices increased 51 percent, from $16.68 per barrel in 2016 to $25.22 per barrel in 2017. Our worldwide annual average natural gas price increased 36 percent, from $3.00 per MCF in 2016 to $4.07 per MCF in 2017. Average annual
bitumen prices also increased 48 percent, from $15.27 per barrel in 2016 to $22.66 per barrel in 2017.

ALASKA

The Alaska segment primarily explores for, produces, transports and markets crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids. We are the largest crude oil
producer in Alaska and have major ownership interests in two of North America’s largest oil fields located on Alaska’s North Slope: Prudhoe Bay and Kuparuk. We also have a significant operating interest in the Alpine Field, located on the
Western North Slope. Additionally, we are one of Alaska’s largest owners of state, federal and fee exploration leases, with approximately 1 million net undeveloped acres atyear-end2017. Alaska
operations contributed 22 percent of our worldwide liquids production and less than 1 percent of our natural gas production.

Greater Prudhoe Area

The Greater Prudhoe Area
includes the Prudhoe Bay Field and five satellite fields, as well as the Greater Point McIntyre Area fields. Prudhoe Bay, the largest oil field on Alaska’s North Slope, is the site of a large waterflood and enhanced oil recovery operation, as
well as a gas plant which processes natural gas to recover natural gas liquids before reinjection into the reservoir. Prudhoe Bay’s satellites are Aurora, Borealis, Polaris, Midnight Sun and Orion, while the Point McIntyre, Niakuk, Raven,
Lisburne and North Prudhoe Bay State fields are part of the Greater Point McIntyre Area.







Greater Kuparuk Area

We operate the Greater Kuparuk Area, which consists of the Kuparuk Field and four satellite fields: Tarn, Tabasco, Meltwater and West Sak. Kuparuk is located
40 miles west of Prudhoe Bay. Field installations include three central production facilities which separate oil, natural gas and water, as well as a separate seawater treatment plant. Development drilling at Kuparuk consists of rotary-drilled wells
and horizontal multi-laterals from existing well bores utilizing coiled-tubing drilling.

Drill Site 2S, in the southwestern area of the Kuparuk Field,
was sanctioned in October 2014. First oil was achieved in October 2015, and completion of the first phase of the project was achieved in 2016.

The 1H
Northeast West Sak (NEWS) oil development targeting the West Sak reservoir in the Kuparuk River Unit, was sanctioned in March 2015. First production was achieved in the fourth quarter of 2017.

Western North Slope

On the Western North Slope,
we operate the Colville River Unit, which includes the Alpine Field and three satellite fields: Nanuq, Fiord and Qannik. Alpine is located 34 miles west of Kuparuk. In 2015, first oil was achieved at Alpine West CD5, a new drill site which extends
the Alpine reservoir west into the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska(NPR-A).During the year, we continued drilling additional wells using the available well slots on the pad.

The Greater Mooses Tooth Unit, the first unit established entirely within theNPR-A,was formed in 2008. In 2017, we
began construction in the unit, which is currently planned to have two drill sites; Greater Mooses Tooth #1 and #2, with expected first oil in 2018 and 2021, respectively.

Cook Inlet Area

In January 2018, we sold our
interest in the Kenai LNG Facility in the Cook Inlet Area. The facility, which consisted of a 1.6million-tons-per-yearcapacity plant, as well as docking and loading
facilities for LNG tankers, had no LNG export program in 2017 due to market conditions.

Point Thomson

In the first quarter of 2017, we recorded an asset impairment and assigned our 4.9 percent interest in the Point Thomson unit, located approximately 60
miles east of Prudhoe Bay, to the other owners of the field.

Alaska North Slope Gas

In 2016, we, along with affiliates of Exxon Mobil Corporation, BP p.l.c. and Alaska Gasline Development Corporation (AGDC), a state-owned corporation
(collectively, the “AKLNGco-venturers”),completed preliminaryfront-endengineering and design(pre-FEED)technical
work for a potential LNG project which would liquefy and export natural gas from Alaska’s North Slope and deliver it to market. In September 2016, we, along with the affiliates of ExxonMobil and BP, indicated our intention not to progress
into the next phase of the project due to changes in the economic environment. AGDC is continuing to progress the project and has recently signed several Memorandums of Understanding with various potential LNG buyers in Asia. We remain supportive of
AGDC’s efforts to advance the project and intend to make our equity gas available for sale to the project at mutually agreed, commercially reasonable terms.

Exploration

Appraisal of the Willow Discovery,
located in the northeast portion of the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska, continued throughout 2017 with the acquisition of3-Dseismic which is currently being processed. In 2018, we will continue appraisal
of the discovery with drilling of additional wells. Further exploration of other state and federal leases is planned in 2018.

We were successful in state
and federal lease sales in the North Slope in the fourth quarter of 2017, where we were the high bidder on 13 tracts for a total of approximately 78,000 net acres.







Acquisition

In January 2018, we entered into an agreement to acquire certain oil and gas assets in Alaska. The acquisition is subject to regulatory approval. We will have
a 100 percent interest in approximately 1.2 million acres of exploration and development lands, including the Willow Discovery. For additional information, see Note 4—Assets Held for Sale, Sold or Acquired, in the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements.

Transportation

We transport the petroleum liquids produced on the North Slope to south central Alaska through an800-milepipeline
that is part of Trans-Alaska Pipeline System (TAPS). We have a 29.1 percent ownership interest in TAPS, and we also have ownership interests in the Alpine, Kuparuk and Oliktok pipelines on the North Slope.

Our wholly owned subsidiary, Polar Tankers, Inc., manages the marine transportation of our North Slope production, using five company-owned, double-hulled
tankers, and charters third-party vessels as necessary. The tankers deliver oil from Valdez, Alaska, primarily to refineries on the west coast of the United States.

LOWER 48

The Lower 48 segment
consists of operations located in the U.S. Lower 48 states and the Gulf of Mexico. The Lower 48 business is organized within three regions covering the Gulf Coast,Mid-Continentand Rockies. As a result of
tight oil opportunities, we have directed our investments toward certain shorter cycle time, lowcost-of-supplyplays. We disposed of several noncore assets within the
Lower 48 in 2017, including our interests in the San Juan Basin and the Panhandle. We hold 10.4 million net onshore and offshore acres in the Lower 48. In 2017, the Lower 48 contributed 30 percent of our worldwide liquids production
and 27 percent of our natural gas production.

Onshore

We hold
10.4 million net acres of onshore conventional and unconventional acreage in the Lower 48, the majority of which is either held by production or owned by the company. Our unconventional holdings total approximately 1.8 million net acres in
the following areas:



•630,000 net acres in the Bakken, located in North Dakota and eastern Montana.

•210,000 net acres in the Eagle Ford, located in South Texas.

•134,000 net acres in the Permian, located in West Texas and southeastern New Mexico.







•98,000 net acres in the Niobrara, located in northeastern Colorado.

•66,000 net acres in the Barnett, located in north central Texas.

•639,000 net acres in other unconventional exploration plays.

The majority of our 2017 onshore production
originated from the Eagle Ford; San Juan, which we disposed of during the year; Bakken; and Permian. Onshore activities in 2017 were centered mostly on continued development of assets, with an emphasis on areas with low cost of supply, particularly
in growing unconventional plays. The 2017 drilling activity levels increased relative to 2016 due to higher capital spending. Our major focus areas in 2017 included the following:



•Eagle Ford—The Eagle Ford continued full-field development in 2017. We operated six rigs on average in 2017, resulting in 133 operated wells drilled and 94 operated wells brought online. Production decreased
17 percent in 2017 compared with 2016, and reached a net peak of 164 MBOED, compared with 176 MBOED in 2016.

•Bakken—We operated four rigs throughout the year in the Bakken. We continued our pad drilling with 87 operated wells drilled during the year and 64 operated wells brought online. We achieved net peak production of
75 MBOED in 2017, compared with 72 MBOED in 2016.

•Permian Basin—The Permian Basin is an area where we are leveraging our conventional legacy position by utilizing new technology to improve the ultimate recovery and value from these fields. This technology should
also identify new, unconventional plays across the region. We hold approximately 1 million net acres in the Permian, which includes 134,000 net unconventional acres. The Permian Basin produced 63 MBOED in 2017, staying essentially flat with
2016, including 19 MBOED of unconventional production.

We completed the sale of our interests in the San Juan Basin on July 31,
2017, and Panhandle assets on September 29, 2017. Production from the assets sold was 74 MBOED, approximately 19 percent of total Lower 48 segment production in 2017. For additional information on our asset dispositions, see Note
4—Assets Held for Sale, Sold or Acquired, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Gulf of Mexico

Atyear-end2017, our portfolio of producing properties in the Gulf of Mexico primarily consisted of one operated field
and three fields operated byco-venturers,totaling approximately 68,000 net acres, including:



•75 percent operated working interest in the Magnolia Field in Garden Banks Blocks 783 and 784.

•15.9 percent nonoperated working interest in the unitized Ursa Field located in the Mississippi Canyon Area.

•15.9 percent nonoperated working interest in the Princess Field, a northern subsalt extension of the Ursa Field.

•12.4 percent nonoperated working interest in the unitized K2 Field, comprised of seven blocks in the Green Canyon Area.

Exploration



•Conventional Exploration

At December 31, 2017, we held approximately 5,000
net acres in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico.

Our 30 percent nonoperated working interest in the Shenandoah discovery was announced in
2009. In early 2017, the sixth Shenandoah well, ShenandoahWR52-3,reached total depth and was followed by the drilling of a sidetrack well from ShenandoahWR52-3.Following the suspension of appraisal activity by the operator during the year, we recorded dry hole and leasehold impairment expense for the entire development. On December 19, 2017, we elected to withdraw from the Shenandoah leases. The
withdrawal was effective February 17, 2018.







•Unconventional Exploration

Our onshore focus areas include the Niobrara in the
Denver-Julesburg Basin and the Permian in the Delaware Basin, as well as several emerging plays. We continue to assess and appraise these and other unconventional opportunities. In 2016 and 2017, we drilled a total of five operated unconventional
wells in the Powder River Basin, four of which were expensed as dry holes in November 2017. The fifth Powder River Basin well was expensed as a dry hole in January 2018.

Facilities

Golden Pass LNG Terminal

We have a 12.4 percent ownership interest in the Golden Pass LNG Terminal and affiliated Golden Pass Pipeline, with a combined net book value of
approximately $247 million at December 31, 2017. It is located adjacent to the Sabine-Neches Industrial Ship Channel northwest of Sabine Pass, Texas. The terminal became commercially operational in May 2011. We hold terminal and pipeline
capacity for the receipt, storage and regasification of the LNG purchased from Qatar Liquefied Gas Company Limited (3) (QG3) and the transportation of regasified LNG to interconnect with major interstate natural gas pipelines. Utilization of the
terminal has been and is expected to be limited, as market conditions currently favor the flow of LNG to European and Asian markets. As a result, we are evaluating opportunities to optimize the value of the terminal facilities.

On May 17, 2017, we completed the sale of our 50 percent nonoperated interest in the FCCL Partnership,
as well as the majority of our western Canada gas assets to Cenovus Energy. Production from the assets sold was 103 MBOED, approximately 62 percent of the total Canada segment production in 2017. For additional information on our asset
dispositions, see Note 4—Assets Held for Sale, Sold or Acquired, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Oil Sands

Our bitumen resources in Canada are produced via an enhanced thermal oil recovery method called steam-assisted gravity drainage (SAGD), whereby steam is
injected into the reservoir, effectively liquefying the heavy bitumen, which is recovered and pumped to the surface for further processing. We hold approximately 0.6 million net acres of land in the Athabasca Region of northeastern Alberta.

Surmont—The Surmont oil sands leases are located approximately 35 miles south of Fort McMurray, Alberta. Surmont is a 50/50 joint venture with Total
S.A. The second phase of the Surmont project achieved first production in 2015, and production continued to ramp up in 2017.

Exploration

We hold exploration acreage in three areas of Canada: onshore western Canada, the Mackenzie Delta/Beaufort Sea Region and the Arctic
Islands. Our primary exploration focus is on unconventional plays in western Canada.



•Unconventional Exploration

We hold approximately 0.1 million net acres in
the emerging Montney play in northeast British Columbia and 0.2 million net acres in Canol Northwest Territories. Our Montney activity in 2017 included completing two and bringing onstream six appraisal wells and acquiring approximately 27,000
additional net acres. Late appraisal drilling activity will continue in 2018 to further explore the area’s resource potential.



•Conventional Exploration

Surrender of Interest documents for our 30 percent
nonoperated working interest in six exploration licenses in the Shelburne Basin, offshore Nova Scotia, were submitted on December 15, 2017, to initiate the exit process, following previously announced results of thetwo-wellexploration drilling campaign at Cheshire and Monterey Jack.

EUROPE AND NORTH AFRICA

The Europe and North Africa segment consists of operations and exploration activities in Norway, the United Kingdom and Libya. In 2017, operations in
Europe and North Africa contributed 18 percent of our worldwide liquids production and 15 percent of natural gas production.

Australia Pacific LNG

Australia Pacific LNG Pty Ltd (APLNG), our joint venture with Origin Energy Limited and China Petrochemical Corporation (Sinopec), is focused on producing
coalbed methane (CBM) from the Bowen and Surat basins in Queensland, Australia, to supply the domestic gas market and convert the CBM into LNG for export. Origin operates APLNG’s upstream production and pipeline system, and we operate the
downstream LNG facility, located on Curtis Island near Gladstone, Queensland, as well as the LNG export sales business.

Two fully subscribed4.5-million-metric-tonnes-per-yearLNG trains have been completed. Approximately 3,900 net wells are ultimately envisioned to supply
both the domestic gas market and the LNG sales contracts. The wells are supported by gathering systems, central gas processing and compression stations, water treatment facilities, and an export pipeline connecting the gas fields to the LNG
facilities. The first APLNG Train 1 cargo sailed in January 2016, and LNG sales continued throughout the year. APLNG Train 2 achieved first production in the third quarter of 2016. The LNG is being sold to Sinopec under20-yearsales agreements for 7.6 million metric tonnes of LNG per year, and Japan-based Kansai Electric Power Co., Inc. under a20-yearsales agreement for approximately
1 million metric tonnes of LNG per year.

APLNG has an $8.5 billion project finance facility, which was fully drawn down and had an outstanding
balance of $7.9 billion at December 31, 2017. In connection with the execution of the project financing, we provided a completion guarantee for ourpro-ratashare of the project finance facility
until the project achieves financial completion. In October 2016, we reached financial completion for Train 1, which reduced our associated guarantee by 60 percent. In August 2017, we reached financial completion for Train 2, which removed the
remaining guarantee. For additional information, see Note 2—Variable Interest Entities (VIEs), Note 5—Investments, Loans and Long-Term Receivables, and Note 11—Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

located in the Timor Sea Joint Petroleum Development Area between Timor-Leste and Australia. We also operate and own a 56.9 percent interest in the associated Darwin LNG Facility, located at Wickham Point, Darwin.

The Bayu-Undan natural gas recycle facility processes wet gas; separates, stores and offloads condensate, propane and butane; andre-injectsdry gas back into the reservoir. In addition, a310-milenatural gas pipeline connects the facility to the3.5-million-metric-tonnes-per-yearcapacity Darwin LNG Facility. Produced natural gas is piped to the Darwin LNG Plant, where it is converted into LNG before being
transported to international markets. In 2017, we sold 150 billion gross cubic feet of LNG primarily to utility customers in Japan.







A continuation of the Bayu-Undan Phase Three Development has been sanctioned with internal, joint venture and
regulatory approval in March 2017. The project premise consists of one subsea and two platform wells, with drilling to commence in April 2018. Production is expected to commence in the third quarter of 2018.

Athena/Perseus

The Athena production license(WA-17-L)is located offshore Western Australia and contains part of the Perseus Field, which straddles the boundary withWA-1-L,an adjoining license area. Natural gas is produced from these licenses, which are due to expire in 2019.

Greater Sunrise

We have a 30 percent
interest in the Greater Sunrise natural gas and condensate field located in the Timor Sea. Timor-Leste and Australia through engagement in a conciliation process under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea have reached agreement on the
central elements of a maritime boundary delimitation between them in the Timor Sea. The Governments’ agreement, to be formalized in a new treaty, constitutes a package that addresses boundaries, the legal status of the Greater Sunrise gas
field, the establishment of a Special Regime for Greater Sunrise, a pathway to development of the resource and the sharing of resulting revenue. Discussions are ongoing between the two Governments and the Sunriseco-venturerswith respect to the development concept for Greater Sunrise. Until the Governments and the Sunriseco-venturersare aligned on a development concept,
activities are currently restricted to compliance and social investment, maintaining relationships and continued engagement with the Governments for a future development option.
