Items 1 and 2. BUSINESS AND PROPERTIES



CORPORATE STRUCTURE

ConocoPhillips is an international, integrated energy company. ConocoPhillips was incorporated in
the state of Delaware on November 16, 2001, in connection with, and in anticipation of, the merger
between Conoco Inc. and Phillips Petroleum Company. The merger between Conoco and Phillips was
consummated on August 30, 2002.

Our business is organized into six operating segments:

•Exploration and Production (E&P)—This segment primarily explores for, produces,
transports and markets crude oil, natural gas, natural gas liquids and bitumen on a
worldwide basis.•Midstream—This segment gathers, processes and markets natural gas produced by
ConocoPhillips and others, and fractionates and markets natural gas liquids, predominantly
in the United States and Trinidad. The Midstream segment primarily consists of our 50
percent equity investment in DCP Midstream, LLC.•Refining and Marketing (R&M)—This segment purchases, refines, markets and transports
crude oil and petroleum products, mainly in the United States, Europe and Asia.•LUKOIL Investment—This segment consists of our equity investment in the ordinary shares
of OAO LUKOIL, an international, integrated oil and gas company headquartered in Russia.
At December 31, 2009, our ownership interest was 20 percent based on issued shares and
20.09 percent based on estimated shares outstanding.•Chemicals—This segment manufactures and markets petrochemicals and plastics on a
worldwide basis. The Chemicals segment consists of our 50 percent equity investment in
Chevron Phillips Chemical Company LLC.•Emerging Businesses—This segment represents our investment in new technologies or

SEGMENT AND GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION

For operating segment and geographic information, see Note 25—Segment Disclosures and Related
Information, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which is incorporated herein by
reference.



EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION (E&P)

At December 31, 2009, our E&P segment represented 66 percent of ConocoPhillips’ total assets. This
segment primarily explores for, produces, transports and markets crude oil, natural gas, natural
gas liquids and bitumen on a worldwide basis. Operations to liquefy natural gas and transport the
resulting liquefied natural gas (LNG) are also included in the E&P segment. At December 31, 2009,
our E&P operations were producing in the United States, Norway, the United Kingdom, Canada,
Australia, offshore Timor-Leste in the Timor Sea, Indonesia, China, Vietnam, Libya, Nigeria,
Algeria and Russia.

The E&P segment does not include the financial results or statistics from our equity investment in
the ordinary shares of LUKOIL, which are reported in our LUKOIL Investment segment. As a result,
references to results, production, prices and other statistics throughout the E&P segment
discussion exclude amounts related to our investment in LUKOIL. However, our share of LUKOIL is
included in the “Oil and Gas Operations” disclosures, as well as in the net proved reserves table
shown below.

The information listed below appears in the “Oil and Gas Operations” disclosures following the
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and is incorporated herein by reference:

•Proved worldwide crude oil and natural gas liquids, natural gas, bitumen and synthetic
oil reserves.•Net production of crude oil and natural gas liquids, natural gas, bitumen and synthetic
oil.•Average sales prices of crude oil and natural gas liquids, natural gas, bitumen and
synthetic oil.•Average production costs per barrel of oil equivalent (BOE).•Net wells completed, wells in progress and productive wells.•Developed and undeveloped acreage.





The following table is a summary of the proved reserves information included in the “Oil and Gas
Operations” disclosures following the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Approximately 65
percent of our proved reserves are located in politically stable countries that belong to the
“Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.” Natural gas reserves are converted to BOE
based on a 6:1 ratio: six thousand cubic feet of natural gas converts to one BOE.

In 2009, E&P’s worldwide production, including its share of equity affiliates’ production
other than LUKOIL, averaged 1,854,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (BOED), compared with
1,789,000 in 2008. During 2009, 755,000 BOED were produced in the United States, a decrease from
775,000 in 2008. Production from our international E&P operations averaged 1,099,000 BOED in 2009,
an increase compared with 1,014,000 in 2008. Worldwide production increased primarily due to new
developments in the United Kingdom, Russia, China, Canada, Vietnam and Norway, in addition to less
unplanned downtime. These increases were partially offset by field decline.

E&P’s worldwide annual average crude oil and natural gas liquids sales price decreased 37 percent,
from $88.91 per barrel in 2008 to $55.63 in 2009. E&P’s average annual worldwide natural gas sales
price decreased 48 percent, from $8.27 per thousand cubic feet in 2008 to $4.26 in 2009.

E&P—UNITED STATES

In 2009, U.S. E&P operations contributed 40 percent of E&P’s worldwide liquids production and
41 percent of natural gas production, compared with 43 percent for each in 2008.

Alaska

Greater Prudhoe Area

The Greater Prudhoe Area is composed of the Prudhoe Bay Field and five satellite fields, as well as
the Greater Point McIntyre Area fields. Prudhoe Bay, the largest oil field on Alaska’s North
Slope, is the site of a large





waterflood and enhanced oil recovery operation, as well as a gas processing plant that processes
and re-injects natural gas into the reservoir. Prudhoe Bay’s satellites are Aurora, Borealis,
Polaris, Midnight Sun and Orion, while the Point McIntyre, Niakuk, Raven and Lisburne Fields are
part of the Greater Point McIntyre Area. We have a 36.1 percent nonoperator interest in all fields
within the Greater Prudhoe Area. Net oil and natural gas liquids production from the Greater
Prudhoe Area averaged 119,000 barrels per day in 2009, compared with 123,000 in 2008.

Greater Kuparuk Area

We operate the Greater Kuparuk Area, composed of the Kuparuk Field and four satellite fields: Tarn,
Tabasco, Meltwater and West Sak. Kuparuk is located about 40 miles west of Prudhoe Bay. Our
ownership interest in the area is approximately 55 percent. Field installations include three
central production facilities that separate oil, natural gas and water. The natural gas is either
used for fuel or compressed for re-injection. Net oil production from the area averaged 65,000
barrels per day in 2009, compared with 67,000 in 2008.

Western North Slope

On the Western North Slope we operate the Colville River Unit, composed of the Alpine Field and
three satellite fields: Nanuq, Fiord and Qannik. Alpine is located about 30 miles west of Kuparuk.
Our ownership interest in the area is approximately 78 percent. Net production in 2009 was 68,000
barrels of oil per day, compared with 70,000 in 2008. Further development of potential satellite
fields west of Alpine and into the National Petroleum Reserve—Alaska (NPRA) is contingent upon the
receipt of permit approvals and additional exploration appraisal work. Planned development of one
of these satellites, the Alpine West CD5 Project, has been postponed due to the denial of a key
permit from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers in February 2010. We expect to appeal their decision.

Cook Inlet Area

We operate the North Cook Inlet Unit, the Beluga River Unit, and the Kenai LNG Plant in the Cook
Inlet Area. We have a 100 percent interest in the North Cook Inlet Unit, while we own 33.3 percent
of the Beluga River Unit. Net production in 2009 from the Cook Inlet Area averaged 85 million
cubic feet per day of natural gas, compared with 88 million in 2008. Production from the North
Cook Inlet Unit is used primarily to supply our share of gas to the Kenai LNG Plant and also as a
backup supply to local utilities, while gas from the Beluga River Unit is primarily sold to local
utilities and is used as backup supply to the Kenai LNG Plant.

We have a 70 percent interest in the Kenai LNG Plant, which supplies LNG to two utility companies
in Japan. We sold 21 net billion cubic feet of LNG in 2009, compared with 27 billion in 2008.

Exploration

In a February 2008 lease sale conducted by the U.S. Department of Interior (DOI) under the Outer
Continental Shelf (OCS) Lands Act, we successfully bid, and were awarded 10-year primary
term leases, on 98 blocks in the Chukchi Sea, for total bid payments of $506 million. Various
special interest groups have brought two separate lawsuits challenging (1) the DOI’s entire OCS
leasing program, and (2) the Chukchi Sea lease sale conducted by the DOI under that program. In
the first suit, the Court ordered the DOI to reconsider one aspect of its OCS leasing program. The
results of the DOI’s reconsideration are expected during the first quarter of 2010. In the second
suit, briefs have been filed on behalf of the defendants, including the DOI, in support of the
Chukchi Sea lease sale, and a decision is expected later in 2010. We continue to progress plans
for drilling an exploration well on our Chukchi Sea leases no earlier than 2012. In January 2010,
we exchanged a 25 percent working interest in 50 of these leases for cash consideration and
additional working interests in the Lower Tertiary play of the deepwater Gulf of Mexico.

Two exploration wells were drilled in the Greater Mooses Tooth Unit, located in the NPRA. One of
the wells was expensed as a dry hole, while the second well encountered hydrocarbons. We are
evaluating the potential for future development of this latest discovery.

Transportation

We transport the petroleum liquids produced on the North Slope to south-central Alaska through an
800-mile pipeline that is part of the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System (TAPS). We have a 28.3 percent
ownership interest in TAPS, and we also have ownership interests in the Alpine, Kuparuk and Oliktok
Pipelines on the North Slope.





Our wholly owned subsidiary, Polar Tankers, Inc., manages the marine transportation of our North
Slope production, using five company-owned double-hulled tankers in addition to chartering
third-party vessels as necessary.

In 2008, ConocoPhillips and BP plc formed a limited liability company to progress the pipeline
project named Denali—The Alaska Gas Pipeline. The project would move Alaska natural gas to North
American markets. Denali has continued to progress the project in preparation for its open season
in 2010, during which the pipeline company will seek customers to make long-term firm
transportation commitments to the project. There is a pipeline project competing with Denali that
is structured under the Alaska Gasline Inducement Act.

U.S. Lower 48

Gulf of Mexico

At year-end 2009, our portfolio of producing properties in the Gulf of Mexico mainly consisted of
one operated field and three fields operated by co-venturers, including:

•75 percent operator interest in the Magnolia Field in Garden Banks Blocks 783 and 784.•16 percent nonoperator interest in the unitized Ursa Field located in the Mississippi
Canyon Area.•16 percent nonoperator interest in the Princess Field, a northern, subsalt extension of
the Ursa Field.•12.4 percent nonoperator interest in the unitized K2 Field, comprised of seven blocks in
the Green Canyon Area.

Net production from our Gulf of Mexico properties averaged 21,000 barrels per day of liquids and
28 million cubic feet per day of natural gas in 2009, compared with 18,000 barrels per day and 24
million cubic feet per day in 2008.

Onshore

Our 2009 onshore production principally consisted of natural gas, with the majority of production
located in the San Juan Basin, Permian Basin, Lobo Trend, Bossier Trend, and panhandles of Texas
and Oklahoma. We also have operations in the Wind River, Anadarko and Fort Worth Basins, as well
as in East Texas and northern and southern Louisiana. Other onshore ownership includes properties
in the Williston Basin, the Piceance Basin and the Cedar Creek Anticline.

Onshore activities in 2009 were mostly centered on continued optimization and development of
existing assets. Combined net production from all Lower 48 onshore fields in 2009 averaged 1,899
million cubic feet per day of natural gas and 145,000 barrels per day of liquids, compared with
1,970 million cubic feet per day and 147,000 barrels per day in 2008.

The San Juan Basin, located in northwestern New Mexico and southwestern Colorado, includes the
majority of our U.S. coalbed methane (CBM) production. Additionally, we continue to pursue
development opportunities in three conventional formations in the San Juan Basin. Net production
from San Juan averaged 903 million cubic feet per day of natural gas and 49,000 barrels per day of
liquids in 2009, compared with 863 million cubic feet per day and 48,000 barrels per day in 2008.

Transportation

In 2006, we acquired a 24 percent interest in West2East Pipeline LLC, which merged into Rockies
Express Pipeline LLC in December 2009. In November 2009, Rockies Express completed construction of
a 1,679-mile natural gas pipeline from Colorado to Ohio, which has the capacity to deliver 1.8
billion cubic feet of natural gas per day to eastern markets. We increased our ownership interest
to 25 percent upon project completion.

Exploration

During 2009, we participated in two significant discoveries in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. We
hold an 18 percent interest in the Tiber discovery and a 40 percent interest in the Shenandoah
discovery. Both discoveries require future appraisal drilling. In addition, we were the
successful bidder on 27 blocks in the March and August 2009 federal offshore lease sales. At year
end, we had interests in 287 lease blocks totaling





1.1 million net acres in the Gulf of Mexico. In January 2010, we exchanged a 25 percent working
interest in 50 of our leases in the Chukchi Sea for cash consideration and additional working
interests in the Lower Tertiary play of the deepwater Gulf of Mexico.

We drilled and completed 52 gross onshore exploration wells. The majority of the wells were
located in the Bakken play in the Williston Basin and the Fort Worth Basin Barnett play. We have
seen encouraging results from initial wells in our Eagle Ford play in South Texas where we have
accumulated over 240,000 acres. Other areas with active exploration drilling programs included
Wyoming, Colorado and East Texas.

E&P—EUROPE

In 2009, E&P operations in Europe contributed 23 percent of E&P’s worldwide liquids production,
compared with 24 percent in 2008. European operations contributed 18 percent of natural gas
production in 2009, compared with 20 percent in 2008. Our European assets are principally located
in the Norwegian and U.K. sectors of the North Sea.

Norway

We operate and hold a 35.1 percent interest in the Greater Ekofisk Area, located approximately
200 miles offshore Norway in the North Sea. The Greater Ekofisk Area is composed of four producing
fields: Ekofisk, Eldfisk, Embla and Tor. Net production in 2009 from the Greater Ekofisk Area was
92,000 barrels of liquids per day and 89 million cubic feet of natural gas per day, compared with
99,000 barrels per day and 100 million cubic feet per day in 2008.

We also have varying ownership interests in other producing fields in the Norwegian sector of the
North Sea and in the Norwegian Sea, including:

•24.3 percent interest in the Heidrun Field.•20 percent interest in the Alvheim Field.•10.3 percent interest in the Statfjord Field.•23.3 percent interest in the Huldra Field.•1.6 percent interest in the Troll Field.•9.1 percent interest in the Visund Field.•6.2 percent interest in the Grane Field.•2.4 percent interest in the Oseberg Area.

Net production from these and other fields in the Norwegian sector of the North Sea and the
Norwegian Sea averaged 68,000 barrels of liquids per day and 128 million cubic feet of natural gas
per day in 2009, compared with 68,000 barrels per day and 139 million cubic feet per day in 2008.

Transportation

We have interests in the transportation and processing infrastructure in the Norwegian sector of
the North Sea, including interests in the Norpipe Oil Pipeline System and in Gassled, which owns
most of the Norwegian gas transportation system.

Exploration

We participated in eight wells in 2009, with six of the wells encountering hydrocarbons. Two
discoveries were made on the Visund East flank, two discoveries were made in the Oseberg Area and
two discoveries were made in the Alvheim Area. We were also awarded an additional 128,000 acres in
2009.

United Kingdom

In addition to our 58.7 percent interest in the Britannia natural gas and condensate field, we own
50 percent of Britannia Operator Limited, the operator of the field. We also have an 83.5 percent
interest and a 75 percent interest in the Callanish and Brodgar Britannia satellite fields,
respectively. Net production from Britannia and its satellite fields averaged 304 million cubic
feet of natural gas per day and 40,000 barrels of liquids per day in 2009, compared with 277
million cubic feet per day and 24,000 barrels per day in 2008.





We operate and hold a 36.5 percent interest in the Judy/Joanne Fields, which together make up
J-Block. Additionally, our operated Jade Field, in which we hold a 32.5 percent interest, produces
from a wellhead platform and pipeline tied to the J-Block facilities. Together, these fields
produced a net 12,000 barrels of liquids per day and 96 million cubic feet of natural gas per day
in 2009,  compared with 13,000 barrels per day and 88 million cubic feet per day in 2008.

Our various ownership interests in 18 producing gas fields in the Rotliegendes and Carboniferous
Areas of the southern North Sea yielded average net production in 2009 of 185 million cubic feet
per day of natural gas, compared with 241 million in 2008.

We also have ownership interests in several other producing fields in the U.K. sector of the North
Sea. Net production from these fields averaged 16,000 barrels of liquids per day and 12 million
cubic feet of natural gas per day in 2009, compared with 17,000 barrels per day and 14 million
cubic feet per day in 2008.

In the Atlantic Margin, we have a 24 percent interest in the Clair Field. Net production in 2009
averaged 12,000 barrels of liquids per day, compared with 11,000 in 2008.

The Millom, Dalton and Calder Fields in the East Irish Sea, in which we have a 100 percent
ownership interest, are operated on our behalf by a third party. Net production in 2009 averaged
60 million cubic feet of natural gas per day, compared with 43 million in 2008.

Transportation

The Interconnector Pipeline, linking the United Kingdom and Belgium, facilitates marketing natural
gas produced in the United Kingdom throughout Europe. Our 10 percent equity share allows us to
ship approximately 200 million cubic feet of natural gas per day to markets in continental Europe,
and our reverse-flow rights provide an 85 million cubic feet per day import capability into the
United Kingdom.

We operate the Teesside oil and Theddlethorpe gas terminals, in which we have 29.3 percent and 50
percent ownership interests, respectively. We also have a 100 percent ownership interest in the
Rivers Gas Terminal, operated by a third party, in the United Kingdom.

Exploration

We participated in three exploration wells in 2009. One well was a discovery, one was expensed as
a dry hole and the third was drilling at year end. The discovery was made in the Southern Gas
Basin and began production in 2009.

Poland

Exploration

In 2009, we entered into a shale gas venture in Poland that provides us with the opportunity to
evaluate and earn a 70 percent interest in six exploration licenses in the Baltic Basin. We
acquired seismic data in 2009 and intend to drill our first well in 2010.

E&P—CANADA

In 2009, E&P operations in Canada contributed 11 percent of E&P’s worldwide liquids production,
compared with 10 percent in 2008. Canadian operations contributed 22 percent of E&P’s worldwide
natural gas production in 2009, the same as in 2008.

Western Canada

Operations in western Canada encompass oil and gas properties throughout Alberta, northeastern
British Columbia, and southern Saskatchewan. Net production from western Canada averaged 1,062
million cubic feet per day of natural gas and 40,000 barrels per day of liquids in 2009, compared
with 1,054 million cubic feet per day and 44,000 barrels per day in 2008.





Surmont

We operate and have a 50 percent interest in the Surmont oil sands lease, located approximately 35
miles south of Fort McMurray, Alberta. The Surmont project uses an enhanced thermal oil recovery
method called steam-assisted gravity drainage (SAGD). The average net production of bitumen from
Surmont during 2009 was 7,000 barrels per day, compared with 6,000 barrels per day in 2008, with
net peak production of 12,000 barrels per day expected in 2013. Surmont Phase II was sanctioned in
2009 and is expected to begin producing in 2015, increasing Surmont’s net production to 50,000
barrels per day in 2017.

FCCL

In 2007, we formed two 50/50 business ventures with EnCana Corporation (now Cenovus Energy Inc.) to
create an integrated North American heavy oil business: FCCL Partnership, a Canadian upstream
general partnership, and WRB Refining LLC, a U.S. downstream limited liability company. FCCL’s
assets, operated by Cenovus, consist of the Foster Creek and Christina Lake SAGD bitumen projects,
both located in the eastern flank of the Athabasca oil sands in northeastern Alberta. Our share of
FCCL’s production increased to 43,000 barrels per day in 2009, compared with  30,000 barrels per day
in 2008, primarily due to Foster Creek Phases 1D and 1E commencing operations late in the first
quarter of 2009 and continuing to ramp-up throughout the year. Construction of Christina Lake
Phase 1C continued through the year, and in the fourth quarter of 2009, we sanctioned Christina
Lake Phase 1D. See the Refining and Marketing (R&M) section for information on WRB.

Syncrude Canada Ltd.

We own a 9 percent interest in the Syncrude Canada Ltd. (SCL) joint venture, created for the
purpose of mining shallow deposits of oil sands, extracting the bitumen, and upgrading it into a
light sweet synthetic crude oil called Syncrude. The primary plant and facilities are located at
Mildred Lake, about 25 miles north of Fort McMurray, Alberta. SCL, as operator of the joint
venture, holds eight oil sands leases and the associated surface rights, of which our share is
approximately 22,400 net acres. Net production averaged 23,000 barrels per day in 2009, compared
with 22,000 in 2008.

Parsons Lake/Mackenzie Gas Project

We are working with three other energy companies, as members of the Mackenzie Delta Producers’
Group, on the development of the Mackenzie Valley Pipeline and gathering system, which is proposed
to transport onshore gas production from the Mackenzie Delta in northern Canada to established
markets in North America. We have a 75 percent interest in the Parsons Lake gas field, one of the
primary fields in the Mackenzie Delta, which would anchor the pipeline development. The Joint
Review Panel, an independent body appointed by the Minister of Environment to evaluate the
potential impacts of the project on the environment and lives of the people in the project area,
conditionally recommended approval of the project in December 2009. We anticipate the Mackenzie
Delta Producers’ Group will continue to pursue needed regulatory authorizations, but detailed
engineering work has been deferred pending resolution with the federal government on the fiscal and
commercial framework.

Exploration

We hold exploration acreage in four areas of Canada: offshore eastern Canada, onshore western
Canada, the Mackenzie Delta/Beaufort Sea Region, and the Arctic Islands. During 2009, we began
drilling an exploration well in the Laurentian Basin, located offshore eastern Canada that
continued into 2010. We also acquired an additional 900,000 acres in the Laurentian Basin in 2009.
In western Canada, we participated in 27 wells resulting in 23 discoveries. We also acquired an
additional 71,000 acres, including over 22,000 acres in the Horn River shale gas play, increasing
our position to nearly 100,000 acres. In the Beaufort Sea Region, we acquired additional interest
in the Amauligak Strategic Discovery License.

E&P—SOUTH AMERICA

Venezuela

Petrozuata, Hamaca and Corocoro

On June 26, 2007, we announced we had been unable to reach agreement with respect to our migration
to anempresa mixtastructure mandated by the Venezuelan government’s Nationalization Decree. In
response, Venezuela’s national oil company, Petróleos de Venezuela S.A. (PDVSA), or its affiliates
directly assumed the





activities associated with and control over ConocoPhillips’ interests in the Petrozuata and Hamaca
heavy oil ventures and the offshore Corocoro development project. For additional information, see
the “Expropriated Assets” section of Note 10—Impairments, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements, which is incorporated herein by reference.

Plataforma Deltana Block 2

We sold our 40 percent nonoperating interest in Plataforma Deltana Block 2 to PDVSA during 2009.

Peru

Exploration

At year-end 2009, we held ownership interests in four exploration blocks in Peru. Final
preparations are under way for a 2D seismic program scheduled for 2010 in Block 39. We operate
Blocks 123, 124 and 129, and are continuing preparations for a 2D seismic program scheduled to
commence in the first quarter of 2010. We relinquished Block 104 during 2009.

Ecuador

In April 2008, Burlington Resources, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of ConocoPhillips, initiated
arbitration before the World Bank’s International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes
(ICSID) against The Republic of Ecuador and PetroEcuador as a result of the newly-enacted Windfall
Profits Tax Law and government-mandated renegotiation of our production sharing contracts. Despite
a restraining order issued by the ICSID, Ecuador confiscated the crude oil production of Burlington
and its co-venturer and sold the illegally seized crude oil. As a result, our assets in Ecuador
were effectively expropriated. In the third quarter of 2009, Ecuador took over operations in Block
7 and 21, formalizing the complete expropriation of our assets. A jurisdictional hearing before
the ICSID was held in January 2010, with the outcome still pending. For additional information,
see the “Expropriated Assets” section of Note 10—Impairments, in the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements.

E&P—ASIA PACIFIC/MIDDLE EAST

In 2009, E&P operations in the Asia Pacific/Middle East Region contributed 13 percent of E&P’s
worldwide liquids production and 16 percent of natural gas production, compared with 11 percent and
13 percent in 2008, respectively.

Australia and Timor Sea

Australia Pacific LNG

In October 2008, we closed on a transaction with Origin Energy, an integrated Australian energy
company, to further enhance our long-term Australasian natural gas business. The 50/50 joint
venture, named Australia Pacific LNG (APLNG), is focused on CBM production from the Bowen and Surat
Basins in Queensland, Australia, and LNG processing and export sales. With this transaction, we
gained access to CBM resources in Australia and will enhance our LNG position with the expected
creation of an additional LNG hub targeting Asia Pacific markets. Multiple LNG trains are
anticipated. Over 20,000 gross wells are ultimately envisioned to supply both the domestic gas
market and the LNG development. Drilling and production operations will be supported by gas
gathering systems and centralized gas processing and compression stations, as well as water
treatment facilities.

Our share of the joint venture’s production in 2009 was 84 million cubic feet per day of natural gas.
Current
production is sold into the Australian domestic market. CBM field development work is ongoing in
parallel with front-end engineering associated with the planned LNG processing facilities. During
2009, Laird Point was selected as the future site for LNG facilities. Final investment decision on
the initial LNG trains is planned for the fourth quarter of 2010.

Bayu-Undan

We operate and hold a 57.2 percent ownership interest in the Bayu-Undan Field located in the Timor
Sea. The field averaged a net production rate of 35,000 barrels of liquids per day in 2009,
compared with 36,000 in 2008. Our share of natural gas production was 216 million cubic feet per
day in 2009, compared with





210 million in 2008. Produced natural gas is used to supply the Darwin LNG Plant, in which
we own a 57.2 percent interest. In 2009, we sold 156 billion gross cubic feet of LNG to utility
customers in Japan, compared with 159 billion in 2008.

Greater Sunrise

We have a 30 percent interest in the Greater Sunrise gas and condensate field located in the Timor
Sea. Although agreement has been reached between the governments of Australia and Timor-Leste
concerning sharing of revenues from the anticipated development of Greater Sunrise, key challenges
to be resolved before significant funding commitments can be made include gaining co-venturer and
government alignment on the development concept, and establishing fiscal stability arrangements.

Western Australia

In 2009, our share of production from the Athena/Perseus (WA-17-L) gas field, located offshore
Western Australia, was 35 million cubic feet of natural gas per day, the same as in 2008.

Exploration

During 2009, we drilled two exploration wells and started a third in the offshore Browse Basin.
The first well, Poseidon-1, was a significant discovery. Poseidon-2, the initial appraisal well
for the discovery, encountered hydrocarbons in some of the same sands as were seen in the discovery
well and is currently being evaluated. A seismic survey has recently been acquired over the
discovery. Additionally, Kontiki-1 was drilled on a prospect independent from Poseidon and was
expensed as a dry hole. We intend to drill at least one additional well in the Browse Basin in 2010.

Qatar

Qatargas 3 is an integrated project jointly owned by Qatar Petroleum (68.5 percent), ConocoPhillips
(30 percent) and Mitsui & Co., Ltd. (1.5 percent). The project comprises upstream natural gas
production facilities to produce approximately 1.4 billion gross cubic feet per day of natural gas
from Qatar’s North Field. The project also includes a 7.8 million-gross-ton-per-year LNG facility,
from which LNG will be shipped in new, leased LNG carriers destined for sale in the United States
and other markets. The first LNG cargoes are expected to be loaded in the second half of 2010.

In order to capture cost savings, Qatargas 3 is executing the development of the onshore and
offshore assets as a single integrated project with Qatargas 4, a joint venture between Qatar
Petroleum and Royal Dutch Shell plc. This includes the joint development of offshore facilities
situated in a common offshore block in the North Field, as well as the construction of two
identical LNG process trains and associated gas treating facilities for both the Qatargas 3 and
Qatargas 4 joint ventures. Upon completion of the Qatargas 3 and Qatargas 4 Projects, production
from the LNG plant and associated facilities will be combined and shared.

We have a 12.4 percent ownership interest in the Golden Pass LNG Terminal and affiliated Golden
Pass Pipeline. The terminal is currently under construction adjacent to the Sabine-Neches
Industrial Ship Channel northwest of Sabine Pass, Texas. Subject to the negotiation of definitive
agreements, ConocoPhillips will hold terminal and pipeline capacity for the receipt, storage and
regasification of the LNG purchased from Qatargas 3 and the transportation of regasified LNG to
interconnect with major interstate natural gas pipelines.

Indonesia

We operate seven production sharing contracts (PSCs) in Indonesia. Three of these PSCs are in
various stages of development from which net production grew to an average of 447 million cubic
feet per day of natural gas and 19,000 barrels per day of liquids in 2009, compared with 343 million
cubic feet per day and 17,000 barrels per day in 2008. Our producing assets are primarily
concentrated in two core areas: the South Natuna Sea and onshore South Sumatra.

South Natuna Sea Block B

The offshore South Natuna Sea Block B PSC, in which we have a 40 percent interest and are the
operator, has two producing oil fields and 16 natural gas fields in various stages of development.
Natural gas production is sold under international sales agreements to Malaysia and Singapore. The
North Belut Field in Block B achieved first gas production in November 2009.





South Sumatra

These onshore blocks are comprised of the Corridor and South Jambi B PSCs. The Corridor PSC, in
which we have a 54 percent interest, has six oil fields and six natural gas fields in various
stages of development. Natural gas is supplied from the Grissik and Suban gas processing plants to
the Duri steamflood in central Sumatra and to markets in Singapore, Batam and West Java. We have a
45 percent interest in the South Jambi B PSC, which supplies natural gas to Singapore.

We are the operator and have a 49 percent share of the Peng Lai 19-3 Field in Bohai Bay Block
11-05, as well as the nearby Peng Lai 19-9 and Peng Lai 25-6 Fields. As part of our Bohai Bay
Phase II Project, a floating production, storage and offloading (FPSO) vessel to accommodate
production from these fields was installed in May 2009. Development of Peng Lai 19-3 continues.
Net production averaged 33,000 barrels of oil per day in 2009, compared with 14,000 in 2008.
Production should continue to ramp-up over the next two years, with annual average net production
of 69,000 barrels of oil per day anticipated in 2011.

The Xijiang development consists of two fields located approximately 80 miles south of Hong Kong in
the South China Sea. Combined net production of oil from the Xijiang Fields averaged 5,000 barrels
per day in 2009, compared with 7,000 in 2008. Under the terms of the contract, our ownership
rights in the 24-3/1 Field ended in January 2010, and our rights in the 30-2 Field will end in
November 2010. Our ownership in these fields was 24.5 percent and 12.3 percent, respectively, at
December 31, 2009.

We have a 24.5 percent interest in the offshore Panyu Field, also located in the South China Sea,
which produced 11,000 net barrels of oil per day in 2009 and 12,000 in 2008.

Exploration

We entered a pilot evaluation program in a coalbed methane play in the onshore Qinshui Basin in
2009. The pilot program is expected to last between 12-18 months and will involve drilling and
monitoring the production performance of a series of horizontal wells. At the end of the program,
we will have the option to elect an assignment of a 30 percent interest in three PSCs covering the
play. We drilled two exploration wells on our existing offshore Bohai Block BZ 11/05, both of
which were expensed as dry holes.

Vietnam

Our ownership interest in Vietnam is centered around the Cuu Long Basin in the South China Sea and
consists of two primarily oil-producing blocks and one gas pipeline transportation system.

We have a 23.3 percent interest in Block 15-1 in the Cuu Long Basin. Net production in 2009 was
22,000 barrels of oil per day, compared with 13,000 in 2008. The oil is processed through a 1
million barrel FPSO vessel and through the Su Tu Vang central processing platform and floating
storage and offloading (FSO) vessel.

Also in the Cuu Long Basin, we have a 36 percent interest in the Rang Dong Field in Block 15-2.
All wellhead platforms produce into an FSO vessel. Net production in 2009 was 7,000 barrels per

and 2 percent of natural gas production, compared with 8 percent and 2 percent, respectively, in
2008.

Nigeria

During 2009, we produced from four onshore Oil Mining Leases (OMLs), in which we have a 20 percent
nonoperator interest. Net production from these leases was 19,000 barrels of liquids per day and
111 million cubic feet of natural gas per day in 2009, compared with 21,000 barrels per day and 105
million cubic feet per day in 2008.

We have a 20 percent interest in a 480-megawatt gas-fired power plant in Kwale, Nigeria, which
supplies electricity to Nigeria’s national electricity supplier. In 2009, the plant consumed 12
million net cubic feet per day of natural gas sourced from our proved reserves in the OMLs.

We have a 17 percent equity interest in Brass LNG Limited, which plans to construct an LNG facility
in the Niger Delta.

Exploration

Development studies continue for the Uge discovery in offshore deepwater Block OPL 214. Onshore,
we participated in the start of the Obiafu SW Deep B exploration well, but the well was abandoned
and expensed due to pad location problems. We plan to redrill the well in 2010.

Libya

ConocoPhillips holds a 16.3 percent interest in the Waha concessions in Libya, which encompass
nearly 13 million gross acres. Net oil production averaged 45,000 barrels per day in 2009, versus
47,000 in 2008.

Algeria

We have interests in three fields in Block 405a: the Menzel Lejmat North Field, the Ourhoud Field,
and the development stage El Merk oil field unit. The El Merk Project was sanctioned in 2009 and
is expected to begin producing in 2012. Net production from these fields averaged 14,000 barrels
of oil per day in 2009, compared with 13,000 in 2008.





E&P—RUSSIA

NMNG

We have a 30 percent ownership interest with a 50 percent governance interest in OOO
Naryanmarneftegaz (NMNG), a joint venture with LUKOIL. NMNG is working to develop resources in the
northern part of Russia’s Timan-Pechora province, including the Yuzhno Khylchuyu (YK) Field.
Initial production from YK was achieved in June 2008. Net production from the joint venture
averaged 46,000 barrels per day in 2009, compared with 13,000 in 2008. Production from the NMNG
joint venture fields is transported via pipeline to LUKOIL’s terminal at Varandey Bay on the
Barents Sea and then shipped via tanker to international markets.

Polar Lights

We have a 50 percent equity interest in Polar Lights Company, an entity that owns producing fields
in the Timan-Pechora Basin in northern Russia. Net production averaged 9,000 barrels of oil per
day in 2009, compared with 11,000 in 2008.

E&P—CASPIAN

In the Caspian Sea, we have an 8.4 percent interest in the Republic of Kazakhstan’s North Caspian
Sea Production Sharing Agreement, which includes the Kashagan Field. The first phase of field
development currently being executed includes construction of artificial drilling islands with
processing facilities and living quarters, and pipelines to carry production onshore. The initial
production phase of the contract is for 20 years, with options to extend the agreement an
additional 20 years. A joint operating company oversees the Kashagan development, and expects
first production in late 2012.

Transportation

We have a 2.5 percent interest in the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan Pipeline, which transports crude oil from
the Caspian Region through Azerbaijan, Georgia and Turkey for tanker loadings at the port of
Ceyhan.

Exploration

In 2009, we acquired a 24.5 percent interest in the N Block, located offshore Kazakhstan. In
addition, appraisal drilling and development studies continue for the next phase of Kashagan and
the satellite fields of Kalamkas, Kairan and Aktote.

E&P—OTHER

LNG

We have a long-term agreement with Freeport LNG Development, L.P. to use 0.9 billion cubic feet per
day of regasification capacity at Freeport’s 1.5 billion-cubic-feet-per-day LNG receiving terminal
in Quintana, Texas. Due to present market conditions, which favor the flow of LNG to European and
Asian markets, our near-to-mid-term utilization of the Freeport Terminal is expected to be limited.
We are responsible for monthly process-or-pay payments to Freeport irrespective of whether we
utilize the terminal for regasification. The financial impact of this capacity underutilization is
not expected to be material to our future earnings or cash flows.

Commercial

Our Commercial organization optimizes the commodity flows of our E&P segment. This group markets
our crude oil and natural gas production, using commodity buyers, traders and marketers in offices
in the United States, the United Kingdom, Singapore, Canada and Dubai.

E&P—RESERVES

We have not filed any information with any other federal authority or agency with respect to our
estimated total proved reserves at December 31, 2009. No difference exists between our estimated
total proved reserves for year-end 2008 and year-end 2007, which are shown in this filing, and
estimates of these reserves shown in a filing with another federal agency in 2009.





DELIVERY COMMITMENTS

We sell crude oil and natural gas from our E&P producing operations under a variety of contractual
arrangements, some of which specify the delivery of a fixed and determinable quantity. Our
Commercial organization also enters into natural gas sales contracts where the source of the
natural gas used to fulfill the contract can be the spot market or a combination of our reserves
and the spot market. Worldwide, we are contractually committed to deliver approximately 6 trillion
cubic feet of natural gas and 60 million barrels of crude oil in the future, including
approximately 800 billion cubic feet related to the minority interests of consolidated
subsidiaries. These contracts have various expiration dates through the year 2025. We expect to
fulfill the majority of these delivery commitments with proved developed reserves. In addition, we
anticipate using proved undeveloped reserves and spot market purchases to fulfill these
commitments. See the disclosure on “Proved Undeveloped Reserves” in the “Oil and Gas Operations”
section following the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for information on the
development of proved undeveloped reserves.



MIDSTREAM

At December 31, 2009, our Midstream segment represented 1 percent of ConocoPhillips’ total assets.
Our Midstream business is primarily conducted through our 50 percent equity investment in DCP
Midstream, LLC, a joint venture with Spectra Energy.

The Midstream business purchases raw natural gas from producers and gathers natural gas through
extensive pipeline gathering systems. The gathered natural gas is then processed to extract
natural gas liquids. The remaining “residue” gas is marketed to electrical utilities, industrial
users and gas marketing companies. Most of the natural gas liquids are fractionated—separated into
individual components like ethane, butane and propane—and marketed as chemical feedstock, fuel or
blendstock. Total natural gas liquids extracted in 2009, including our share of DCP Midstream,
were 187,000 barrels per day, compared with 188,000 in 2008.

DCP Midstream markets a portion of its natural gas liquids to ConocoPhillips and Chevron Phillips
Chemical Company LLC under a supply agreement that continues until December 31, 2014. Beginning in
2015, the volume commitment is reduced by 20 percent each year until the volume commitment is zero.
This purchase commitment is on an “if-produced, will-purchase” basis and is expected to have a
relatively stable purchase pattern over the remaining term of the contract. Under the agreement,
natural gas liquids are purchased at various published market index prices, less transportation and
fractionation fees.

DCP Midstream is headquartered in Denver, Colorado. At December 31, 2009, DCP Midstream owned or
operated 53 natural gas liquids extraction and 10 natural gas liquids fractionation plants, and its
gathering and transmission systems included approximately 60,000 miles of pipeline. In 2009, DCP
Midstream’s raw natural gas throughput averaged 6.1 billion cubic feet per day, and natural gas
liquids extraction averaged 358,000 barrels per day, compared with 6.2 billion cubic feet per day
and 360,000 barrels per day in 2008. DCP Midstream’s assets are primarily located in the following
producing regions of the United States: Rocky Mountains, Midcontinent, Permian, East Texas/North
Louisiana, South Texas, Central Texas and Gulf Coast.
Outside of DCP Midstream, our U.S. natural gas liquids business included the following as of
year-end 2009:

•A 25,000 barrel-per-day capacity natural gas liquids fractionation plant in Gallup, New
Mexico.•A 22.5 percent equity interest in Gulf Coast Fractionators, which owns a natural gas
liquids fractionation plant in Mont Belvieu, Texas (with our net share of capacity at
24,300 barrels per day).•A 40 percent interest in a fractionation plant in Conway, Kansas (with our net share of
capacity at 43,200 barrels per day).•A 12.5 percent equity interest in a fractionation plant in Mont Belvieu, Texas (with our
net share of capacity at 26,000 barrels per day).•A commercial trading organization based in Houston, Texas, that optimizes the flow of
natural gas liquids and markets propane on a wholesale basis.

We also own a 39 percent equity interest in Phoenix Park Gas Processors Limited, which processes
natural gas in Trinidad and markets natural gas liquids in the Caribbean, Central America and the
U.S. Gulf Coast. Its





facilities include a 2 billion-cubic-feet-per-day gas processing plant and a 70,000 barrel-per-day
natural gas liquids fractionator. A third gas processing train was completed in July 2009, which
increased total processing capacity to 2 billion cubic feet per day. Our share of natural gas
liquids extracted averaged 8,000 barrels per day in 2009 and 2008. Our share of fractionated
liquids averaged 17,000 barrels per day in 2009, compared with 14,000 in 2008.



REFINING AND MARKETING (R&M)

At December 31, 2009, our R&M segment represented 24 percent of ConocoPhillips’ total assets. R&M
operations encompass refining crude oil and other feedstocks into petroleum products (such as
gasolines, distillates and aviation fuels); buying, selling and transporting crude oil; and buying,
transporting, distributing and marketing petroleum products. R&M has operations in the United
States, Europe and the Asia Pacific Region. The R&M segment does not include the results or
statistics from our equity investment in LUKOIL, which are reported in our LUKOIL Investment
segment.

Our Commercial organization optimizes the commodity flows of our R&M segment. This organization
procures feedstocks for R&M’s refineries, facilitates supplying a portion of the gas and power
needs of the R&M facilities, supplies petroleum products to our marketing operations, and markets
petroleum products directly to third parties. Commercial has buyers, traders and marketers in
offices in the United States, the United Kingdom, Singapore, Canada and Dubai.

MSLP

Merey Sweeny, L.P. (MSLP) is a limited partnership that owns a 70,000 barrel-per-day delayed coker
and related facilities at the Sweeny Refinery used to produce fuel-grade petroleum coke. Prior to
August 28, 2009, MSLP was owned 50/50 by us and PDVSA. Under the agreements that govern the
relationships between the partners, certain defaults by PDVSA with respect to supply of crude oil
to the Sweeny Refinery gave us the right to acquire PDVSA’s 50 percent ownership interest in MSLP.
On August 28, 2009, we exercised that right. In public statements, PDVSA has challenged our
actions. We continue to use the equity method of accounting for our investment in MSLP.





WRB

In 2007, we closed on a business venture with EnCana Corporation (now Cenovus) to create an
integrated North American heavy oil business. This venture consists of two 50/50 business
ventures: a Canadian upstream general partnership, FCCL Partnership, and a U.S. downstream limited
liability company, WRB Refining LLC. WRB consists of the Wood River and Borger Refineries, located
in Roxana, Illinois, and Borger, Texas, respectively. We are the operator and managing partner of
WRB. See the “Exploration and Production (E&P)” section for additional information on FCCL.

Since formation, the joint venture has expanded the processing capability of heavy Canadian crude
to 95,000 barrels per day from 60,000 barrels per day with the startup of a coker at Borger in
2007. In addition, during 2008, the final permit was received and plans were progressed to expand
the Wood River Refinery, including the installation of a coker. With the completion of this
project, anticipated in 2011, total processing capability of heavy Canadian or similar crudes at
Wood River will increase to 225,000 barrels per day, and the majority of the existing asphalt
production at the refinery will be replaced with production of upgraded products.

Capital Projects

In 2009, capital was directed toward projects to meet environmental and air emission standards and
to further improve the operating reliability, safety and energy efficiency of processing units.
During 2009, we expanded a hydrocracker at the Rodeo facility of our San Francisco Refinery. The
hydrocracker was commissioned in September 2009, resulting in a 12 percent increase in clean
product yield.

Marketing

In the United States as of December 31, 2009, we marketed gasoline, diesel and aviation fuel
through approximately 8,500 outlets in 49 states. The majority of these sites utilize thePhillips
66,Conocoor76brands.

Wholesale

At December 31, 2009, our wholesale operations utilized a network of marketers operating
approximately 7,680 outlets that provided refined product offtake from our refineries. A strong
emphasis is placed on the wholesale channel of trade because of its lower capital requirements. We
also buy and sell petroleum products in the spot market. Our refined products are marketed on both
a branded and unbranded basis.

In addition to automotive gasoline and diesel, we produce and market aviation gasoline, which is
used by smaller, piston engine aircraft. At December 31, 2009, aviation gasoline and jet fuel were
sold through independent marketers at approximately 710Phillips 66-branded locations in the United
States.

Retail

At December 31, 2009, CFJ Properties, our 50/50 joint venture with Flying J, owned and operated
approximately 110Flying J-branded truck travel plazas. Flying J filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy
protection in December 2008. In July 2009, Flying J and Pilot Travel Centers LLC (Pilot) announced
a planned merger of their retail businesses, which was approved by the bankruptcy court in January
2010, and is currently under governmental antitrust review. Subject to the closing of the Flying
J/Pilot merger and other customary conditions, we have agreed to sell our interest in CFJ to Pilot.

In December 2006, we announced our U.S. company-owned and company-operated retail outlets and our
U.S. company-owned and dealer-operated retail outlets would be divested to new or existing
wholesale marketers. Of the approximately 830 sites included in the held for sale plans,
approximately 100 dealer-operated sites remain to be sold in 2010.





Transportation

We distribute refined products to our customers via company-owned and common-carrier pipeline,
barge, railcar and truck.

Pipelines and Terminals

At December 31, 2009, R&M managed approximately 30,000 miles of common-carrier crude oil, raw
natural gas liquids, and petroleum products pipeline systems in the United States, including those
partially owned or operated by affiliates. We also owned or operated 44 finished product
terminals, seven liquefied petroleum gas terminals, five crude oil terminals and one coke exporting
facility.

In December 2007, we acquired a 50 percent equity interest in four Keystone Pipeline entities, to
create a joint venture with TransCanada Corporation. In 2008 we exercised an option to reduce our
equity interest through a dilution mechanism, which gradually lowered our ownership interest to
20.01 percent by the third quarter of 2009. In the third quarter of 2009, we sold our remaining
ownership interest in Keystone.

Tankers

At December 31, 2009, we had 21 double-hulled crude oil tankers under charter, with capacities
ranging in size from 713,000 to 2,100,000 barrels. These tankers are used primarily to transport
feedstocks to certain of our U.S. refineries. In addition, we  utilitized five double-hulled
product tankers to transport our heavy and clean products. The tankers discussed here exclude the
operations of the company’s subsidiary, Polar Tankers, Inc., which are discussed in the E&P
segment, as well as an owned tanker on lease to a third party for use in the North Sea.

Specialty Businesses

We manufacture and sell a variety of specialty products including petroleum cokes, lubes (such as
automotive and industrial lubricants), solvents, polypropylene and pipeline flow improvers. Our
lubes are marketed under thePhillips 66,Conoco,76andKendallbrands. We also manufacture and
market high-quality graphite and anode-grade petroleum cokes in the United States and Europe for
use in the global steel and aluminum industries.

The company’s 50 percent owned Excel Paralubes joint venture owns a hydrocracked lubricant base oil
manufacturing plant located adjacent to the Lake Charles Refinery. The facility produces
approximately 20,000 barrels per day of high-quality, clear hydrocracked base oils.

We operate a crude oil and products storage complex consisting of 7.5 million barrels of
storage capacity and an offshore mooring buoy, located about 80 miles southwest of the Whitegate
Refinery in Bantry Bay, Ireland.

In November 2009, we announced a delay in the planned upgrade of the Wilhelmshaven Refinery.
During 2010, we expect to complete procurement of long lead items in anticipation of project
commencement in 2012, contingent upon market conditions.

The project to expand the crude oil, conversion and treating unit capacity of the Melaka Refinery
is expected to be completed by the fourth quarter of 2010. When complete, our net share of the
refinery’s crude throughput capacity will increase from 61,000 to 80,000 barrels per day.

In 2006, we signed a Memorandum of Understanding with Saudi Aramco to conduct a detailed evaluation
of the proposed development of a 400,000 barrel-per-day, full-conversion refinery in Yanbu, Saudi
Arabia. The refinery would be designed to process Arabian heavy crude oil and produce
high-quality, ultra-low-sulfur refined products. Final investment decision on this project is
estimated to occur in 2010.

Marketing

At December 31, 2009, R&M had marketing operations in five European countries. Our European
marketing strategy is to sell primarily through owned, leased or joint venture retail sites using a
low-cost, high-volume strategy. We use theJETbrand name to market retail and wholesale products
in Austria, Germany and the United Kingdom. In addition, a joint venture in which we have an
equity interest markets products in Switzerland under theCoopbrand name. We also market aviation
fuels, liquid petroleum gases, heating oils, transportation fuels and marine bunkers to commercial
customers and into the bulk or spot market in the aforementioned countries and Ireland.

As of December 31, 2009, we had approximately 1,225 marketing outlets in our European operations,
of which approximately 880 were company-owned and 345 were dealer-owned. Through our joint venture
operations in Switzerland, we also have interests in 225 additional sites.



LUKOIL INVESTMENT

At December 31, 2009, our LUKOIL Investment segment represented 4 percent of ConocoPhillips’ total
assets. In 2004, we became a strategic equity investor in OAO LUKOIL, an international, integrated
oil and gas company headquartered in Russia. Under the Shareholder Agreement between the two
companies, we have representation on the LUKOIL Board of Directors, and LUKOIL’s corporate charter
requires unanimous Board consent for certain key decisions. At year-end 2009, we had a 20 percent
ownership interest in LUKOIL based on authorized and issued shares. Based on estimated shares
outstanding at year end, our ownership was 20.09 percent. We use the equity method of accounting
for our investment in LUKOIL. See Note 6—Investments, Loans and Long-Term Receivables, in the
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information.

As reported in LUKOIL’s publicly available 2008 annual report, the majority of its 2008 upstream
oil production was sourced within Russia, with 59 percent from the western Siberia Region, 18
percent from the Timan-Pechora Province and 12 percent from the Urals Region. Outside of Russia,
LUKOIL had 2008 oil production in Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Egypt and Azerbaijan, and gas production
in Uzbekistan, Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan. Seventy-five percent of LUKOIL’s natural gas production
was sourced within Russia. In addition, LUKOIL has an active exploration program primarily focused
in Russia, with additional activity in several countries. Downstream, LUKOIL has seven refineries,
as well as a 49 percent interest in the ISAB refinery complex in Italy, resulting in total net
crude oil throughput capacity of approximately 1.3 million barrels per day. In 2009, LUKOIL
acquired a 45 percent interest in a Dutch refinery. LUKOIL also has a marketing network extending
to 25 countries, with the majority of wholesale and retail sales in Russia, the United States and
Europe.







CHEMICALS

At December 31, 2009, our Chemicals segment represented 2 percent of ConocoPhillips’ total assets.
The Chemicals segment consists of our 50 percent equity investment in Chevron Phillips Chemical
Company LLC (CPChem), a joint venture with Chevron Corporation, headquartered in The Woodlands,
Texas.

CPChem’s business is structured around two primary operating segments: Olefins & Polyolefins and
Specialties, Aromatics & Styrenics. The Olefins & Polyolefins segment produces and markets
ethylene, propylene, and other olefin products, which are primarily consumed within CPChem for the
production of polyethylene, normal alpha olefins, polypropylene and polyethylene pipe. The
Specialties, Aromatics & Styrenics segment manufactures and markets aromatics products, such as
benzene, styrene, paraxylene and cyclohexane. This segment also manufactures and markets
polystyrene, as well as styrene-butadiene copolymers. Furthermore, this segment manufactures and
markets a variety of specialty chemical products including organosulfur chemicals, solvents,
catalysts, drilling chemicals, mining chemicals and high-performance engineering plastics and
compounds.

CPChem’s manufacturing facilities are located in Belgium, Brazil, China, Colombia, Qatar, Saudi
Arabia, Singapore, South Korea and the United States.

CPChem owns a 49 percent interest in Qatar Chemical Company Ltd. (Q-Chem), a joint venture that
owns a major olefins and polyolefins complex in Mesaieed, Qatar. CPChem also owns a 49 percent
interest in Qatar Chemical Company II Ltd. (Q-Chem II), a joint venture that began construction of
a second complex in Mesaieed in 2005. This Q-Chem II facility is designed to produce polyethylene
and normal alpha olefins on a site adjacent to the Q-Chem complex. In connection with this
project, CPChem entered into a separate agreement establishing a joint venture to develop an
ethylene cracker in Ras Laffan Industrial City, Qatar. Operational startup of the Q-Chem II
project is anticipated in the second half of 2010.

In 2008, Jubail Chevron Phillips Company, a 50 percent owned joint venture of CPChem, commenced
startup of an integrated styrene facility in Al Jubail, Saudi Arabia. The facility was built
adjacent to the existing aromatics complex owned by Saudi Chevron Phillips Company (SCP), another
50 percent owned CPChem joint venture. Project completion was achieved in July 2009.

In 2007, CPChem formed a 50 percent owned joint venture, Saudi Polymers Company (SPCo), to
construct and operate an integrated petrochemicals complex at Al Jubail, Saudi Arabia.
Construction began in January 2008, and commercial production is scheduled to begin in late 2011.
In July 2009, an initial public offering of shares in CPChem’s joint venture partner’s company was
completed, resulting in a corresponding increase in the partner’s ownership interest in SPCo, which
reduced CPChem’s ownership to 35 percent.



EMERGING BUSINESSES

At December 31, 2009, our Emerging Businesses segment represented 1 percent of ConocoPhillips’
total assets. The segment encompasses the development of new technologies and businesses outside
our normal operations. Activities within this segment are focused on power generation and new
technologies related to conventional and nonconventional hydrocarbon recovery (including heavy
oil), refining, alternative energy, biofuels and the environment.

The focus of our power business is on developing projects to support our E&P and R&M strategies.
While projects primarily in place to enable these strategies are included within their respective
segments, projects with a significant merchant component are included in the Emerging Businesses
segment.

The Immingham combined heat and power plant (CHP), a wholly owned 730-megawatt facility in the
United Kingdom, provides steam and electricity to the Humber Refinery and steam to a neighboring
refinery, as well as merchant power into the U.K. market. In December 2009, commercial operation
began on a 450-megawatt expansion, bringing total capacity to 1,180 megawatts.





We also own a gas-fired cogeneration plant in Orange, Texas, as well as a 50 percent operating
interest in Sweeny Cogeneration LP, a joint venture near the Sweeny Refinery complex.

Our Technology group focuses on developing new business opportunities designed to provide future
growth prospects for ConocoPhillips. Focus areas include advanced hydrocarbon processes, energy
efficiency technologies, new petroleum-based products, renewable fuels and carbon capture and
conversion technologies. We have commercialized production of renewable diesel, a new type of
renewable fuel that utilizes existing infrastructure. Relationships with Iowa State University,
Colorado Center for Biorefining and Biofuels, and Archer Daniels Midland to develop
second-generation biofuels have also been initiated. In addition, we have formed an internal group
to evaluate wind, solar and geothermal investment opportunities.

Our technology center in Qatar, which we developed with General Electric Company to research water
sustainability solutions for petroleum, petrochemical, municipal and agricultural applications,
opened in 2009.

We offer a gasification technology (E-Gas™) that uses petroleum coke, coal, and other low-value
hydrocarbons as feedstock, resulting in high-value synthesis gas used for a slate of products,
including power, substitute natural gas (SNG), hydrogen and chemicals. This clean, efficient
technology facilitates carbon capture and storage as well as minimizes criteria pollutant emissions
and reduces water consumption. E-Gas™ Technology has been utilized in commercial applications
since 1987 and is currently licensed to several third parties. We are currently pursuing three
projects that apply the E-Gas™ Technology, two in the United States and one in the United Kingdom.
We are also pursuing several additional licensing opportunities, primarily in Asia and North
America.



COMPETITION

We compete with private, public and state-owned companies in all facets of the petroleum and
chemicals businesses. Some of our competitors are larger and have greater resources. Each of our
segments is highly competitive. No single competitor, or small group of competitors, dominates any
of our business lines.

Upstream, our E&P segment competes with numerous other companies in the industry, including
state-owned companies, to locate and obtain new sources of supply and to produce oil and natural
gas in an efficient, cost-effective manner. Based on publicly available year-end 2008 reserves
statistics, we had the seventh-largest total of worldwide proved reserves of
nongovernment-controlled companies. We deliver our oil and natural gas production into the
worldwide oil and natural gas commodity markets. Principal methods of competing include
geological, geophysical and engineering research and technology; experience and expertise; economic
analysis in connection with portfolio management; and operating efficient oil and gas producing
properties.

The Midstream segment, through our equity investment in DCP Midstream and our consolidated
operations, competes with numerous other integrated petroleum companies, as well as natural gas
transmission and distribution companies, to deliver components of natural gas to end users in the
commodity natural gas markets. DCP Midstream is a large producer of natural gas liquids in the
United States. Principal methods of competing include economically securing the right to purchase
raw natural gas into gathering systems, managing the pressure of those systems, operating efficient
natural gas liquids processing plants and securing markets for the products produced.

Downstream, our R&M segment competes primarily in the United States, Europe and the Asia Pacific
Region. Based on the statistics published in the December 21, 2009, issue of theOil & Gas
Journal, our R&M segment had the largest U.S. refining capacity of 17 large refiners of petroleum
products. Worldwide, our refining capacity ranked fourth among nongovernment-controlled companies.
In the Chemicals segment, CPChem generally ranked within the top 10 producers of many of its major
product lines, based on average 2009 production capacity, as published by industry sources.
Petroleum products, petrochemicals and plastics are delivered into the worldwide commodity markets.
Elements of competition for both our R&M and Chemicals segments include product improvement, new
product development, low-cost structures, and efficient manufacturing and distribution systems. In
the marketing portion of the business, competitive factors include product properties and
processibility, reliability of supply, customer service, price and credit terms, advertising and
sales promotion, and development of customer loyalty to ConocoPhillips’ or CPChem’s branded
products.
