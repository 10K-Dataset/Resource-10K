Items 1 and 2. BUSINESS AND PROPERTIES

CORPORATE STRUCTURE

ConocoPhillips is an international,
integrated energy company. ConocoPhillips was incorporated in the state of Delaware on November 16, 2001, in connection with, and in anticipation of, the merger between Conoco Inc. and Phillips Petroleum Company. The merger between Conoco and
Phillips was consummated on August 30, 2002.

Our business is organized into six operating segments:



•Exploration and Production (E&P)—This segment primarily explores for, produces, transports and markets crude oil, bitumen, natural gas,
liquefied natural gas (LNG) and natural gas liquids on a worldwide basis.

•Midstream—This segment gathers, processes and markets natural gas produced by ConocoPhillips and others, and fractionates and markets
natural gas liquids, predominantly in the United States and Trinidad. The Midstream segment primarily consists of our 50 percent equity investment in DCP Midstream, LLC.

•Refining and Marketing (R&M)—This segment purchases, refines, markets and transports crude oil and petroleum products, mainly in the
United States, Europe and Asia.

•LUKOIL Investment—This segment consists of our past investment in the ordinary shares of OAO LUKOIL, an international, integrated oil
and gas company headquartered in Russia. We completed the divestiture of our entire interest in LUKOIL in the first quarter of 2011.

•Chemicals—This segment manufactures and markets petrochemicals and plastics on a worldwide basis. The Chemicals segment consists of our 50
percent equity investment in Chevron Phillips Chemical Company LLC (CPChem).

•Emerging Businesses—This segment represents our investment in new technologies or businesses outside our normal scope of operations.

At December 31, 2011, ConocoPhillips employed approximately 29,800 people.

Planned Separation of Downstream Businesses

On July 14, 2011, we announced approval by our Board of Directors to pursue the separation of our refining, marketing and transportation businesses into a stand-alone, publicly traded corporation via
a tax-free distribution. The new downstream company, named Phillips 66, will be headquartered in Houston, Texas. In addition to the refining, marketing and transportation businesses, we expect Phillips 66 will also include most of our Midstream
segment, our Chemicals segment, as well as our power generation and certain technology operations included in our Emerging Businesses segment, to create an integrated downstream company.







Index to Financial Statements

The separation would be accomplished by the pro rata distribution of one share of Phillips 66 stock for
every two shares of ConocoPhillips stock held by ConocoPhillips’ shareholders on the record date for such distribution.

In October 2011,
we requested a private letter ruling from the U.S. Internal Revenue Service, which is expected to confirm the distribution will qualify as a tax-free reorganization for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In addition, we filed the initial Phillips 66
Form 10 registration statement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on November 14, 2011, and an amendment on January 3, 2012.

The separation is subject to market conditions, customary regulatory approvals, the receipt of an affirmative Internal Revenue Service private letter ruling and final Board approval, and is expected to be
completed in the second quarter of 2012.

SEGMENT AND GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION

For operating segment and geographic information, see Note 25—Segment Disclosures and Related Information, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements, which is incorporated herein by reference.

EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION (E&P)

At December 31, 2011, our E&P segment represented 67 percent of ConocoPhillips’ total assets. This segment primarily
explores for, produces, transports and markets crude oil, bitumen, natural gas and natural gas liquids on a worldwide basis. Operations to liquefy natural gas, transport and market the resulting LNG are also included in the E&P segment. At
December 31, 2011, our E&P operations were producing in the United States, Norway, the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, offshore Timor-Leste in the Timor Sea, Indonesia, China, Vietnam, Libya, Nigeria, Algeria, Qatar and Russia.

The E&P segment does not include the financial results or statistics from our prior investment in the ordinary shares of LUKOIL, which
are reported in our LUKOIL Investment segment. As a result, references to results, production, prices and other statistics throughout the E&P segment discussion exclude amounts related to LUKOIL. However, our share of LUKOIL is included in the
“Oil and Gas Operations” disclosures, as well as in the following net proved reserves table, for periods before we ceased using equity-method accounting for this investment, which occurred at the end of the third quarter of 2010.

The information listed below appears in the “Oil and Gas Operations” disclosures following the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements and is incorporated herein by reference:



•Proved worldwide crude oil and natural gas liquids, natural gas, bitumen and synthetic oil reserves.

•Net production of crude oil and natural gas liquids, natural gas, bitumen and synthetic oil.

•Average sales prices of crude oil and natural gas liquids, natural gas, bitumen and synthetic oil.

•Average production costs per barrel of oil equivalent (BOE).

•Net wells completed, wells in progress and productive wells.

•Developed and undeveloped acreage.







Index to Financial Statements

The following table is a summary of the proved reserves information included in the “Oil and Gas
Operations” disclosures following the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Approximately 80 percent of our proved reserves are located in politically stable countries that belong to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and
Development. Natural gas reserves are converted to BOE based on a 6:1 ratio: six thousand cubic feet of natural gas converts to one BOE. See Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for a discussion
of factors that will enhance the understanding of the table below.

In 2011, E&P’s worldwide production, including its share of equity affiliates, averaged 1,619,000 barrels
of oil equivalent per day (BOED), compared with 1,752,000 BOED in 2010. During 2011, 653,000 BOED were produced in the United States, a 5 percent decrease from 686,000 BOED in 2010. Production from our international E&P operations averaged
966,000 BOED in 2011, a 9 percent decrease from 1,066,000 BOED in 2010. Worldwide production decreased primarily due to suspended operations in Libya and Bohai Bay, China, asset dispositions and unplanned downtime. Normal field decline was
largely offset by new production.

E&P’s worldwide annual average crude oil and natural gas liquids sales price increased 34 percent,
from $72.77 per barrel in 2010 to $97.22 per barrel in 2011. Worldwide bitumen prices increased 18 percent, from $53.06 per barrel in 2010 to $62.56 per barrel in 2011. E&P’s average annual worldwide natural gas sales price increased 7
percent, from $4.98 per thousand cubic feet in 2010 to $5.34 per thousand cubic feet in 2011.

E&P—UNITED STATES

In 2011, U.S. E&P operations contributed 45 percent of E&P’s worldwide liquids production and 36 percent of natural gas production.

Greater Prudhoe Area

The Greater Prudhoe Area includes the Prudhoe Bay Field and five satellite fields, as well as the Greater Point McIntyre Area fields. Prudhoe Bay, the largest oil field on Alaska’s North Slope, is
the site of a large waterflood and enhanced oil recovery operation, as well as a gas processing plant which processes natural gas for reinjection into the reservoir. Prudhoe Bay’s satellites are Aurora, Borealis, Polaris, Midnight Sun and
Orion, while the Point McIntyre, Niakuk, Raven and Lisburne fields are part of the Greater Point McIntyre Area.

Greater Kuparuk
Area

We operate the Greater Kuparuk Area, which is made up of the Kuparuk Field and four satellite fields: Tarn, Tabasco, Meltwater
and West Sak. Kuparuk is located 40 miles west of Prudhoe Bay on Alaska’s North Slope. Field installations include three central production facilities that separate oil, natural gas and water, as well as a separate seawater treatment plant. The
natural gas is either used for fuel or compressed for reinjection.

Western North Slope

On the Western North Slope, we operate the Colville River Unit, which includes the Alpine Field and three satellite fields: Nanuq, Fiord and Qannik.
Alpine is located 34 miles west of Kuparuk. In December 2011, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers granted us a permit required to build a gravel road, bridge and pipeline crossing over the Nigliq channel of the Colville River for development of a
satellite field west of Alpine in the National Petroleum Reserve—Alaska (NPRA), the Alpine West CD5 Project. We plan to incorporate the terms of the permit into our project plan as we progress project sanctioning of CD5 in 2012. Initial
production is anticipated toward the end of 2015.

Cook Inlet Area

We operate the North Cook Inlet Unit, the Beluga River Unit, and the Kenai LNG Plant in the Cook Inlet Area. We have a 100 percent interest in the North Cook Inlet Unit, while we own 33.3 percent of the
Beluga River Unit. Our share of production is used to supply feedstock and fuel to the Kenai LNG Plant and is also sold to local utilities.

In October 2011, we acquired an additional 30 percent interest in the Kenai LNG Plant, bringing our ownership interest to 100 percent. The Kenai LNG
Plant had historically supplied LNG to utility companies in Japan. Due to market conditions, the Kenai Plant was scheduled to be mothballed in the second quarter of 2011; however, we delayed the shutdown in order to ship additional cargoes to Asia,
due to energy shortages caused by the earthquake and tsunami in Japan. In November 2011, we idled the plant for future use. We subsequently secured additional third-party gas supplies, and as a result, expect to resume limited LNG exports in the
second half of 2012.

Exploration

In the February 2008 Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) Lease Sale 193, we successfully bid and were awarded 10-year-primary-term leases on 98 blocks in the Chukchi Sea. We plan to drill an exploration
well on our Chukchi Sea leasehold in 2014, subject to the outcome of pending litigation challenging Lease Sale 193 and the receipt of required regulatory permits.

In January 2010, we exchanged a 25 percent working interest in 50 of our leases in the Chukchi Sea for cash consideration and additional working interests in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. In late 2010, we
entered into an agreement to farm-down an additional 10 percent of our working interest in the same Chukchi Sea leases, and that agreement received regulatory approval in July 2011.

Transportation

We transport the petroleum liquids produced on the North Slope to
south-central Alaska through an 800-mile pipeline that is part of the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System (TAPS). We have a 28.3 percent ownership interest in TAPS, and we also have ownership interests in the Alpine, Kuparuk and Oliktok Pipelines on
the North Slope.

Our wholly owned subsidiary, Polar Tankers, Inc., manages the marine transportation of our North Slope production, using
five company-owned double-hulled tankers in addition to chartering third-party vessels as necessary.

In 2008, ConocoPhillips and BP plc
formed a limited liability company to progress the pipeline project named Denali—The Alaska Gas Pipeline. The project was intended to move natural gas from Alaska’s North Slope to North American markets. In May 2011, the project was
canceled as a result of insufficient customer transportation commitments to the project.

Onshore

Our 2011 onshore production principally consisted of natural gas and associated liquids production, with the majority of production located in the San Juan Basin, Permian Basin, Lobo Trend, Eagle Ford,
Williston Basin, panhandles of Texas and Oklahoma, Fort Worth Basin, Anadarko Basin and Bossier Trend. We also have operations in the Wind River Basin, East Texas, Rockies and northern and southern Louisiana. Onshore activities in 2011 were centered
mostly on continued optimization and development of existing assets, with particular focus on areas with higher liquids production.







Index to Financial Statements

•Shale Plays

Exploration and development continues in our shale positions in Eagle Ford, Bakken and Barnett. In the Eagle Ford, we drilled approximately 160 exploration and development wells in 2011 and plan to drill
approximately 200 wells in 2012. With subsequent investments, we expect to achieve peak production in 2017 and long-term average production of 140,000 BOED. During 2011, we acquired approximately 240,000 additional acres in various resource plays
across the Lower 48, which included the Avalon, Wolfcamp and Niobrara areas, further expanding our significant acreage position in Lower 48 shale plays.



•San Juan

The San Juan Basin, located in northwestern New Mexico and southwestern Colorado, includes the majority of our U.S. coalbed methane (CBM) production. We continue to pursue development opportunities in
three conventional formations in the San Juan Basin.

Gulf of Mexico

At year-end 2011, our portfolio of producing properties in the Gulf of Mexico consisted of one operated field and three fields operated by co-venturers, including:



•75 percent operator interest in the Magnolia Field in Garden Banks Blocks 783 and 784.

•16 percent nonoperator interest in the unitized Ursa Field located in the Mississippi Canyon Area.

•16 percent nonoperator interest in the Princess Field, a northern, subsalt extension of the Ursa Field.

•12.4 percent nonoperator interest in the unitized K2 Field, comprised of seven blocks in the Green Canyon Area.

Exploration

In the Gulf of
Mexico, we have a 45 percent interest in the Coronado well, which was spud in October 2011. A decision to cease drilling the well was made prior to reaching the targeted depth, and the well was expensed as a dry hole. We are in the planning process
to appraise the results of Tiber and Shenandoah, which were discovered in 2009. Additionally, we were the successful bidder on 75 blocks in the Paleogene play in OCS Lease Sale 218 in December 2011. We expect these blocks will be awarded in 2012.

Offshore south Louisiana, we drilled the Shalimar exploration well. The well did not reach its target depth due to technical drilling issues
and was expensed as a dry hole.

Onshore, we actively pursued the appraisal of our existing unconventional resource plays, including the Eagle
Ford in South Texas, the Bakken in the Williston Basin, and the Barnett in the Fort Worth Basin. We have seen encouraging results in these liquids-rich plays and plan to continue appraisal and development in 2012.

Transportation

We have a 25
percent interest in the Rockies Express Pipeline (REX). The REX natural gas pipeline runs 1,679 miles from Cheyenne, Colorado, to Clarington, Ohio, and has a natural gas transmission capacity of 1.8 billion cubic feet per day. Numerous
compression facilities support the pipeline system. The REX pipeline is designed to enable natural gas producers in the Rocky Mountains region to deliver natural gas supplies to the Midwest and eastern regions of the United States. Upon the
completion of the separation of the downstream businesses, we expect REX will be included in the new downstream company, Phillips 66.

E&P—EUROPE

In 2011, E&P
operations in Europe contributed 20 percent of E&P’s worldwide liquids production and 14 percent of natural gas production. Our European assets are principally located in the Norwegian and U.K. sectors of the North Sea.

The Greater Ekofisk Area, located approximately 200 miles offshore Stavanger, Norway in the North Sea, is comprised
of four producing fields: Ekofisk, Eldfisk, Embla and Tor. Ekofisk crude oil is exported to Teesside, England, and the natural gas is exported to Emden, Germany. Our Ekofisk South and Eldfisk II projects continue to progress, with production from
both of these projects expected in 2013 and 2014, respectively.

The Alvheim development consists of a floating production, storage and
offloading (FPSO) vessel and subsea installations. Produced crude oil is exported via shuttle tankers, and natural gas is transported to the United Kingdom via a pipeline to the Beryl-Sage system.

The Heidrun Field is located in the Norwegian Sea. Produced crude oil is transported to Mongstad in Norway and Tetney in the United Kingdom by
double-hulled shuttle tankers. Part of the natural gas is transported and sold to buyers in Europe, while the remainder is used as feedstock in a methanol plant in Norway, in which we own an 18.3 percent interest.

The Statfjord Field straddles the boundary between the United Kingdom and Norway. In January 2012, we entered into an agreement to sell our interests in
the Statfjord Field and associated satellites. The transaction is expected to close in the second quarter of 2012.

We also have varying
ownership interests in five other producing fields in the Norwegian sector of the North Sea and in the Norwegian Sea.

Exploration

During 2011, we drilled one exploration well, Peking Duck (7/11-12S), including the Agn sidetrack well (7/11-12A). The wells were
non-commercial gas discoveries and were expensed as dry holes. In addition, we participated in two partner-operated wells, Caterpillar (PL340BS) in the Alvheim Area and Arran (PL309) in the Oseberg Area. The Caterpillar discovery is currently being
evaluated. Arran was a dry hole and has been plugged and abandoned.

We were awarded three new licenses in the Norwegian
21stLicensing Round: PL603, a 25 percent working interest
in the Norwegian Sea; PL605, a 50 percent operating interest in the Barents Sea; and PL615, a 25 percent working interest in the Barents Sea. We acquired 3D seismic over PL605.

Transportation

We own a 35.1 percent interest in the Norpipe Oil Pipeline System, a
220-mile pipeline which carries crude oil from Ekofisk to a terminal and natural gas processing facility in Teesside, England. In addition, we own a 1.9 percent interest in Norwegian Continental Shelf Gas Transportation (Gassled), which owns
most of the Norwegian gas transportation infrastructure.

In addition to our interest in the Britannia natural gas and condensate field, we own 50 percent of Britannia Operator
Limited, the operator of the field. Condensate is delivered through the Forties Pipeline to an oil stabilization and processing plant near the Grangemouth Refinery in Scotland, while natural gas is transported through Britannia’s line to St.
Fergus, Scotland. The Britannia satellite fields, Callanish and Brodgar, produce via subsea manifolds and pipelines linked to the Britannia platform.

J-Block is comprised of the Judy/Joanne, Jade and Jasmine fields, located in the U.K. central North Sea. In 2010, we received government approval for the development of the Jasmine Field, which is
expected to achieve average net peak production of 34,000 BOED by 2013.

We have various ownership interests in 18 producing gas fields in the
Rotliegendes and Carboniferous areas of the Southern North Sea. Our interests in the East Irish Sea include the Millom, Dalton and Calder fields, which are operated on our behalf by a third party.

We own a 24 percent interest in the Clair Field, located in the Atlantic Margin. The Clair Ridge Project received government approval in October 2011,
and we anticipate initial production in 2016.

In December 2011, we entered into an agreement to sell our interests in the MacCulloch, Alba
and Nicol fields. The sales of these interests are expected to close in the first half of 2012.

Exploration

During 2011, we participated in two partner-operated exploration wells. Well 206/12a-3 in the Clair South West Area, West of Shetlands, was an oil
discovery and has been suspended in order to evaluate development options for the area. The Cameron well (44/19a-7a) in the Southern North Sea was a small gas discovery and is currently being evaluated for commerciality.

Transportation

We have a 10
percent interest in the Interconnector Pipeline, which links the United Kingdom and Belgium and facilitates the marketing throughout Europe of natural gas produced in the United Kingdom. We have export capability to ship up to 220 million cubic
feet of natural gas per day to markets in continental Europe via the Interconnector, and our reverse-flow rights provide 85 million cubic feet per day of import capability into the United Kingdom.

We operate the Teesside oil and Theddlethorpe gas terminals in which we have 29.3 percent and 50 percent ownership interests, respectively. We
also have a 100 percent ownership interest in the Rivers Gas Terminal, operated by a third party, in the United Kingdom.

Western Canada

Our operations in western Canada are primarily comprised of three core development areas: Deep Basin, Kaybob and O’Chiese, which extend from central Alberta to northeastern British Columbia. We
operate or have ownership interests in approximately 80 natural gas processing plants in the region, and, as of December 31, 2011, held leasehold rights in 6 million net acres in western Canada.

Oil Sands

We hold approximately
1 million net acres of land in the Athabasca Region of northeastern Alberta. Our bitumen resources in Canada are produced via an enhanced thermal oil recovery method called steam-assisted gravity drainage (SAGD), whereby steam is injected into
the reservoir, effectively liquefying the heavy bitumen, which is recovered and pumped to the surface for further processing.



•Surmont

The Surmont oil sands lease is located approximately 35 miles south of Fort McMurray, Alberta. Surmont Phase II construction began in 2010, with production startup targeted for 2015. Surmont’s net
production is expected to increase to 50,000 barrels per day by 2016.



•FCCL

We have two 50/50 North American heavy oil business ventures with Cenovus Energy Inc.: FCCL Partnership, a Canadian upstream general partnership, and WRB Refining LP, a U.S. downstream limited
partnership. FCCL’s assets, operated by Cenovus, include the Foster Creek, Christina Lake and Narrows Lake SAGD bitumen projects.

Construction continued in 2011 on Foster Creek Phase F, the first of three additional approved expansion phases. Upon completion of Foster Creek Phases F, G and H, net peak production is anticipated to
increase by 42,500 barrels per day beginning in 2014. At Christina Lake, first production for Phase C occurred in the third quarter of 2011. Construction of Christina Lake Phase D continued through 2011, with initial production expected in late
2012. Once phases C and D are both fully operational, net peak production at Christina Lake is estimated to be 47,000 barrels per day. Christina Lake Phases E, F and G received regulatory approval in the second quarter of 2011, and construction on
Phase E commenced in the third quarter of 2011.







Index to Financial Statements

Narrows Lake is an emerging opportunity within the FCCL Partnership. A regulatory application for the development of Narrows Lake was submitted in June 2010, and we anticipate receiving a
response in the second quarter of 2012. Initial production is anticipated in 2017.

For information on WRB, see the
“Refining and Marketing (R&M)” section.

Parsons Lake/Mackenzie Gas Project

We are involved with three other energy companies, as members of the Mackenzie Delta Producers’ Group, on the development of the Mackenzie Valley
Pipeline and gathering system, which is proposed to transport onshore gas production from the Mackenzie Delta in northern Canada to established markets in North America. We have a 75 percent interest in the Parsons Lake natural gas field, one of the
primary fields in the Mackenzie Delta, which would anchor the pipeline development. In March 2011, the project received regulatory approval from the National Energy Board of Canada. However, due to a continued decline in market conditions and lack
of resolution with the Canadian government on fiscal terms, we are currently evaluating multiple options regarding the scope and timing of this project. Should the project not proceed, we would need to assess for impairment the carrying value of the
undeveloped leasehold and capitalized project development costs, which totaled $662 million at December 31, 2011, including capitalized interest.

Amauligak

We have a 53.8 percent operating interest in Amauligak, which lies
approximately 31 miles offshore in shallow water in the Beaufort Sea. A range of development options are being evaluated.

Exploration

We hold exploration
acreage in four areas of Canada: offshore eastern Canada, onshore western Canada, the Mackenzie Delta/Beaufort Sea Region and the Arctic Islands. During 2011, we conducted pilot drilling programs in the Muskwa (Horn River Basin) and Duvernay
(West Shale Basin) unconventional resource plays, and we acquired approximately 260,000 acres of exploration leasehold in the Canol Shale, Duvernay Shale and other plays.

E&P—SOUTH AMERICA

Venezuela

In 2007, we announced we had been unable to reach agreement with respect to our migration to anempresa mixtastructure mandated by the Venezuelan
government’s Nationalization Decree. As a result, Venezuela’s national oil company, Petróleos de Venezuela S.A. (PDVSA), or its affiliates, directly assumed control over ConocoPhillips’ interests in the Petrozuata and
Hamaca heavy oil ventures and the offshore Corocoro development project. In response to this expropriation, we filed a request for international arbitration on November 2, 2007, with the World Bank’s International Centre for Settlement of
Investment Disputes (ICSID). An arbitration hearing was held before an ICSID tribunal during the summer of 2010, and we are currently awaiting an interim decision on key legal and factual issues. A separate arbitration hearing was held in January
2012 before the International Chamber of Commerce on ConocoPhillips’ separate claims against PDVSA for certain breaches of their Association Agreements prior to the expropriation.

Ecuador

In 2008, Burlington Resources, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of ConocoPhillips,
initiated arbitration before ICSID against The Republic of Ecuador, as a result of the newly enacted Windfall Profits Tax Law and government-mandated renegotiation of our production sharing contracts. Despite a restraining order issued by ICSID,
Ecuador confiscated the crude oil production of Burlington and its co-venturer and sold the illegally seized crude oil. In 2009, Ecuador took over operations in Blocks 7 and 21, fully expropriating our assets. In June 2010, the ICSID tribunal
concluded it has jurisdiction to hear the expropriation claim. An arbitration hearing on case merits occurred in March 2011. On September 30, 2011, Ecuador filed a supplemental counterclaim asserting environmental damages, which we believe will
not be material. The arbitration process is ongoing.

Australia Pacific LNG

Australia Pacific LNG (APLNG), our joint venture with Origin Energy and China Petrochemical Corporation (Sinopec), is focused on producing CBM from the Bowen and Surat basins in Queensland, Australia.
Origin operates APLNG’s production and pipeline system, and we will operate the LNG facility. Natural gas is currently sold to domestic customers, while progress continues on the development of an LNG processing and export sales business. Once
established, this will enhance our LNG position and serve as an additional LNG hub supplying Asia Pacific markets. Two initial 4.5-million-tonnes-per-year LNG trains are anticipated, with over 10,000 net wells ultimately envisioned to supply both
the domestic gas market and the LNG development. The additional wells will be supported by expanded gas gathering systems, centralized gas processing and compression stations, and water treatment facilities, in addition to a new export pipeline from
the gas fields to the LNG facilities.

The project received environmental approval from the Australian federal government in February 2011,
and a final investment decision on the initial LNG train and common facilities was approved in July 2011. The project’s first LNG exports are expected to begin in 2015.

In April 2011, APLNG and Sinopec signed definitive agreements for APLNG to supply up to 4.3 million tonnes of LNG per year for 20 years. The agreements also specified terms under which Sinopec

Greater Sunrise

We have a 30 percent interest in the Greater Sunrise gas and condensate field located in the Timor Sea. Although the governments of Australia and
Timor-Leste have reached an agreement concerning sharing of revenues from the anticipated development of Greater Sunrise, key challenges must be resolved before significant funding commitments can be made. These include gaining both
governments’ approval of the development concept selected by the co-venturers.

Exploration

We operate three permits located in the Browse Basin, offshore northwest Australia. We own a 60 percent interest in two of the permits, WA-315-P and
WA-398-P. In February 2012, we received regulatory approval to reduce our interest in the third permit, WA-314-P, from 60 percent to 10 percent. The first phase of drilling in 2009/2010 resulted in discoveries in WA-315-P and WA-398-P. In 2011,
we completed the analysis of the 3-D seismic survey acquired during the 2009/2010 drilling campaign. The Phase II drilling campaign will commence in the first quarter of 2012 and will comprise a five- to eight-well program.

During 2011, we executed an option agreement to earn up to a 75 percent working interest in the Goldwyer Shale Project located in the Canning Basin
of Western Australia. Drilling is expected to commence in 2012. Upon completion of the initial drilling program, we will have the right to assume operatorship of the Goldwyer Shale Project. The agreement is awaiting regulatory approvals.

In the Bonaparte Basin, offshore northern Australia, we operate and own a 60 percent interest in two permits, NT/P69 and NT/P61. During 2011, we
reprocessed the seismic data over the Caldita structure in NT/P61, which will allow us to fully evaluate the remaining exploration potential of the permit.

onshore South Sumatra.

South Natuna Sea Block B

The offshore South Natuna Sea Block B PSC has two producing oil fields and 16 natural gas fields in various stages of development. Natural gas production is sold under international sales agreements
to Malaysia and Singapore.

South Sumatra

The Corridor PSC consists of six oil fields and six natural gas fields in various stages of development. Natural gas is supplied from the Grissik and Suban gas processing plants to the Duri steamflood in
central Sumatra and to markets in Singapore, Batam and West Java. Unitization of the Suban natural gas field was finalized in 2011, and as a result, 10 percent of the field’s proved reserves are now attributable to an adjacent PSC. The South
Jambi “B” PSC includes three gas fields which are in various stages of development.

Exploration

We operate two offshore exploration PSCs, Kuma and Arafura Sea, with ownership interests of 60 percent and 51 percent, respectively. During 2011, we
drilled the Kaluku well in the Kuma PSC and the Mutiara Putih well in the Arafura Sea PSC. Both were expensed as dry holes. A third PSC, Amborip VI, was relinquished in 2011. We also own and operate an 80 percent interest in the Warim onshore

The Peng Lai 19-3, 19-9 and 25-6 fields are located in Bohai Bay Block 11/05. Production from the Phase I development of
the PL 19-3 Field began in 2002. The Phase II development includes six drilling and production platforms and an FPSO vessel used to accommodate production from all the fields.







Index to Financial Statements

On July 13, 2011, the State Oceanic Administration (SOA) in the People’s Republic of China
instructed us to suspend production from the Peng Lai 19-3 Field Platforms B and C, as a result of two separate seepage incidents which occurred near the platforms. On September 2, 2011, the SOA ordered us to halt operations at the Peng Lai
19-3 Field, pending additional cleanup efforts and reservoir depressurization activities to ensure any residual seepage had stopped. The incidents resulted in a total release of approximately 700 barrels of oil into Bohai Bay and approximately
2,600 barrels of mineral oil-based drilling mud onto the seafloor. The mineral oil-based drilling mud was recovered and cleaned up from the seafloor. The sources of the seeps have been sealed and containment devices deployed as a preventative
measure to capture any residue.

The SOA also required implementation of preventative measures to avoid recurrence, in addition to the filing
of an updated environmental impact assessment and development plan for approval. A revised development plan was submitted to China’s National Development and Reform Commission in November 2011 and is currently under review. A revised
environmental impact assessment was submitted to the SOA in February 2012.

The approved depressurization plan, combined with limited
development and field optimization, reduced 2011 average daily net production from the field by 14,000 barrels of oil per day, compared to 2010 production levels. Future impacts on our business are not known at this time.

In January 2012, we and the China National Offshore Oil Corp. (CNOOC) announced an agreement with China’s Ministry of Agriculture to resolve
fishery-related issues in connection with the seepage incidents. Under this agreement, approximately $160 million will be paid as compensation to settle private claims of potentially affected fishermen in relevant Bohai Bay communities, and public
claims for alleged fishery damage. We hold a 49 percent ownership interest in the Peng Lai fields. The agreement fulfills the objectives of the compensation fund we announced in September 2011. As part of this agreement, we have also designated
approximately $16 million of our previously announced environmental fund to be used to improve fishery resources and for related projects.

The Panyu development, also located in the South China Sea, is comprised of three oil fields: Panyu 4-2, Panyu 5-1 and Panyu 11-6. An expansion of the
scope and capacity of the existing Panyu 4-2 and Panyu 5-1 fields is being undertaken, with the addition of two production platforms targeted for completion in 2013.

MIDSTREAM

At December 31, 2011, our Midstream segment represented 2 percent of ConocoPhillips’ total assets. Our Midstream business is primarily
conducted through our 50 percent equity investment in DCP Midstream, LLC, a joint venture with Spectra Energy.

The Midstream business
purchases raw natural gas from producers and gathers natural gas through extensive pipeline gathering systems. The gathered natural gas is then processed to extract natural gas liquids. The remaining “residue” gas is marketed to electrical
utilities, industrial users and gas marketing companies. Most of the natural gas liquids are fractionated—separated into individual components such as ethane, butane and propane—and marketed as chemical feedstock, fuel or refinery
blendstock. Total natural gas liquids extracted in 2011, including our share of DCP Midstream, averaged 200,000 barrels per day.

DCP
Midstream is headquartered in Denver, Colorado. At December 31, 2011, DCP Midstream owned or operated 61 natural gas processing facilities, with a gross inlet capacity of 7.2 billion cubic feet per day of natural gas. Its natural gas pipeline
systems included gathering services for these facilities, as well as natural gas transmission, and totaled approximately 62,000 miles of pipeline. At December 31, 2011, DCP Midstream also owned or operated 12 natural gas liquids
fractionation plants, along with propane terminal facilities and natural gas liquids pipeline assets.

In 2011, DCP Midstream’s raw
natural gas throughput averaged 6.1 billion cubic feet per day, and natural gas liquids extraction averaged 383,000 barrels per day. DCP Midstream’s assets are primarily located in the following producing regions of the United States:
Rocky Mountains, Midcontinent, Permian, East Texas/North Louisiana, South Texas, Central Texas and Gulf Coast.







Index to Financial Statements

DCP Midstream markets a portion of its natural gas liquids to us and CPChem under a supply agreement whose
volume commitments remain steady until December 31, 2014. This purchase commitment is on an “if-produced, will-purchase” basis and is expected to have a relatively stable purchase pattern over the remaining term of the contract. Under
the agreement, natural gas liquids are purchased at various published market index prices, less transportation and fractionation fees.

DCP
Midstream is constructing a natural gas processing plant in the Eagle Ford shale area of Texas. The plant, named the Eagle Plant, is expected to have a capacity of 200 million cubic feet per day and be accompanied by related natural gas liquids
infrastructure. The Eagle Plant would increase DCP Midstream’s total natural gas processing capacity in the area to 1 billion cubic feet per day and is expected to be online in the third quarter of 2012.

DCP Midstream is building a major natural gas liquids pipeline in Texas. The Sand Hills Pipeline is designed to provide new natural gas liquids
transportation capacity from the Permian Basin and Eagle Ford shale area to markets in the Gulf Coast. The pipeline’s initial capacity is expected to be 200,000 barrels per day, with expansion to 350,000 barrels per day possible. The
pipeline will be phased into service, with completion of the first phase expected by the third quarter of 2012 to accommodate DCP Midstream’s growing Eagle Ford liquids volumes. Service from the Permian Basin could be available as soon as the
third quarter of 2013.

Outside of DCP Midstream, our U.S. natural gas liquids business includes the following:



•A 25,000-barrel-per-day capacity natural gas liquids fractionation plant in Gallup, New Mexico.

•A 22.5 percent equity interest in Gulf Coast Fractionators, which owns a natural gas liquids fractionation plant in Mont Belvieu, Texas. Our net share
of capacity is 24,300 barrels per day. In October 2010, Gulf Coast Fractionators announced plans to expand the capacity of its fractionation facility to 145,000 barrels per day, which would bring our net capacity to approximately
32,600 barrels per day. The expansion is expected to be operational in the second quarter of 2012.

•A 40 percent interest in a fractionation plant in Conway, Kansas. Our net share of capacity is 43,200 barrels per day.

•A 12.5 percent equity interest in a fractionation plant in Mont Belvieu, Texas. Our net share of capacity is 26,000 barrels per day.

•Marketing operations that optimize the flow of natural gas liquids and markets propane on a wholesale basis.

We also own a 39 percent equity interest in Phoenix Park Gas Processors Limited, which processes natural gas in Trinidad and markets natural gas liquids
throughout the Atlantic Basin. Its facilities include a 2-billion-cubic-feet-per-day gas processing plant and a 70,000-barrel-per-day natural gas liquids fractionator. In 2011, our share of natural gas liquids extracted averaged 8,000 barrels per
day, and our share of fractionated liquids averaged 16,000 barrels per day.

Upon completion of the separation of the downstream
businesses, we expect all of our investments in Midstream will be included in Phillips 66, with the exception of the Gallup, New Mexico natural gas liquids fractionation plant and our equity interest in Phoenix Park.
