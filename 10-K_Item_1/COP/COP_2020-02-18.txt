Total production of 1,348 MBOED increased 5 percent in 2019 compared with 2018.



The increase in total

average production primarily resulted from new wellsonline in the Lower 48; an increased interest inthe

Western North Slope (WNS) and Greater Kuparuk Area (GKA) of Alaska followingacquisitions closed in

2018; and higher production in Norway due to drillingactivity and the startup of Aasta Hansteenin December

2018.The increase in production was partly offset by normalfield decline and disposition impacts,primarily

from the U.K. asset sale in 2019 and non-coreasset sales in the Lower 48 during 2018.






























Production excluding Libya was 1,305 MBOED in2019 compared with 1,242 MBOED in 2018, anincrease of

63 MBOED or 5 percent.Underlying production, which excludes Libya andthe net volume impact from

closed dispositions and acquisitions of 51 MBOEDin 2019 and 47 MBOED in 2018, is used to measureour

ability to grow production organically.Our underlying production grew 5 percent to1,254 MBOED in 2019

from 1,195 MBOED in 2018.



Our worldwide annual average realized pricewas $48.78 per BOE in 2019,a decrease of 9 percent compared

with $53.88 per BOE in 2018,reflecting weaker marker prices as a result ofmacroeconomic demand concerns.

Our worldwide annual average crude oil pricedecreased 10 percent, from $68.13 per barrelin 2018 to $60.99

per barrel in 2019.Additionally, our worldwide annual average NGL prices decreased 34 percent,from

$30.48 per barrel in 2018 to $20.09 per barrel in2019.Our worldwide annual average natural gas price

decreased 11 percent, from $5.65 per MCF in 2018 to $5.03 per MCFin 2019.Average annual bitumen prices

increased 42 percent, from $22.29 per barrel in 2018to $31.72 per barrel in 2019.





ALASKA



The Alaska segment primarily explores for, produces, transportsand markets crude oil, natural gas and NGLs.

We are the largest crude oil producer in Alaska and have major ownership interests intwo of North America’s

largest oil fields located on Alaska’s North Slope: Prudhoe Bay and Kuparuk.We also have a 100 percent

interest in the Alpine Field, located on the Western North Slope.Additionally, we are one of Alaska’s largest

owners of state, federal and fee exploration leases,with approximately 1.32 million net undevelopedacres at

year-end 2019.Alaska operations contributed 25 percentof our worldwide liquids production and lessthan 1

percent of our natural gas production.




Greater Prudhoe Area

The Greater Prudhoe Area includes the PrudhoeBay Field and five satellite fields, as well as theGreater Point

McIntyre Area fields.Prudhoe Bay, the largest oil field on Alaska’s North Slope, is the site of a large

waterflood and enhanced oil recovery operation,as well as a gas plant which processesnatural gas to recover

NGLs before reinjection into the reservoir.Prudhoe Bay’s satellites are Aurora, Borealis, Polaris, Midnight

Sun and Orion, while the Point McIntyre,Niakuk, Raven, Lisburne and North Prudhoe BayState fields are

part of the Greater Point McIntyre Area.



Greater Kuparuk Area

We operate the Greater Kuparuk Area, which consists of the Kuparuk Field and foursatellite fields: Tarn,

Tabasco, Meltwater and West Sak.Kuparuk is located 40 miles west of PrudhoeBay.Field installations

include three central production facilitieswhich separate oil, natural gas and water, as well as a separate

seawater treatment plant.Development drilling at Kuparuk consists ofrotary-drilled wells and horizontal

multi-laterals from existing well bores utilizingcoiled-tubing drilling.
















Western North Slope

On the Western North Slope, we operate the Colville River Unit, which includes theAlpine Field and three

satellite fields: Nanuq, Fiord and Qannik.Alpine is located 34 miles west of Kuparuk.In 2015, first oil was

achieved at Alpine West CD5,a drill site which extends the Alpine reservoir westinto the National Petroleum

Reserve-Alaska (NPR-A).In 2019, we continued drilling additionalwells using the available well slots on this

pad.



The Greater Mooses Tooth Unit, the first unit established entirely within theNPR-A, was formed in 2008.In

2017, we began construction in the unit with twodrill sites; Greater Mooses Tooth #1 (GMT-1) and Greater

Mooses Tooth #2 (GMT-2).GMT-1 achieved first oil in the fourth quarter of 2018 and completed drilling in

2019.We expect first oil from GMT-2 in 2021.



Alaska North Slope Gas

In 2016, we, along with affiliates of Exxon Mobil Corporation,BP p.l.c. and Alaska Gasline Development

Corporation (AGDC), a state-owned corporation,completed preliminary FEED technicalwork for a potential

LNG project which would liquefy and export naturalgas from Alaska’s North Slope and deliver it to

market.In 2016, we, along with the affiliates of ExxonMobiland BP,indicated our intention not to progress

into the next phase of the project due to changes inthe economic environment.AGDC decided to continue on

its own.In 2019, affiliates of ExxonMobil and BP agreedto each contribute up to $5 million or approximately

one third of AGDC’s anticipated costs for full-year 2020.In 2020, AGDC will be focused on permitting

efforts, the most important of which is the National EnvironmentalProtection Act process before the FERC.

FERC’s final milestones are the Publication of Notice of Availability of Final Environmental Impact

Statement, which is scheduled for March 6, 2020,and the Issuance of Final Order, which is scheduled for June

4, 2020.AGDC has recently contracted with FluorCorporation to evaluate cost reduction opportunitiesin

preparation for soliciting partners for the project.We continue to be willing to sell our North Slope gas to the

project but do not plan to take an equity position.



Exploration

Appraisal of the Willow Discovery, located in the northeast portion of the NPR-A, continuedthroughout 2019

with five appraisal wells.In 2020, we will continue appraisal ofthe Willow Discovery and explore the

Harpoon Prospect, located southwest of Willow.



In 2019, we drilled the West Willow-2 well to appraise the 2018 West Willow oil discovery.



In late 2018, we commenced appraisal of the PutuDiscovery with a long reach well fromexisting Alpine CD4

infrastructure.The CD4 appraisal well finished drillingand flow tested in 2019.A supporting injector well

was drilled in late 2019 for a 2020 injectivity test.



The Cairn 2S-315 Well was drilled in late 2018 from the 2S drill site on state leasesin the Kuparuk River Unit.

A long-term flow test was commenced in 2019 andevaluations are ongoing.



A 3-Dseismic survey was completed in 2018 overa 250-mile area on state lands.We are currently evaluating

this seismic data for future exploration opportunities.



We were successful in the federal lease sale on the North Slope in the fourth quarterof 2019, where we were

the high bidder on three tracts for a total ofapproximately 33,000 net acres.





Acquisitions

In the third quarter of 2019, we completed theNuna discovery acreage acquisition, expandingthe Kuparuk

River Unit by 21,000 acres and leveraging legacyinfrastructure.
































































Transportation

We transport the petroleum liquids produced on the North Slope to south centralAlaska through an 800-mile

pipeline that is part of Trans-Alaska Pipeline System (TAPS).We have a 29.1percent ownership interest in

TAPS, and we also have ownership interests in the Alpine, Kuparuk and Oliktok pipelineson the North Slope.



Our wholly owned subsidiary, Polar Tankers, Inc., manages the marine transportation of our North Slope

production, using five company-owned, double-hulledtankers,and charters third-party vessels as necessary.

The tankers deliver oil from Valdez, Alaska, primarily to refineries on the west coast of the U.S.





LOWER 48



The Lower 48 segment consists of operations locatedin the contiguous U.S. and the Gulf of Mexico.

Organized into the Gulf Coast and Great Plains businessunits, we hold 10.4million net onshore and offshore

acres, with a portfolio of conventional production fromlegacy assets as well as newer production fromour low

cost of supply, shorter cycle time, resource-rich unconventional plays.Based on 2019 production volumes, the
