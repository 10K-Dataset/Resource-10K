Items 1 and 2. BUSINESS AND PROPERTIES

CORPORATE STRUCTURE

ConocoPhillips is the world’s largest independent exploration and production (E&P) company, based on proved reserves and production of liquids and
natural gas. ConocoPhillips was incorporated in the state of Delaware on November 16, 2001, in connection with, and in anticipation of, the merger between Conoco Inc. and Phillips Petroleum Company. The merger between Conoco and Phillips was
consummated on August 30, 2002.

In April 2012, the ConocoPhillips Board of Directors approved the separation of our downstream business into an
independent, publicly traded energy company, Phillips 66. Each ConocoPhillips stockholder received one share of Phillips 66 stock for every two shares of ConocoPhillips stock held at the close of business on the record date of April 16, 2012.
The separation was completed on April 30, 2012, and activities related to Phillips 66 have been treated as discontinued operations for all periods prior to the separation.

In 2012, we agreed to sell our interest in the North Caspian Sea Production Sharing Agreement (Kashagan) and our Nigeria and Algeria businesses (collectively,
the “Disposition Group”). We sold our Nigeria business in the third quarter of 2014, and we sold Kashagan and our Algeria business in the fourth quarter of 2013. Results for the Disposition Group have been reported as discontinued
operations in all periods presented. For additional information on all discontinued operations, see Note 3—Discontinued Operations, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Headquartered in Houston, Texas, we have operations and activities in 21 countries. Our key focus areas include safely operating producing assets, executing
major developments and exploring for new resources in promising areas. Our portfolio includes resource-rich North American tight oil and oil sands assets; lower-risk legacy assets in North America, Europe, Asia and Australia; several major
international developments; and an inventory of global conventional and unconventional exploration prospects.

At December 31, 2015, ConocoPhillips
employed approximately 15,900 people worldwide.

We are marketing certain non-core assets across all of our segments. For additional information on asset
sales, see the “Outlook” section of Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, and Note 6—Assets Held for Sale or Sold, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.







SEGMENT AND GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION

Effective November 1, 2015, the Other International and historically presented Europe segments were restructured to align with changes to our internal
organization structure. The Libya business was moved from the Other International segment to the historically presented Europe segment, which is now renamed Europe and North Africa. Accordingly, results of operations for the Other International and
Europe and North Africa segments have been revised in all periods presented. There was no impact on our consolidated financial statements, and the impact on our segment presentation is immaterial. For operating segment and geographic information,
see Note 24—Segment Disclosures and Related Information, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which is incorporated herein by reference.

We explore for, produce, transport and market crude oil, bitumen, natural gas, liquefied natural gas (LNG) and natural gas liquids on a worldwide basis. At
December 31, 2015, our continuing operations were producing in the United States, Norway, the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, Timor-Leste, Indonesia, China, Malaysia, and Qatar.

The information listed below appears in the “Oil and Gas Operations” disclosures following the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and is
incorporated herein by reference:



•Proved worldwide crude oil, natural gas liquids, natural gas and bitumen reserves.

•Net production of crude oil, natural gas liquids, natural gas and bitumen.

•Average sales prices of crude oil, natural gas liquids, natural gas and bitumen.

•Average production costs per barrel of oil equivalent (BOE).

•Net wells completed, wells in progress and productive wells.

•Developed and undeveloped acreage.

The following table is a summary of the proved reserves information
included in the “Oil and Gas Operations” disclosures following the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Approximately 84 percent of our proved reserves are located in politically stable countries that belong to the Organization for
Economic Cooperation and Development. Natural gas reserves are converted to BOE based on a 6:1 ratio: six thousand cubic feet (MCF) of natural gas converts to one BOE. See Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results
of Operations for a discussion of factors that will enhance the understanding of the following summary reserves table.

Total production from continuing operations was 1,589 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day (MBOED) in 2015,
compared with 1,540 MBOED, including Libya, in 2014, an increase of 3 percent. The increase in total average production in 2015 primarily resulted from additional production from major developments, including tight oil plays in the Lower 48; Gumusut
in Malaysia; APLNG in Australia; Greater Britannia projects and the J-Area in the U.K.; and the ramp-up of Foster Creek Phase F in Canada. Improved well performance, mostly in the Lower 48, western Canada and Norway, and lower turnaround activity
also contributed to higher production in 2015. These increases were largely offset by normal field decline. Production from continuing operations was 1,589 MBOED in 2015, compared with 1,532 MBOED in 2014, excluding Libya, an increase of 57 MBOED,
or 4 percent. Full-year production from assets sold or under agreement in 2015 was 64 MBOED.

Our total average realized price from continuing
operations was $34.34 per BOE in 2015, a decrease of 47 percent compared with $64.59 per BOE in 2014, which reflected lower average realized prices across all commodities. Our worldwide annual average crude oil price from continuing operations
decreased 48 percent in 2015, from $92.80 per barrel in 2014 to $48.26 per barrel in 2015. Additionally, our worldwide annual average natural gas liquids prices from continuing operations decreased 54 percent, from $38.99 per barrel in 2014 to
$17.79 per barrel in 2015. Our worldwide annual average natural gas price from continuing operations decreased 40 percent, from $6.57 per MCF in 2014 to $3.96 per MCF in 2015. Average annual bitumen prices also decreased 66 percent, from $55.13 per
barrel in 2014 to $18.72 per barrel in 2015.







ALASKA

The Alaska segment primarily explores for, produces, transports and markets crude oil, natural gas liquids, natural gas and LNG. We are the largest crude oil
and natural gas producer in Alaska and have major ownership interests in two of North America’s largest oil fields located on Alaska’s North Slope: Prudhoe Bay and Kuparuk. We also have a significant operating interest in the Alpine Field,
located on the Western North Slope. Additionally, we are one of Alaska’s largest owners of state and federal exploration leases, with approximately 0.7 million net undeveloped acres at year-end 2015. Approximately 0.4 million of these
acres are located in the National Petroleum Reserve—Alaska (NPRA) and the North Slope, and 0.3 million are located in the Chukchi Sea. In 2015, Alaska operations contributed 19 percent of our worldwide liquids production and 1 percent of
our natural gas production.

*Thousands of barrels per day.

**Millions of cubic feet per day.

Greater Prudhoe Area

The Greater Prudhoe Area
includes the Prudhoe Bay Field and five satellite fields, as well as the Greater Point McIntyre Area fields. Prudhoe Bay, the largest oil field on Alaska’s North Slope, is the site of a large waterflood and enhanced oil recovery operation, as
well as a gas plant which processes natural gas to recover natural gas liquids before reinjection into the reservoir. Prudhoe Bay’s satellites are Aurora, Borealis, Polaris, Midnight Sun and Orion, while the Point McIntyre, Niakuk, Raven and
Lisburne fields are part of the Greater Point McIntyre Area.

Greater Kuparuk Area

We operate the Greater Kuparuk Area, which consists of the Kuparuk Field and four satellite fields: Tarn, Tabasco, Meltwater and West Sak. Kuparuk is located
40 miles west of Prudhoe Bay. Field installations include three central production facilities which separate oil, natural gas and water, as well as a separate seawater treatment plant. Development drilling at Kuparuk consists of rotary-drilled wells
and horizontal multi-laterals from existing well bores utilizing coiled-tubing drilling.

Drill Site 2S, in the southwestern area of the Kuparuk Field,
was sanctioned in October 2014. First oil was achieved in October 2015 with net peak production estimated at 5 MBOED in 2016.

The 1H Northeast West Sak
(NEWS) oil development targeting the West Sak reservoir in the Kuparuk River Unit, was sanctioned in March 2015. First production is anticipated in 2017.

Western North Slope

On the Western North Slope,
we operate the Colville River Unit, which includes the Alpine Field and three satellite fields: Nanuq, Fiord and Qannik. Alpine is located 34 miles west of Kuparuk. In October 2015, first oil was achieved at Alpine West CD5, a new drill site which
extends the Alpine reservoir west into the NPRA. Net peak production is estimated at 10 MBOED in 2016.

The Greater Mooses Tooth Unit, the first unit
established entirely within the NPRA, was formed in 2008. In 2015, we received permit approvals and sanctioning from the regulatory agencies for the Greater Mooses Tooth #1 (GMT1) drill site. GMT1 is planned to be connected by road to the CD5 drill
site, and production







will be transported by pipeline to the existing Alpine facilities for processing. We are evaluating further exploration and development potential in the NPRA.

Cook Inlet Area

We operate the North Cook Inlet
Unit, the Beluga River Unit, and the Kenai LNG Facility in the Cook Inlet Area. We have a 100 percent interest in the North Cook Inlet Unit and the Kenai LNG Facility, while we own 33.3 percent of the Beluga River Unit. Our share of production from
the units is primarily sold to local utilities and is also used to supply feedstock to the Kenai LNG Plant.

The Kenai LNG Facility includes a
1.6 million-tons-per-year capacity plant, as well as docking and loading facilities for LNG tankers. LNG from the plant has historically been transported and sold to utility companies in Japan. The plant was idled in late-2012; however, due to
a change in market conditions, including additional gas supplies, we were granted a two-year export license from the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) in April 2014 to export up to 40 billion cubic feet of LNG from the facility. As a result, we
shipped six cargoes of LNG from the Kenai Facility to Asia in 2015. In February 2016, our export license was renewed for an additional two years.

In the
first quarter of 2016, we entered into an agreement to sell our interest in the Beluga River Unit natural gas field in the Cook Inlet Area. The transaction is expected to close in the second quarter of 2016.

Point Thomson

We own a 5 percent interest in the
Point Thomson Unit, which is located approximately 60 miles east of Prudhoe Bay. An initial production system is anticipated to be online by second quarter 2016, which is estimated to send 400 net barrels of oil equivalent per day (BOED) of
condensate through the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System (TAPS).

Alaska LNG (AKLNG)

During 2012, we, along with affiliates of Exxon Mobil Corporation, BP p.l.c. and TransCanada Corporation (collectively, the “AKLNG co-venturers”),
began evaluating a potential LNG project which would liquefy and export natural gas from Alaska’s North Slope and deliver it to market. The AKLNG Project concept is an integrated LNG project consisting of a liquefaction plant, including marine
terminal facilities and auxiliary marine vessels, located in south-central Alaska; a natural gas treatment plant, located on the North Slope; and an estimated 800-mile natural gas pipeline, which would connect the two plants.







Significant engineering, technical, regulatory, fiscal, commercial and permitting issues would need to be
resolved prior to a final investment decision on the potential $45 billion to $65 billion (gross) project.

Exploration

We plan to drill two to three exploration wells in 2016 in the NPRA.

Our plans to drill an exploration well in the Chukchi Sea have been cancelled due to the current market environment, regulatory uncertainty and expiry of the
primary lease term in 2020. As a result, we recorded a $406 million after-tax charge for leasehold and capitalized interest impairment and dry hole expense in the fourth quarter of 2015.

Transportation

We transport the petroleum liquids
produced on the North Slope to south central Alaska through an800-milepipeline that is part of TAPS. We have a 29.1 percent ownership interest in TAPS, and we also have ownership interests in the
Alpine, Kuparuk and Oliktok pipelines on the North Slope.

Our wholly owned subsidiary, Polar Tankers, Inc., manages the marine transportation of our
North Slope production, using five company-owned, double-hulled tankers, and charters third-party vessels as necessary. The tankers primarily deliver oil from Valdez, Alaska, to refineries on the west coast of the United States.

LOWER 48

The Lower 48 segment
consists of operations located in the U.S. Lower 48 states and exploration activities in the Gulf of Mexico. The Lower 48 business is organized within three regions covering the Gulf Coast,Mid-Continentand
Rockies. As a result of tight oil opportunities, we have directed our investments toward certain shorter cycle time, low cost-of-supply plays. In July 2015, we announced our plan to reduce future deepwater exploration spending and terminated our
Gulf of Mexico deepwater drillship contract with Ensco. We hold 14.3 million net onshore and offshore acres in the Lower 48. In 2015, the Lower 48 contributed 33 percent of our worldwide liquids production and 36 percent of our natural gas
production.

Onshore

We hold 12.4 million net acres of onshore conventional and unconventional acreage in the Lower 48, the majority of which is either held by production or
owned by the company. Our unconventional holdings total approximately 2.6 million net acres in the following areas:



•900,000 net acres in the San Juan Basin, located in northwestern New Mexico and southwestern Colorado.

•617,000 net acres in the Bakken, located in North Dakota and eastern Montana.

•216,000 net acres in the Eagle Ford, located in South Texas.

•109,000 net acres in the Niobrara, located in northeastern Colorado.

•102,000 net acres in the Permian, located in West Texas and southeastern New Mexico.

•61,000 net acres in the Barnett, located in north central Texas.

•553,000 net acres in other unconventional exploration plays.

The majority of our 2015 onshore production
originated from the Eagle Ford, San Juan, Permian and Bakken. Onshore activities in 2015 were centered mostly on continued development of emerging and existing assets, with an emphasis on areas with low cost of supply, particularly in growing
unconventional plays. The 2015 drilling activity levels declined relative to 2014 due to reduced capital spending in the low commodity price environment. Our major focus areas in 2015 included the following:



•Eagle Ford—The Eagle Ford continued full field development in 2015, with the majority of the development program being drilled on multi-well pads. We operated six rigs on average in 2015, resulting in 136 operated
wells drilled and 150 operated wells brought online. In 2015, we also increased production by 12 percent compared with 2014 and achieved net peak production of 190 MBOED, compared with 179 MBOED in 2014.

•Bakken—We operated five rigs on average throughout the year in the Bakken. We continued our pad drilling efficiency, drilling 89 operated wells during the year and bringing 128 operated wells online. As a result,
we achieved net peak production of 80 MBOED in 2015, compared with 63 MBOED in 2014.

•San Juan Basin—The San Juan Basin includes significant conventional gas production, which yields approximately 20 percent natural gas liquids, as well as the majority of our U.S. coalbed methane (CBM) production.
We hold approximately 1.3 million net acres of oil and gas leases by production in San Juan, where we continue to pursue select conventional development opportunities. This also includes approximately 900,000 net unconventional acres of lease
rights.

•Permian Basin—The Permian Basin is another area where we are leveraging our conventional legacy position by utilizing new technology to improve the ultimate recovery and value from these fields. This technology
should also identify new, unconventional plays across the region. We hold approximately 1.0 million net acres in the Permian, which includes 102,000 net unconventional acres.

In the fourth quarter of 2015, we completed the sale of certain non-core assets in East Texas and North Louisiana and South Texas. Production from the assets
sold was 33 MBOED, approximately 6 percent of the total Lower 48 segment production in 2015.

Gulf of Mexico

At year-end 2015, our portfolio of producing properties in the Gulf of Mexico primarily consisted of one operated field and three fields operated by
co-venturers, including:



•75 percent operated working interest in the Magnolia Field in Garden Banks Blocks 783 and 784.

•15.9 percent nonoperated working interest in the unitized Ursa Field located in the Mississippi Canyon Area.

•15.9 percent nonoperated working interest in the Princess Field, a northern subsalt extension of the Ursa Field.

•12.4 percent nonoperated working interest in the unitized K2 Field, comprised of seven blocks in the Green Canyon Area.







Exploration



•Conventional Exploration

In the third quarter of 2015, we decided not to conduct
further activity on certain Gulf of Mexico leases. At December 31, 2015, we held approximately 1.8 million net acres in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico.

During 2015, we conducted appraisal drilling at Shenandoah, Tiber, and Gila. The nonoperated Gibson exploration and Tiber appraisal wells, and
the ConocoPhillips operated Melmar exploration well are currently drilling.

We own a 30 percent nonoperated working interest in the
Shenandoah discovery, which was announced in 2009. The third Shenandoah down dip appraisal well was spud in 2015, and planning is underway for the next appraisal well, which is expected to spud in the first half of 2016.

The operated Harrier and nonoperated Vernaccia wells were expensed as dry holes in 2015. The operator of the Gila prospect has elected to
discontinue exploration and appraisal activity. Accordingly, we recorded $111 million in after-tax dry hole expense for a previously suspended well in the Gila prospect, and a $100 million charge for the impairment of undeveloped leasehold costs.



•Unconventional Exploration

Our onshore focus areas include the Niobrara in the
Denver-Julesburg Basin and the Wolfcamp and Bone Springs in the Delaware Basin, as well as several emerging plays. In 2015, we drilled 21 unconventional wells in the Delaware Basin. We continue to assess and appraise this and other
unconventional opportunities.

Facilities

Freeport LNG Terminal

In July 2013, we agreed with
Freeport LNG Development, L.P. to terminate our long-term agreement to use 0.9 billion cubic feet per day of regasification capacity at Freeport’s 1.5 billion cubic-feet-per-day LNG receiving terminal in Quintana, Texas. The termination
agreement conditions were satisfied in 2014. Our terminal regasification capacity has been reduced from 0.9 billion cubic feet per day to 0.4 billion cubic feet per day until July 1, 2016, at which time it will be reduced to zero. As a
result of this transaction, we anticipate saving approximately $50 to $60 million per year in costs over the next 17 years. For additional information, see Note 7—Investments, Loans and Long-Term Receivables, in the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements.

Golden Pass LNG Terminal

We have a 12.4 percent ownership interest in the Golden Pass LNG Terminal and affiliated Golden Pass Pipeline, with a combined net book value of approximately
$273 million at December 31, 2015. It is located adjacent to the Sabine-Neches Industrial Ship Channel northwest of Sabine Pass, Texas. The terminal became commercially operational in May 2011. We hold terminal and pipeline capacity for the
receipt, storage and regasification of the LNG purchased from Qatar Liquefied Gas Company Limited (3) (QG3) and the transportation of regasified LNG to interconnect with major interstate natural gas pipelines. Utilization of the terminal has
been and is expected to be limited, as market conditions currently favor the flow of LNG to European and Asian markets. As a result, we are evaluating opportunities to optimize the value of the terminal facilities.

Great Northern Iron Ore Properties Trust

We hold
the interest in the Great Northern Iron Ore Properties trust (the Trust), a grantor trust that owns mineral and surface interests in the Mesabi Iron Range in northeastern Minnesota and certain other personal property. Pursuant to the terms of
the Trust Agreement, the Trust terminated on April 6, 2015. At the end of the wind-down period, documents memorializing our ownership of certain Trust property, including all of the







Trust’s mineral properties and active leases, will be delivered to us. The Trustees currently
anticipate the wind-down process, final distribution and dissolution of the Trust will be completed by the end of 2016. At that time, we expect to recognize the fair value of the Trust’s net assets transferred to us.

Other



•San Juan Gas Plant—We operate and own a 50 percent interest in the San Juan Gas Plant, a 550 million cubic-feet-per-day capacity natural gas processing plant in Bloomfield, New Mexico.

•Lost Cabin Gas Plant—We operate and own a 46 percent interest in the Lost Cabin Gas Plant, a 313 million cubic-feet-per-day capacity natural gas processing facility in Lysite, Wyoming.

•Helena Condensate Processing Facility—We operate and own the Helena Condensate Processing Facility, a 90,000 barrel-per-day condensate processing plant located in Kenedy, Texas.

•Sugarloaf Condensate Processing Facility—We operate and own an 87.5 percent interest in the Sugarloaf Condensate Processing Facility, a 30,000 barrel-per-day condensate processing plant located near Pawnee, Texas.

•Bordovsky Condensate Processing Facility—We operate and own the Bordovsky Condensate Processing Facility, a 15,000 barrel-per-day condensate processing plant located in Kenedy, Texas.

CANADA

Our Canadian operations
mainly consist of natural gas fields in western Canada and oil sands developments in the Athabasca Region of northeastern Alberta. In 2015, operations in Canada contributed 21 percent of our worldwide liquids production and 18 percent of our natural
gas production.

Western Canada

Our operations in western Canada extend across Alberta and British Columbia. We operate or have ownership interests in approximately 50 natural gas processing
plants in the region, and, as of December 31, 2015, held leasehold rights in 3.2 million net acres in western Canada. Our investments in 2015 were focused mainly on opportunities in the following three core development areas:



•Deep Basin—We hold leasehold rights in 1.4 million net acres in the Deep Basin, located in northwest Alberta and northeast British Columbia. In 2015, Deep Basin achieved average net production of
48 MBOED, and we drilled 13 horizontal wells.

•Kaybob-Edson—We hold leasehold rights in 0.8 million net acres in the Kaybob-Edson Area, located south of the Deep Basin in west central Alberta. Net production for Kaybob-Edson averaged 45 MBOED in 2015,
and we drilled 15 horizontal wells.

•Clearwater—Located in west central Alberta, south of Kaybob-Edson, we hold 0.9 million net acres of leasehold rights. In 2015, average net production for Clearwater was 40 MBOED, and we drilled
11 horizontal wells.







Assets located outside these development areas are focused on production optimization. In the fourth quarter of
2015, we finalized sales of certain non-core assets in British Columbia, Saskatchewan and Alberta. Production from the assets sold was 27 MBOED, approximately 9 percent of the total Canada segment production in 2015. At December 31, 2015, the
company held 0.1 million net acres of leasehold rights in these areas.

Oil Sands

We hold approximately 0.9 million net acres of land in the Athabasca Region of northeastern Alberta. Our bitumen resources in Canada are produced via an
enhanced thermal oil recovery method called steam-assisted gravity drainage (SAGD), whereby steam is injected into the reservoir, effectively liquefying the heavy bitumen, which is recovered and pumped to the surface for further processing.



•Surmont—The Surmont oil sands leases are located approximately 35 miles south of Fort McMurray, Alberta. Surmont is a 50/50 joint venture with Total S.A. Surmont 2 construction began in 2010, and achieved first
production in the third quarter of 2015. Surmont’s gross production capacity is estimated to be 150 MBOED.

•FCCL— FCCL Partnership, a Canadian upstream general partnership, is a 50/50 heavy oil business venture with Cenovus Energy Inc. FCCL’s assets are operated by Cenovus and include the Foster Creek, Christina
Lake and Narrows Lake SAGD bitumen developments. FCCL continues to progress development plans for each of these assets, including near-term completion of phase expansions as detailed below:



¡Foster Creek

Foster Creek is located approximately 200 miles northeast of
Edmonton, Alberta. There are six producing phases at Foster Creek, Phases A through F, with construction continuing on Phase G. Net production at Foster Creek increased approximately 12 MBOED, mainly as a result of a continued ramp up toward full
capacity. In the fourth quarter of 2014, FCCL received regulatory approval for Phase J.



¡Christina Lake

Christina Lake is located approximately 75 miles south of Fort
McMurray, Alberta. There are five producing phases at Christina Lake, Phases A through E, with construction continuing on Phase F. In late 2015, an optimization project was completed at Christina Lake that increased gross production capacity to 160
MBOED, with incremental production expected to ramp up during 2016. In the fourth quarter of 2015, regulatory approval was received for Phase H development.



¡Narrows Lake

Narrows Lake Phase A, was sanctioned in late 2012 and is
expected to have 45 MBOED of production capacity; however, construction has been deferred.

Exploration

We hold exploration acreage in four areas of Canada: onshore western Canada, offshore eastern Canada, the Mackenzie Delta/Beaufort Sea Region and the Arctic
Islands. Our primary exploration focus is on unconventional plays in western Canada and conventional exploration offshore eastern Canada.



•Conventional Exploration

During 2014, we entered into a farm-in agreement to
acquire a 30 percent nonoperated interest in six exploration licenses covering approximately five million gross acres in the deepwater Shelburne Basin, offshore Nova Scotia. In the fourth quarter of 2015, we spudded the first of two exploration well
commitments in offshore Nova Scotia. The second exploration well is anticipated to begin drilling in the second quarter of 2016. In December 2014, we participated in a successful bid for one







exploration license covering 0.7 million gross acres located in the Flemish Pass Basin,
offshore Newfoundland. In January 2015, we were awarded the license, in which we hold a 30 percent nonoperated interest. Seismic surveys of the subsurface were completed in 2015.



•Unconventional Exploration

We hold approximately 0.7 million net acres in
the emerging Montney, Muskwa, Duvernay and Canol unconventional plays in Alberta, northeastern British Columbia and the Northwest Territories. During 2015, we completed a lease swap and continued to drill exploration and appraisal wells in the
Montney play, which extends from British Columbia into Alberta.

In the fourth quarter of 2015, we recorded dry hole expense of $185 million after-tax
associated with our Horn River, Northwest Territories, Thornbury and Saleski properties, and an impairment charge of $75 million after-tax for unproved properties in the Duvernay, Thornbury, Saleski and Crow Lake areas.

EUROPE AND NORTH AFRICA

The Europe
and North Africa segment consists of operations and exploration activities in Norway, the United Kingdom and Libya. In 2015, operations in Europe and North Africa contributed 14 percent of our worldwide liquids production and 12 percent of
natural gas production.

The Greater Ekofisk Area is located approximately 200 miles offshore Stavanger, Norway in the North Sea, and comprises
three producing fields: Ekofisk, Eldfisk and Embla. Crude oil is exported to Teesside, England, and the natural gas is exported to Emden, Germany. Ekofisk South achieved first production in 2013, while Eldfisk II achieved startup in January 2015.
Continued development drilling in the Greater Ekofisk Area will contribute additional production over the coming years, as additional wells come online.

The Alvheim development is located in the northern part of the North Sea and consists of a floating production, storage and offloading (FPSO) vessel and
subsea installations. Produced crude oil is exported via shuttle tankers, and natural gas is transported to the Scottish Area Gas Evacuation (SAGE) terminal at St. Fergus, Scotland, through the SAGE pipeline.

The Heidrun Field is located in the Norwegian Sea. Produced crude oil is stored in a floating storage unit and exported via shuttle tankers. Part of the
natural gas is currently injected into the reservoir for optimization of crude oil production, while the remainder is used as feedstock in a methanol plant in Norway, in which we own an 18 percent interest.

We also have varying ownership interests in five other producing fields in the Norway sector of the North Sea and in the Norwegian Sea, as well as the Aasta
Hansteen development. The operator is targeting first gas for Aasta Hansteen by late 2018.







Exploration

ConocoPhillips participated in four nonoperated exploration and appraisal wells in the Oseberg, Visund and Aasta Hansteen areas. Two wells in the Oseberg area
were discoveries and were put on production; the others were discoveries currently undergoing evaluation. ConocoPhillips was awarded two new exploration licenses in early 2015, PL044C and PL782S with interests of 41.9 and 40.0 percent, respectively.
Two more licenses were awarded in early 2016, PL845 and PL782SB, both with interests of 40.0 percent.

Transportation

We own a 35.1 percent interest in the Norpipe Oil Pipeline System, a 220-mile pipeline which carries crude oil from Ekofisk to a crude oil stabilization and
natural gas liquids processing facility in Teesside, England. In November 2015, we sold our 1.9 percent interest in Norwegian Continental Shelf Gas Transportation (Gassled), which owns most of the Norwegian gas transportation infrastructure.

Britannia is one of the largest natural gas and condensate fields in the North Sea. We assumed operatorship of Britannia in
August 2015, following the acquisition of third party equity in Britannia Operator Limited, which is now wholly owned by ConocoPhillips. Condensate is delivered through the Forties Pipeline to an oil stabilization and processing plant near the
Grangemouth Refinery in Scotland, while natural gas is transported through Britannia’s line to St. Fergus, Scotland. The Britannia satellite fields, Callanish and Brodgar, produce via subsea manifolds and pipelines linked to the Britannia
platform. Project startups for the Brodgar H3 susbsea tieback, and Enochdhu, a single well tie back to Callanish, were achieved in the first and second quarters of 2015, respectively. These projects increased Britannia’s production in 2015 by
13.8 MBOED net. We are continuing work to hook up the Alder module to the Britannia facilities and anticipate delivery of first gas in 2016. Alder is a high-pressure, high-temperature gas condensate reservoir located in the U.K. Continental Shelf,
17 miles west of the Britannia facilities.

The J-Area consists of the Judy/Joanne, Jade and Jasmine fields, located in the U.K. Central North Sea. The
Jasmine Field is a high-pressure, high-temperature gas condensate reservoir located approximately six miles west of the Judy Platform. The development includes a 24-slot wellhead platform with a bridge-linked accommodation and utilities platform, a
six-mile, 16-inch multi-phase pipeline bundle, and a riser and processing platform bridge-linked to the existing Judy Platform.

We have various ownership
interests in several producing gas fields in the Rotliegendes and Carboniferous areas of the Southern North Sea. Decommissioning activity in the Southern North Sea is ongoing, with final production from the Viking transportation system and
associated satellites achieved in early 2016. Our interests in the East Irish Sea include the Millom, Dalton and Calder fields, which are operated on our behalf by a third party.







We own a 24 percent interest in the Clair Field, located in the Atlantic Margin. Clair Ridge is the second phase
of development for the Clair Field and is comprised of a 36-slot drilling and production facility with a bridge-linked accommodation and utilities platform. The new facilities will tie into existing oil and gas export pipelines to the Shetland
Islands. Initial production for Clair Ridge is targeted for 2018.

Exploration

During 2015, we participated in a nonoperated exploration/appraisal well in the Greater Clair area which was a discovery. The discovery is undergoing
evaluations for future development. We also drilled one operated exploration well north of the Jasmine Field in the Central Graben which was a dry hole, and were awarded two new licenses in the East Irish Sea.

Transportation

We operate the Teesside oil and
Theddlethorpe gas terminals in which we have 29.3 percent and 50 percent ownership interests, respectively. We also have a 100 percent ownership interest in the Rivers Gas Terminal, operated by a third party.

Australia Pacific LNG

Australia Pacific LNG Pty Ltd (APLNG), our joint venture with Origin Energy Limited and China Petrochemical Corporation (Sinopec), is focused on producing CBM
from the Bowen and Surat basins in Queensland, Australia, and converting the CBM into LNG. Natural gas is sold to domestic customers, while LNG is exported. Origin operates APLNG’s upstream production and pipeline system, and we operate the
downstream LNG facility, located on Curtis Island near Gladstone, Queensland, as well as the LNG export sales business.

Two fully subscribed
4.5 million tonnes-per-year LNG trains have been sanctioned. Approximately 3,900 net wells are ultimately envisioned to supply both the domestic gas market and the LNG sales contracts. The wells will be supported by gathering systems, central
gas processing and compression stations, water treatment facilities, and a new export pipeline connecting the gas fields to the LNG facilities. APLNG Train 1 achieved first LNG in the fourth quarter of 2015 and the first cargo sailed in January
2016. Train 1 LNG is being sold to Sinopec under a 20-year sales agreement for up to 4.3 million metric tonnes of LNG per year. Start-up of the second LNG train is expected to occur in the second half of 2016. The resulting LNG exports from
Train 2 will commence shortly thereafter. Sinopec has agreed to purchase an additional 3.3 million metric tonnes of LNG per year through 2035, and Japan-based Kansai Electric Power Co., Inc. has agreed to purchase approximately 1 million
metric tonnes of LNG per year for 20 years.

APLNG has an $8.5 billion project finance facility, of which $8.4 billion had been drawn from the facility at
December 31, 2015. In connection with the execution of the project financing, we provided a completion guarantee for our pro-rata share of the project finance facility until the project achieves financial completion. For additional information,
see Note 4—Variable Interest Entities (VIEs), Note 7—Investments, Loans and Long-Term Receivables, and Note 12—Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Bayu-Undan

The Bayu-Undan gas condensate field is
located in the Timor Sea Joint Petroleum Development Area between Timor-Leste and Australia. We also operate and own a 56.9 percent interest in the associated Darwin LNG Facility, located at Wickham Point, Darwin.

The Bayu-Undan natural gas recycle facility processes wet gas; separates, stores and offloads condensate, propane and butane; and re-injects dry gas back into
the reservoir. In addition, a 310-mile natural gas pipeline connects the facility to the 3.5 million tonnes-per-year capacity Darwin LNG Facility. Produced natural gas is







piped to the Darwin LNG Plant, where it is converted into LNG before being transported to international markets. In 2015, we sold 174 billion gross cubic feet of LNG primarily to utility
customers in Japan.

The Bayu-Undan Phase Three Development consists of two standalone, subsea horizontal wells tied back to the existing drilling,
production and processing platform. The first subsea, horizontal well commenced production in the first quarter of 2015. The well was tied back to the existing drilling, production, and processing platform. A second subsea, horizontal well was
drilled, completed, then suspended due to insufficient deliverability to the platform. There are no plans to remediate nor re-drill the well in the near

future. A continuation of Phase Three development is being evaluated, and is currently in the preliminary front-end engineering and design phase.

ConocoPhillips served a Notice of Arbitration on the Timor-Leste Minister of Finance in October 2012 for outstanding disputes related to a series of tax
assessments. The arbitration hearing was conducted in June 2014. In January 2016, the Government of Timor-Leste and ConocoPhillips reached a settlement of several significant tax disputes. However, we await the Tribunal’s decision with respect
to certain unresolved matters. For additional information, see Note 13—Contingencies and Commitments, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Athena/Perseus

The Athena production license
(WA-17-L) is located offshore Western Australia and contains part of the Perseus Field which straddles the boundary with WA-1-L, an adjoining license area. Natural gas is produced from these licenses.

Greater Sunrise

We have a 30 percent interest in
the Greater Sunrise gas and condensate field located in the Timor Sea. In May 2013, the Timor-Leste Government referred a dispute with the Australian Government relating to the treaty on Certain Maritime Arrangements in the Timor Sea (CMATS) to
international arbitration. The CMATS arbitration does not directly impact our underlying interests in Sunrise; however, we and the Sunrise co-venturers are unable to commit to further commercial and technical work activities due to the uncertainty
created by the lack of government alignment. Accordingly, current activities are restricted to compliance and social investment, as well as maintaining relationships and development options for Sunrise.

focus on process and occupational safety. In support of the goal of zero incidents, HSE milestones and criteria are established annually to drive strong safety performance. Progress toward these milestones and criteria are measured and reported. HSE
audits are conducted on business functions periodically, and improvement actions are established and tracked to completion. We also have detailed processes in place to address sustainable development in our economic, environmental and social
performance. Our processes, related tools and requirements focus on water, biodiversity and climate change, as well as social and stakeholder issues.

The
environmental information contained in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations on pages 62 through 66 under the captions “Environmental” and “Climate Change” is incorporated
herein by reference. It includes information on expensed and capitalized environmental costs for 2015 and those expected for 2016 and 2017.
