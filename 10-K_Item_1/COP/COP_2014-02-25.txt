Items 1 and 2. BUSINESS AND PROPERTIES

CORPORATE STRUCTURE

ConocoPhillips is the world’s largest
independent exploration and production (E&P) company, based on proved reserves and production of liquids and natural gas. ConocoPhillips was incorporated in the state of Delaware on November 16, 2001, in connection with, and in anticipation
of, the merger between Conoco Inc. and Phillips Petroleum Company. The merger between Conoco and Phillips was consummated on August 30, 2002.

On April 30, 2012, we completed the separation of our downstream businesses into an independent, publicly traded company, Phillips 66. Our refining, marketing and transportation businesses, most of
our Midstream segment, our Chemicals segment, as well as our power generation and certain technology operations included in our Emerging Businesses segment (collectively, our “Downstream business”), were transferred to Phillips 66. As a
part of our asset disposition program, in the fourth quarter of 2013, we completed the sale of our interest in the North Caspian Sea Production Sharing Agreement (Kashagan) and the sale of our Algeria business, and we have agreements to sell our
Nigeria business. Results of operations related to Phillips 66, Kashagan, Algeria and Nigeria have been classified as discontinued operations in all periods presented in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. For additional information, see Note
3—Discontinued Operations, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Headquartered in Houston, Texas, we have operations and
activities in 27 countries. Our key focus areas include safely operating producing assets, executing major developments and exploring for new resources in promising areas. Our portfolio includes resource-rich North American shale and oil sands
assets; lower-risk legacy assets in North America, Europe, Asia and Australia; several major international developments; and a growing inventory of global conventional and unconventional exploration prospects.

At December 31, 2013, ConocoPhillips employed approximately 18,400 people worldwide.







SEGMENT AND GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION

For operating segment and geographic information, see Note 25—Segment Disclosures and Related Information, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements, which is incorporated herein by reference.

We explore for, produce, transport and market crude oil, bitumen, natural gas,
liquefied natural gas (LNG) and natural gas liquids on a worldwide basis. At December 31, 2013, our continuing operations were producing in the United States, Norway, the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, Timor-Leste, Indonesia, China,
Malaysia, Qatar, Libya and Russia.

We manage our operations through six operating segments, which are defined by geographic region: Alaska,
Lower 48 and Latin America, Canada, Europe, Asia Pacific and Middle East, and Other International.

The information listed below appears in
the “Oil and Gas Operations” disclosures following the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and is incorporated herein by reference:



•Proved worldwide crude oil, natural gas liquids, natural gas and bitumen reserves.

•Net production of crude oil, natural gas liquids, natural gas and bitumen.

•Average sales prices of crude oil, natural gas liquids, natural gas and bitumen.

•Average production costs per barrel of oil equivalent (BOE).

•Net wells completed, wells in progress and productive wells.

•Developed and undeveloped acreage.

The following table is a summary of the proved reserves information included in the “Oil and Gas Operations” disclosures following the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Approximately
83 percent of our proved reserves are located in politically stable countries that belong to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. Natural gas reserves are converted to BOE based on a 6:1 ratio: six thousand cubic feet of
natural gas converts to one BOE. See Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for a discussion of factors that will enhance the understanding of the following summary reserves table.

Total production from continuing operations, including our share of equity affiliates, for 2013 averaged
1,502 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day (MBOED), a 2 percent decrease compared with 1,527 MBOED in 2012. The decrease was mainly due to normal field decline, asset dispositions, shut-in Libya production, due to the closure of the
Es Sider crude oil export terminal, and higher unplanned downtime. These decreases were partially offset by new production from major developments, mainly from shale plays in the Lower 48, the ramp-up of production from new phases at Christina Lake
in Canada, and early production in Malaysia; higher production in China; and increased conventional drilling and well performance, mostly in the Lower 48, western Canada and Norway. Adjusted for dispositions, downtime and the impact from the closure
of the Es Sider Terminal in Libya, production grew by 30 MBOED, or 2 percent, compared with 2012.

Our total realized price from continuing
operations remained relatively flat in 2013, from $67.68 per BOE in 2012, compared with $67.62 per BOE in 2013. Our worldwide annual average crude oil sales price from continuing operations decreased 2 percent in 2013, from $105.72 per barrel in
2012 to $103.32 per barrel in 2013. Additionally, our worldwide average annual natural gas liquids prices from continuing operations decreased 11 percent, from $46.36 per barrel in 2012 to $41.42 per barrel in 2013. Our average annual worldwide
natural gas sales price from continuing operations increased 11 percent, from $5.48 per thousand cubic feet in 2012 to $6.11 per thousand cubic feet in 2013. Average annual bitumen prices decreased 1 percent, from $53.91 per barrel in 2012 to
$53.27 per barrel in 2013.







ALASKA

The Alaska segment primarily explores for, produces, transports and markets crude oil, natural gas liquids, natural gas and LNG. We are the largest crude oil and natural gas producer in Alaska and have
major ownership interests in two of North America’s largest oil fields located on Alaska’s North Slope: Prudhoe Bay and Kuparuk. We also have a significant operating interest in the Alpine Field, located on the Western North Slope.
Additionally, we are one of Alaska’s largest owners of state and federal exploration leases, with approximately 0.9 million net undeveloped acres at year-end 2013. Approximately 0.5 million of these acres are located in the National
Petroleum Reserve—Alaska (NPRA) and 0.3 million are located in the Chukchi Sea. In 2013, Alaska operations contributed 23 percent of our worldwide liquids production and 1 percent of our natural gas production.

* Thousands of barrels per day.

** Millions of cubic feet per day.

Greater Prudhoe Area

The Greater Prudhoe Area includes the Prudhoe Bay Field and five satellite fields, as well as the Greater Point McIntyre Area fields. Prudhoe Bay, the
largest oil field on Alaska’s North Slope, is the site of a large waterflood and enhanced oil recovery operation, as well as a gas processing plant which processes natural gas for reinjection into the reservoir. Prudhoe Bay’s satellites
are Aurora, Borealis, Polaris, Midnight Sun and Orion, while the Point McIntyre, Niakuk, Raven and Lisburne fields are part of the Greater Point McIntyre Area.

Greater Kuparuk Area

We operate the Greater Kuparuk Area, which consists of the
Kuparuk Field and four satellite fields: Tarn, Tabasco, Meltwater and West Sak. Kuparuk is located 40 miles west of Prudhoe Bay. Field installations include three central production facilities which separate oil, natural gas and water, as well as a
separate seawater treatment plant. New rotary-drilled wells and sidetracks from existing well bores utilizing coiled-tubing drilling are the primary means for development drilling at Kuparuk.

The successful Shark Tooth delineation well extended the known Kuparuk accumulation to the southwestern area of the Kuparuk Field. As a result, plans for the future development of Drill Site 2S are
progressing, with project sanction targeted for late 2014 and first production estimated in late 2015.

Western North Slope

On the Western North Slope, we operate the Colville River Unit, which includes the Alpine Field and three satellite fields: Nanuq,
Fiord and Qannik. Alpine is located 34 miles west of Kuparuk. Construction is progressing on Alpine West CD5, a drill site to access the western extension of the Alpine reservoir, in the NPRA. Initial production is anticipated in late 2015, with net
peak production estimated at 10 MBOED in 2016.

The Greater Mooses Tooth Unit, the first unit established entirely within the NPRA, was formed
in 2008. We are progressing development planning for the Greater Mooses Tooth #1 (GMT1) drill site in the Greater Mooses Tooth Unit. We filed permitting applications for GMT1 in July 2013, and project sanction is targeted for late 2014. GMT1 is
planned to be connected by road to the CD5 drill site, and production will be







transported by pipeline to the existing Alpine facilities for processing. Construction is estimated to begin in 2016, with first production anticipated in late 2017. We are evaluating further
exploration and development potential in the NPRA.

Cook Inlet Area

We operate the North Cook Inlet Unit, the Beluga River Unit, and the Kenai LNG Facility in the Cook Inlet Area. We have a 100 percent interest in the North Cook Inlet Unit and the Kenai LNG Facility,
while we own 33.3 percent of the Beluga River Unit. Both units produce natural gas, and our share of production is currently sold to local utilities.

The Kenai LNG Facility includes a 1.3 million-tons-per-year capacity plant, which historically manufactured LNG for sale to utility companies in Japan, as well as docking and loading facilities,
which enable the LNG to be transported by tanker. Although our LNG export license expired in March 2013, the plant is operational and in stand-by mode, maintaining the flexibility to resume limited operations. Due to a change in market conditions,
including additional gas supplies, we submitted applications in December 2013 to the U.S. Department of Energy to resume LNG exports from the Kenai LNG Facility.

Point Thomson

We own a 5 percent interest in the Point Thomson Unit, which is
located approximately 60 miles east of Prudhoe Bay. An initial production system is anticipated to be online by 2016, which is estimated to send 400 net BOED of condensate through the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System (TAPS).

More Alaska Production Act (MAPA)

Following the April 2013 enactment of revised oil tax legislation, MAPA, we have increased our exploration and development investments and activities on
the North Slope by adding rigs and progressing new development opportunities. We will continue to work with co-owners to identify additional opportunities to increase our investments in Alaska.

Alaska LNG (AKLNG)

During 2012,
we, along with affiliates of Exxon Mobil Corporation, BP p.l.c. and TransCanada Corporation (collectively, the “AKLNG co-venturers”), began evaluating a potential LNG project which would export and liquefy natural gas from Alaska’s
North Slope and deliver it to market. The AKLNG Project concept is an integrated LNG project consisting of a liquefaction plant, including marine terminal facilities and auxiliary marine vessels, located in south-central Alaska; a natural gas
treatment plant, located on the North Slope; and an estimated 800-mile natural gas pipeline, which would connect the two plants.

In October
2013, the AKLNG co-venturers selected the Nikiski area on the Kenai Peninsula as the lead site for the proposed AKLNG natural gas liquefaction plant and terminal. On January 14, 2014, the AKLNG co-venturers, the Commissioners of the Alaska
Departments of Revenue and Natural Resources, and the Alaska Gasline Development Corporation, a state-owned corporation, signed a Heads of Agreement (HOA) for the AKLNG Project. The HOA provides a roadmap of how the parties intend to progress the
project, including proposed terms for participation by the State of Alaska as an equity owner, proposed fiscal and regulatory terms, and proposed terms for expansion of project components. One of the initial steps in the HOA is enactment of general
legislation by the State of Alaska, as well as further commercial agreements, which would be subject to approval by the Alaska legislature. Significant engineering, technical, regulatory, fiscal, commercial and permitting issues would need to be
resolved prior to a final investment decision on the potential 17 million-tons-per-year, $45 billion to $65 billion (gross) project. Following the enabling legislation, we anticipate commencing preliminary front-end engineering and development,
currently estimated in the second quarter of 2014.







Exploration

In April 2013, we suspended our plans to drill an exploration well in the Chukchi Sea in 2014, in light of the uncertainties of evolving federal regulatory requirements and operational permitting
standards. Once these requirements are clarified and better defined, we will re-evaluate plans for drilling in the Chukchi Sea.

In 2013, we
drilled and flow-tested a new discovery at the Cassin prospect, located in the Bear Tooth Unit in the northeast NPRA, and we also tested the Moraine play on the western flank of the Kuparuk Field. The results for both wells are currently under
evaluation. Additionally, we plan to drill two exploration wells within the Greater Mooses Tooth Unit in 2014: the Rendezvous 3, which is currently drilling, and Flattop-1, which is expected to be spud later in the first quarter of 2014.

Transportation

We transport the
petroleum liquids produced on the North Slope to south-central Alaska through an800-milepipeline that is part of TAPS. We have a 29.1 percent ownership interest in TAPS, and we also have ownership
interests in the Alpine, Kuparuk and Oliktok pipelines on the North Slope.

Our wholly owned subsidiary, Polar Tankers, Inc., manages the
marine transportation of our North Slope production, using five company-owned, double-hulled tankers and chartering third-party vessels, as necessary. The tankers deliver oil from Valdez, Alaska, to refineries on the west coast of the United States.







LOWER 48 AND LATIN AMERICA

The Lower 48 and Latin America segment primarily consists of operations located in the U.S. Lower 48 states, as well as exploration activities in the
Gulf of Mexico and Colombia. As a result of increasing shale opportunities and a low natural gas price environment, we have directed our investments toward high-margin, liquids-rich plays, predominantly in the Lower 48.

Lower 48

We hold 15.3 million net
onshore and offshore acres in the Lower 48. In 2013, the Lower 48 contributed 29 percent of our worldwide liquids production and 38 percent of our natural gas production.

Onshore

We hold 13.1 million net acres of onshore conventional and unconventional acreage in the Lower 48, the majority of which is either held by production or owned by the Company. Our unconventional
holdings total approximately 2.7 million net acres in the following areas:



•620,000 net acres in the Bakken, located in North Dakota and Eastern Montana;

•221,000 net acres in the Eagle Ford, located in South Texas;

•240,000 net acres in the Permian, located in West Texas and southeastern New Mexico;

•130,000 net acres in the Niobrara, located in northeastern Colorado;

•900,000 net acres in the San Juan Basin, located in northwestern New Mexico and southwestern Colorado;

•65,000 net acres in the Barnett, located in north central Texas; and

•541,000 net acres in other unconventional exploration plays.







The majority of our 2013 onshore production originated from San Juan, Eagle Ford, Permian, Bakken, Anadarko,
Lobo and Barnett. Onshore activities in 2013 were centered mostly on continued development and optimization of emerging and existing assets, with an emphasis on areas with higher-margin, liquids-rich production, particularly in growing
unconventional plays. Our major focus areas in 2013 included the following:



•Eagle Ford—Exploration and development continued in 2013 in the Eagle Ford. In 2013, we increased production by 70 percent, compared to 2012;
drilled 164 exploration and development wells; connected 225 wells; and achieved net peak production of 141 MBOED, compared with 103 MBOED in 2012. We also had 11 operated rigs drilling throughout 2013.

•Bakken—The Bakken experienced a significant increase in activity in 2013. We drilled 126 operated wells during the year, of which 85 were brought
online. We also increased our operated rig count to 11 and improved our efficiency with pad drilling. As a result, we achieved net peak production of more than 40 MBOED in 2013, compared with approximately 25 MBOED in 2012.

•San Juan Basin—The San Juan Basin includes significant conventional gas production, which yields approximately 35 percent natural gas liquids, as
well as the majority of our U.S. coalbed methane (CBM) production. We hold approximately 1.3 million net acres of oil and gas leases by production in San Juan, where we continue to pursue conventional development opportunities. This also
includes approximately 900,000 net unconventional acres of lease rights, where we are advancing the assessment of the Mancos shale play.

•Permian Basin—the Permian Basin is another area where we are leveraging our conventional legacy position by utilizing new technology to improve
the ultimate recovery and value from these fields. This technology will also identify new, unconventional plays across the region. We hold approximately 1.0 million net acres in the Permian, which includes 240,000 net unconventional acres.

Gulf of Mexico

At year-end 2013, our portfolio of producing properties in the Gulf of Mexico primarily consisted of one operated field and three fields operated by co-venturers, including:



•75 percent operated working interest in the Magnolia Field in Garden Banks Blocks 783 and 784.

•15.9 percent nonoperated working interest in the unitized Ursa Field located in the Mississippi Canyon Area.

•15.9 percent nonoperated working interest in the Princess Field, a northern, subsalt extension of the Ursa Field.

•12.4 percent nonoperated working interest in the unitized K2 Field, comprised of seven blocks in the Green Canyon Area.

Exploration



•Conventional Exploration

In the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, we added approximately 430,000 net acres to our position in 2013, bringing our total acreage position to 2.1 million acres at December 31, 2013. Since 2011, we
have nearly doubled our acreage footprint in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico and currently rank in the top five deepwater leaseholders. In 2013, we announced two new oil discoveries in the deepwater Lower Tertiary play at Coronado and Gila, adding to
the existing Shenandoah and Tiber discoveries made in 2009.

We own a 30 percent working interest in the Shenandoah discovery.
The results of the Shenandoah appraisal well were announced in 2013 and confirmed Shenandoah as a significant oil discovery. The well encountered more than 1,000 feet of net pay in high-quality, Lower Tertiary-aged reservoirs. We plan to participate
in further appraisal of Shenandoah in 2014. The Coronado exploration well encountered more than 400 feet of net pay and will require further appraisal. We hold a 35 percent working interest in Coronado. In 2013, we acquired a 20 percent interest in
the Gila Prospect, located







in the Keathley Canyon section of the Gulf of Mexico. The Gila exploration well was announced as a discovery in 2013 and is expected to be appraised in 2014.

Ongoing drilling activities at the end of 2013 included a Tiber appraisal well, in which we own an 18 percent working interest, a
Coronado appraisal well and the Deep Nansen exploration well. We hold a 12.5 percent interest in the Deep Nansen well. We plan to evaluate the results of these wells in the first half of 2014.

The nonoperated Ardennes wildcat well and the ConocoPhillips-operated Thorn wildcat well were declared dry holes in 2013.

In support of our intentions to grow our Gulf of Mexico exploration program, we secured access to two new-build deepwater drillships,
which we anticipate will be delivered to the Gulf of Mexico in 2014 and 2015. The drillships will provide rig availability for our operated drilling program.



•Unconventional Exploration

In 2013, we actively pursued the exploration and appraisal of our existing unconventional resource plays, including the Eagle Ford in the Western Gulf Basin, the Bakken in the Williston Basin, the Barnett
in the Fort Worth Basin, the Niobrara play in the Denver-Julesburg Basin, Wolfcamp and Bone Springs in the Delaware Basin, Wolfcamp in the Midland Basin, and the Mancos in the San Juan Basin. During 2013, we acquired approximately 61,000 net
additional acres in various resource plays across the Lower 48, which included the Eagle Ford, Niobrara and Permian plays, further expanding our significant acreage position in Lower 48 shale plays to approximately 2.7 million net acres.

During 2013, we drilled a total of 25 unconventional wells in the Niobrara, Bone Springs and Wolfcamp plays. In 2014, we will
continue to actively explore and appraise unconventional plays in the Lower 48, with a focus on Bone Springs, Wolfcamp and Niobrara. We will also continue to assess new opportunities in unconventional plays.

Facilities

Freeport LNG Terminal

We have a long-term agreement with Freeport LNG Development, L.P. to use 0.9 billion cubic feet per day of regasification capacity at
Freeport’s 1.5-billion-cubic-feet-per-day LNG receiving terminal in Quintana, Texas. In July 2013, we agreed with Freeport LNG to terminate this agreement, subject to Freeport LNG obtaining regulatory approval and project financing for an LNG
liquefaction and export facility in Texas, in which we are not a participant. Upon satisfaction of these conditions, currently expected to occur in the second half of 2014, we will pay Freeport LNG a termination fee of approximately $600
million. Freeport LNG will repay the outstanding ConocoPhillips loan used by Freeport LNG to partially fund the original construction of the terminal. These transactions, plus miscellaneous items, will result in a one-time net cash outflow of
approximately $80 million for us. When the agreement becomes effective, we also expect to recognize an after-tax charge to earnings of approximately $540 million. At that time, our terminal regasification capacity will be reduced from 0.9
billion cubic feet per day to 0.4 billion cubic feet per day, until July 1, 2016, at which time it will be reduced to zero. As a result of this transaction, we anticipate saving approximately $50 to $60 million per year in operating
costs over the next 19 years. For additional information, see Note 4—Variable Interest Entities (VIEs), in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Golden Pass LNG Terminal

We have a 12.4 percent ownership interest in the Golden
Pass LNG Terminal and affiliated Golden Pass Pipeline. It is located adjacent to the Sabine-Neches Industrial Ship Channel northwest of Sabine Pass, Texas. The terminal became commercially operational in May 2011. We hold terminal and pipeline
capacity for the receipt, storage and regasification of the LNG purchased from Qatargas 3 and the transportation of regasified LNG to interconnect with major interstate natural gas pipelines. Market conditions currently favor the flow of LNG to
European and Asian markets; therefore, our near-to-mid-term utilization of the terminal is expected to be limited.

Colombia

Unconventional Exploration

During 2013, we entered into a farm-in agreement with
Canacol Energy Ltd. to acquire a 70 percent working interest for deep rights in the Santa Isabel Block in the Middle Magdalena Basin, which covers approximately 71,000 net acres. The first exploration well did not reach our planned La Luna Shale
target and was expensed. Additional seismic acquisition and processing will continue in 2014. Additionally, we executed farm-in agreements to acquire 30 percent working interests in three blocks in the Middle Magdalena Basin, which cover
approximately 116,000 net acres.

Venezuela

In September 2013, the World Bank’s International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID) arbitration tribunal ruled Venezuela unlawfully expropriated ConocoPhillips’ significant
oil investments in the Petrozuata and Hamaca heavy crude oil projects and the offshore Corocoro development project in June 2007. A separate arbitration phase will proceed to determine the amount of damages owed to ConocoPhillips for
Venezuela’s actions. For additional information, see Note 14—Contingencies and Commitments, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Ecuador

In December 2012, an ICSID tribunal issued a decision on liability in favor
of Burlington Resources, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of ConocoPhillips, finding that Ecuador’s seizure of Blocks 7 and 21 was an unlawful expropriation in violation of the Ecuador-U.S. Bilateral Investment Treaty. An additional arbitration
phase is now proceeding to determine the damages owed to ConocoPhillips for Ecuador’s actions and to address Ecuador’s counterclaims. For additional information, see Note 14—Contingencies and Commitments, in the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements.







CANADA

Our Canadian operations mainly consist of natural gas fields in western Canada and oil sands developments in the Athabasca Region of northeastern Alberta. In 2013, operations in Canada contributed 17
percent of our worldwide liquids production and 20 percent of our natural gas production.

Western Canada

Our operations in western Canada primarily consist of three core development areas: Deep Basin, Kaybob and Clearwater, which extend from central Alberta to northeastern British Columbia. We operate or
have ownership interests in approximately 80 natural gas processing plants in the region, and, as of December 31, 2013, held leasehold rights in 5.7 million net acres in western Canada.

Oil Sands

We hold approximately
0.9 million net acres of land in the Athabasca Region of northeastern Alberta. Our bitumen resources in Canada are produced via an enhanced thermal oil recovery method called steam-assisted gravity drainage (SAGD), whereby steam is injected
into the reservoir, effectively liquefying the heavy bitumen, which is recovered and pumped to the surface for further processing.



•Surmont

The Surmont oil sands leases are located approximately 35 miles south of Fort McMurray, Alberta. Surmont is a 50/50 joint venture with Total S.A. Surmont Phase 2 construction began in 2010, with
production startup targeted for 2015. Following startup, Surmont’s gross production capacity is estimated to be 150 MBOED, with peak production anticipated by 2018.



•FCCL

We have a 50/50 heavy oil business venture with Cenovus Energy Inc., FCCL Partnership, a Canadian upstream general partnership. FCCL’s assets, operated by Cenovus, include the Foster Creek, Christina
Lake and Narrows Lake SAGD bitumen developments. FCCL continues to progress expansion plans which would potentially increase total gross production capacity to approximately 750 MBOED.



oFoster Creek is located approximately 200 miles northeast of Edmonton, Alberta. There are five producing phases at Foster Creek, Phases A through E, with three more
under construction: Phases F, G and H. First production for Phase F is expected in the third quarter of 2014, and first production for Phases G and H are anticipated in 2015 and 2016, respectively. These phases, in addition to planned optimization,
will add approximately 125 MBOED of gross production capacity. An application for regulatory approval for an additional expansion, Phase J, was filed in 2013.



oChristina Lake is located approximately 75 miles south of Fort McMurray, Alberta. There are five producing phases at Christina Lake, Phases A through
E, with plans underway for three additional phases: Phases F, G and H. Gross production at Christina Lake increased more







than 55 percent in 2013, mostly as a result of Phase D reaching full capacity in the first quarter of 2013 and Phase E commencing production in the third quarter of 2013. Phase E added 40 MBOED
of gross production capacity. During 2013, construction continued on Phase F, which is expected to commence production in 2016 and add another 50 MBOED of gross production capacity. Engineering work continued for Phase G, with first production
anticipated for 2017. An application for Phase H was submitted for regulatory review in 2013. With the additional expansion phases and optimization work, total gross production capacity from Christina Lake has the potential to reach approximately
310 MBOED.



oNarrows Lake is located near Christina Lake and is expected to have three phases of development. During 2013, plant construction began on Phase A, which is estimated to
have 45 MBOED of gross production capacity. Initial production is anticipated in 2017.

Amauligak

We have a 55 percent operating interest in the Amauligak discovery, which lies approximately 30 miles offshore in shallow water in the Beaufort Sea. A
range of development options are being evaluated.

Exploration

We hold exploration acreage in four areas of Canada: offshore eastern Canada, onshore western Canada, the Mackenzie Delta/Beaufort Sea Region and the Arctic Islands. Our primary exploration focus is
on liquids-rich unconventional plays in Alberta, British Columbia and the Northwest Territories.



•Unconventional Exploration

We hold approximately 0.7 million net acres in the emerging Montney, Muskwa, Duvernay and Canol unconventional plays in Alberta, northeastern British Columbia and the Northwest Territories. During
2013, we drilled unconventional test wells in the Duvernay, located in Alberta; the Canol shale, located in the Northwest Territories; and the Montney play, which extends from British Columbia into Alberta. In 2014, exploration activities will
continue in Duvernay, Canol and Montney. We also plan to continue delineating potential development opportunities in the oil sands.

The Greater Ekofisk Area is located approximately 200 miles offshore Stavanger, Norway in the North Sea, and
comprises four producing fields: Ekofisk, Eldfisk, Embla and Tor. Crude oil is exported to Teesside, England, and the natural gas is exported to Emden, Germany. In October 2013, we achieved first oil production from Ekofisk South, a development
which includes the planned drilling of 35 new production and eight water injection wells. At year-end 2013, four production wells and the eight water injection wells had been drilled. A second development, Eldfisk II, is scheduled to start up by
early 2015. Ekofisk South, along with Eldfisk II and other developments offshore Norway, are expected to add approximately 60 MBOED of net production within the next five years.

The Alvheim development is located in the northern part of the North Sea and consists of a floating production, storage and offloading (FPSO) vessel and subsea installations. Produced crude oil is
exported via shuttle tankers, and natural gas is transported to the United Kingdom via a pipeline to the Beryl-Sage system.

The Heidrun Field
is located in the Norwegian Sea. Produced crude oil is transported to Mongstad in Norway and Tetney in the United Kingdom by double-hulled shuttle tankers. Part of the natural gas is currently injected into the reservoir for optimization of crude
oil production, while the remainder is used as feedstock in a methanol plant in Norway, in which we own an 18.3 percent interest.

We also
have varying ownership interests in five other producing fields in the Norway sector of the North Sea and in the Norwegian Sea, including the Aasta Hansteen development, a gas discovery with first gas scheduled for late 2017.

Exploration

During 2013, we participated in five nonoperated wells, of which three were discoveries. Also in 2013, we were awarded four new

Australia Pacific LNG

Australia Pacific LNG Pty Ltd (APLNG), our joint venture with Origin Energy Limited and China Petrochemical Corporation (Sinopec), is focused on producing CBM from the Bowen and Surat basins in
Queensland, Australia, and converting the CBM into LNG. Natural gas is currently sold to domestic customers, while progress continues on the development of the LNG processing and export sales business. Origin operates APLNG’s upstream
production and pipeline system, and we will operate the downstream LNG facility, located on Curtis Island near Gladstone, Queensland.

Two
fully subscribed 4.5-million-tonnes-per-year LNG trains have been sanctioned. Approximately 3,900 net wells are ultimately envisioned to supply both the domestic gas market and the LNG sales contracts. The wells will be supported by gathering
systems, central gas processing and compression stations, water treatment facilities, and a new export pipeline connecting the gas fields to the LNG facilities. First LNG is expected in mid-2015, under a sales agreement with Sinopec for up to
4.3 million metric tonnes of LNG per year for 20 years. Start-up of the second LNG train is expected to occur six-to-nine months following the startup of Train 1, under sales agreements with Sinopec and Japan-based Kansai Electric Power
Co., Inc. The resulting LNG exports from Train 2 will commence shortly thereafter. Sinopec has agreed to purchase an additional 3.3 million metric tonnes of LNG per year through 2035, and Kansai has agreed to purchase approximately
1 million metric tonnes of LNG per year for 20 years.

In May 2012, APLNG executed project financing agreements for an $8.5 billion
project finance facility and began drawing on the financing in October 2012. In connection with the execution of the project financing, we provided a completion guarantee for our pro-rata share of the project finance facility. Our guarantee of the
project financing will be released upon meeting certain completion tests with milestones.

For additional information, see Note
4—Variable Interest Entities (VIEs), Note 7—Investments, Loans and Long-Term Receivables, and Note 13—Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Bayu-Undan

The Bayu-Undan gas condensate field is located in the Timor Sea Joint
Petroleum Development Area between Timor-Leste and Australia. We also operate and own a 56.9 percent interest in the associated Darwin LNG Facility, located at Wickham Point, Darwin.

The Bayu-Undan natural gas recycle facility processes wet gas; separates, stores and offloads condensate, propane and butane; and re-injects dry gas back into the reservoir. In addition, a 500-kilometer
natural gas







pipeline connects the facility to the 3.5-million-tonnes-per-year capacity Darwin LNG Facility. Produced natural gas is piped to the Darwin LNG Plant, where it is converted into LNG before being
transported to international markets. In 2013, we sold 167 billion gross cubic feet of LNG to utility customers in Japan.

The Bayu-Undan
Phase Three Development was sanctioned in the third quarter of 2013, with development drilling anticipated to commence in the third quarter of 2014 and initial production estimated in the second quarter of 2015. The development will consist of two
standalone, subsea horizontal wells tied back to the existing drilling, production, and processing (DPP) platform. In 2013, we secured a semi-submersible drilling rig, procured long-lead items and commenced planning and detailed engineering for
subsea and DPP topsides installation. Planning and engineering activities will continue through 2014. The two wells are expected to produce over three to five years, with estimated average production of 150 MMCFD.

ConocoPhillips served a Notice of Arbitration on the Timor-Leste Minister of Finance in October 2012 for outstanding disputes related to a series of tax
assessments. The arbitration process is currently underway. For additional information, see Note 14—Contingencies and Commitments, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

The Athena production license (WA-17-L) is located offshore Western
Australia and contains part of the Perseus Field which straddles the boundary with WA-1-L, an adjoining license area. Natural gas is produced from these licenses.

Greater Sunrise

We have a 30 percent interest in the Greater Sunrise gas and
condensate field located in the Timor Sea. In May 2013, the Timor-Leste Government referred a dispute with the Australian Government relating to the treaty on Certain Maritime Arrangements in the Timor Sea (CMATS) to international
arbitration. The CMATS arbitration does not directly impact our underlying interest in Sunrise; however, key challenges must be resolved before further commercial and technical work continues.

Exploration



•Conventional Exploration

We operate three permits in the Browse Basin, offshore northwest Australia. In 2013, we reduced our interests in two permits in the Greater Poseidon Area, WA-315-P and WA-398-P, from 60 percent to 40
percent. We have a 10 percent interest in WA-314-P, which is outside the Greater Poseidon Area. Phase I of the 2009/2010 Browse Basin drilling campaign resulted in discoveries in the Greater Poseidon Area: Poseidon-1, Poseidon-2 and Kronos-1. Phase
II of the drilling campaign consists of six wells and commenced in 2012. The first two wells, Boreas-1 and Zephyros-1, discovered hydrocarbons and were completed, plugged and abandoned in 2012. The third well, Proteus-1, discovered hydrocarbons and
was plugged and abandoned in 2013. The three wells were drilled in the Greater Poseidon Area. The fourth well, Grace-1, was drilled to satisfy aYear-5permit obligation for WA-314-P. The Grace-1 was spud in
late 2013, reached total depth in early 2014 and was declared a dry hole. The outcome does not affect our view of the overall Greater Poseidon Project.

In the Bonaparte Basin, offshore northern Australia, we operate the NT/RL5 and NT/RL6 permits. Our ownership interest in each of the permits is 37.5 percent. A three-well appraisal program is expected to
commence in 2014 to further evaluate the field’s potential.



•Unconventional Exploration

In 2013, we reduced our working interest in four exploration permits within the Canning Basin of Western Australia from 75 percent to 46 percent. These permits cover approximately 11 million gross
acres. Phase I of a three-well drilling program commenced in 2012 with the drilling of the Nicolay-1 and the Gibb-Maitland-1 wells. Both were written off as dry holes in 2013. Phase I drilling is expected to resume in the second half of 2014.

Health, Safety and Environment

Our Health, Safety and Environment (HSE) organization provides tools and support to our business units and staff groups to help them ensure world class

intense focus on occupational safety. In support of the goal of zero incidents, our HSE Excellence Process requires the business

sustainable development in our economic, environmental and social performance. Our processes, related tools and requirements focus on water, biodiversity and climate change, as well as social and stakeholder issues.
