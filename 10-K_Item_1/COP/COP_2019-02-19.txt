SEGMENT AND GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION

For operating segment and geographic information, see Note 25—Segment Disclosures and Related Information, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements, which is incorporated herein by reference.

We explore for, produce, transport and market crude oil, bitumen, natural gas, LNG and natural gas
liquids on a worldwide basis. At December 31, 2018, our operations were producing in the United States, Norway, the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, Timor-Leste, Indonesia, Malaysia, Libya, China and Qatar.

The information listed below appears in the “Oil and Gas Operations” disclosures following the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and is
incorporated herein by reference:



•Proved worldwide crude oil, natural gas liquids, natural gas and bitumen reserves.

•Net production of crude oil, natural gas liquids, natural gas and bitumen.

•Average sales prices of crude oil, natural gas liquids, natural gas and bitumen.







•Average production costs per barrel of oil equivalent (BOE).

•Net wells completed, wells in progress and productive wells.

•Developed and undeveloped acreage.

The following table is a summary of the proved reserves information included in the “Oil and Gas Operations” disclosures following the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements. Approximately 80 percent of our proved reserves are located in politically stable countries that belong to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. Natural gas reserves are converted to BOE
based on a 6:1 ratio: six thousand cubic feet (MCF) of natural gas converts to one BOE. See Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for a discussion of factors that will enhance the understanding of
the following summary reserves table.

Total production, including Libya, of 1,283 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day (MBOED) decreased 7 percent
in 2018 compared with 2017. The decrease in total average production primarily resulted from noncore asset dispositions, including the dispositions of our 50 percent nonoperated interest in the Foster Creek Christina Lake (FCCL) Partnership, as
well as the majority of our western Canada gas assets, and our interest in the San Juan Basin in the Lower 48 in 2017; normal field decline; and higher unplanned downtime, including a third-party pipeline outage in Malaysia in 2018. The decrease in
production was partly offset by growth from the Big 3 Unconventionals—Eagle Ford, Bakken and Delaware, development programs primarily in Europe and Alaska, and rampup of major projects in Asia Pacific.

Production excluding Libya was 1,242 MBOED in 2018 compared with 1,356 MBOED in 2017. The volume from closed dispositions was approximately 200 MBOED in 2017
and 15 MBOED in 2018. The volume from acquisitions was less than 10 MBOED in 2018. Our underlying production, which excludes the full-year impact of acquisitions, dispositions, and Libya, increased over 5 percent in 2018 compared with 2017.







Our worldwide annual average realized price was $53.88 per BOE in 2018, an increase of 37 percent compared
with $39.19 per BOE in 2017, reflecting stronger marker prices as well as a shift in our portfolio toward a higher mix of crude oil and less of bitumen and natural gas. Our worldwide annual average crude oil price increased 31 percent in 2018,
from $51.96 per barrel in 2017 to $68.13 per barrel in 2018. Additionally, our worldwide annual average natural gas liquids prices increased 21 percent, from $25.22 per barrel in 2017 to $30.48 per barrel in 2018. Our worldwide annual average
natural gas price increased 39 percent, from $4.07 per MCF in 2017 to $5.65 per MCF in 2018. Average annual bitumen prices decreased 2 percent, from $22.66 per barrel in 2017 to $22.29 per barrel in 2018.

ALASKA

The Alaska segment primarily
explores for, produces, transports and markets crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids. We are the largest crude oil producer in Alaska and have major ownership interests in two of North America’s largest oil fields located on
Alaska’s North Slope: Prudhoe Bay and Kuparuk. We also have a 100 percent interest in the Alpine Field, located on the Western North Slope. Additionally, we are one of Alaska’s largest owners of state, federal and fee exploration
leases, with approximately 1.25 million net undeveloped acres atyear-end2018. Alaska operations contributed 23 percent of our worldwide liquids production and less than 1 percent of our
natural gas production.

Greater Prudhoe Area

The Greater Prudhoe Area
includes the Prudhoe Bay Field and five satellite fields, as well as the Greater Point McIntyre Area fields. Prudhoe Bay, the largest oil field on Alaska’s North Slope, is the site of a large waterflood and enhanced oil recovery operation, as
well as a gas plant which processes natural gas to recover natural gas liquids before reinjection into the reservoir. Prudhoe Bay’s satellites are Aurora, Borealis, Polaris, Midnight Sun and Orion, while the Point McIntyre, Niakuk, Raven,
Lisburne and North Prudhoe Bay State fields are part of the Greater Point McIntyre Area.

Greater Kuparuk Area

We operate the Greater Kuparuk Area, which consists of the Kuparuk Field and four satellite fields: Tarn, Tabasco, Meltwater and West Sak. Kuparuk is located
40 miles west of Prudhoe Bay. Field installations include three central production facilities which separate oil, natural gas and water, as well as a separate seawater treatment plant. Development drilling at Kuparuk consists of rotary-drilled wells
and horizontal multi-laterals from existing well bores utilizing coiled-tubing drilling.

We completed a transaction in the fourth quarter of 2018 which
increased our interest in the Greater Kuparuk Area by 39.2 percent. Further discussion of the transaction is included in the “Acquisitions” section below.







Western North Slope

On the Western North Slope, we operate the Colville River Unit, which includes the Alpine Field and three satellite fields: Nanuq, Fiord and Qannik. Alpine is
located 34 miles west of Kuparuk. In 2015, first oil was achieved at Alpine West CD5, a drill site which extends the Alpine reservoir west into the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska(NPR-A).In 2018, we
continued drilling additional wells using the available well slots on this pad.

The Greater Mooses Tooth Unit, the first unit established entirely within
theNPR-A,was formed in 2008. In 2017, we began construction in the unit, which is currently planned to have two drill sites; Greater Mooses Tooth #1(GMT-1)and
Greater Mooses Tooth #2(GMT-2).GMT-1achieved first oil in the fourth quarter of 2018 and we expect first oil fromGMT-2in
2021.

We completed a transaction in the second quarter of 2018 to increase our interest in the Western North Slope from 78 percent to
100 percent. Further discussion of the transaction is included in the “Acquisitions” section below.

Alaska North Slope Gas

In 2016, we, along with affiliates of Exxon Mobil Corporation, BP p.l.c. and Alaska Gasline Development Corporation (AGDC), a state-owned
corporation, completed preliminaryfront-endengineering and design(pre-FEED)technical work for a potential LNG project which would liquefy and export natural gas from
Alaska’s North Slope and deliver it to market. In 2016, we, along with the affiliates of ExxonMobil and BP, indicated our intention not to progress into the next phase of the project due to changes in the economic environment. AGDC decided
to continue progressing the project on its own and signed several Memorandums of Understanding with various potential LNG buyers in Asia. AGDC has also signed a Joint Development Agreement with Sinopec, CIC Capital and Bank of China, which was
recently extended to June 30, 2019. In early January 2019, recently elected Governor Dunleavy appointed new members to AGDC’s board of directors who replaced AGDC’s president with an interim president. The Dunleavy administration has
indicated they are interested in participation in the project by ConocoPhillips, ExxonMobil and BP. We remain willing to make our equity gas available for sale to the project at mutually agreed, commercially reasonable terms.

Exploration

Appraisal of the Willow Discovery,
located in the northeast portion of the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska, continued throughout 2018 with three appraisal wells. Additionally, the WestWillow-1exploration well, drilled in 2018, resulted in
an oil discovery. In 2019, we will continue appraisal of the Willow and West Willow discoveries.

The Putu 2/2A and Stony Hill 1 wells were drilled in
2018 on state and federal leases, resulting in oil discoveries. In late 2018, we commenced appraisal of the Putu Discovery with a long reach well from existing Alpine CD4 infrastructure.

The Cairn2S-315Well was drilled in late 2018 from the 2S drill site on state leases in the Kuparuk River Unit. A
flow test will commence in the first quarter of 2019.

A3-Dseismic survey was completed in 2018 over a250-milearea on state lands. We are currently processing this data.

We were successful in the federal lease sale on
the North Slope in the fourth quarter of 2018, where we were the high bidder on five tracts for a total of approximately 48,000 net acres.

Acquisitions

During the second quarter of 2018,
we obtained regulatory approvals and completed a transaction we entered into with Anadarko Petroleum Corporation to acquire its 22 percent nonoperated interest in the Western North Slope of Alaska, as well as its interest in the Alpine
Transportation Pipeline. In 2018, our Alaska segment net production included 7 MBOED associated with the additional interest acquired.







During the fourth quarter of 2018, we completed a transaction with BP to acquire their 39.2 percent
nonoperated interest in the Greater Kuparuk Area, including their 38 percent interest in the Kuparuk Transportation Company in Alaska (Kuparuk Assets), and to sell a ConocoPhillips subsidiary to BP, which held 16.5 percent of our
24 percent interest in theBP-operatedClair Field in the United Kingdom. In 2018, our Alaska segment net production included 1 MBOED associated with the additional interest acquired in the Greater
Kuparuk Area.

that is part of Trans-Alaska Pipeline System (TAPS). We have a 29.1 percent ownership interest in TAPS, and we also have ownership interests in the Alpine, Kuparuk and Oliktok pipelines on the North Slope.

Our wholly owned subsidiary, Polar Tankers, Inc., manages the marine transportation of our North Slope production, using five company-owned, double-hulled
tankers, and charters third-party vessels as necessary. The tankers deliver oil from Valdez, Alaska, primarily to refineries on the west coast of the United States.

LOWER 48

The Lower 48 segment
consists of operations located in the contiguous United States and the Gulf of Mexico. The Lower 48 business is organized within two regions covering the Gulf Coast and Great Plains. As a result of tight oil opportunities, we have directed our
investments toward certain shorter cycle time, low cost of supply plays. We disposed of several noncore assets within the Lower 48 in 2018, including our interests in the Barnett and certain conventional assets in the Permian Basin. In 2017, we
disposed of our interest in the San Juan Basin. We hold 10.3 million net onshore and offshore acres in the Lower 48. In 2018, the Lower 48 contributed 36 percent of our worldwide liquids production and 21 percent of our natural gas
production.
