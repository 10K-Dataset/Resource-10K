Forward-Looking Statements

Overview

Alcoa is the world
leader in the production and management of primary aluminum, fabricated aluminum, and alumina combined, through its active and growing participation in all major aspects of the industry: technology, mining, refining, smelting, fabricating, and
recycling. Aluminum is a commodity that is traded on the London Metal Exchange (LME) and priced daily based on market supply and demand. Aluminum and alumina represent more than three-fourths of Alcoa’s revenues, and the price of aluminum
influences the operating results of Alcoa. Nonaluminum products include precision castings and aerospace and industrial fasteners. Alcoa’s products are used worldwide in aircraft, automobiles, commercial transportation, packaging, building and
construction, oil and gas, defense, and industrial applications.

Alcoa is a global company operating in 31 countries. Based upon the country
where the point of sale occurred, the United States (U.S.) and Europe generated 52% and 27%, respectively, of Alcoa’s sales in 2009. In addition, Alcoa has investments and operating activities in Australia, Brazil, China, Iceland, Guinea,
Russia, and the Kingdom of







Saudi Arabia, all of which present opportunities for substantial growth. Governmental policies, laws and
regulations, and economic factors, including inflation and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates, affect the results of operations in these countries.

Alcoa’s operations consist of four worldwide reportable segments: Alumina, Primary Metals, Flat-Rolled Products, and Engineered Products and Solutions.

The following charts and related
discussion of the company’s Bauxite Interests, Alumina Refining and Primary Aluminum Facilities and Capacities, and Flat-Rolled Products, Engineered Products and Solutions and Corporate Facilities provide additional description of Alcoa’s
businesses. The Alumina segment primarily consists of a series of affiliated operating entities referred to as Alcoa World Alumina and Chemicals (AWAC). Alcoa owns 60% and Alumina Limited owns 40% of these individual entities. For more information
on AWAC, see Exhibit Nos. 10(a) through 10(f)(1) to this report.







Bauxite Interests

Aluminum is one of the most plentiful elements in the earth’s crust. Aluminum is produced primarily from bauxite, an ore containing aluminum in the form of aluminum oxide, commonly referred to as
alumina. Aluminum is made by extracting alumina from bauxite and then removing oxygen from the alumina. Alcoa processes most of the bauxite that it mines into alumina. The company obtains bauxite from its own resources and from those belonging to
the AWAC enterprise, located in the countries listed in the chart below, as well as pursuant to both long-term and short-term contracts and mining leases. In 2009, Alcoa consumed 36.0 million metric tons (mt) of bauxite from AWAC and its own
resources, 4.8 million mt from related third parties and 1.9 million mt from unrelated third parties. Alcoa’s present sources of bauxite are sufficient to meet the forecasted requirements of its alumina refining operations for the
foreseeable future. The following table provides information regarding the company’s bauxite interests:

1Alcoa also has interests at the following locations that are bauxite resources which do not currently produce bauxite: Cape Bougainville and Mitchell
Plateau in Australia, and Brownsberg, Coermotibo DS, Lely Mountains, and Nassau, all in eastern Suriname.



2AofA is part of the AWAC group of companies and is owned 60% by Alcoa and 40% by Alumina Limited.



3Alumínio is owned 100% by Alcoa.



4Brazilian mineral legislation does not establish the duration of mining concessions. The concession remains in force until the complete exhaustion of
the deposit. The company estimates that (i) the concessions at Poços de Caldas will last at least until 2020 and (ii) the concessions at Trombetas will last until 2046. Depending, however, on actual and future needs, the rate at
which the deposits are explored and government approval is obtained, the concessions may be extended to (or expire at) a later (or an earlier) date.



5Alumínio holds an 8.125% interest, Alcoa World Alumina Brasil Ltda. (formerly Abalco S.A., which merged with Alcoa World Alumina Brasil Ltda. in
December 2008) (AWA Brasil) holds a 4.375% interest and Alcoa World Alumina LLC (AWA LLC) holds a 5% interest in MRN. AWA Brasil and AWA LLC are both part of the AWAC group of companies and are owned 60% by Alcoa and 40% by Alumina Limited. MRN is
jointly owned with affiliates of Rio Tinto Alcan Inc., Companhia Brasileira de Alumínio, Companhia Vale do Rio Doce, BHP Billiton Plc (BHP Billiton) and Norsk Hydro. Alumínio, AWA Brasil, and AWA LLC purchase bauxite from MRN under
long-term supply contracts.







6In September 2009, development of a new bauxite mine was completed in Juruti, state of Para in northern Brazil. The mine is fully operational and
expected to produce 2.6 million mt per year (mtpy) of bauxite.



7This entity is part of the AWAC group of companies and is owned 60% by Alcoa and 40% by Alumina Limited.



8AWA LLC owns a 45%
interest in Halco (Mining), Inc. Halco owns 100% of Boké Investment Company, a Delaware company, which owns 51% of CBG. The Guinean Government owns 49% of CBG, which has the exclusive right through 2038 to develop and mine bauxite in certain
areas within a 10,000 square-mile concession in northwestern Guinea.



9AWA LLC has a bauxite purchase contract with CBG that will provide Alcoa with bauxite through 2011.



10Clarendon Alumina Production Ltd. is a wholly-owned entity of the Government of Jamaica.



11In July 2009, AWA LLC acquired the BHP Billiton subsidiary that was a 45% joint venture partner in the Surinamese bauxite mining and alumina refining
joint ventures. Prior to the AWA LLC buy out, BHP Billiton’s subsidiary held a 45% interest to Suralco’s 55% interest in the two joint ventures. After the acquisition of the BHP Billiton subsidiary, its name was changed to N.V. Alcoa
Minerals of Suriname (AMS).



12While mining rights at Caramacca extend until 2012 and rights at the remaining Suriname locations extend until 2033, it is likely that all Suriname
bauxite resources will be exhausted within the next several years. Alcoa is evaluating alternative sources of bauxite, including resources from Suralco’s concession in eastern Suriname such as the Nassau plateau.

Kingdom of Saudi Arabia Joint Venture

In December 2009, Alcoa and Saudi Arabian Mining Company (Ma’aden) entered into an agreement setting forth the terms of a joint venture between them to develop a fully integrated aluminum industry in
the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. In its initial phases, the joint venture plans to develop a fully integrated industrial complex that will include a bauxite mine with an initial capacity of 4.0 million mt per year (mtpy); an alumina refinery with
an initial capacity of 1.8 million mtpy; an aluminum smelter with an initial capacity of ingot, slab and billet of 740,000 mtpy; and a rolling mill, with initial hot-mill capacity of between 250,000 and 460,000 mtpy. The mill is expected to
focus initially on the production of sheet, end and tab stock for the manufacture of aluminum cans, and potentially other products to serve the construction industry.

The refinery, smelter and rolling mill will be established within the new industrial zone of Raz Az Zawr on the east coast of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. First production from the aluminum smelter and
rolling mill is anticipated in 2013, and first production from the mine and refinery is expected in 2014.

Capital investment is expected to
be approximately $10.8 billion (SAR 40.5 billion) subject to the completion of detailed feasibility studies and environmental impact assessments. Ma’aden will own a 60% interest in the joint venture. Alcoa will own a 40% interest through a
special purpose vehicle (SPV) controlled by Alcoa. Through this arrangement, Alcoa will have a 20% economic interest in the joint venture. Each of Alcoa and the partners in the SPV are expected to invest approximately $900 million over a four-year
period. For additional information regarding the joint venture, see the Equity Investments section of Note I to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8. (Financial Statements and Supplementary Data).







Alumina Refining Facilities and Capacity

Alcoa is the world’s leading producer of alumina. Alcoa’s alumina refining facilities and its worldwide alumina capacity are shown in the

3This entity is part of the AWAC group of companies and is owned 60% by Alcoa and 40% by Alumina Limited.



4This entity is owned 100% by Alcoa.



5In January 2009, the company began curtailment of production at Poços de Caldas. The facility’s production was curtailed by 135,000 mtpy.
However, production is expected to be ramped-up during the first quarter of 2010.



6The named company
or an affiliate holds this interest.



7Clarendon Alumina Production Ltd. is a wholly-owned entity of the Government of Jamaica.



8In August 2007, Hurricane Dean substantially damaged the Rocky Point port from which Jamalco ships alumina. The facility is shipping alumina from
temporary on-site port facilities constructed in 2007. Permanent repairs to the Rocky Point Pier are expected to be completed in 2011. The refinery is operating at approximately 95% of nameplate capacity.



9In July 2009, AWA LLC acquired the BHP Billiton subsidiary that was a 45% joint venture partner in the Surinamese bauxite mining and alumina refining
joint ventures. Prior to the AWA LLC buy out, BHP Billiton’s subsidiary held a 45% interest to Suralco’s 55% interest in the two joint ventures. After the acquisition of the BHP Billiton subsidiary, its name was changed to N.V. Alcoa
Minerals of Suriname (AMS).







10In May 2009, the Suralco alumina refinery announced curtailment of 870,000 mtpy. The decision was made to protect the long-term viability of the
industry in Suriname. The curtailment was aimed at deferring further bauxite extraction until additional in-country bauxite resources are developed and market conditions for alumina improve.



11Reductions in production at Point Comfort resulted mostly from the effects of curtailments initiated in late 2008 through early 2009, as a result of
overall market conditions. The reductions included approximately 1,500,000 mtpy curtailment. Of that amount, 800,000 mtpy remained curtailed as of December 31, 2009.

As noted above, Alcoa and Ma’aden entered into an agreement that involves the development of an alumina refinery in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Initial capacity of the refinery is expected to be 1.8
million mtpy. First production is expected in 2014.

Investments in the company’s Brazilian upstream operations continue. The 2.1 million
mtpy expansion of the Alumar consortium alumina refinery in São Luís, Maranhão, has increased the refinery’s nameplate capacity to approximately 3.5 million mtpy, with Alcoa’s share of such capacity more than
doubling to 1.89 million mtpy based on its 54% ownership stake through Alumínio and AWAC. Construction on the refinery was finalized at the end of 2009. The company is continuing with its modernization of the Poços de Caldas aluminum
smelter.

In November 2005, Alcoa World Alumina LLC (AWA LLC) and Rio Tinto Alcan Inc. signed a Basic Agreement with the Government of Guinea
that sets forth the framework for development of a 1.5 million mtpy alumina refinery in Guinea. In 2006, the Basic Agreement was approved by the Guinean National Assembly and was promulgated into law. The Basic Agreement was set to expire in
November 2008, but has been extended to November 2010. Pre-feasibility studies were completed in 2008. Further project activities may be considered in 2010, but execution is dependent upon global economic conditions and conditions within Guinea.

In September 2006, Alcoa received environmental approval from the Government of Western Australia for expansion of the Wagerup alumina
refinery to a maximum capacity of 4.7 million mtpy, a potential increase of over 2 million mtpy. This approval included environmental conditions that must be satisfied before Alcoa can seek construction approval for the project. The
project was suspended in November 2008 due to global economic conditions and the unavailability of a secure long-term energy supply in Western Australia.

In 2008, AWAC signed a cooperation agreement with Vietnam National Coal-Minerals Industries Group (Vinacomin) in which they agreed to conduct a joint feasibility study of the Gia Nghia bauxite mine and
alumina refinery project located in Dak Nong Province in Vietnam’s Central Highlands, with first stage capacity expected to be between 1.0 and 1.5 million mtpy. The cooperation between AWAC and Vinacomin on Gia Nghia is subject to approval
by the Government of Vietnam. If established, the Gia Nghia venture is expected to be 51% owned by Vinacomin, 40% by AWAC and 9% by others.

5In December 2008, approximately 15,000 mtpy annualized production was idled at the Portland facility due to overall market conditions. In July 2009, an
additional 15,000 mtpy annualized production was idled, again, due to overall market conditions.



6In January 2009, approximately 32,000 mtpy annualized production was idled at the Poços de Caldas facility due to overall market conditions.
However, production is expected to increase during the first quarter of 2010.



7In November 2008, Baie Comeau permanently curtailed one potline (53,000 mtpy) in response to the economic downturn and as part of a modernization
program, reducing nameplate capacity to 385,000 mtpy.



8Owned through Rio Tinto Alcan Inc.’s interest in Pechiney Reynolds Québec, Inc., which is owned by Rio Tinto Alcan Inc. and Alcoa.



9In November 2009, Alcoa announced the idling of smelting at Fusina and Portovesme due to uncertainty in obtaining competitively priced power and the
financial impact of the European Commission decision regarding electricity tariffs, as described in Part I, Item 3. (Legal Proceedings) of this report. The idling has not occurred as of the filing of this report.



10In March 2009, Alcoa and Orkla ASA exchanged respective stakes in the Sapa AB and Elkem Aluminium ANS companies. Alcoa now owns 100% of the Lista and
Mosjøen smelters.



11The Warrick facility currently has one idled potline of approximately 40,000 mtpy of annualized production.



12At the end of 2005, all production was idled at the Eastalco smelter located in Frederick, Maryland.



13All production at the Badin, North Carolina facility has been idled since August 2002.



14All production at the Massena East smelter was idled in June 2009 due to economic conditions, as well as the planned modernization of that facility.



15All production at the Tennessee smelter was idled in March 2009 due to economic conditions.



16Between June and November 2008, three of Rockdale’s six potlines were idled as a result of uneconomical power prices. The remaining three
operating lines were idled in November 2008 due to uncompetitive power supply and overall market conditions.



17One and a quarter of Intalco’s three potlines, or approximately 115,000 mtpy, remains idled.



18Two of Wenatchee’s four potlines, or approximately 84,000 mtpy, remain idled.

As of December 31, 2009, Alcoa had approximately 1,234,000 mtpy of idle capacity against total Alcoa Consolidated Capacity of 4,812,900 mtpy.

As noted above, Alcoa and Ma’aden entered into an agreement that involves development of an aluminum smelter in the Kingdom of Saudi
Arabia. The smelter is expected to have an initial capacity of ingot, slab and billet of 740,000 mtpy. First production is expected in 2013.

Alcoa and the Government of Iceland began detailed feasibility studies for the development of a 250,000 mtpy aluminum smelter at Bakki near Húsavík in north Iceland in 2006. Although the memorandum of understanding (MOU)
between the Government, the Municipality and Alcoa related to this activity expired in 2009, Alcoa is pursuing continued studies. At the same time, the Government and the local community are developing their revised strategy for utilizing the
power from the geothermal areas under a new MOU structure. They have said that Alcoa is the preferred partner even if the company was not invited to this new MOU. Separate MOU agreements between Alcoa and Landsvirkjun and Alcoa and
Landsnet covering development of power generation and transmission for this smelter project were signed in May 2006. Although the MOU between Alcoa and Landsvirkjun expired in 2008, Alcoa and the power companies continue their collaboration on the
studies, including the Joint Environmental Impact Assessment, and Alcoa is working on the extension of the Landsnet MOU which expired in December 2009.







In 2007, Alcoa and Greenland Home Rule Government entered into an MOU regarding cooperation on a feasibility
study for an aluminum smelter with a 360,000 mtpy capacity in Greenland. The MOU also encompasses a hydroelectric power system and related infrastructure improvements, including a port. In 2008, Greenland’s parliament allocated funding to
support the second phase of joint studies with Alcoa and endorsed that the smelter be located at Maniitsoq. Related studies are expected to extend through 2010. Greenland elected a new Parliament in 2009 and when the government convenes in Spring
2010, it is expected to consider Greenland’s ownership stake in the project.

In March 2009, Alcoa and Orkla ASA (Orkla) exchanged their
respective stakes in Elkem Aluminium ANS (a Norwegian smelting partnership) (EA) and Sapa AB (a Swedish extrusion joint venture) (SAPA) to focus on specific areas of expertise and best practices. EA, now 100% owned by Alcoa, operates smelters in
Mosjøen and Lista, Norway and supplies extrusion billets, rolling ingots and foundry ingots to rolling mills, extrusion plants and foundries in Europe. Alcoa also received the balance of EA’s ownership stake in the Mosjøen
anode plant in which Alcoa already held an approximate 82% share and which supplies anodes to Alcoa’s Fjarðaál, Iceland and Mosjøen, Norway smelters. Orkla received Alcoa’s 45% share of the SAPA soft-alloy extrusion
profile joint venture.

In December 2008, Alcoa and the Brunei Economic Development Board agreed to further extend an existing MOU to enable
more detailed studies into the feasibility of establishing a modern, gas-powered aluminum smelter in Brunei Darussalam. The MOU extends a memorandum signed originally in 2003. Phase one of the feasibility study will determine scope and dimensions of
the proposed facility, power-delivery strategy, location, as well as an associated port and infrastructure. At completion of phase one, the parties will determine whether a more detailed phase two study is warranted. If completed, it is expected
that the smelter would have an initial operating capacity of 360,000 mtpy with the potential for future increase.







Flat-Rolled Products Facilities

The principal business of the company’s Flat-Rolled Products segment is the production and sale of aluminum plate, sheet and foil. This segment includes rigid container sheet, which is sold directly
to customers in the packaging and consumer market. This segment also includes sheet and plate used in the transportation, building and construction and distribution markets.

As noted above, Alcoa and Ma’aden entered into an agreement that involves development of a rolling mill in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Initial hot mill capacity is expected to be between 250,000 and
460,000 mtpy. First production is expected in 2013.

In January 2009, the company announced its intention to sell its Global Foil business.
The sale of the Shanghai, China foil facility was completed effective November 1, 2009, and the sale of the Sabiñánigo, Spain foil facility was completed on December 1, 2009. The company continues to manufacture foil in
Itapissuma, Brazil and Alicante, Spain, while other strategic options are being explored.

Products and Solutions. These raw materials are still utilized in the Flat-Rolled Products segment.

Generally, other
materials are purchased from third party suppliers under competitively-priced supply contracts or bidding arrangements. The company believes that the raw materials necessary to its business are and will continue to be available.







Energy

Alcoa produces aluminum from alumina by an electrolytic process requiring large amounts of electric power. Electric power accounts for approximately 24% of the company’s primary aluminum costs. Alcoa
generates approximately 22% of the power used at its smelters worldwide and generally purchases the remainder under long-term arrangements. Power generated by natural gas, or in the alternative, by fuel oil, as purchased by the company, accounts for
approximately 15% and 14%, respectively, of the company’s total refining production costs. The paragraphs below summarize the sources of power and the long-term power arrangements for Alcoa’s smelters and refineries.

North America – Electricity

The Deschambault, Baie Comeau and Bécancour smelters in Québec purchase electricity under existing contracts that run through 2015, which will be followed on by long-term contracts with Hydro-Québec executed in December
2008 that expire in 2040, provided that Alcoa completes the modernization of the Baie Comeau smelter by the end of 2015. The smelter located in Baie Comeau, Québec purchases approximately 65% of its power needs under the Hydro-Québec
contract and receives the remainder from a 40%-owned hydroelectric generating company, Manicouagan Power Limited Partnership, whose ownership was restructured in 2009 with Hydro-Québec acquiring the 60% stake previously held by Abitibi.

The company’s wholly-owned subsidiary, Alcoa Power Generating Inc. (APGI), generates approximately 28% of the power requirements for
Alcoa’s smelters in the U.S. The company generally purchases the remainder under long-term contracts. APGI owns and operates two hydroelectric projects, Tapoco and Yadkin, consisting of eight dams, under Federal Energy Regulatory Commission
(FERC) licenses. APGI hydroelectric facilities provide electric power, as needed, for the aluminum smelters at Alcoa, Tennessee and Badin, North Carolina. The Tennessee smelter may also purchase power from the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) under
a contract that extends to June 20, 2010. Discussions for the supply of power by TVA to the smelter after the expiration of the current contract are underway.

APGI received a renewed 40-year FERC license for the Tapoco project in 2005. The relicensing process is nearing completion for the Yadkin hydroelectric project license. In 2007, APGI filed with FERC a
Relicensing Settlement Agreement with the majority of the interested stakeholders that broadly resolved open issues. The National Environmental Policy Act process is complete, with a final environmental impact statement having been issued in April
2008. The remaining requirement for the relicensing was the issuance by North Carolina of the required water quality certification under Section 401 of the Clean Water Act. The Section 401 water quality certification was issued on
May 7, 2009, but is being appealed, and has been stayed since late May 2009 pending substantive determination on the appeal. APGI received a year-to-year license renewal from FERC in May 2008, and will continue to operate under annual licenses
until the new Section 401 certification is issued and the FERC relicensing process is complete. With the Badin smelter idled, power generated from APGI’s Yadkin system is largely being sold to an affiliate, Alcoa Power Marketing LLC, and
then sold into the wholesale market.

The company, through APGI, generates substantially all of the power used at its Warrick smelter using
nearby coal reserves. Since May 2005, Alcoa has owned the nearby Friendsville, Illinois coal reserves, which mine is being operated by Vigo Coal Company, Inc. The mine is producing approximately one million tons of coal per year, 45% of the Warrick
power plant’s requirements. The balance of the coal used is purchased principally from local Illinois basin coal producers pursuant to term contracts of varying duration.

In the Pacific Northwest, Alcoa has been operating under a contract with Chelan County Public Utility District (Chelan PUD) located in the State of Washington that is sufficient to supply about half of
the capacity of the Wenatchee smelter through October 2011. In July 2008, Alcoa and Chelan PUD executed a new contract which will begin in November 2011 and run through October 2028 under which Alcoa will receive approximately 26% of the hydropower
output of Chelan PUD’s Rocky Reach and Rock Island dams.







Alcoa had a contract through September 2011 with the Bonneville Power Administration
(BPA) under which Alcoa was receiving financial benefits to reduce the cost of power purchased from the market to partially operate the Intalco smelter. In December 2008, the 9thCircuit Court of Appeals issued its opinion in the Pacific Northwest Generating Cooperative v. BPA case which
invalidated the financial benefits portion of that arrangement. In January 2009, Alcoa and BPA executed a short-term agreement running through September 2009 that transformed that arrangement into one consistent with the Court’s opinion, which
interim contract was also invalidated by the same panel of the 9thCircuit Court of Appeals. These two panel decisions are being appealed. Subsequently, Alcoa and BPA signed a new contract providing for the sale of physical power at the Northwest Power Act-mandated industrial firm power (IP) rate, for the
period from December 22, 2009 – May 26, 2011 (17 months), with provision for a 5-year extension if certain financial tests can be met.

In the northeast, the purchased power contracts for both the Massena East and Massena West
smelters in New York expire not earlier than June 30, 2013, following their extension in 2003 for 10 years upon New York Power Authority (NYPA) having relicensed its St. Lawrence-FDR Hydro Project. In December 2007, Alcoa and NYPA reached
agreement in principle on a new energy contract to supply the Massena East and Massena West smelters for 30 years, beginning on July 1, 2013. The definitive agreement implementing this arrangement became effective February 24, 2009. A
subsequent amendment, providing Alcoa additional time to complete the design and engineering work for its Massena East modernization plan, and providing for the return of 256 megawatts of power to NYPA while Massena East is idled, was entered into
effective April 16, 2009. Implementation of the Massena East modernization plan is subject to further approval of the Alcoa Board.

The
Mt. Holly smelter in South Carolina purchases electricity from Santee Cooper under a contract that expires December 31, 2015, subject to certain extension provisions.

At the end of 2005, all production was temporarily curtailed at the Eastalco smelter located in Frederick, Maryland. The curtailment coincided with the expiration of the smelter’s power contract on
December 31, 2005, as a competitively-priced replacement power supply could not be obtained. Alcoa continues efforts to find an alternative power source for Eastalco.

Australia – Electricity

Power is generated from extensive brown coal deposits covered by a long-term mineral lease held by Alcoa of Australia Limited (AofA), and that power currently provides approximately 40% of the electricity for the company’s smelter in
Point Henry, Victoria. The State Electricity Commission of Victoria provides the remaining power for this smelter and all power for the Portland smelter, under contracts with AofA that extend to 2014 and 2016, respectively. Work continues on new
power arrangements that would begin upon the expiration of these power contracts.







Brazil – Electricity

The Alumar smelter is almost entirely supplied by Eletronorte (Centrais Elétricas do Norte do Brasil S.A.) through a long-term power purchase
agreement expiring in December 2024. Eletronorte has supplied the Alumar smelter from the beginning of its operations in 1984. Alcoa Alumínio S.A.’s (Alumínio) remaining power needs for the smelter are supplied from the Barra
Grande hydroelectric project.

Alumínio owns a 30.99% stake in Maesa – Machadinho Energética S.A., which is the owner of
83.06% of the Machadinho hydroelectric power plant located in southern Brazil. Alumínio’s share of the plant’s output is supplied to the Poços de Caldas smelter, and is sufficient to cover 55% of its operating needs.

Alumínio also has a 42.18% interest in Energética Barra Grande S.A. – BAESA, which built the Barra Grande hydroelectric
power plant in southern Brazil. Alumínio’s share of the power generated by BAESA covers the remaining power needs of the Poços de Caldas smelter and a portion of the power needs of Alumínio’s interest in the Alumar
smelter.

With Machadinho and Barra Grande, Alumínio’s current power self-sufficiency is approximately 40%, to meet a total energy
demand of approximately 695 megawatts from Brazilian primary plants.

Alumínio is also participating in a number of other Brazilian
hydropower projects. Two of these projects have received the Environmental License Permits from the Federal Government and started construction in 2007:



•Estreito, northern Brazil – Alumínio’s share is 25.49%



•Serra do Facão, in the southeast of Brazil – Alumínio’s share is 34.97%

Both projects are in the final stages of construction, with Serra do Facão expected to begin generating power in the second quarter of 2010, and
Estreito in the first quarter of 2011.

The Pai Querê project in southern Brazil (Alumínio’s share is 35%) and the Santa
Isabel project in northern Brazil (Alumínio’s share is 20%) are still in the process of obtaining necessary environmental licenses.

If these projects are completed, the power will be used in Alumínio’s smelters or sold into the Brazilian grid.

Europe – Electricity

The company’s smelters at San Ciprián, La Coruña and Avilés, Spain
purchase electricity under bilateral power contracts that commenced in May 2009 and are due to expire on December 31, 2012. Prior to the establishment of







power supply under the bilateral contracts, Alcoa was supplied under a regulated power tariff. On January 25, 2007, the EC announced that it has opened an investigation to establish whether
the regulated electricity tariffs granted by Spain comply with EU state aid rules. Alcoa operated in Spain for more than ten years under a power supply structure approved by the Spanish Government in 1986, an equivalent tariff having been granted in
1983. The investigation is limited to the year 2005 and it is focused both on the energy-intensive consumers and the distribution companies. It is Alcoa’s understanding that the Spanish tariff system for electricity is in conformity with all
applicable laws and regulations, and therefore no state aid is present in that tariff system. A decision by the EC has not yet been made. If the EC’s investigation concludes that the regulated electricity tariffs for industries are unlawful,
Alcoa will have an opportunity to challenge the decision in the EU courts.

Pursuant to the exchange arrangement with Orkla previously
described, Alcoa assumed 100% ownership of the two smelters in Norway, Lista and Mosjøen, at the end of the first quarter of 2009. These smelters have long-term power arrangements in place which continue until at least 2019.

Iceland – Electricity

Alcoa’s Fjarðaál smelter in eastern Iceland began operation in 2007. Central to those operations is a 40-year power contract under which Landsvirkjun, the Icelandic national power company, built the Kárahnjúkar
dam and hydro-power project, and supplies competitively priced electricity to the smelter. First power was supplied to the Fjarðaál smelter in April 2007, and with the completion of the Kárahnjúkar project in late 2007, the
smelter achieved full production in April 2008. In late 2009, Iceland imposed two new taxes on power intensive industries, both for a period of 3 years, from 2010 through 2012. One tax is based on energy consumption; the other is a pre-payment of
certain other charges, and will be recoverable from 2013 through 2015.

North America – Natural Gas

In order to supply its refineries and smelters in the U.S. and Canada, the company generally procures natural gas on a competitive bid basis from a variety
of sources including producers in the gas production areas and independent gas marketers. For Alcoa’s larger consuming locations in Canada and the U.S., the gas commodity as well as interstate pipeline transportation is procured to provide
increased flexibility and reliability. Contract pricing for gas is typically based on a published industry index or New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) price. The company may choose to reduce its exposure to NYMEX pricing by hedging a portion of
required natural gas consumption.

Australia – Natural Gas

Alcoa of Australia (AofA) holds a 20% equity interest in a consortium that bought the Dampier-to-Bunbury natural gas pipeline in October 2004. This pipeline
transports gas from the northwest gas fields to Alcoa’s alumina refineries and other users in the Southwest of Western Australia. AofA uses gas to co-generate steam and electricity for its alumina refining processes at the Kwinana, Pinjarra and
Wagerup refineries. Gas supply from Apache Northwest Pty Ltd and a separate joint venture, in which Apache is a participant, was curtailed beginning in June 2008 following an explosion and fire at its Varanus Island gas processing plant. Supply was
progressively restored beginning in August 2008, with full supply being returned in June 2009. The shortfall in gas supply from Varanus Island was covered by short term contracts with other gas producers and liquid fuels. Production at the
Kwinana, Pinjarra and Wagerup refineries was not materially impacted.

Patents, Trade Secrets and Trademarks

The company believes that its domestic and international patent, trade secret and trademark assets provide it with a significant competitive advantage. The
company’s rights under its patents, as well as the products made and sold under them, are important to the company as a whole and, to varying degrees, important to each business segment. The patents owned by Alcoa generally concern particular
products or manufacturing equipment or techniques. Alcoa’s business as a whole is not, however, materially dependent on any single patent, trade secret or trademark.







The company has a number of trade secrets, mostly regarding manufacturing processes and material
compositions that give many of its businesses important advantages in their markets. The company continues to strive to improve those processes and generate new material compositions that provide additional benefits.

The company also has a number of domestic and international registered trademarks that have significant recognition within the markets
that are served. Examples include the name “Alcoa” and the Alcoa symbol for aluminum products, Howmet metal castings, Huck®fasteners, Kawneer building panels and Dura-Bright®for wheels with dirt resistant surface treatments. The company’s rights under its trademarks are important to the company as a whole and, to varying degrees,
important to each business segment.

Competitive Conditions

Alcoa is subject to highly competitive conditions in all aspects of its aluminum and nonaluminum businesses. Competitors include a variety of both U.S. and non-U.S. companies in all major markets. Price,
quality and service are the principal competitive factors in Alcoa’s markets. Where aluminum products compete with other materials – such as steel and plastics for automotive and building applications; magnesium, titanium, composites and
plastics for aerospace and defense applications – aluminum’s diverse characteristics, particularly its light weight, recyclability and flexibility are also significant factors. For Alcoa’s segments that market products under
Alcoa’s brand names, brand recognition and brand loyalty also play a role. In addition Alcoa’s competitive position depends, in part, on the company’s access to an economical power supply to sustain its operations in various
countries.

Research and Development

Alcoa, a technology leader in the aluminum industry, engages in research and development programs that include process and product development, and basic and applied research. Expenditures for Research
and Development (R&D) activities were $169 million in 2009, $246 million in 2008 and $238 million in 2007.

Most of the major process
areas within the company have a Technology Management Review Board (TMRB) consisting of members from various worldwide locations. Each TMRB is responsible for formulating and communicating a technology strategy for the corresponding process area,
developing and managing the technology portfolio and ensuring the global transfer of technology. Alternatively, certain business units conduct these activities and research and development programs within the worldwide business unit, supported by
the Alcoa Technical Center (ATC). Technical personnel from the TMRBs, ATC and such business units also participate in the corresponding Market Sector Teams. In this manner, research and development activities are aligned with corporate and business
unit goals.

During 2009, the company continued to work on new developments for a number of strategic projects in all business segments. In
Primary Metals, progress was made on inert anode technology with tests carried out on a “pilot scale”. Progress has been successful in many respects as a result of full pot testing of anode assemblies, although there remain technical and
cost targets to achieve. If the technology proves to be commercially feasible, the company believes that it would be able to convert its existing potlines to this new technology, resulting in significant operating cost savings. The new technology
would also generate environmental benefits by reducing certain emissions and eliminating carbon dioxide. No timetable has been established for commercial use. Progress was also made on carbothermic projects with pilot tests. The projects, if
commercially feasible, may reduce capital and energy costs, as well as provide environmental benefits related to waste reduction.

In the
semi-fabrication businesses, National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has certified Alcoa’s Davenport, Iowa facility as a supplier in the U.S. to produce aluminum-lithium alloy 2195 thin plate for the Ares 1 crew launch vehicle, the
rocket that will enable astronauts to explore space. First shipments have been made and successfully validated by NASA.







Alcoa has also moved from the R&D stage to “commercial scale” on its continuous cast-rolled
micromill process. The full width implementation at the San Antonio, Texas facility has been successful with coils delivered to the market. In addition, a new process “Sequential Alloy Casting” has been developed and products are being
validated by the Department of Defense.

Leveraging of new technologies such as bio-mimicry, nano and low cost sensing continues to progress.
For example, riblets that reduce aerodynamic drag (sharkskin mimicry) have been analyzed and produced on a test basis. Self-cleaning nano coatings have been demonstrated on building products. Energy saving sensing devices are being integrated in
company manufacturing plants. Integrated thermal management products for consumer electronics have been developed and are being validated by our customers.

A number of products were commercialized in 2009 including Dura Bright®wheels for commercial transport applications; new alloy products and advanced fasteners for Boeing 787; easy clean coatings for building products; alloy 7085 for mold blocks; unique surface sheet for the consumer electronics market;
lightweight, high-strength applications for the defense market; and high performance products such as drill pipes for the oil and gas markets.

For the aerospace market, new multi-material technologies continue to be developed to effectively compete with composites. Alcoa’s advanced aerospace alloys contributed to the successful operation of China’s first home-produced
regional jet, ARJ21-700.

The company currently has at least 60 new products in various development stages. As a result of product development
and technological advancement, the company continues to pursue patent protection in jurisdictions throughout the world.

“Environmental Matters” on page 82 and in Note N to the Consolidated Financial Statements under the caption “Environmental Matters” on pages 110-113.

Employees

Total worldwide employment at year-end 2009 was approximately 59,000
employees in 31 countries. About 37,000 of these employees are represented by labor unions. The company believes that relations with its employees and any applicable union representatives generally are good.

In the U.S., approximately 9,000 employees are represented by various labor unions. The master collective bargaining agreement between Alcoa and the United
Steelworkers, covering 10 locations and approximately 5,600 U.S. employees, is scheduled to expire on May 31, 2010. The parties will negotiate in May with the intent of reaching a new long-term agreement. To the extent a new long-term agreement
is not reached, a work stoppage at some or all of the 10 locations could begin on June 1, 2010. There are 18 other collective bargaining agreements in the U.S. with varying expiration dates. Various collective bargaining agreements with varying
expiration dates cover about 12,000 employees in Europe, 5,600 employees in Russia, 6,200 employees in Central and South America, 3,800 employees in Australia, 600 employees in China and 2,200 employees in Canada.

In 2009, Alcoa reduced worldwide headcount by approximately 28,000 as a result of temporary and permanent reductions in force and various divestures. Alcoa
has lifted the global hiring and salary freezes that it instituted in 2009.
