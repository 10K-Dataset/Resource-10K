Forward-Looking Statements

Overview

Alcoa is a global leader in lightweight metals engineering and
manufacturing. Alcoa’s innovative, multi-material products, which include aluminum, titanium, and nickel, are used worldwide in aircraft, automobiles, commercial transportation, packaging, building and construction, oil and gas, defense,
consumer electronics, and industrial applications.

Alcoa is also the world leader in the production and management of primary aluminum,
fabricated aluminum, and alumina combined, through its active participation in all major aspects of the industry: technology, mining, refining, smelting, fabricating, and recycling. Aluminum is a commodity that is traded on the London Metal Exchange
(LME) and priced daily. Aluminum (primary and fabricated) and alumina represent approximately 80% of Alcoa’s revenues, and the price of aluminum influences the operating results of Alcoa.

Alcoa is a global company operating in 30 countries. Based upon the country where the point of sale occurred, the U.S. and Europe generated 51% and 26%,
respectively, of Alcoa’s sales in 2013. In addition, Alcoa has investments and







operating activities in, among others, Australia, Brazil, China, Guinea, Iceland, Russia, and Saudi Arabia, all of which present opportunities for substantial growth. Governmental policies, laws
and regulations, and other economic factors, including inflation and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates, affect the results of operations in these countries.

Alcoa’s operations consist of four worldwide reportable segments: Alumina, Primary Metals, Global Rolled Products, and Engineered Products and Solutions.

The following tables and related discussion of the Company’s Bauxite Interests, Alumina Refining and Primary
Aluminum Facilities and Capacities, Global Rolled Products, Engineered Products and Solutions and Corporate Facilities provide additional description of Alcoa’s businesses. The Alumina segment primarily consists of a series of affiliated
operating entities referred to as Alcoa World Alumina and Chemicals (AWAC). Alcoa owns 60% and Alumina Limited owns 40% of these individual entities. For more information on AWAC, see Exhibit Nos. 10(a) through 10(f)(1) to this report.

Bauxite Interests

Aluminum is
one of the most plentiful elements in the earth’s crust and is produced primarily from bauxite, an ore containing aluminum in the form of aluminum oxide, commonly referred to as alumina. Aluminum is made by extracting alumina from bauxite and
then removing oxygen from the alumina. Alcoa processes most of the bauxite that it mines into alumina. The Company obtains bauxite from its own resources and from those belonging to the AWAC enterprise, located in the countries listed in the table
below, as well as pursuant to both long-term and short-term contracts and mining leases. During 2013, Alcoa consumed 41 million metric tons (mt) from AWAC and its own resources and 7 million mt from entities in which the Company has an
equity interest. Tons of bauxite are reported as bone dry metric tons (bdmt) unless otherwise stated. See the glossary of bauxite mining related terms at the end of this section.

The Company has access to large bauxite deposit areas with mining rights that extend in most cases more than 20 years from today. For purposes of evaluating the amount of bauxite that will be available to
supply as feedstock to its refineries, the Company considers both estimates of bauxite resources as well as calculated bauxite reserves. Bauxite







resources represent deposits for which tonnage, densities, shape, physical characteristics, grade and mineral content can be estimated with a reasonable level of confidence based on the amount of
exploration sampling and testing information gathered through appropriate techniques from locations such as outcrops, trenches, pits, workings and drill holes. Bauxite reserves represent the economically mineable part of resource deposits, and
include diluting materials and allowances for losses, which may occur when the material is mined. Appropriate assessments and studies have been carried out to define the reserves, and include consideration of and modification by realistically
assumed mining, metallurgical, economic, marketing, legal, environmental, social and governmental factors. Alcoa employs a conventional approach (including additional drilling with successive tightening of the drill grid) with customized techniques
to define and characterize its various bauxite deposit types allowing Alcoa to confidently establish the extent of its bauxite resources and their ultimate conversion to reserves.

The table below only includes the amount of proven and probable reserves controlled by the Company. While the level of reserves may appear low in relation to annual production levels, they are consistent
with historical levels of reserves for our mining locations. Given the Company’s extensive bauxite resources, the abundant supply of bauxite globally and the length of the Company’s rights to bauxite, it is not cost-effective to invest the
significant resources necessary to establish bauxite reserves that reflect the total size of the bauxite resources available to the Company. Rather, bauxite resources are upgraded annually to reserves as needed by the location. Detailed assessments
are progressively undertaken within a proposed mining area and mine activity is then planned to achieve a uniform quality in the supply of blended feedstock to the relevant refinery. Alcoa believes its present sources of bauxite on a global basis
are sufficient to meet the forecasted requirements of its alumina refining operations for the foreseeable future.

Bauxite Resource
Development Guidelines

Alcoa has developed best practice guidelines for bauxite reserve and resource classification at its operating
bauxite mines. Alcoa’s reserves are declared in accordance with Alcoa’s internal guidelines as administered by the Alcoa Ore Reserve Committee (AORC). The reported ore reserves set forth in the table below are those that Alcoa estimates
could be extracted economically with current technology and in current market conditions. Alcoa does not use a price for bauxite, alumina, or aluminum to determine its bauxite reserves. The primary criteria for determining bauxite reserves are the
feed specifications required by the customer alumina refinery. In addition to these specifications, a number of modifying factors have been applied to differentiate bauxite reserves from other mineralized material. Alcoa mining locations have annual
in-fill drilling programs designed to progressively upgrade the reserve classification of their bauxite.

4Brazilian mineral legislation does not establish the duration of mining concessions. The concession remains in force until the exhaustion of the
deposit. The Company estimates that (i) the concessions at Poços de Caldas will last at least until 2020, (ii) the concessions at Trombetas will last until 2046 and (iii) the concessions at Juruti will last until 2100.
Depending, however, on actual and future needs, the rate at which the deposits are exploited and government approval is obtained, the concessions may be extended to (or expire at) a later (or an earlier) date.



5Clarendon Alumina Production Ltd. is wholly-owned by the Government of Jamaica.



6Alcoa World Alumina LLC (AWA LLC) owns 100% of N.V. Alcoa Minerals of Suriname (AMS). Suralco and AMS are parts of the AWAC group of companies which
are owned 60% by Alcoa and 40% by Alumina Limited.



7The mining rights in the Onverdacht and Coermotibo areas where Suralco has active mines extend until 2033. Onverdacht reserves were reclassified as
resources pending testing during 2014 to confirm ore characteristics. Proven reserves at Coermotibo were reclassified as probable reserves pending new density tests during 2014. Bauxite within these areas will likely be exhausted in the next few
years. During 2013, Suralco received for processing 12.7 thousand







mt of Juruti high iron bauxite as test material. Alcoa is actively exploring and evaluating additional sources of bauxite in Suriname. During 2014, Suralco will be mining from both reserves and
resources. A feasibility study relating to the development of a mine at the Nassau Plateau is in progress.



8Alumínio holds an 8.58% total interest, AWA Brasil (formerly Abalco S.A., which merged with Alcoa World Alumina Brasil Ltda. in December 2008)
holds a 4.62% total interest and AWA LLC holds a 5% total interest in MRN. MRN is jointly owned with affiliates of Rio Tinto Alcan Inc., Companhia Brasileira de Alumínio, Companhia Vale do Rio Doce, BHP Billiton Plc (BHP Billiton) and Norsk
Hydro. Alumínio, AWA Brasil, and AWA LLC purchase bauxite from MRN under long-term supply contracts.



9AWA LLC owns a 45% interest in Halco (Mining), Inc. (Halco). Halco owns 100% of Boké Investment Company, a Delaware company, which owns 51% of
CBG. The Guinean Government owns 49% of CBG, which has the exclusive right through 2038 to develop and mine bauxite in certain areas within a 10,000 square-mile concession in northwestern Guinea.



10AWA LLC has a bauxite purchase contract with CBG that expires in 2029. Before that expiration date, AWA LLC expects to negotiate an extension of the
contract as CBG will have concession rights until 2038. The CBG concession can be renewed beyond 2038 by agreement of the Government of Guinea and CBG should more time be required to commercialize the remaining economic bauxite within the
concession.

Kingdom of Saudi Arabia Joint Venture

In December 2009, Alcoa and Saudi Arabian Mining Company (Ma’aden) entered into a joint venture to develop a fully integrated aluminum complex in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. In its initial phases,
the complex includes a bauxite mine with an initial capacity of 4 million bdmtpy; an alumina refinery with an initial capacity of 1.8 million mtpy; an aluminum smelter with an initial







capacity of ingot, slab and billet of 740,000 mtpy; and a rolling mill with initial capacity of 380,000 mtpy. The mill will produce sheet, end and tab stock for the manufacture of aluminum cans,
as well as other products to serve the automotive, construction, and other industries.

The refinery, smelter and rolling mill are located
within the Ras Al Khair industrial zone on the east coast of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. First hot metal from the smelter was produced on December 12, 2012. The smelter reached production of 190,000 mtpy in 2013 and is expected to reach full
capacity in 2014. The first hot coil from the rolling mill was produced in the fourth quarter of 2013 and the first automotive coil is expected in the fourth quarter of 2014. First production from the mine and refinery is expected in 2014.

Total capital investment is expected to be approximately $10.8 billion (SAR 40.5 billion). Ma’aden owns a 74.9% interest in the joint
venture. Alcoa owns a 25.1% interest in the smelter and rolling mill, with the AWAC group holding a 25.1% interest in the mine and refinery. For additional information regarding the joint venture, see the Equity Investments section of Note I to the

8In May 2009, the Suralco alumina refinery announced curtailment of 870,000 mtpy. The decision was made to protect the long-term viability of the
industry in Suriname. The curtailment was aimed at deferring further bauxite extraction until additional in-country bauxite resources are developed and market conditions for alumina improve. The refinery currently has approximately 876,000 mtpy of
idle capacity.



9Reductions in production at Point Comfort resulted mostly from the effects of curtailments initiated in late 2008 through early 2009, as a result of
overall market conditions. The reductions included curtailments of approximately 1,500,000 mtpy. Of that original amount, 340,000 mtpy remain curtailed.

As of December 31, 2013, Alcoa had approximately 1,216,000 mtpy of idle capacity against total Alcoa Consolidated Capacity of 18,112,000 mtpy.

As noted above, Alcoa and Ma’aden are developing an alumina refinery in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Initial capacity of the refinery is expected to
be 1.8 million mtpy. First production is expected in 2014. For additional information regarding the joint venture, see the Equity Investments section of Note I to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8. (Financial
Statements and Supplementary Data).

In November 2005, AWA LLC and Rio Tinto Alcan Inc. signed a Basic Agreement with the Government of Guinea
that sets forth the framework for development of a 1.5 million mtpy alumina refinery in Guinea. In 2006, the Basic Agreement was approved by the Guinean National Assembly and was promulgated into law. The Basic Agreement was originally set to
expire in November 2008, but was extended to November 2012, and has been recently extended again until 2015. Pre-feasibility studies were completed in 2008. Additional feasibility study work was completed in 2012, and further activities continued in
2013.

In September 2006, Alcoa received environmental approval from the Government of Western Australia for expansion of the Wagerup alumina
refinery to a maximum capacity of 4.7 million mtpy, a potential increase of over 2 million mtpy. This approval had a term of 5 years and included environmental conditions that must be satisfied before Alcoa could seek construction approval
for the project. The project was suspended in November 2008 due to global economic conditions and the unavailability of a secure long-term energy supply in Western Australia. These constraints continue and as such the project remains under
suspension. In May 2012, the Government of Western Australia granted Alcoa a 5 year extension of the original environmental approval. There were no material developments in 2013.

In 2008, AWAC signed a cooperation agreement with Vietnam National Coal-Minerals Industries Group (Vinacomin) in which they agreed to conduct a joint feasibility study of the Gia Nghia bauxite mine and
alumina refinery project located in Vietnam’s Central Highlands. The cooperation between AWAC and Vinacomin on Gia Nghia is subject to approval by the Government of Vietnam. If established, the Gia Nghia venture is expected to be 51% owned by
Vinacomin, 40% by AWAC and 9% by others. There were no material developments in 2013.

5In December 2008, approximately 15,000 mtpy annualized production was idled at the Portland facility due to overall market conditions. In July 2009, an
additional 15,000 mtpy annualized production was idled, again, due to overall market conditions. This production remains idled.



6In August 2013, Alcoa initiated the temporary curtailment of 31,000 mtpy at its Poços de Caldas smelter and 97,000 mtpy at its São
Luís (Alumar) smelter. This action was completed by the end of September 2013. An additional 3,000 mtpy was temporarily curtailed at the Poços de Caldas smelter by the end of 2013.







7In mid-May 2013, in connection with the announcement of a revised modernization plan schedule for the Baie-Comeau smelter, Alcoa stated that it would
permanently close the plant’s two Soderberg potlines. The closure, which was completed in August, involved 105,000 mtpy of capacity and was part of the 460,000 mtpy of smelting capacity Alcoa announced was under review in May 2013.



8Owned through Rio Tinto Alcan Inc.’s interest in Pechiney Reynolds Québec, Inc., which is owned by Rio Tinto Alcan Inc. and Alcoa.



9In January 2012, as part of a restructuring of Alcoa’s global smelting system, Alcoa announced that it had decided to curtail operations at the
Portovesme smelter during the first half of 2012. In March 2012, Alcoa decided to delay the curtailment of the Portovesme smelter until the second half of 2012 based on negotiations with the Italian government and other stakeholders. In the third
quarter of 2012, Alcoa began the process of curtailing the Portovesme smelter, and it has since been fully curtailed as of November 2012 with all 150,000 mtpy idled. This action may lead to the permanent closure of the Portovesme facility; however,
Alcoa will keep the smelter in restart condition through June 2014.



10In January 2012, Alcoa announced its intention to partially and temporarily curtail its Avilés and La Coruña smelters. The partial
curtailments were completed in the first half of 2012. As a result of a modification to the load interruptibility regime then in place in the Spanish power market, Alcoa restarted a portion (27,000 mtpy combined for Avilés and La
Coruña) of the capacity previously curtailed in the first half of 2012 in order to meet the requirements of the modified interruptibility regime. 35,000 mtpy and 27,000 mtpy remain curtailed at Avilés and La Coruña,
respectively. See the Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations section for more information.



11In August 2013, Alcoa announced the permanent closure of one potline representing 41,000 mtpy at the Massena East facility. In addition, in January
2014, Alcoa announced the permanent shutdown and demolition of the remaining two potlines (capacity of 84,000 mtpy) that employ Soderberg technology at the smelter. The two Soderberg potlines will be fully shut down by the end of the first quarter
of 2014.



12Between June and November 2008, three of Rockdale’s six potlines were idled as a result of uneconomical power prices. The remaining three
operating lines were idled in November 2008 due to uncompetitive power supply and overall market conditions. In January 2012, Alcoa announced that it will permanently shut down and demolish two of the six idled potlines as part of a larger strategy
to improve its cost position and competitiveness. The remaining four potlines (191,000 mtpy) remain idled.



13Approximately half of one potline at the Intalco smelter remains idled, approximately 49,000 mtpy.



14One potline at the Wenatchee smelter remains idled, or approximately 41,000 mtpy.

As of December 31, 2013, Alcoa had approximately 655,000 mtpy of idle capacity against total Alcoa Consolidated Capacity of 4,037,000 mtpy.

In June 2013, Alcoa announced its intention to permanently close the Fusina, Italy smelter. The closure is in addition to the 460,000 mtpy of
operating smelting capacity that the company announced was under review in May 2013.

As noted above, Alcoa and Ma’aden have developed an
aluminum smelter in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. The smelter is expected to have an initial capacity of ingot, slab and billet of 740,000 mtpy. First hot metal was produced on December 12, 2012 and the smelter reached production of 190,000 mtpy
in 2013. In October 2013, Alcoa announced that it had halted production on one of two potlines. The temporary shutdown was undertaken after a period of pot instability. The joint venture is actively working to restore the potline, and it is expected
to be completed and back online between the first and second quarter of 2014. The second potline is operating at capacity. There is no impact to any other part of the joint venture project.

In 2013, Alcoa and the Brunei Economic Development Board agreed to further extend an existing Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) to enable more detailed studies into the feasibility of establishing a
modern, gas-powered aluminum smelter in Brunei Darussalam.

In November 2013, following elections in Greenland, the parliament approved
changes to framework legislation affecting large scale projects. The impact of those changes on the economic feasibility of the proposed integrated hydro system-aluminum smelter now requires evaluation.







The MOU with the Government of Angola for the feasibility study of an aluminum smelter and related power
assets has expired, and will not be extended.

Global Rolled Products

The principal business of the Company’s Global Rolled Products segment is the production and sale of aluminum plate, sheet, and specialty foil. This segment includes rigid container sheet (RCS),
which is sold directly to customers in the packaging and consumer market. This segment also includes sheet and plate used in the aerospace, automotive, brazing, commercial transportation, and building and construction markets.

As noted above, Alcoa and Ma’aden are developing a rolling mill in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. In 2010, the joint venture entity, Ma’aden
Rolling Company, signed project financing for its rolling mill and broke ground on the construction of the mill. Initial capacity is approximately 380,000 mtpy. The rolling mill produced its first coil at the end of 2013. In March 2012, Alcoa and
Ma’aden announced commencement of work to extend the product mix of their aluminum complex currently under construction, enabling the two companies to include capability for producing approximately 100,000 mt of a wide range of products
suitable for further downstream manufacturing in the complex’s product lines. The products include automotive heat-treated and non-heat-treated sheet, building and construction sheet and foil stock sheet. The line is expected to start
production by the end of 2014.

In January 2011, Alcoa and China Power Investment Corporation (CPI) signed an MOU followed by a Letter of
Intent that provides a framework for the creation of a joint venture which includes a focus on producing high-end fabricated aluminum products in China. In February 2012, Alcoa and CPI announced that they finalized an agreement to establish a joint
venture company to produce high-end fabricated aluminum products in China. The new joint venture company, Alcoa CPI Aluminum Investment Co. Ltd., with its headquarters in Shanghai, was established in November 2012 and is majority owned and managed
by Alcoa. In 2014, during the next phase of this joint venture, three Alcoa businesses will be integrated into the new joint venture company. These three businesses include a brazing sheet facility located in Kunshan, China and a can sheet facility
located in Qinhuangdao, China. The third business is discussed below, under the Engineered Products and Solutions segment.

In order to meet
rising demand for aluminum auto sheet from the automotive market, the Company invested in a $300 million expansion of its Davenport Works plant. The expansion was completed on time and on budget, with the first coil produced in December 2013. The
expansion is creating an additional 150 full time jobs in Davenport. An economic development incentive package from the Iowa Department of Economic Development helped secure the selection of Davenport for the expansion.

In addition, the Company broke ground on a $275 million expansion of its Tennessee operations in August 2013. This expansion will convert some of the
plant’s existing can sheet capacity to high-strength aluminum automotive sheet capacity, as well as install incremental automotive capacity. Once completed in mid-2015, the expansion will create an additional 200 full time jobs in Alcoa,
Tennessee.

On August 31, 2012, Alcoa assumed full control and ownership of Evermore Recycling LLC from its prior joint venture partner,
Novelis Corporation, and integrated it into the Company.

Engineered Products and Solutions

This segment represents Alcoa’s downstream operations and includes titanium, aluminum, and super alloy investment castings; fasteners; aluminum wheels; integrated aluminum structural systems;
architectural extrusions; and forgings and hard alloy extrusions. These products, which are used in the aerospace, automotive, building and construction, commercial transportation, power generation, and industrial markets, are sold directly to
customers and through distributors.

In 2012, Alcoa announced that it will expand its aluminum lithium capacity and capabilities and began
construction of a $90 million greenfield facility adjacent to its Lafayette, Indiana plant. When completed, the facility will produce more than 20,000 mt of aluminum lithium and be capable of casting round and rectangular ingot for rolled, extruded,
and forged applications. The facility is expected to cast its first aluminum lithium cast products by the end of 2014. Alcoa completed expanding aluminum lithium production at its Technical Center in Alcoa Center, PA in the third quarter of 2012. In
June of 2013, Alcoa also completed its expansion at its Kitts Green plant in the United Kingdom, creating additional aluminum lithium casting capacity.

Alcoa and VSMPO-AVISMA Corporation signed a cooperation agreement in October 2013, which will allow the companies to meet growing demand for high-end titanium and aluminum products for aircraft
manufacturers







worldwide. Once formed, the new joint venture will focus on manufacturing high-end aerospace products, such as landing gear and forged wing components, at Alcoa’s plant in Samara, Russia.
The joint venture is expected to be operational in 2016.

As discussed above, in accordance with the February 2012 agreement between Alcoa and
CPI, the parties created a joint venture company in November 2012, to produce high-end fabricated aluminum products in China. Three Alcoa businesses in total will be integrated into this company in 2014, during the next phase of the joint venture.
One of these businesses will be an aerospace and industrial fastener facility located in Suzhou, China. The other two businesses are discussed above, under the Global Rolled Products segment.

Explanatory Note: Certain aluminum produced by Alcoa also includes alloying materials. Because of the number of different
types of elements that can be used to produce Alcoa’s various alloys, providing a range of such elements would not be meaningful. With the exception of a very small number of internally used products, Alcoa produces its alloys in adherence to
an Aluminum Association standard. The Aluminum Association, of which Alcoa is an active member, uses a specific designation system to identify alloy types. In general, each alloy type has a major alloying element other than aluminum but will also
have other constituents as well, but of lesser amounts.

Energy

Employing the Bayer process, Alcoa refines alumina from bauxite ore. Alcoa then produces aluminum from the alumina by an electrolytic process requiring substantial amounts of electric power. Energy
accounts for approximately 25% of the Company’s total alumina refining production costs. Electric power accounts for approximately 26% of the Company’s primary aluminum production costs. Alcoa generates approximately 20% of the power used
at its smelters worldwide and generally purchases the remainder under long-term arrangements. The paragraphs below summarize the sources of power and the long-term power arrangements for Alcoa’s smelters and refineries.

North America – Electricity

The Deschambault, Baie Comeau, and Bécancour smelters in Québec purchase electricity under existing contracts that run through 2015, which will be followed by long-term contracts with
Hydro-Québec first executed in December 2008, revised twice, in 2012 and 2013, and expiring in 2040, provided that Alcoa completes the modernization of the Baie Comeau smelter by September 2019. The smelter located in Baie Comeau,
Québec completed the permanent closure of its two remaining Soderberg potlines in September 2013, consequently reducing its annual production by 105,000 metric tons. Following this curtailment, the Baie-Comeau smelter now purchases
approximately 74% of its power needs under the Hydro-Québec contract, and the remainder from a 40% owned hydroelectric generating company, Manicougan Power Limited Partnership. Furthermore, in October 2013, Alcoa provided Hydro-Québec
with advanced







notification to reduce to close to zero its purchasing obligation under the power contracts for the three smelters effective at the end of 2014. Alcoa’s provision of such advanced
notification to Hydro-Québec does not require Alcoa to reduce its electricity consumption accordingly. However, providing such notification ensures that Alcoa would have the right to do so if it deems such an action to be necessary.

The Company’s wholly-owned subsidiary, Alcoa Power Generating Inc. (APGI), generates approximately 29% of the power requirements for
Alcoa’s smelters operating in the U.S. The Company generally purchases power under long-term contracts. APGI owns and operates the Yadkin hydroelectric project, consisting of four dams in North Carolina, and the Warrick coal-fired power plant
located in Indiana.

Pending completion of the relicensing process, APGI received year-to-year license renewals from FERC starting in May 2008, and will continue to operate under annual licenses until a new Section 401
certification is issued and the FERC relicensing process is complete. Since the permanent closure of the Badin, North Carolina smelter, power generated from APGI’s Yadkin system is largely being sold to an affiliate, Alcoa Power Marketing LLC,
and then sold into the wholesale market. Proceeds from sales to the wholesale market are used to offset higher priced power contracts at other U.S. operations.

APGI generates substantially all of the power used at the Company’s Warrick, Indiana smelter using nearby coal reserves. Since May 2005, Alcoa has owned the nearby Friendsville, Illinois coal
reserves, with the Friendsville Mine being operated by Vigo Coal Company, Inc. The Friendsville Mine is producing approximately one million tons of coal per year. In June 2011, the Red Brush West Mine, owned by Alcoa and operated by Vigo Coal, was
opened and produced approximately 60,000 tons per month over an eighteen-month period, but operation ceased in 2013. In the second quarter of 2013, Liberty Mine, also owned by Alcoa and operated by Vigo Coal, began producing coal and is operating at
a level of approximately one million tons per year. Friendsville and Liberty Mines together combine to supply 95% of the power plant’s future needs. The balance of the coal used is royalty coal or purchased coal from the Illinois basin.

In the State of Washington, Alcoa’s Wenatchee smelter operates under a contract with Chelan County Public Utility District (Chelan PUD)
under which Alcoa receives approximately 26% of the hydropower output of Chelan PUD’s Rocky Reach and Rock Island dams.

Starting on
January 1, 2013, the Intalco smelter began receiving physical power from the Bonneville Power Administration (BPA) pursuant to a new contract executed between Alcoa and BPA, under which Alcoa receives physical power at the Northwest Power Act
mandated industrial firm power (IP) rate through September 30, 2022.

Prior to 2007, power for the Rockdale smelter in Texas was
historically supplied from Company-owned generating units and units owned by Luminant Generation Company LLC (formerly TXU Generation Company LP) (Luminant),







In the Northeast, the purchased power contracts for both the Massena East and Massena West smelters in New York expired on December 31, 2013, subject to their terms and conditions. Commencing on
January 1, 2014, the Massena smelters receive physical power pursuant to a new thirty-year energy contract executed between Alcoa and the New York Power Authority (NYPA), as amended in January 2011. The January 2011 amendment provides Alcoa
additional time to complete the design and engineering work for its Massena East modernization plan. Implementation of the Massena East modernization plan is subject to further approval of the Alcoa Board of Directors. Alcoa announced on
January 15, 2014 the accelerated closure of the remaining potlines at its Massena East smelter.

The Mt. Holly smelter in South Carolina
purchases electricity from Santee Cooper under a contract that was amended and restated in 2012, and expires December 31, 2015. The contract includes a provision for follow-on service at the then current rate schedule for industrial customers.

Australia – Electricity

Power is generated from extensive brown coal deposits covered by a long-term mineral lease held by AofA, and that power currently provides approximately 40% of the electricity for AofA’s Point Henry
smelter. The State Electricity Commission of Victoria (SECV) provides the remaining power for this smelter, and all power for the Portland smelter, under contracts with Alcoa Portland Aluminium Pty Ltd, a wholly-owned subsidiary of AofA, in respect
of its interest in Portland, that extend to 2014 and 2016, respectively. Upon the expiration of these contracts, both smelters will purchase power from the Australian National Energy Market (NEM) variable spot market. In March 2010, AofA and Eastern
Aluminium (Portland) Pty Ltd (in respect of the Portland Smelter only) separately entered into fixed for floating swap contracts with Loy Yang Power in order to manage exposure to variable energy rates from the NEM for the Point Henry and Portland
smelters. The fixed for floating swap contract with Loy Yang Power for the Point Henry smelter was terminated in 2013. The fixed for floating swap contract with Loy Yang Power for the Portland smelter commences from the date of expiration of the
current contract with the SECV and is in place until December 2036.

Brazil – Electricity

The Alumar smelter is partially supplied by Centrais Elétricas do Norte do Brasil S.A. (Eletronorte) under a long-term power purchase agreement
originally expiring in December 2024. Eletronorte has supplied the Alumar smelter from the beginning of its operations in 1984. Since 2006, Alumínio’s power needs of the Poços de Caldas smelter have been







supplied from self-generated energy. In March 26, 2012, the Eletronorte contract supply was reduced from 423 MW to 263 MW. In March 2012, Alumínio declared that the Eletronorte
contract will be terminated by March 31, 2014 and alternatives for supplying the remaining power needs of both smelters are being analyzed.

Alumínio owns a 25.74% stake in Consórcio Machadinho, which is the owner of the Machadinho hydroelectric power plant located in southern Brazil. Alumínio’s share of the
plant’s output is supplied to the Poços de Caldas smelter, and is sufficient to cover 55% of its operating needs at full capacity.

Alumínio has a 42.18% interest in Energética Barra Grande S.A.(BAESA), which built the Barra Grande hydroelectric power plant in southern
Brazil. Alumínio’s share of the power generated by BAESA covers the remaining power needs of the Poços de Caldas smelter and a portion of the power needs of Alumínio’s interest in the Alumar smelter.

Alumínio also has 34.97% share in Serra do Facão in the southeast of Brazil, which began commercial generation in July 2010.
Alumínio’s share of the Serra do Facão output is currently being sold in the market. Starting April 1, 2014, when the existing contract with Eletronorte is terminated, this share of the power from Serra do Facao will supply
the Alumar smelter, replacing power currently being purchased from Eletronorte.

Alumínio is also participating in the Estreito
hydropower project in northern Brazil, holding a 25.49% share, which began commercial operations with its first turbine in 2011. Its eighth and last turbine became operational in March 2013. Aluminio’s share of the plant’s output is
supplied to the Alumar smelter which replaced the 160 MW Eletronorte power contract reduction on March 26, 2012.

With Machadinho, Barra
Grande, Serra do Facão and Estreito, Alumínio’s power self-sufficiency is approximately 70%, to meet a total energy demand of approximately 690 MW from Brazilian primary aluminum plants at full capacity.

Consortia in which Alumínio participates have received concessions for the Pai Querê hydropower project in southern Brazil
(Alumínio’s share is 35%). Development of this concession has not yet begun.

Europe – Electricity

Alcoa owns two smelters in Norway, Lista and Mosjøen, which have
long-term power arrangements in place that continue until the end of 2019.







Iceland – Electricity

Alcoa’s Fjarðaál smelter in eastern Iceland began operation in 2007. Central to those operations is a forty-year power contract under which Landsvirkjun, the Icelandic national power
company, built the Kárahnjúkar dam and hydropower project, and supplies competitively priced electricity to the smelter. In late 2009, Iceland imposed two new taxes on power intensive industries, both for a period of three years, from
2010 through 2012. One tax is based on energy consumption; the other is a pre-payment of certain other charges, and will be recoverable from 2013 through 2015. In 2012, Iceland extended the energy consumption tax though 2015.

Spain – Natural Gas

In order to facilitate the full conversion of the San Ciprian, Spain alumina refinery from fuel oil to natural gas, in October 2013, Alumina Española SA (AE) and Gas Natural Transporte SDG SL (GN)
signed a take or pay gas pipeline utilization agreement. Pursuant to that agreement, the ultimate shareholders of AE, Alcoa Inc. and Alumina Limited, have agreed to guarantee the payment of AE’s contracted gas pipeline utilization over the
four years of the commitment period in the event AE fails to do so, each shareholder being responsible for its respective proportionate share (i.e., 60/40). Such commitment will come into force six months after the gas pipeline is put into
operation by GN. It is expected that the gas pipeline will be completed by January 2015.

North America – Natural Gas

In order to supply its refinery and smelters in the U.S. and Canada, Alcoa generally procures natural gas on a competitive bid basis from
a variety of sources including producers in the gas production areas and independent gas marketers. For Alcoa’s larger consuming locations in Canada and the U.S., the gas commodity and the interstate pipeline transportation are procured to
provide increased flexibility and reliability. Contract pricing for gas is typically based on a published industry index or New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) price. The Company may choose to reduce its exposure to NYMEX pricing by hedging a
portion of required natural gas consumption.

Australia – Natural Gas

AofA holds a 20% equity interest in a consortium that bought the Dampier-to-Bunbury natural gas pipeline in October 2004. This pipeline transports gas
from the northwest gas fields to AofA’s alumina refineries and other users in the Southwest of Western Australia. AofA uses gas to co-generate steam and electricity for its alumina refining processes at the Kwinana, Pinjarra and Wagerup
refineries. More than 90% of AofA’s gas requirements for the remainder of the decade are secured under long-term contracts. AofA is considering multiple supply options to replace expiring contracts, including investing directly in projects that
have the potential to deliver cost-based gas.

Patents, Trade Secrets and Trademarks

The Company believes that its domestic and international patent, trade secret and trademark assets provide it with a significant competitive advantage.
The Company’s rights under its patents, as well as the products made and sold under them, are important to the Company as a whole and, to varying degrees, important to each business segment. The patents owned by Alcoa generally concern
particular products or manufacturing equipment or techniques. Alcoa’s business as a whole is not, however, materially dependent on any single patent, trade secret or trademark. As a result of product development and technological advancement,
the Company continues to pursue patent protection in jurisdictions throughout the world. At the end of 2013, the Company’s worldwide patent portfolio consisted of approximately 794 pending patent applications and 1,980 granted patents.

The Company has a number of trade secrets, mostly regarding manufacturing processes and material compositions that give many of its
businesses important advantages in their markets. The Company continues to strive to improve those processes and generate new material compositions that provide additional benefits.

The Company also has a number of domestic and international registered trademarks that have significant recognition within the
markets that are served. Examples include the name “Alcoa” and the Alcoa symbol for aluminum products, Howmet metal castings, Huck®fasteners, Kawneer®building
panels and Dura-Bright®wheels with easy-clean surface treatments. The Company’s rights under its
trademarks are important to the Company as a whole and, to varying degrees, important to each business segment.

Competitive Conditions

Alcoa is subject to highly competitive conditions in all aspects of its aluminum and non-aluminum businesses. Competitors include a
variety of both U.S. and non-U.S. companies in all major markets. Price, quality, and service are the principal competitive factors in Alcoa’s markets. Where aluminum products compete with other materials—such as steel and plastics for
automotive and building applications; magnesium, titanium, composites, and plastics for aerospace and defense applications—aluminum’s diverse characteristics, particularly its strength, light weight, recyclability, and flexibility are also
significant factors. For Alcoa’s segments that market products under Alcoa’s brand names, brand recognition, and brand loyalty also play a role. In addition Alcoa’s competitive position depends, in part, on the Company’s access
to an economical power supply to sustain its operations in various countries.

Research and Development

Alcoa, a light metals technology leader, engages in research and development programs that include process and product development, and basic and applied
research. Expenditures for research and development (R&D) activities were $192 million in 2013, $197 million in 2012, and $184 million in 2011.

Most of the major process areas within the Company have a Technology Management Review Board (TMRB) or Center of Excellence (CoE) consisting of members from various worldwide locations. Each TMRB or CoE
is responsible for formulating and communicating a technology strategy for the corresponding process area, developing and managing the technology portfolio and ensuring the global transfer of technology. Alternatively, certain business units conduct
these activities and research and development programs within the worldwide business unit, supported by the Alcoa Technical Center (ATC). Technical personnel from the TMRBs, ATC and such business units also participate in the corresponding Market
Sector Teams. In this manner, research and development activities are aligned with corporate and business unit goals.

During 2013, the
Company continued to work on new developments for a number of strategic projects in all business segments. In Primary Metals, progress was made on inert anode technology with tests carried out on a pilot scale. Progress has been successful in many
respects as a result of full pot testing of anode assemblies, although technical and cost targets remain to be achieved. If the technology proves to be commercially feasible, the Company believes that it would result in significant operating cost
savings, and generate environmental benefits by reducing certain emissions and eliminating carbon dioxide. No timetable has been established for commercial use. The Company is also







continuing to develop the carbothermic aluminum process, which is in the research and development phase. The technology holds the potential to produce aluminum at a lower cost, driven by reduced
conversion costs, lower energy requirements and lower emissions at a lower capital cost than traditional smelting.

The
Company continued its progress leveraging new science and technologies in 2013. For example, a new, higher strength wheel alloy (MagnaForce™) was developed for next generation wheels, as was the development and deployment of a more corrosion resistant, more environmentally friendly Dura-Bright EVO™surface treatment. In addition, the Company expects to launch in 2014 a commercial truck wheel using the MagnaForce™alloy.

A number of products were commercialized in 2013 including new fasteners, aluminum lithium (Al-Li) and more traditional 7xxx series alloys for various aerospace applications, numerous innovations in the
building and construction market for enhanced thermal performance and increased functionality. New, high strength foundry alloys are being tested at multiple automotive OEMs. The Company continues to develop its Micromill™technology and ran numerous customer trials in the RCS, automotive and packaging markets. The Company has also
continued to externally license technology including the A951 pretreatment technology, shaping technology, and
Colorkast™products for the consumer electronics segment. In addition, the Company licensed its natural
wastewater treatment technology to Bauer Resources GmbH in 2013.

Alcoa’s research and development focus is on product development to
support sustainable, profitable growth; manufacturing technologies to improve efficiencies and reduce costs; and environmental risk reductions. Environmental technologies continue to be an area of focus for the Company, with projects underway that
address emissions reductions, the reduction of spent pot lining, advanced recycling, and the beneficial use of bauxite residue.

Environmental Matters

Information relating to environmental matters is included in Note N to the Consolidated Financial Statements under the caption “Environmental
Matters” on pages 122-126. Approved capital expenditures for new or expanded facilities for environmental control are approximately $55 million for 2014 and $12 million for 2015.

Employees

Total worldwide employment at the end of 2013 was approximately 60,000
employees in 30 countries. About 40,000 of these employees are represented by labor unions. The Company believes that relations with its employees and any applicable union representatives generally are good.

In the U.S., approximately 9,500 employees are represented by various labor unions. The largest of these is the master collective bargaining agreement
between Alcoa and the United Steelworkers (USW). This agreement covers 10 locations and approximately 6,100 U.S. employees. It expires on May 15, 2014. The parties will negotiate in early May with the intent of reaching a new long-term
agreement. To the extent a new long-term agreement is not reached, a work stoppage at some of the 10 locations could begin on May 16, 2014. There are 16 other collective bargaining agreements in the U.S. with varying expiration dates. On a
regional basis, collective bargaining agreements with varying expiration dates cover approximately 16,500 employees in Europe and Russia, 11,800 employees in North America, 7,000 employees in Central and South America, 4,100 employees in Australia,
and 1,000 employees in China.
