Forward-Looking Statements

Overview

Alcoa is the world leader in the production and management of primary
aluminum, fabricated aluminum, and alumina combined, through its active and growing participation in all major aspects of the industry: technology, mining, refining, smelting, fabricating, and recycling. Aluminum is a commodity that is traded on the
London Metal Exchange (LME) and priced daily based on market supply and demand. Aluminum and alumina represent more than 80% of Alcoa’s revenues, and the price of aluminum influences the operating results of Alcoa. Nonaluminum products include
precision castings and aerospace and industrial fasteners. Alcoa’s products are used worldwide in aircraft, automobiles, commercial transportation, packaging, building and construction, oil and gas, defense, consumer electronics, and industrial
applications.

Alcoa is a global company operating in 31 countries. Based upon the country where the point of sale occurred, the U.S. and
Europe generated 49% and 27%, respectively, of Alcoa’s sales in 2011. In addition, Alcoa has investments and operating activities in, among others, Australia, Brazil, China, Guinea, Iceland, Russia, and Saudi Arabia, all of which







present opportunities for substantial growth. Governmental policies, laws and regulations, and other economic factors, including inflation and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and
interest rates, affect the results of operations in these countries.

Alcoa’s operations consist of four worldwide reportable segments:
Alumina, Primary Metals, Flat-Rolled Products, and Engineered Products and Solutions.

The following charts and related discussion of the company’s Bauxite Interests, Alumina Refining and Primary
Aluminum Facilities and Capacities, Flat-Rolled Products, Engineered Products and Solutions and Corporate Facilities provide additional description of Alcoa’s businesses. The Alumina segment primarily consists of a series of affiliated
operating entities referred to as Alcoa World Alumina and Chemicals (AWAC). Alcoa owns 60% and Alumina Limited owns 40% of these individual entities. For more information on AWAC, see Exhibit Nos. 10(a) through 10(f)(1) to this report.







Bauxite Interests

Aluminum is one of the most plentiful elements in the earth’s crust. Aluminum is produced primarily from bauxite, an ore containing aluminum in the form of aluminum oxide, commonly referred to as
alumina. Aluminum is made by extracting alumina from bauxite and then removing oxygen from the alumina. Alcoa processes most of the bauxite that it mines into alumina. The company obtains bauxite from its own resources and from those belonging to
the AWAC enterprise, located in the countries listed in the chart below, as well as pursuant to both long-term and short-term contracts and mining leases. In 2011, Alcoa consumed 43.0 million metric tons (mt) of bauxite from AWAC and its own
resources, 6.4 million mt from related third parties and 1.1 million mt from unrelated third parties. Alcoa’s present sources of bauxite are sufficient to meet the forecasted requirements of its alumina refining operations for the
foreseeable future. The following table provides information regarding the company’s bauxite interests:

1Alcoa also has interests at the following locations that are bauxite resources which do not currently produce bauxite: Cape Bougainville and Mitchell
Plateau in Australia; Az Zabirah in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (currently scheduled for completion in 2014 and initially expected to produce 4 million mtpy); and Brownsberg, Coermotibo DS, Lely Mountains, and Nassau, all in eastern Suriname.



2This entity is part of the AWAC group of companies and is owned 60% by Alcoa and 40% by Alumina Limited.



3Alumínio is owned 100% by Alcoa.



4Brazilian mineral legislation does not establish the duration of mining concessions. The concession remains in force until the exhaustion of the
deposit. The company estimates that (i) the concessions at Poços de Caldas will last at least until 2020, (ii) the concessions at Trombetas will last until 2046 and (iii) the concessions at Juruti will last until 2100.
Depending, however, on actual and future needs, the rate at which the deposits are explored and government approval is obtained, the concessions may be extended to (or expire at) a later (or an earlier) date.



5Alumínio holds an 8.58% total interest, Alcoa World Alumina Brasil Ltda. (formerly Abalco S.A., which merged with Alcoa World Alumina Brasil
Ltda. in December 2008) (AWA Brasil) holds a 4.62% total interest and Alcoa World Alumina LLC (AWA LLC) holds a 5% total interest in MRN. AWA Brasil and AWA LLC are both part of the AWAC group of companies and are owned 60% by Alcoa and 40% by
Alumina Limited. MRN is jointly owned with affiliates of Rio Tinto Alcan Inc., Companhia Brasileira de Alumínio, Companhia Vale do Rio Doce, BHP Billiton Plc (BHP







Billiton) and Norsk Hydro. Alumínio, AWA Brasil, and AWA LLC purchase bauxite from MRN under long-term supply contracts.



6In September 2009, development of a new bauxite mine was completed in Juruti, state of Para in northern Brazil. The mine is fully operational and
produced 2.6 million mt in 2010 and 3.8 million mt in 2011. In 2012 production is expected to rise to 4.4 million mt.



7AWA LLC owns a 45% interest in Halco (Mining), Inc. Halco owns 100% of Boké Investment Company, a Delaware company, which owns 51% of CBG. The
Guinean Government owns 49% of CBG, which has the exclusive right through 2038 to develop and mine bauxite in certain areas within a 10,000 square-mile concession in northwestern Guinea.



8AWA LLC has a bauxite purchase contract with CBG that will provide Alcoa with bauxite through 2013.



9Clarendon Alumina Production Ltd. is wholly-owned by the Government of Jamaica.



10AWA LLC owns 100% of N.V. Alcoa Minerals of Suriname (AMS). AWA LLC is part of the AWAC group of companies and is owned 60% by Alcoa and 40% by Alumina
Limited.



11Subject to Suriname government approval of a pending five-year extension request, mining rights at Caramacca will expire this operating year 2012.
Rights at the remaining Suriname locations all extend until 2033. It is likely that all Suriname current bauxite resources will be exhausted within the next several years. Alcoa is actively exploring and evaluating alternative sources of bauxite in
Suriname. Approximately 1.6 million mt of bauxite was added to the reserves in 2011 from greenfield exploration in the current concession, and the development of the Nassau Plateau bauxite is entering its final phase.

Kingdom of Saudi Arabia Joint Venture

In December 2009, Alcoa and Saudi Arabian Mining Company (Ma’aden) entered into an agreement setting forth the terms of a joint venture between them to develop a fully integrated aluminum complex in
the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. In its initial phases, the complex will include a bauxite mine with an initial capacity of 4 million mtpy; an alumina refinery with an initial capacity of 1.8 million mtpy; an aluminum smelter with an initial
capacity of ingot, slab and billet of 740,000 mtpy; and a rolling mill with initial capacity of 380,000 mtpy. The mill is expected to focus initially on the production of sheet, end and tab stock for the manufacture of aluminum cans, and potentially
other products to serve the construction, automotive, and other industries.

The refinery, smelter and rolling mill will be established within
the new industrial zone of Ras Al Khair (formerly Ras Az Zawr) on the east coast of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. First production from the aluminum smelter and rolling mill is anticipated in 2013, and first production from the mine and refinery is
expected in 2014.

Total capital investment is expected to be approximately $10.8 billion (SAR 40.5 billion). Ma’aden owns a 74.9%
interest in the joint venture. Alcoa owns a 25.1% interest in the smelter and rolling mill, with the AWAC group having a 25.1% interest in the mine and refinery. For additional information regarding the joint venture, see the Equity Investments
section of Note I to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8. (Financial Statements and Supplementary Data).

8In May 2009, the Suralco alumina refinery announced curtailment of 870,000 mtpy. The decision was made to protect the long-term viability of the
industry in Suriname. The curtailment was aimed at deferring further bauxite extraction until additional in-country bauxite resources are developed and market conditions for alumina improve. The refinery currently has approximately 793,000 mtpy of
idle capacity.



9Reductions in production at Point Comfort resulted mostly from the effects of curtailments initiated in late 2008 through early 2009, as a result of
overall market conditions. The reductions included curtailments of approximately 1,500,000 mtpy. Of that original amount, 384,000 mtpy remain curtailed.

As noted above, Alcoa and Ma’aden entered into an agreement that involves the development of an alumina refinery in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Initial capacity of the refinery is expected to be
1.8 million mtpy. First production is expected in 2014. For additional information regarding the joint venture, see the Equity Investments section of Note I to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8. (Financial Statements
and Supplementary Data).







The 2.1 million mtpy expansion of the Alumar consortium alumina refinery in São Luís,
Maranhão, completed by the end of 2009, has increased the refinery’s nameplate capacity to approximately 3.5 million mtpy, with Alcoa’s share of such capacity more than doubling to 1.89 million mtpy based on its 54%
ownership stake through Alumínio and AWAC.

In November 2005, Alcoa World Alumina LLC (AWA LLC) and Rio Tinto Alcan Inc. signed a Basic
Agreement with the Government of Guinea that sets forth the framework for development of a 1.5 million mtpy alumina refinery in Guinea. In 2006, the Basic Agreement was approved by the Guinean National Assembly and was promulgated into law. The
Basic Agreement was originally set to expire in November 2008, but has been extended to November 2012. Pre-feasibility studies were completed in 2008. Additional feasibility study work was completed in 2011, and further activities are planned for
2012.

In September 2006, Alcoa received environmental approval from the Government of Western Australia for expansion of the Wagerup alumina
refinery to a maximum capacity of 4.7 million mtpy, a potential increase of over 2 million mtpy. This approval has a term of 5 years and included environmental conditions that must be satisfied before Alcoa can seek construction approval for the
project. The project was suspended in November 2008 due to global economic conditions and the unavailability of a secure long-term energy supply in Western Australia. These constraints continue and as such the project remains under suspension. Alcoa
is therefore seeking an extension of the 2006 environmental approval for the expansion for a further 5 years, with a formal determination expected in spring of 2012.

In 2008, AWAC signed a cooperation agreement with Vietnam National Coal-Minerals Industries Group (Vinacomin) in which they agreed to conduct a joint feasibility study of the Gia Nghia bauxite mine and
alumina refinery project located in Dak Nong Province in Vietnam’s Central Highlands, with first stage capacity expected to be between 1.0 and 1.5 million mtpy. The cooperation between AWAC and Vinacomin on Gia Nghia is subject to approval
by the Government of Vietnam. If established, the Gia Nghia venture is expected to be 51% owned by Vinacomin, 40% by AWAC and 9% by others.

7In May 2010, Alcoa and the Italian Government agreed to a temporary curtailment of the Fusina smelter. As of June 30, 2010, the Fusina smelter was
fully curtailed. Additionally, in January 2012, as part of a restructuring of Alcoa’s global smelting system, Alcoa announced that it has decided to curtail operations at the Portovesme smelter during the first half of 2012. This action may
lead to the permanent closure of the Portovesme smelter.



8In January 2012, Alcoa announced that it will be temporarily idling a portion of the smelters in Avilés and La Coruña. The company
intends for this to be completed within the first half of 2012. Avilés and La Coruna will both be operating at approximately 50% of capacity.



9All production at the Tennessee smelter was idled in March 2009 due to economic conditions. In January 2012, Alcoa announced that it will permanently
shut down and demolish this facility as part of a larger strategy to improve its cost position and competitiveness.



10Between June and November 2008, three of Rockdale’s six potlines were idled as a result of uneconomical power prices. The remaining three
operating lines were idled in November 2008 due to uncompetitive power supply and overall market conditions. In January 2012, Alcoa announced that it will permanently shut down and demolish two of the six idled potlines as part of a larger strategy
to improve its cost position and competitiveness.



11Approximately half of one potline at the Intalco smelter remains idled, or approximately 47,000 mtpy.



12One potline at the Wenatchee smelter remains idled, or approximately 41,000 mtpy.

As of December 31, 2011, Alcoa had approximately 644,000 mtpy of idle capacity against total Alcoa Consolidated Capacity of 4,518,000 mtpy. These
figures are prior to any changes noted above regarding Rockdale, Tennessee, Avilés, Portovesme and La Coruña.

In January
2011, Alcoa and the China Power Investment Corporation (CPI) signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) to collaborate on a broad range of aluminum and energy projects in China and other locations. The projects under consideration may range from
mining, refining, smelting, aluminum fabrication to collaboration on energy projects. In September 2011, Alcoa and CPI signed a Letter of Intent that provides a framework for the creation of a joint venture, which will focus on producing
high-end fabricated aluminum products in China and leverage Alcoa’s and CPI’s existing footprint and capabilities. The new joint venture will target growth opportunities in the Chinese automotive, aerospace, packaging and consumer
electronics markets.

As noted above, at the end of 2009 Alcoa and Ma’aden entered into an agreement that involves development of an
aluminum smelter in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. In 2010, the joint venture entity, Ma’aden Aluminium Company signed project financing and broke ground on the construction of the smelter. The smelter is expected to have an initial capacity of
ingot, slab and billet of 740,000 mtpy. First production is expected in 2013.

In 2006, Alcoa and the Government of Iceland, together with the
National Power Company (Landsvirkjun) and the National Transmission Company (Landsnet) began detailed feasibility studies for the development of a 250,000 mtpy aluminum smelter at Bakki near Húsavík in north Iceland. In October
2011, Alcoa informed the Government of Iceland, Landsvirkjun and Landsnet that the power availability and proposed pricing would not support an aluminum smelter, and that the project would not continue.

In December 2008, Alcoa and the Brunei Economic Development Board agreed to further extend an existing MOU to enable more detailed studies into the
feasibility of establishing a modern, gas-powered aluminum smelter in Brunei Darussalam. The MOU extends a memorandum signed originally in 2003. Phase one of the feasibility study will determine scope and dimensions of the proposed facility,
power-delivery strategy, location, as well as an associated port and infrastructure. At completion of phase one, the parties will determine whether a more detailed phase two study







is warranted. If completed, it is expected that the smelter would have an initial operating capacity of 360,000 mtpy with the potential for future increase. In 2011, the MOU was further extended
to enable determination of feasibility.

In 2007, Alcoa and Greenland Home Rule Government entered into an MOU regarding cooperation on a
feasibility study for an aluminum smelter with a 360,000 mtpy capacity in Greenland. The MOU also encompasses a hydroelectric power system and related infrastructure improvements, including a port. In 2008, Greenland’s parliament allocated
funding to support the second phase of joint studies with Alcoa and endorsed that the smelter be located at Maniitsoq. In 2010, Alcoa and the Greenland Home Rule Government revised the completion dates for feasibility studies associated with
development of the proposed integrated hydro system and aluminum smelter at Maniitsoq to enable more detailed consideration of aspects of the project related to construction and provision of energy and to allow the Greenland parliament sufficient
time to deliberate and vote on critical aspects of national legislation concerning the project. The feasibility studies were completed in the fourth quarter of 2011. A Greenland Parliamentary vote to allow continued studies for construction and
provision of energy is scheduled for late 2012.

In the fourth quarter of 2011, Alcoa and the Government of Angola, through the ministries of
Energy, Water & Geology, Mines and Industry, entered into an exclusive MOU regarding cooperation on a feasibility study for an aluminum smelter in Angola with a 720,000 mtpy capacity. The MOU also encompasses a hydroelectric power system
and power transmission facilities to be built by the Government and resulting long term purchase power agreement.

Flat-Rolled Products
Facilities

The principal business of the company’s Flat-Rolled Products segment is the production and sale of aluminum plate,
sheet and foil. This segment includes rigid container sheet, which is sold directly to customers in the packaging and consumer market. This segment also includes sheet and plate used in the aerospace, automotive, commercial transportation, and
building and construction markets.

As noted above, Alcoa and Ma’aden entered into an agreement that involves development of a rolling
mill in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. In 2010, the joint venture entity, Ma’aden Rolling Company signed project financing for its rolling mill and broke ground on the construction of the mill. Initial capacity is approximately 380,000 mtpy.
First production is expected in 2013.

As discussed above, in 2011, Alcoa and the CPI signed an MOU followed by a Letter of Intent that
provides a framework for the creation of a joint venture which includes a focus on producing high-end fabricated aluminum products in China. This venture will leverage Alcoa’s and CPI’s existing footprint and capabilities.

Although the company completed the sale of substantially all of its Global Foil Business in 2009, the company continues to manufacture foil for the
end-user market in Itapissuma, Brazil.

Generally, other materials are purchased from third party suppliers under competitively-priced supply contracts or
bidding arrangements. The company believes that the raw materials necessary to its business are and will continue to be available.

Energy

Employing the Bayer
process, Alcoa refines alumina from bauxite ore. Alcoa then produces aluminum from the alumina by an electrolytic process requiring large amounts of electric power. Energy and electricity account for







approximately 25% of the company’s total alumina refining production costs. Electric power accounts for approximately 26% of the company’s primary aluminum production costs. Alcoa
generates approximately 22% of the power used at its smelters worldwide and generally purchases the remainder under long-term arrangements. The paragraphs below summarize the sources of power and the long-term power arrangements for Alcoa’s
smelters and refineries.

North America – Electricity

The Deschambault, Baie Comeau, and Bécancour smelters in Québec purchase electricity under existing contracts that run through 2015, which will be followed by long-term contracts with
Hydro-Québec first executed in December 2008, revised in 2011 and expiring in 2040, provided that Alcoa completes the modernization of the Baie Comeau smelter by early 2016. The smelter located in Baie Comeau, Québec has historically
purchased approximately 65% of its power needs under the Hydro-Québec contract, receiving the remainder from a 40% owned hydroelectric generating company, Manicouagan Power Limited Partnership (MPLP). Beginning on January 1, 2011, these
percentages changed such that approximately 80% is sourced from Hydro-Québec, with the remaining 20% from MPLP.

The company’s
wholly-owned subsidiary, Alcoa Power Generating Inc. (APGI), generates approximately 38% of the power requirements for Alcoa’s smelters operating in the U.S. The company generally purchases the remainder under long-term contracts. APGI owns and
operates two hydroelectric projects, Tapoco and Yadkin, consisting of eight dams.

New power contracts with Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA)
were executed in June 2011 replacing the previous contracts which were set to expire on June 30, 2011. These three-year contracts cover the sale of APGI Tapoco energy, capacity and renewable energy credits to TVA and the purchase of
supplemental energy from TVA to assist APGI in serving Tennessee’s rolling operations. APGI also executed an Interconnection Agreement, a Hydro-Coordination Agreement and a Reliability Coordination Agreement pursuant to the unbundling of
previous APGI and TVA agreements which provided for coordinated operation of the hydroelectric and transmission facilities owned by TVA and APGI, as well as the sale of power between APGI and TVA. As part of its long term goal of lowering
Alcoa’s position on the world aluminum production cost curve, in January of 2012, Alcoa announced the permanent closure of its Alcoa, Tennessee smelter, which has been curtailed since 2009. Demolition and remediation activities related to these
actions will begin in the first half of 2012 and are expected to be completed in 2015.

APGI generates
substantially all of the power used at the company’s Warrick smelter using nearby coal reserves. Since May 2005, Alcoa has owned the nearby Friendsville, Illinois coal reserves, with the mine being operated by Vigo Coal Company, Inc. The mine
is producing approximately one million tons of coal per year. In June 2011, the Red Brush West Mine, owned by Alcoa and operated by Vigo Coal, was opened and will produce approximately 60,000 tons per month over an eighteen-month period. In 2011,
the two owned mines provided approximately 61% of the Warrick power plant’s requirements. The balance of the coal used is purchased principally from local Illinois Basin coal producers pursuant to term contracts of varying duration.







In the northwest, Alcoa operated under a contract with Chelan County Public Utility District (Chelan PUD)
located in the State of Washington that was sufficient to supply about half of the capacity of the Wenatchee smelter through October 2011. In November 2011, a new contract executed between Alcoa and Chelan PUD became effective, under which Alcoa
receives approximately 26% of the hydropower output of Chelan PUD’s Rocky Reach and Rock Island dams, which will continue to supply about half of the capacity of the Wenatchee smelter.

Following the invalidation by the 9thCircuit Court of Appeals of the 2006-2011 contract with the Bonneville Power Administration (BPA) under which Alcoa
was receiving financial benefits to reduce the cost of power purchased from the market to partially operate the Intalco smelter, Alcoa and BPA signed a new contract providing for the sale of physical power at the Northwest Power Act mandated
industrial firm power (IP) rate, for the period from December 22, 2009 – May 26, 2011 (17 months). That “initial period” has been extended through May 26, 2012. The contract also contains a provision for a five-year
extension if certain financial tests can be met.

In the northeast, the purchased power contracts for both the Massena East and Massena West smelters in New York expire December 31, 2013, subject to their terms and conditions. In December 2007,
Alcoa and The New York Power Authority (NYPA) reached agreement in principle on a new energy contract to supply the Massena East and Massena West smelters for 30 years, beginning on January 1, 2014, following an amendment in January 2011. The
definitive agreement implementing this arrangement became effective February 24, 2009. A subsequent amendment, providing Alcoa additional time to complete the design and engineering work for its Massena East modernization plan, and providing
for the return of 256 megawatts (MW) of power to NYPA while Massena East was idled, was entered into effective April 16, 2009 and was superseded by the January 2011 amendment. Implementation of the Massena East modernization plan is subject to
further approval of the Alcoa Board of Directors. Alcoa restarted production at Massena East in the first quarter of 2011.

The Mt. Holly
smelter in South Carolina purchases electricity from Santee Cooper under a contract that was amended and restated in 2010, and expires December 31, 2015. The contract includes a provision for follow-on service at the then current rate schedule
for industrial customers.

Australia – Electricity

Power is generated from extensive brown coal deposits covered by a long-term mineral lease held by Alcoa of Australia Limited (AofA), and that power currently provides approximately 40% of the electricity
for the company’s smelter in Point Henry, Victoria. The State Electricity Commission of Victoria provides the remaining power for this smelter, and all power for the Portland smelter, under contracts with AofA and Eastern Aluminium (Portland)
Pty Ltd,







a wholly-owned subsidiary of AofA, in respect of its interest in Portland, that extend to 2014 and 2016, respectively. Upon the expiry of these contracts both smelters will purchase power from
the Australian National Energy Market (NEM) variable spot market. In March 2010, AofA and Eastern Aluminium (Portland) Pty Ltd (in respect of the Portland Smelter only) separately entered into fixed for floating swap contracts with Loy Yang Power in
order to manage exposure to variable energy rates from the NEM from the date of expiry of the current contracts with the State Electricity Commission of Victoria until December 2036.

Brazil – Electricity

The Alumar smelter is supplied by Eletronorte (Centrais Elétricas do Norte do Brasil S.A.) under a long-term power purchase agreement expiring in December 2024. Eletronorte has supplied the Alumar
smelter from the beginning of its operations in 1984. Since 2006, Alcoa Alumínio S.A.’s (Alumínio) remaining power needs for the smelter are supplied from self-generated energy. Beginning in March 2012, the Eletronorte supply will
be reduced by the amount of 160 MW that will be supplied through power self-generation.

Alumínio owns a 30.99% stake in Maesa –
Machadinho Energética S.A., which is the owner of 83.06% of the Machadinho hydroelectric power plant located in southern Brazil. Alumínio’s share of the plant’s output is supplied to the Poços de Caldas smelter, and is
sufficient to cover 55% of its operating needs.

Alumínio has a 42.18% interest in Energética Barra Grande S.A. – BAESA,
which built the Barra Grande hydroelectric power plant in southern Brazil. Alumínio’s share of the power generated by BAESA covers the remaining power needs of the Poços de Caldas smelter and, as noted above, a portion of the
power needs of Alumínio’s interest in the Alumar smelter.

Alumínio also has 34.97% share in Serra do Facão in the
southeast of Brazil, which began commercial generation in August 2010. Alumínio’s share of the Serra do Facão output is currently being sold in the market.

Alumínio is also participating in the Estreito hydropower project in northern Brazil, holding a 25.49% share. Four out of its eight generation units began commercial operation in 2011. The
remaining four generation units are expected to begin commercial operation in 2012.

With Machadinho, Barra Grande, Serra do Facão and
Estreito, Alumínio’s current power self-sufficiency is approximately 65%, to meet a total energy demand of approximately 690 MW from Brazilian primary aluminum plants.

From March 26, 2012, Estreito power will supply the Alumar smelter replacing 160MW of power under the Eletronorte contract, reducing it from 423MW to 263MW. Power from Serra do Facão will also
replace Eletronorte starting January 1, 2014. Until then, power from Serra do Facão will be sold externally.

Consortia in which
Alumínio participates have received concessions for the Pai Querê hydropower project in southern Brazil (Alumínio’s share is 35%) and the Santa Isabel hydropower project in northern Brazil (Alumínio’s share is
20%). Development of these concessions has not yet begun.

Europe – Electricity

Until December 31, 2005, the company purchased electricity for its smelters at Portovesme and Fusina, Italy under a power supply structure approved
by the European Commission (EC) in 1996. That measure provided a competitive power supply to the primary aluminum industry and was not considered state aid from the Italian Government. In 2005, Italy granted an extension of the regulated electricity
tariff that was in force until December 31, 2005 through November 19, 2009. (The extension was originally through 2010, but the date was changed by legislation adopted by the Italian Parliament effective on August 15, 2009.) In July
2006, the EC announced that it had opened an investigation to establish whether the extension of the regulated electricity tariff granted by Italy complied with







In March 2009, Alcoa and Orkla ASA exchanged respective stakes in the Sapa AB and Elkem Aluminium ANS companies. Pursuant to the exchange, Alcoa assumed
100% ownership of the two smelters in Norway, Lista and Mosjøen, at the end of the first quarter of 2009. These smelters have long-term power arrangements in place which continue until at least 2019.

Iceland – Electricity

Alcoa’s Fjarðaál smelter in eastern Iceland began operation in 2007. Central to those operations is a 40-year power contract under which Landsvirkjun, the Icelandic national power company,
built the Kárahnjúkar dam and hydro-power project, and supplies competitively priced electricity to the smelter. In late 2009, Iceland imposed two new taxes on power intensive industries, both for a period of three years, from 2010
through 2012. One tax is based on energy consumption; the other is a pre-payment of certain other charges, and will be recoverable from 2013 through 2015.

North America – Natural Gas

In order to supply its refineries and smelters in the
U.S. and Canada, Alcoa generally procures natural gas on a competitive bid basis from a variety of sources including producers in the gas production areas and independent gas marketers. For Alcoa’s larger consuming locations in Canada and the
U.S., the gas commodity and the interstate







pipeline transportation are procured to provide increased flexibility and reliability. Contract pricing for gas is typically based on a published industry index or New York Mercantile Exchange
(NYMEX) price. The company may choose to reduce its exposure to NYMEX pricing by hedging a portion of required natural gas consumption.

Australia – Natural Gas

Alcoa of Australia (AofA) holds a 20% equity interest in a
consortium that bought the Dampier-to-Bunbury natural gas pipeline in October 2004. This pipeline transports gas from the northwest gas fields to Alcoa’s alumina refineries and other users in the Southwest of Western Australia. AofA uses gas to
co-generate steam and electricity for its alumina refining processes at the Kwinana, Pinjarra and Wagerup refineries. Approximately 85% of AofA’s gas supplies are under long-term contract out to 2020. AofA is progressing multiple supply
options to replace expiring contracts, including investing directly in projects that have the potential to deliver cost-based gas.

Patents, Trade Secrets and Trademarks

The company believes that its domestic and international patent, trade secret and trademark assets provide it with a significant competitive advantage. The company’s rights under its patents, as well
as the products made and sold under them, are important to the company as a whole and, to varying degrees, important to each business segment. The patents owned by Alcoa generally concern particular products or manufacturing equipment or techniques.
Alcoa’s business as a whole is not, however, materially dependent on any single patent, trade secret or trademark.

The company has a
number of trade secrets, mostly regarding manufacturing processes and material compositions that give many of its businesses important advantages in their markets. The company continues to strive to improve those processes and generate new material
compositions that provide additional benefits.

The company also has a number of domestic and international registered
trademarks that have significant recognition within the markets that are served. Examples include the name “Alcoa” and the Alcoa symbol for aluminum products, Howmet metal castings, Huck®fasteners, Kawneer®building
panels and Dura-Bright®wheels with easy-clean surface treatments. The company’s rights under its
trademarks are important to the company as a whole and, to varying degrees, important to each business segment.

Competitive Conditions

Alcoa is subject to highly competitive conditions in all aspects of its aluminum and non-aluminum businesses. Competitors include a
variety of both U.S. and non-U.S. companies in all major markets. Price, quality, and service are the principal competitive factors in Alcoa’s markets. Where aluminum products compete with other materials – such as steel and plastics for
automotive and building applications; magnesium, titanium, composites, and plastics for aerospace and defense applications – aluminum’s diverse characteristics, particularly its light weight, recyclability, and flexibility are also
significant factors. For Alcoa’s segments that market products under Alcoa’s brand names, brand recognition, and brand loyalty also play a role. In addition Alcoa’s competitive position depends, in part, on the company’s access
to an economical power supply to sustain its operations in various countries.

Research and Development

Alcoa, a technology leader in the aluminum industry, engages in research and development programs that include process and product development, and basic
and applied research. Expenditures for research and development (R&D) activities were $184 million in 2011, $174 million in 2010, and $169 million in 2009.

Most of the major process areas within the company have a Technology Management Review Board (TMRB) or Center of Excellence (CoE) consisting of members from various worldwide locations. Each TMRB or CoE
is responsible for formulating and communicating a technology strategy for the corresponding process area, developing and managing the technology portfolio and ensuring the global transfer of technology. Alternatively, certain business







units conduct these activities and research and development programs within the worldwide business unit, supported by the Alcoa Technical Center (ATC). Technical personnel from the TMRBs, ATC and
such business units also participate in the corresponding Market Sector Teams. In this manner, research and development activities are aligned with corporate and business unit goals.

During 2011, the company continued to work on new developments for a number of strategic projects in all business segments. In Primary Metals, progress was made on inert anode technology with tests
carried out on a pilot scale. Progress has been successful in many respects as a result of full pot testing of anode assemblies, although there remain technical and cost targets to achieve. If the technology proves to be commercially feasible, the
company believes that it would result in significant operating cost savings, and generate environmental benefits by reducing certain emissions and eliminating carbon dioxide. No timetable has been established for commercial use. The company is also
continuing to develop the carbothermic aluminum process, which is in the research and development phase. The technology holds the potential to produce aluminum at a lower cost, driven by reduced conversion costs, lower energy requirements and
lower emissions at a lower capital cost than traditional smelting.

The company continued its progress leveraging new science and technologies
in 2011. For example, riblets that reduce aerodynamic drag have been analyzed and produced on a test basis. Self-cleaning nano coatings have been demonstrated on building products (an example of such was commercialized in 2011 as EcoClean, which is
the world’s first coil-coated aluminum architectural panel that helps clean itself and the air around it). Energy saving sensing devices are being integrated in company manufacturing plants. Integrated thermal management products for consumer
electronics have been developed and are being validated by our customers.

A number of products were commercialized in
2011 including new fasteners, new aerospace alloy products for reducing structural weight, cost and production risk, self-cleaning EcoClean®coated building panels, and new armor plate alloy solutions. The company continues to develop its Micromill™ technology. Scale-up to full commercial width
has been successful. Product development continues, and commercialization has commenced. In addition, previously developed products such as Alcoa’s LvL ONE®wide base aluminum wheel continue to receive accolades, such as being selected as a “Top 5” Product of 2010 byHeavy Duty Aftermarket Journal.

Alcoa’s research and development focus is on product development to support sustainable, profitable growth; manufacturing technologies
to improve efficiencies and reduce costs; and on environmental risk reductions. Environmental technologies continue to be an area of focus for the company, with projects underway that address emissions reductions, the reduction of spent pot lining,
advanced recycling, and the beneficial use of bauxite residue.

As a result of product development and technological advancement, the company
continues to pursue patent protection in jurisdictions throughout the world. At the end of 2011, the company’s worldwide patent portfolio consisted of 870 pending patent applications and 1,895 granted patents.

Environmental Matters

Information relating to environmental matters is included in Note N to the Consolidated Financial Statements under the caption “Environmental
Matters” on pages 114-117.

Employees

Total worldwide employment at the end of 2011 was approximately 61,000 employees in 31 countries. About 31,000 of these employees are represented by labor unions. The company believes that relations with
its employees and any applicable union representatives generally are good.

In the U.S., approximately 9,500 employees are represented by
various labor unions. The largest of these is the master collective bargaining agreement between Alcoa and the United Steelworkers (USW). This agreement covers 10 locations and approximately 6,100 U.S. employees. It expires on May 15, 2014.
There are 16 other collective







bargaining agreements in the U.S. with varying expiration dates. Collective bargaining agreements with varying expiration dates also cover about 6,300 employees in Europe, 3,900 employees in
Russia, 4,000 employees in Central and South America, 3,800 employees in Australia, 1,100 employees in China and 2,200 employees in Canada.
