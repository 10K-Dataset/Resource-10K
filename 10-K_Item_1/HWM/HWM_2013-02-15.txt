Forward-Looking Statements

Overview

Alcoa is the world leader in the production and management of primary
aluminum, fabricated aluminum, and alumina combined, through its active and growing participation in all major aspects of the industry: technology, mining, refining, smelting, fabricating, and recycling. Aluminum is a commodity that is traded on the
London Metal Exchange (LME) and priced daily. Aluminum and alumina represent more than 80% of Alcoa’s revenues, and the price of aluminum influences the operating results of Alcoa. Non-aluminum products include precision castings and aerospace
and industrial fasteners. Alcoa’s products are used worldwide in aircraft, automobiles, commercial transportation, packaging, building and construction, oil and gas, defense, consumer electronics, and industrial applications.

Alcoa is a global company operating in 30 countries. Based upon the country where the sale occurred, the U.S. and Europe generated 52% and 25%,
respectively, of Alcoa’s sales in 2012. In addition, Alcoa has investments and operating activities in, among others, Australia, Brazil, China, Guinea, Iceland, Russia, and the Kingdom of Saudi







Arabia, all of which present opportunities for substantial growth. Governmental policies, laws and regulations, and other economic factors, including inflation and fluctuations in foreign
currency exchange rates and interest rates, affect the results of operations in these countries.

Alcoa’s operations consist of four
worldwide reportable segments: Alumina, Primary Metals, Global Rolled Products, and Engineered Products and Solutions.

The following tables and related discussion of the Company’s Bauxite Interests, Alumina Refining and Primary
Aluminum Facilities and Capacities, Global Rolled Products, Engineered Products and Solutions and Corporate Facilities provide additional description of Alcoa’s businesses. The Alumina segment primarily consists of a series of affiliated
operating entities referred to as Alcoa World Alumina and Chemicals (AWAC). Alcoa owns 60% and Alumina Limited owns 40% of these individual entities. For more information on AWAC, see Exhibit Nos. 10(a) through 10(f)(1) to this report.

Bauxite Interests

Aluminum is
one of the most plentiful elements in the earth’s crust and is produced primarily from bauxite, an ore containing aluminum in the form of aluminum oxide, commonly referred to as alumina. Aluminum is made by extracting alumina from bauxite and
then removing oxygen from the alumina. Alcoa processes most of the bauxite that it mines into alumina. The Company obtains bauxite from its own resources and from those belonging to the AWAC enterprise, located in the countries listed in the table
below, as well as pursuant to both long-term and short-term contracts and mining leases. In 2012, Alcoa consumed 45 million metric tons (mt) of bauxite from AWAC and its own resources, 7.1 million mt from related third parties and
1.1 million mt from unrelated third parties. Tons of bauxite are reported as bone dry metric tons (bdmt) unless otherwise stated. See the glossary of bauxite mining related terms at the end of this section.

The Company has access to large bauxite deposit areas with mining rights that extend in most cases more than 20 years from today. For purposes of
evaluating the amount of bauxite that will be available to supply as feedstock to its refineries, the Company considers both estimates of bauxite resources as well as calculated bauxite reserves. Bauxite resources represent deposits for which
tonnage, densities, shape, physical characteristics, grade and mineral content can be estimated with a reasonable level of confidence based on the amount of exploration sampling and testing







information gathered through appropriate techniques from locations such as outcrops, trenches, pits, workings and drill holes. Bauxite reserves represent the economically mineable part of
resource deposits, and include diluting materials and allowances for losses, which may occur when the material is mined. Appropriate assessments and studies have been carried out to define the reserves, and include consideration of and modification
by realistically assumed mining, metallurgical, economic, marketing, legal, environmental, social and governmental factors. Alcoa employs a conventional approach (including additional drilling with successive tightening of the drill grid) with
customized techniques to define and characterize its various bauxite deposit types allowing Alcoa to confidently establish the extent of its bauxite resources and their ultimate conversion to reserves.

The table below only includes the amount of proven and probable reserves controlled by the Company. While the level of reserves may appear low in
relation to annual production levels, they are consistent with historical levels of reserves for our mining locations. Given the Company’s extensive bauxite resources, the abundant supply of bauxite globally and the length of the Company’s
rights to bauxite, it is not cost-effective to invest the significant resources necessary to establish bauxite reserves that reflect the total size of the bauxite resources available to the Company. Rather, bauxite resources are upgraded annually to
reserves as needed by the location. Detailed assessments are progressively undertaken within a proposed mining area and mine activity is then planned to achieve a uniform quality in the supply of blended feedstock to the relevant refinery. Alcoa
believes its present sources of bauxite on a global basis are sufficient to meet the forecasted requirements of its alumina refining operations for the foreseeable future.

Bauxite Resource Development Guidelines

Alcoa has developed best practice guidelines for
bauxite reserve and resource classification at its operating bauxite mines. Alcoa’s reserves are declared in accordance with Alcoa’s internal guidelines as administered by the Alcoa Ore Reserve Committee (AORC). The reported ore reserves
set forth in the table below are those that Alcoa estimates could be extracted economically with current technology and in current market conditions. Alcoa does not use a price for bauxite, alumina, or aluminum to determine its bauxite reserves. The
primary criteria for determining bauxite reserves are the feed specifications required by the customer alumina refinery. In addition to these specifications, a number of modifying factors have been applied to differentiate bauxite reserves from
other mineralized material. Alcoa mining locations have annual in-fill drilling programs designed to progressively upgrade the reserve classification of their bauxite.

2This entity is part of the AWAC group of companies and is owned 60% by Alcoa and 40% by Alumina Limited.



3Alumínio is owned 100% by Alcoa.



4Brazilian mineral legislation does not establish the duration of mining concessions. The concession remains in force until the exhaustion of the
deposit. The Company estimates that (i) the concessions at Poços de Caldas will last at least until 2020, (ii) the concessions at Trombetas will last until 2046 and (iii) the concessions at Juruti will last until 2100.
Depending, however, on actual and future needs, the rate at which the deposits are exploited and government approval is obtained, the concessions may be extended to (or expire at) a later (or an earlier) date.



5In September 2009, development of a new bauxite mine was completed in Juruti, state of Pará in northern Brazil. The mine is fully operational
and produced 3.8 million bdmt in 2012.

holds a 4.62% total interest and AWA LLC holds a 5% total interest in MRN. MRN is jointly owned with affiliates of Rio Tinto Alcan Inc., Companhia Brasileira de Alumínio, Companhia Vale do Rio Doce, BHP Billiton Plc (BHP Billiton) and Norsk
Hydro. Alumínio, AWA Brasil, and AWA LLC purchase bauxite from MRN under long-term supply contracts.



10AWA LLC owns a 45% interest in Halco (Mining), Inc. Halco owns 100% of Boké Investment Company, a Delaware company, which owns 51% of CBG. The
Guinean Government owns 49% of CBG, which has the exclusive right through 2038 to develop and mine bauxite in certain areas within a 10,000 square-mile concession in northwestern Guinea.



11AWA LLC has a bauxite purchase contract with CBG that expires in 2029. Before that expiration date, AWA LLC expects to negotiate an extension of the
contract as CBG will have concession rights until 2038. The CBG concession can be renewed beyond 2038 by agreement of the Government of Guinea and CBG should more time be required to commercialize the remaining economic bauxite within the
concession.



12Guinea—Boké: CBG prices bauxite and plans the mine based on the bauxite qualities of total alumina (TAl2O3) and total silica (TSiO2).

Kingdom of Saudi Arabia Joint Venture

In December 2009, Alcoa and Saudi Arabian Mining Company (Ma’aden) entered into a joint venture to develop a fully integrated aluminum complex in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. In its initial phases,
the complex includes a bauxite mine with an initial







capacity of 4 million bdmtpy; an alumina refinery with an initial capacity of 1.8 million mtpy; an aluminum smelter with an initial capacity of ingot, slab and billet of 740,000 mtpy;
and a rolling mill with initial capacity of 380,000 mtpy. The mill will produce sheet, end and tab stock for the manufacture of aluminum cans, as well as other products to serve the automotive, construction, and other industries.

The refinery, smelter and rolling mill are located within the Ras Al Khair industrial zone on the east coast of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. First hot
metal from the smelter was produced on December 12, 2012. Rolling mill production is anticipated to start sometime in 2013. First production from the mine and refinery is expected in 2014.

Total capital investment is expected to be approximately $10.8 billion (SAR 40.5 billion). Ma’aden owns a 74.9% interest in the joint venture. Alcoa
owns a 25.1% interest in the smelter and rolling mill, with the AWAC group holding a 25.1% interest in the mine and refinery. For additional information regarding the joint venture, see the Equity Investments section of Note I to the Consolidated
Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8. (Financial Statements and Supplementary Data).

8In May 2009, the Suralco alumina refinery announced curtailment of 870,000 mtpy. The decision was made to protect the long-term viability of the
industry in Suriname. The curtailment was aimed at deferring further bauxite extraction until additional in-country bauxite resources are developed and market conditions for alumina improve. The refinery currently has approximately 893,000 mtpy of
idle capacity.



9Reductions in production at Point Comfort resulted mostly from the effects of curtailments initiated in late 2008 through early 2009, as a result of
overall market conditions. The reductions included curtailments of approximately 1,500,000 mtpy. Of that original amount, 384,000 mtpy remain curtailed.

As noted above, Alcoa and Ma’aden are developing an alumina refinery in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Initial capacity of the refinery is expected to be 1.8 million mtpy. First production is
expected in 2014. For additional information regarding the joint venture, see the Equity Investments section of Note I to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8. (Financial Statements and Supplementary Data).

The 2.1 million mtpy expansion of the Alumar consortium alumina refinery in São Luís, Maranhão, completed by the end of 2009,
has increased the refinery’s nameplate capacity to approximately 3.5 million mtpy, with Alcoa’s share of such capacity more than doubling to 1.89 million mtpy based on its 54% ownership stake through Alumínio and AWAC.

In November 2005, AWA LLC and Rio Tinto Alcan Inc. signed a Basic Agreement with the Government of Guinea that sets forth the framework for
development of a 1.5 million mtpy alumina refinery in Guinea. In 2006, the Basic Agreement was approved by the Guinean National Assembly and was promulgated into law. The Basic Agreement was originally set to expire in November 2008, but was
extended to November 2012, and has been recently extended again until 2015. Pre-feasibility studies were completed in 2008. Additional feasibility study work was completed in 2012, and further activities are planned for 2013.

In September 2006, Alcoa received environmental approval from the Government of Western Australia for expansion of the Wagerup alumina refinery to a
maximum capacity of 4.7 million mtpy, a potential increase of over 2 million mtpy. This approval had a term of 5 years and included environmental conditions that must be satisfied before Alcoa could seek construction approval for the
project. The project was suspended in November 2008 due to global economic conditions and the unavailability of a secure long-term energy supply in Western Australia. These constraints continue and as such the project remains under suspension. In
May 2012, the Government of Western Australia granted Alcoa a 5 year extension of the 2006 environmental approval.

In 2008, AWAC signed a
cooperation agreement with Vietnam National Coal-Minerals Industries Group (Vinacomin) in which they agreed to conduct a joint feasibility study of the Gia Nghia bauxite mine and alumina refinery project located in Vietnam’s Central Highlands.
The cooperation between AWAC and Vinacomin on Gia Nghia is subject to approval by the Government of Vietnam. If established, the Gia Nghia venture is expected to be 51% owned by Vinacomin, 40% by AWAC and 9% by others.

7In May 2010, Alcoa and the Italian Government agreed to a temporary curtailment of the Fusina smelter. As of June 30, 2010, the Fusina smelter was
fully curtailed. Additionally, in January 2012, as part of a restructuring of Alcoa’s global smelting system, Alcoa announced that it had decided to curtail operations at the Portovesme smelter during the first half of 2012. In March 2012,
Alcoa decided to delay the curtailment of the Portovesme smelter until the second half of 2012 based on negotiations with the Italian government and other stakeholders. In the third quarter of 2012, Alcoa began the process of curtailing the
Portovesme smelter, and it has since been fully curtailed as of November 2012 with all 150,000 mtpy idled. This action may lead to the permanent closure of the Portovesme smelter.



8In January 2012, Alcoa announced its intentions to partially and temporarily curtail its Avilés and La Coruña smelters. The partial
curtailments were completed in the first half of 2012. As a result of a modification to the load interruptibility regime currently in place in the Spanish power market, Alcoa has commenced the restart of a portion (25,000 mtpy combined for
Avilés and La Coruña) of the capacity previously curtailed in the first half of 2012 in order to meet the requirements of the modified interruptibility regime. See the Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations section for more information.



9Between June and November 2008, three of Rockdale’s six potlines were idled as a result of uneconomical power prices. The remaining three
operating lines were idled in November 2008 due to uncompetitive power supply and overall market conditions. In January 2012, Alcoa announced that it will permanently shut down and demolish two of the six idled potlines as part of a larger strategy
to improve its cost position and competitiveness. The remaining four potlines (191,000 mtpy) remain idled.



10Approximately half of one potline at the Intalco smelter remains idled, approximately 45,200 mtpy.



11One potline at the Wenatchee smelter remains idled, or approximately 41,000 mtpy.

As of December 31, 2012, Alcoa had approximately 591,000 mtpy of idle capacity against total Alcoa Consolidated Capacity of 4,227,000 mtpy.

All production at the Tennessee smelter was idled in March 2009 due to economic conditions. In January 2012, Alcoa announced that it would
permanently shut down the 215,000 mtpy facility as part of a larger strategy to improve its cost position and competitiveness. Demolition and remediation are ongoing.

In January 2011, Alcoa and China Power Investment Corporation (CPI) signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) to collaborate on a broad range of aluminum and energy projects in China and other locations.
The projects under consideration may range from mining, refining, smelting, and aluminum fabrication to collaboration on energy projects. A new joint venture company, established in November 2012, is discussed below under the Global Rolled Products
segment.

As noted above, Alcoa and Ma’aden are developing an aluminum smelter in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. The smelter is expected to
have an initial capacity of ingot, slab and billet of 740,000 mtpy. First hot metal was produced on December 12, 2012.

In December 2008,
Alcoa and the Brunei Economic Development Board agreed to further extend an existing MOU to enable more detailed studies into the feasibility of establishing a modern, gas-powered aluminum smelter in Brunei Darussalam. The MOU extends a memorandum
signed originally in 2003. Phase one of the feasibility study will determine scope and dimensions of the proposed facility, power-delivery strategy, location, as well as an associated port and infrastructure. At completion of phase one, the parties
will determine whether a more detailed phase two study is warranted. If completed, it is expected that the smelter would have an initial operating capacity of 360,000 mtpy with the potential for future increase. In 2012, the MOU was further extended
to enable determination of feasibility.

In 2007, Alcoa and Greenland Home Rule Government entered into an MOU regarding cooperation on a
feasibility study for an aluminum smelter with a 360,000 mtpy capacity in Greenland. The MOU also encompasses a







hydroelectric power system and related infrastructure improvements, including a port. In 2008, Greenland’s parliament allocated funding to support the second phase of joint studies with
Alcoa and endorsed that the smelter be located at Maniitsoq. In 2010, Alcoa and the Greenland Home Rule Government revised the completion dates for feasibility studies associated with development of the proposed integrated hydro system and aluminum
smelter at Maniitsoq to enable more detailed consideration of aspects of the project related to construction and provision of energy and to allow the Greenland parliament sufficient time to deliberate and vote on critical aspects of national
legislation concerning the project. The feasibility studies were completed in the fourth quarter of 2011. In December 2012, the Greenland parliament enacted framework legislation encompassing particular requirements of large scale developmental
projects. The parliament also approved continuation of feasibility studies as described in the MOU.

In the fourth quarter of 2011, Alcoa and
the Government of Angola, through the ministries of Energy, Water & Geology, Mines and Industry, entered into an exclusive MOU regarding cooperation on a feasibility study for an aluminum smelter in Angola with a 720,000 mtpy capacity. The
MOU also encompasses a hydroelectric power system and power transmission facilities to be built by the Government and a resulting long term power purchase agreement.

Global Rolled Products

The principal business of the Company’s Global Rolled
Products segment is the production and sale of aluminum plate, sheet and foil. This segment includes rigid container sheet, which is sold directly to customers in the packaging and consumer market. This segment also includes sheet and plate used in
the aerospace, automotive, commercial transportation, and building and construction markets.

As noted above, Alcoa and Ma’aden are
developing a rolling mill in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. In 2010, the joint venture entity, Ma’aden Rolling Company signed project financing for its rolling mill and broke ground on the construction of the mill. Initial capacity is
approximately 380,000 mtpy. The rolling mill is anticipated to start sometime in 2013. In March 2012, Alcoa and Ma’aden announced commencement of work to extend the product mix of their aluminum complex currently under construction, enabling
the two companies to include capability for producing approximately 100,000 metric tons of a wide range of products suitable for further downstream manufacturing in the complex’s product lines. They include automotive heat-treated and
non-heat-treated sheet, building and construction sheet and foil stock sheet. The line is expected to start production at the end of 2014.

As
discussed above, in 2011, Alcoa and CPI signed an MOU followed by a Letter of Intent that provides a framework for the creation of a joint venture which includes a focus on producing high-end fabricated aluminum products in China. In February 2012,
Alcoa and CPI announced that they finalized an agreement to establish a joint venture company to produce high-end fabricated aluminum products in China. The new joint venture company, Alcoa CPI Aluminum Investment Co. Ltd., was established in
November 2012 and will be majority owned and managed by Alcoa and based in Shanghai.

In March 2012, the Company broke ground on a $300
million expansion of its Davenport Works plant to meet rising demand for aluminum from the automotive market. The expansion will create an additional 150 full time jobs in Davenport once completed. The planned expansion was announced in September
2011 and is expected to be completed by the end of 2013. An economic development incentive package from the Iowa Department of Economic Development helped secure the selection of Davenport for the expansion.

On August 31, 2012, Alcoa assumed full control and ownership of Evermore Recycling LLC (Evermore). Evermore had previously been a joint venture
between Alcoa and Novelis Corporation, created for the purpose of used beverage can procurement.

Explanatory Note: Certain aluminum produced by Alcoa also includes alloying materials. Because of the number of
different types of elements that can be used to produce alloy aluminum products, providing a range of such elements would not be meaningful. With the exception of a very small number of internally used products, Alcoa produces its alloys in
adherence to an Aluminum Association standard. The Aluminum Association, of which Alcoa is an active member, uses a specific designation system to identify alloy types. In general, each alloy type has a major alloying element other than
aluminum but will also have other constituents as well, but of lesser amounts.

Energy

Employing the Bayer process, Alcoa refines alumina from bauxite ore. Alcoa then produces aluminum from the alumina by an electrolytic process requiring
substantial amounts of electric power. Energy accounts for approximately 25% of the Company’s total alumina refining production costs. Electric power accounts for approximately 26% of the Company’s primary aluminum production costs. Alcoa
generates approximately 20% of the power used at its smelters worldwide and generally purchases the remainder under long-term arrangements. The paragraphs below summarize the sources of power and the long-term power arrangements for Alcoa’s
smelters and refineries.

North America – Electricity

The Deschambault, Baie Comeau, and Bécancour smelters in Québec purchase electricity under existing contracts that run through 2015, which will be followed by long-term contracts with
Hydro-Québec first executed in December 2008, revised in 2012 and expiring in 2040, provided that Alcoa completes the modernization of the Baie Comeau smelter by September 2016. The smelter located in Baie Comeau, Québec has
historically purchased approximately 65% of its power needs under the Hydro-Québec contract, receiving the remainder from a 40% owned hydroelectric generating company, Manicouagan Power Limited Partnership (MPLP). Beginning on January 1,
2011, these percentages changed such that approximately 80% is sourced from Hydro-Québec, with the remaining 20% from MPLP.

The
Company’s wholly-owned subsidiary, Alcoa Power Generating Inc. (APGI), generates approximately 29% of the power requirements for Alcoa’s smelters operating in the U.S. The Company generally purchases the remainder under long-term
contracts. APGI owns and operates the Yadkin hydroelectric project, consisting of four dams in North Carolina. In November 2012, APGI finalized the sale of its Tapoco Hydroelectric Project to Brookfield Renewable Energy Partners.

The relicensing process continues for Yadkin. In 2007, APGI filed with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) a Relicensing Settlement Agreement
with the majority of the interested stakeholders that broadly resolved open issues. The National Environmental Policy Act process is complete, with a final environmental impact statement having been issued in April 2008. The remaining requirement
for the relicensing was the issuance by North Carolina of the required water quality certification under Section 401 of the Clean Water Act. The Section 401 water quality certification was issued on May 7, 2009, but was appealed, and
has been stayed since late May 2009 pending substantive determination on the appeal. On December 1,







2010, APGI received notice from North Carolina of its revocation of the Section 401 water quality certification, and APGI appealed the revocation. In September 2012, the North Carolina
administrative law judge dismissed without prejudice the revocation appeal, and APGI filed a new application for a 401 certificate. This enables APGI to have a fresh start to the 401 application process, and the state is required to act on the
application within one year, or it is deemed granted. APGI received a year-to-year license renewal from FERC in May 2008, and will continue to operate under annual licenses until a new Section 401 certification is issued and the FERC
relicensing process is complete. Since the permanent closure of the Badin, North Carolina smelter, power generated from APGI’s Yadkin system is largely being sold to an affiliate, Alcoa Power Marketing LLC, and then sold into the wholesale
market. Proceeds from sales to the wholesale market are used to offset higher priced power contracts at other U.S. operations.

APGI generates
substantially all of the power used at the Company’s Warrick smelter using nearby coal reserves. Since May 2005, Alcoa has owned the nearby Friendsville, Illinois coal reserves, with the mine being operated by Vigo Coal Company, Inc. The mine
is producing approximately one million tons of coal per year. In June 2011, the Red Brush West Mine, owned by Alcoa and operated by Vigo Coal, was opened and produced approximately 60,000 tons per month over an eighteen-month period. In 2012, the
two owned mines provided approximately 85% of the Warrick power plant’s requirements. The balance of the coal used is purchased principally from local Illinois Basin coal producers pursuant to term contracts of varying duration. Red Brush West
Mine will halt production in the first quarter of 2013. Liberty Mine, owned by Alcoa and operated by Vigo Coal, will begin producing coal in the second quarter of 2013 and will be a one million ton per year mine. Friendsville and Liberty Mines will
combine to supply 95% of the power plant’s future needs.

In the State of Washington, Alcoa’s Wenatchee smelter operates under a
contract with Chelan County Public Utility District (Chelan PUD) under which Alcoa receives approximately 26% of the hydropower output of Chelan PUD’s Rocky Reach and Rock Island dams.

For the period from December 22, 2009 to December 31, 2012, Alcoa and the Bonneville Power Administration (BPA) operated under a contract providing for the sale of physical power to the Intalco
smelter at the Northwest Power Act mandated industrial firm power (IP) rate. On January 1, 2013, a new contract executed between Alcoa and BPA became effective, under which Alcoa receives physical power at the IP rate through September 30,
2022.







In the northeast, the purchased power contracts for both the Massena East and Massena West smelters in New
York expire December 31, 2013, subject to their terms and conditions. In December 2007, Alcoa and The New York Power Authority (NYPA) reached agreement in principle on a new energy contract to supply the Massena East and Massena West smelters
for 30 years, beginning on January 1, 2014, following an amendment in January 2011. The definitive agreement implementing this arrangement became effective February 24, 2009. A subsequent amendment, providing Alcoa additional time to
complete the design and engineering work for its Massena East modernization plan, and providing for the return of 256 megawatts (MW) of power to NYPA while Massena East was idled, was entered into effective April 16, 2009 and was superseded by
the January 2011 amendment. Implementation of the Massena East modernization plan is subject to further approval of the Alcoa Board of Directors. Alcoa restarted production at Massena East in the first quarter of 2011.

The Mt. Holly smelter in South Carolina purchases electricity from Santee Cooper under a contract that was amended and restated in 2012, and expires
December 31, 2015. The contract includes a provision for follow-on service at the then current rate schedule for industrial customers.

Australia – Electricity

Power is generated from extensive brown coal deposits
covered by a long-term mineral lease held by AofA, and that power currently provides approximately 40% of the electricity for the AofA’s Point Henry smelter. The State Electricity Commission of Victoria (SECV) provides the remaining power for
this smelter, and all power for the Portland smelter, under contracts with AofA and Eastern Aluminium (Portland) Pty Ltd, a wholly-owned subsidiary of AofA, in respect of its interest in Portland, that extend to 2014 and 2016, respectively. Upon the
expiration of these contracts both smelters will purchase power from the Australian National Energy Market (NEM) variable spot market. In March 2010, AofA and Eastern Aluminium (Portland) Pty Ltd (in respect of the Portland Smelter only) separately
entered into fixed for floating swap contracts with Loy Yang Power in order to manage exposure to variable energy rates from the NEM for the Point Henry and Portland smelters. The contracts commence from the date of expiration of the current
contracts with the SECV and are in place until December 2036.

Brazil – Electricity

The Alumar smelter is partially supplied by Eletronorte (Centrais Elétricas do Norte do Brasil S.A.) under a long-term power purchase agreement
originally expiring in December 2024. Eletronorte has supplied the Alumar smelter from the beginning of its operations in 1984. Since 2006, Alcoa Alumínio S.A.’s (Alumínio) remaining power needs for the smelter are supplied from
self-generated energy. In March 2012, the Eletronorte contract supply was reduced from 423 MW to 263 MW and will be further reduced to 200 MW in January 2014. In March 2012, Aluminio declared that the Electronorte contract will be terminated by
March 2014 and alternatives for supplying the remaining power needs of both smelters are being analyzed.

Alumínio owns a 30.99% stake
in Maesa—Machadinho Energética S.A., which is the owner of 83.06% of the Machadinho hydroelectric power plant located in southern Brazil. Alumínio’s share of the plant’s output is supplied to the Poços de Caldas
smelter, and is sufficient to cover 55% of its operating needs.

Alumínio has a 42.18% interest in Energética Barra Grande
S.A.—BAESA, which built the Barra Grande hydroelectric power plant in southern Brazil. Alumínio’s share of the power generated by BAESA covers the remaining power needs of the Poços de Caldas smelter and, as noted above, a
portion of the power needs of Alumínio’s interest in the Alumar smelter.

Alumínio also has 34.97% share in Serra do
Facão in the southeast of Brazil, which began commercial generation in August 2010. Alumínio’s share of the Serra do Facão output is currently being sold in the market. Power from Serra do Facao will replace Electronorte
starting January 1, 2014 when the existing contract will be further reduced by 60 MW. Until then, power from Serra do Facao will be sold externally to the market.







Alumínio is also participating in the Estreito hydropower project in northern Brazil, holding a
25.49% share. Four out of its eight generation units began commercial operation in 2011. Three additional units began operation in 2012, and the remaining unit is expected to begin commercial operation by March 2013. Aluminio’s share of the
plant’s output is supplied to the Alumar smelter which replaced the 160 MW Electronorte power contract reduction on March 26, 2012.

With Machadinho, Barra Grande, Serra do Facão and Estreito, Alumínio’s current power self-sufficiency is approximately 70%, to meet a
total energy demand of approximately 690 MW from Brazilian primary aluminum plants.

Consortia in which Alumínio participates have
received concessions for the Pai Querê hydropower project in southern Brazil (Alumínio’s share is 35%) and the Santa Isabel hydropower project in northern Brazil (Alumínio’s share is 20%). Development of these
concessions has not yet begun.

Europe – Electricity

Alcoa’s smelters at San Ciprián, La Coruña and
Avilés, Spain purchase electricity under bilateral power contracts. The contracts that commenced in May 2009 expired on December 31, 2012 and have been replaced with new bilateral contracts commencing on January 1, 2013. The
contracts for San Ciprián and Avilés smelters each have a 4 year term. The contract for the La Coruña smelter is for a single year. Prior to the establishment of power supply under the bilateral contracts, Alcoa was supplied
under a regulated power tariff. On January 25, 2007, the EC announced that it has opened an investigation to establish whether the regulated electricity tariffs granted by Spain comply with EU state aid rules. Alcoa operated in Spain for more
than ten years under a power supply structure approved by the Spanish Government in 1986, an equivalent tariff having been granted in 1983. The investigation is limited to the year 2005 and it is focused both on the energy-intensive consumers and
the distribution companies. It is Alcoa’s understanding that the Spanish tariff system for electricity is in conformity with all applicable laws and regulations, and therefore no state aid is present in that tariff system. A decision by the EC
has not yet been made. If the EC’s investigation concludes that







the regulated electricity tariffs for industries are unlawful, Alcoa will have an opportunity to challenge the decision in the EU courts. Due to the high cost position of the La Coruña and
Avilés smelters, combined with rising raw material costs and falling aluminum prices, in early January 2012, Alcoa announced its intentions to partially and temporarily curtail its La Coruña and Avilés, Spain smelters. The
partial curtailments were completed in the first half of 2012. As a result of a modification to the load interruptibility regime currently in place in the Spanish power market, Alcoa has commenced the restart of a portion (25,000 mpty combined for
Avilés and La Coruña) of the capacity previously curtailed in the first half of 2012 to meet the requirements of the modified interruptibility regime. See the Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results
of Operations section for more information.

In March 2009, Alcoa and Orkla ASA exchanged respective stakes in the Sapa AB and Elkem Aluminium
ANS companies. Pursuant to the exchange, Alcoa assumed 100% ownership of the two smelters in Norway, Lista and Mosjøen, at the end of the first quarter of 2009. These smelters have long-term power arrangements in place which continue until at
least 2019.

Iceland – Electricity

Alcoa’s Fjarðaál smelter in eastern Iceland began operation in 2007. Central to those operations is a forty-year power contract under which Landsvirkjun, the Icelandic national power
company, built the Kárahnjúkar dam and hydro-power project, and supplies competitively priced electricity to the smelter. In late 2009, Iceland imposed two new taxes on power intensive industries, both for a period of three years, from
2010 through 2012. One tax is based on energy consumption; the other is a pre-payment of certain other charges, and will be recoverable from 2013 through 2015. In 2012, Iceland extended the energy consumption tax though 2015.

North America – Natural Gas

In order to supply its refineries and smelters in the U.S. and Canada, Alcoa generally procures natural gas on a competitive bid basis from a variety of sources including producers in the gas production
areas and independent gas marketers. For Alcoa’s larger consuming locations in Canada and the U.S., the gas commodity and the interstate pipeline transportation are procured to provide increased flexibility and reliability. Contract pricing for
gas is typically based on a published industry index or New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) price. The Company may choose to reduce its exposure to NYMEX pricing by hedging a portion of required natural gas consumption.

Australia – Natural Gas

AofA holds a 20% equity interest in a consortium that bought the Dampier-to-Bunbury natural gas pipeline in October 2004. This pipeline transports gas from the northwest gas fields to AofA’s alumina
refineries and other users in the Southwest of Western Australia. AofA uses gas to co-generate steam and electricity for its alumina refining processes at the Kwinana, Pinjarra and Wagerup refineries. Approximately 85% of AofA’s gas supplies
are under long-term contract out to 2020. AofA is progressing multiple supply options to replace expiring contracts, including investing directly in projects that have the potential to deliver cost-based gas.

Patents, Trade Secrets and Trademarks

The Company believes that its domestic and international patent, trade secret and trademark assets provide it with a significant competitive advantage. The Company’s rights under its patents, as well
as the products made and sold under them, are important to the Company as a whole and, to varying degrees, important to each business segment. The patents owned by Alcoa generally concern particular products or manufacturing equipment or techniques.
Alcoa’s business as a whole is not, however, materially dependent on any single patent, trade secret or trademark.

The Company has a
number of trade secrets, mostly regarding manufacturing processes and material compositions that give many of its businesses important advantages in their markets. The Company continues to strive to improve those processes and generate new material
compositions that provide additional benefits.

The Company also has a number of domestic and international registered
trademarks that have significant recognition within the markets that are served. Examples include the name “Alcoa” and the Alcoa symbol for aluminum products, Howmet metal castings, Huck®fasteners, Kawneer®building
panels and Dura-Bright®wheels with easy-clean surface treatments. The Company’s rights under its
trademarks are important to the Company as a whole and, to varying degrees, important to each business segment.

Competitive Conditions

Alcoa is subject to highly competitive conditions in all aspects of its aluminum and non-aluminum businesses. Competitors include a
variety of both U.S. and non-U.S. companies in all major markets. Price, quality, and service are the principal competitive factors in Alcoa’s markets. Where aluminum products compete with other materials—such as steel and plastics for
automotive and building applications; magnesium, titanium, composites, and plastics for aerospace and defense applications—aluminum’s diverse characteristics, particularly its light weight, recyclability, and flexibility are also
significant factors. For Alcoa’s segments that market products under Alcoa’s brand names, brand recognition, and brand loyalty also play a role. In addition Alcoa’s competitive position depends, in part, on the Company’s access
to an economical power supply to sustain its operations in various countries.

Research and Development

Alcoa, a technology leader in the aluminum industry, engages in research and development programs that include process and product development, and basic
and applied research. Expenditures for research and development (R&D) activities were $197 million in 2012, $184 million in 2011, and $174 million in 2010.







Most of the major process areas within the Company have a Technology Management Review Board (TMRB) or
Center of Excellence (CoE) consisting of members from various worldwide locations. Each TMRB or CoE is responsible for formulating and communicating a technology strategy for the corresponding process area, developing and managing the technology
portfolio and ensuring the global transfer of technology. Alternatively, certain business units conduct these activities and research and development programs within the worldwide business unit, supported by the Alcoa Technical Center (ATC).
Technical personnel from the TMRBs, ATC and such business units also participate in the corresponding Market Sector Teams. In this manner, research and development activities are aligned with corporate and business unit goals.

During 2012, the Company continued to work on new developments for a number of strategic projects in all business segments. In Primary Metals, progress
was made on inert anode technology with tests carried out on a pilot scale. Progress has been successful in many respects as a result of full pot testing of anode assemblies, although there remain technical and cost targets to achieve. If the
technology proves to be commercially feasible, the Company believes that it would result in significant operating cost savings, and generate environmental benefits by reducing certain emissions and eliminating carbon dioxide. No timetable has been
established for commercial use. The Company is also continuing to develop the carbothermic aluminum process, which is in the research and development phase. The technology holds the potential to produce aluminum at a lower cost, driven by
reduced conversion costs, lower energy requirements and lower emissions at a lower capital cost than traditional smelting.

The Company
continued its progress leveraging new science and technologies in 2012. For example, riblets that reduce aerodynamic drag have been analyzed and produced on a test basis. Self-cleaning nano coatings have been demonstrated on building products (an
example of such was commercialized in 2011 as EcoClean, which is the world’s first coil-coated aluminum architectural panel that helps clean itself and the air around it). Energy saving sensing devices are being integrated in Company
manufacturing plants. Integrated thermal management products for consumer electronics have been developed and are being validated by our customers.

A number of products were commercialized in 2012 including new fasteners, aluminum lithium (Al-Li) and more traditional 7xxx series alloys for various aerospace applications, numerous innovations in the
building and construction market for enhanced thermal performance and increased functionality. The Company continues to develop its MicromillTMtechnology and ran numerous customer trials in the rigid container sheet (RCS) and packaging markets. There has been
considerable progress in the development of next generation commercial truck wheels. The Company has also continued to externally license technology including the A951 pretreatment technology, shaping technology, and ColorkastTMproducts for the consumer electronics segment.

Alcoa’s research and development focus is on product development to support sustainable, profitable growth; manufacturing technologies to improve
efficiencies and reduce costs; and environmental risk reductions. Environmental technologies continue to be an area of focus for the Company, with projects underway that address emissions reductions, the reduction of spent pot lining, advanced
recycling, and the beneficial use of bauxite residue.

As a result of product development and technological advancement, the Company continues
to pursue patent protection in jurisdictions throughout the world. At the end of 2012, the Company’s worldwide patent portfolio consisted of 870 pending patent applications and 1,895 granted patents.
