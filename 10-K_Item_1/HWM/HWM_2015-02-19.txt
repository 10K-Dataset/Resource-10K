Forward-Looking Statements

Overview

Alcoa is a global leader in lightweight metals engineering and manufacturing. Alcoa’s innovative, multi-material products, which include aluminum,
titanium, and nickel, are used worldwide in aircraft, automobiles, commercial transportation, packaging, building and construction, oil and gas, defense, consumer electronics, and industrial applications.

Alcoa is also the world leader in the production and management of primary aluminum, fabricated aluminum, and alumina combined, through its active
participation in all major aspects of the industry: technology, mining, refining, smelting, fabricating, and recycling. Aluminum is a commodity that is traded on the London Metal Exchange (LME) and priced daily. Sales of primary aluminum and alumina
represent approximately 40% of Alcoa’s revenues. The price of aluminum influences the operating results of Alcoa.






Alcoa is a global company operating in 30 countries. Based upon the country where the point of sale
occurred, the United States and Europe generated 51% and 27%, respectively, of Alcoa’s sales in 2014. In addition, Alcoa has investments and operating activities in, among others, Australia, Brazil, China, Guinea, Iceland, Russia, and Saudi
Arabia, all of which present opportunities for substantial growth. Governmental policies, laws and regulations, and other economic factors, including inflation and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates, affect the
results of operations in these countries.

Alcoa’s operations consist of four worldwide reportable segments: Alumina, Primary Metals,
Global Rolled Products, and Engineered Products and Solutions.

The following tables and related discussion of the Company’s Bauxite Interests, Alumina Refining and Primary
Aluminum Facilities and Capacities, Global Rolled Products, Engineered Products and Solutions and Corporate Facilities provide additional description of Alcoa’s businesses. The Alumina segment primarily consists of a series of affiliated
operating entities referred to as Alcoa World Alumina and Chemicals (AWAC). Alcoa owns 60% and Alumina Limited owns 40% of these individual entities. For more information on AWAC, see Exhibit Nos. 10(a) through 10(f)(1) to this report.

Bauxite Interests

Aluminum is
one of the most plentiful elements in the earth’s crust and is produced primarily from bauxite, an ore containing aluminum in the form of aluminum oxide, commonly referred to as alumina. Aluminum is made by extracting alumina from bauxite and
then removing oxygen from the alumina. Alcoa processes most of the bauxite that it mines into alumina. The Company obtains bauxite from its own resources and from those belonging to the AWAC enterprise, located in the countries listed in the table
below, as well as pursuant to both long-term and short-term contracts and mining leases. During 2014, Alcoa consumed 40.8 million metric tons (mt) from AWAC and its own resources and 8.2 million mt from entities in which the Company has an
equity interest. In addition, AWAC sold 1.6 million mt of bauxite to third parties. Tons of bauxite are reported as bone dry metric tons (bdmt) unless otherwise stated. See the glossary of bauxite mining related terms at the end of this
section.

The Company has access to large bauxite deposit areas with mining rights that extend in most cases more than 20 years from the date
of this report. For purposes of evaluating the amount of bauxite that will be available to supply as






feedstock to its refineries, the Company considers both estimates of bauxite resources as well as calculated bauxite reserves. Bauxite resources represent deposits for which tonnage, densities,
shape, physical characteristics, grade and mineral content can be estimated with a reasonable level of confidence based on the amount of exploration sampling and testing information gathered through appropriate techniques from locations such as
outcrops, trenches, pits, workings and drill holes. Bauxite reserves represent the economically mineable part of resource deposits, and include diluting materials and allowances for losses, which may occur when the material is mined. Appropriate
assessments and studies have been carried out to define the reserves, and include consideration of and modification by realistically assumed mining, metallurgical, economic, marketing, legal, environmental, social and governmental factors. Alcoa
employs a conventional approach (including additional drilling with successive tightening of the drill grid) with customized techniques to define and characterize its various bauxite deposit types allowing Alcoa to confidently establish the extent
of its bauxite resources and their ultimate conversion to reserves.

The table below only includes the amount of proven and probable reserves
controlled by the Company. While the level of reserves may appear low in relation to annual production levels, they are consistent with historical levels of reserves for the Company’s mining locations. Given the Company’s extensive bauxite
resources, the abundant supply of bauxite globally and the length of the Company’s rights to bauxite, it is not cost-effective to invest the significant resources necessary to establish bauxite reserves that reflect the total size of the
bauxite resources available to the Company. Rather, bauxite resources are upgraded annually to reserves as needed by the location. Detailed assessments are progressively undertaken within a proposed mining area and mine activity is then planned to
achieve a uniform quality in the supply of blended feedstock to the relevant refinery. Alcoa believes its present sources of bauxite on a global basis are sufficient to meet the forecasted requirements of its alumina refining operations for the
foreseeable future.

Bauxite Resource Development Guidelines

Alcoa has developed best practice guidelines for bauxite reserve and resource classification at its operating bauxite mines. Alcoa’s reserves are declared in accordance with Alcoa’s internal
guidelines as administered by the Alcoa Ore Reserves Committee (AORC). The reported ore reserves set forth in the table below are those that Alcoa estimates could be extracted economically with current technology and in current market conditions.
Alcoa does not use a price for bauxite, alumina, or aluminum to determine its bauxite reserves. The primary criteria for determining bauxite reserves are the feed specifications required by the customer alumina refinery. In addition to these
specifications, a number of modifying factors have been applied to differentiate bauxite reserves from other mineralized material. Alcoa mining locations have annual in-fill drilling programs designed to progressively upgrade the reserve and
resource classification of their bauxite.

3Alumínio is owned 100% by Alcoa.



4Brazilian mineral legislation does not establish the duration of mining concessions. The concession remains in force until the exhaustion of the
deposit. The Company estimates that (i) the concessions at Poços de Caldas will last at least until 2020, (ii) the concessions at Trombetas will last until 2046 and (iii) the concessions at Juruti will last until 2100.
Depending, however, on actual and future needs, the rate at which the deposits are exploited and government approval is obtained, the concessions may be extended to (or expire at) a later (or an earlier) date.



5Alcoa World Alumina LLC (AWA LLC) owns 100% of N.V. Alcoa Minerals of Suriname (AMS). Suralco and AMS are parts of the AWAC group of companies which
are owned 60% by Alcoa and 40% by Alumina Limited.



6The mining rights in the Onverdacht and Coermotibo areas where Suralco has active mines extend until 2033. Bauxite within these areas will likely be
exhausted in the near future. During 2015, Suralco will be mining from both reserves and resources. Alcoa has decided not to develop a mine at the Nassau Plateau based on current refinery cost and market conditions.






7Alumínio holds an 8.58% total interest, AWA Brasil holds a 4.62% total interest and AWA LLC holds a 5% total interest in MRN. MRN is jointly
owned with affiliates of Rio Tinto Alcan Inc., Companhia Brasileira de Alumínio, Companhia Vale do Rio Doce, BHP Billiton Plc (BHP Billiton) and Norsk Hydro. Alumínio, AWA Brasil, and AWA LLC purchase bauxite from MRN under long-term
supply contracts.



8AWA LLC owns a 45% interest in Halco (Mining), Inc. (Halco). Halco owns 100% of Boké Investment Company, a Delaware company, which owns 51% of
CBG. The Guinean Government owns 49% of CBG, which has the exclusive right through 2038 to develop and mine bauxite in certain areas within a 10,000 square-mile concession in northwestern Guinea.



9AWA LLC has a bauxite purchase contract with CBG that expires in 2029. Before that expiration date, AWA LLC expects to negotiate an extension of the
contract as CBG will have concession rights until 2038. The CBG concession can be renewed beyond 2038 by agreement of the Government of Guinea and CBG should more time be required to commercialize the remaining economic bauxite within the
concession.

Kingdom of Saudi Arabia Joint Venture

In December 2009, Alcoa and Saudi Arabian Mining Company (Ma’aden) entered into a joint venture to develop a fully integrated aluminum complex in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. In its initial phases,
the complex includes a bauxite mine with an initial






capacity of 4 million bdmtpy; an alumina refinery with an initial capacity of 1.8 million mtpy; an aluminum smelter with an initial capacity of ingot, slab and billet of 740,000 mtpy;
and a rolling mill with initial capacity of 380,000 mtpy. The mill will produce a variety of sheet products.

The refinery, smelter and
rolling mill are located within the Ras Al Khair industrial zone on the east coast of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. First hot metal from the smelter was produced on December 12, 2012, and the smelter produced 600,000 mt in 2014. Since mid-2014,
the smelter has been operating at full capacity.

The first hot coil from the rolling mill was produced in the fourth quarter of 2013. The
mine’s first bauxite was shipped in the second quarter of 2014 and construction of the mine was 83% complete at year end. The refinery became fully operational and produced its first alumina from Saudi Arabia bauxite in the fourth quarter of
2014.

Total capital investment is expected to be approximately $10.8 billion (SAR 40.5 billion). Ma’aden owns a 74.9% interest in the
joint venture. Alcoa owns a 25.1% interest in the smelter and rolling mill, with the AWAC group holding a 25.1% interest in the mine and refinery. For additional information regarding the joint venture, see the Equity Investments section of Note I
to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8. (Financial Statements and Supplementary Data).

As noted above, Alcoa and Ma’aden have been developing an alumina refinery in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Initial capacity of the refinery will be 1.8 million mtpy. As noted above, the refinery
became fully operational and produced its first alumina from Saudi Arabia bauxite in the fourth quarter of 2014. For additional information regarding the joint venture, see the Equity Investments section of Note I to the Consolidated Financial
Statements in Part II, Item 8. (Financial Statements and Supplementary Data).

In November 2005, AWA LLC and Rio Tinto Alcan Inc. signed
a Basic Agreement with the Government of Guinea that sets forth the framework for development of a 1.5 million mtpy alumina refinery in Guinea. In 2006, the Basic Agreement was approved by the Guinean National Assembly and was promulgated into
law. The Basic Agreement was originally set to expire in November 2008, but was extended to November 2015. Pre-feasibility studies were completed in 2008. Additional feasibility study work was completed in 2012. Alcoa continued its evaluation
of the project in 2014.






In September 2006, Alcoa received environmental approval from the Government of Western Australia for
expansion of the Wagerup alumina refinery to a maximum capacity of 4.7 million mtpy, a potential increase of over 2 million mtpy. This approval had a term of 5 years and included environmental conditions that must be satisfied before Alcoa
could seek construction approval for the project. The project was suspended in November 2008 due to global economic conditions and the unavailability of a secure long-term energy supply in Western Australia. These constraints continue and as such
the project remains under suspension. In May 2012, the Government of Western Australia granted Alcoa a 5 year extension of the original environmental approval. There were no material developments in 2014.

In 2008, AWAC signed a cooperation agreement with Vietnam National Coal-Minerals Industries Group (Vinacomin) in which they agreed to conduct a joint
feasibility study of the Gia Nghia bauxite mine and alumina refinery project located in Vietnam’s Central Highlands. The cooperation between AWAC and Vinacomin on Gia Nghia is subject to approval by the Government of Vietnam. If established,
the Gia Nghia venture is expected to be 51% owned by Vinacomin, 40% by AWAC and 9% by others. There were no material developments in 2014.

production.



2The figures in this column reflect Alcoa’s share of production from these facilities.



3The named company or an affiliate holds this interest.






4This figure includes the minority interest of Alumina Limited in the Portland facility, which is owned by AofA. From this facility, Alcoa takes 100% of
the production allocated to AofA.



5The Portland smelter has approximately 30,000 mtpy of idle capacity.



6In 2013, Alcoa temporarily curtailed 34,000 mtpy at the Poços de Caldas smelter and 97,000 mtpy at the Alumar smelter. In the first quarter of
2014, management initiated the temporary curtailment of the remaining 62,000 mtpy at the Poços de Caldas smelter and an additional 85,000 mtpy at the Alumar smelter. The process of curtailing this additional capacity began in March 2014 and
was completed by the end of May 2014. In the 2014 third quarter, an additional 12,000 mtpy was curtailed at the Alumar smelter.



7In mid-May 2013, in connection with the announcement of a revised modernization plan schedule for the Baie-Comeau smelter, Alcoa stated that it would
permanently close the plant’s two Soderberg potlines. The closure, which was completed in August 2013, involved 105,000 mtpy of capacity and was part of the 460,000 mtpy of smelting capacity Alcoa announced was under review in May 2013.



8Owned through Rio Tinto Alcan Inc.’s interest in Pechiney Reynolds Québec, Inc., which is owned by Rio Tinto Alcan Inc. and Alcoa.



9The Avilés and La Coruña smelters have approximately 64,000 mtpy of idle capacity combined.



10The Rockdale smelter has been fully curtailed since the end of 2008.



11The Intalco smelter has approximately 49,000 mtpy of idle capacity.



12The Wenatchee smelter has approximately 41,000 mtpy of idle capacity.

As of December 31, 2014, Alcoa had approximately 665,000 mtpy of idle capacity against total Alcoa Consolidated Capacity of 3,497,000 mtpy.

In May 2013, Alcoa announced that management would review 460,000 mtpy of smelting capacity over a 15-month period for possible curtailment. This review was aimed at maintaining Alcoa’s
competitiveness despite falling aluminum prices and would focus on the highest-cost smelting capacity and those plants that have long-term risk due to factors such as energy costs or regulatory uncertainty. As part of this review during the
remainder of 2013, management initiated the permanent shutdown of 146,000 mtpy of combined capacity at the Baie Comeau smelter (see footnote 7 above) and the Massena East smelter in New York, as well as a temporary curtailment of 131,000 mtpy of
capacity in Brazil (see footnote 6 above). All of these actions were completed in 2013.

In June 2013, Alcoa announced its intention to
permanently close the Fusina, Italy smelter. The closure was in addition to the 460,000 mtpy of operating smelting capacity that the company announced was under review in May 2013.

During the first quarter of 2014, the Company initiated three additional actions, resulting in the permanent shutdown of 274,000 mtpy of capacity and the temporary curtailment of 147,000 mtpy of capacity.
The permanent shutdowns were comprised of the remaining capacity (84,000 mtpy) at the Massena East smelter and the full capacity (190,000 mtpy) at the Point Henry smelter in Australia. The remaining capacity of the Massena East smelter represented
two Soderberg potlines that were no longer competitive. This shutdown was completed by the end of the 2014 first quarter. For the Point Henry smelter, the Company determined that the smelter had no prospect of becoming financially viable. The
shutdown of the Point Henry smelter was completed in August 2014.

In the third quarter of 2014, management approved the permanent shutdown of
the Portovesme smelter (150,000 mtpy) in Italy, which has been idle since November 2012. This decision was made because the fundamental reasons that made the Portovesme smelter uncompetitive remained unchanged, including the lack of a viable
long-term power solution.

In the fourth quarter of 2014, Alcoa sold its 50.3% interest (115,000 mtpy) in the Mount Holly smelter in Goose
Creek, South Carolina, to Century Aluminum Company.

As a result of the above-described actions, the Massena East, Mount Holly, Point Henry
and Portovesme smelters have not been included in the table above.

As noted above, Alcoa and Ma’aden have developed an aluminum smelter
in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. The smelter has an initial capacity of ingot, slab and billet of 740,000 mtpy. First hot metal was produced on December 12, 2012, and the smelter produced 600,000 mt in 2014. Since mid-2014, the smelter has been
operating at full capacity.






In November 2014, Alcoa completed the sale of an aluminum rod plant located in Bécancour,
Québec, Canada to Sural Laminated Products. This facility takes molten aluminum and shapes it into the form of a rod, which is used by customers primarily for the transportation of electricity. In conjunction with this transaction, Alcoa
entered into a multi-year agreement with Sural Laminated Products to supply molten aluminum for the rod plant.

In 2014, Alcoa and the Brunei
Economic Development Board agreed to extend for four years an existing Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) to enable more detailed studies into the feasibility of establishing a modern, gas-powered aluminum smelter in Brunei Darussalam to follow a
period of strategic assessment of global market conditions.

In 2007, Alcoa and Greenland Home Rule Government entered into an MOU regarding
cooperation on a feasibility study for an aluminum smelter with a 360,000 mtpy capacity in Greenland. The MOU also encompasses a hydroelectric power system and related infrastructure improvements, including a port. In November 2014, following new
elections in Greenland, the new parliament began a review of framework legislation affecting large scale developmental projects. Once completed, the impact of the review on the economic feasibility of the proposed integrated hydro system-aluminum
smelter will be evaluated.

Global Rolled Products

The principal business of the Company’s Global Rolled Products segment is the production and sale of aluminum plate, sheet, and specialty foil. This segment includes sheet and plate used in
aerospace, automotive, brazing, commercial transportation, consumer electronics, building and construction and other industrial markets. This segment also includes rigid container sheet, which is sold directly to customers in the food and beverage
packaging markets.

The Company’s $300 million expansion of its Tennessee Operations continued and the $300 million expansion of its
Davenport Works, Iowa plant was completed in 2014. Both expansions will support the manufacture of high strength aluminum automotive sheet. Also in 2014, Alcoa announced a $190 million investment at its Davenport Works facility to expand its product
offerings in the aerospace and industrial markets through the installation of technology that will enhance the performance of thick aluminum and aluminum-lithium plate in various applications such as wing ribs and fuselage frames. Construction on
the project will begin in 2015 with first customer production expected to begin in 2017.

Also in 2014, Alcoa announced a $40 million
investment in its Itapissuma, Brazil rolling mill to increase production of specialty foils for aseptic and flexible packages. Initial work for the expansion is underway and commissioning is expected to begin in 2016.

In December 2014, Alcoa sold its facilities in Amorebieta and Alicante (Spain) and Castelsarrasin (France), as well as the associated research and
development facility in Alicante to Atlas Holdings LLC.

Alcoa permanently closed its two rolling mills in Australia located in Geelong,
Victoria and in Yennora, New South Wales in the fourth quarter of 2014. The two rolling mills served the domestic and Asian can sheet markets, which have been impacted by excess capacity.

In September 2014, Alcoa announced a long-term contract to supply aluminum sheet and plate products to Boeing, the world’s largest aerospace company and leading manufacturer of commercial jetliners
and defense, space and security systems. The multiyear contract, valued at more than $1 billion, is the largest ever between the two companies.

In September 2014, Alcoa and China Power Investment Corporation (CPI) temporarily suspended joint venture activities undertaken by the joint venture,
which the parties had established in 2012, so that CPI could focus on its merger with the State Nuclear Power Technology Corporation. This includes suspension of the integration of three Alcoa businesses (a facility in Kunshan, China that
manufactures brazing sheet; a facility in Qinhuangdao, China that manufactures beverage can sheet and sheet for commercial transportation; and a fastener facility in Suzhou, China). The joint venture company, Alcoa CPI Aluminum Investment Co. Ltd,
is majority owned by Alcoa and headquartered in Shanghai, China.






In December 2014, Alcoa unveiled breakthrough manufacturing technology, the Alcoa
MicromillTM, that will manufacture the most advanced
aluminum sheet on the market. The Alcoa-patented Micromill process changes the microstructure of the metal, allowing the production of an aluminum alloy for automotive applications that has 40 percent greater formability and 30 percent greater
strength than the incumbent aluminum used today while meeting stringent automotive surface quality requirements. Additionally, automotive parts made with Micromill material will be twice as formable and at least 30 percent lighter than parts made
from high strength steel. The Micromill will enable the next generation of automotive aluminum products, and equip Alcoa to capture growing demand.

As noted above, Alcoa and Ma’aden have developed a rolling mill in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. The rolling mill, which is 74 acres under one roof, is operational and will manufacture a variety of
sheet products.

In 2014, Alcoa bought out the 30% interest in the Kunshan brazing sheet facility for $28 million from its partner, Shanxi
Yuncheng Engraving Group, and the parties terminated the joint venture in August 2014. Alcoa also reached agreement on the terms of sale for its remaining minority interest (17.96%) in Yunnan Xaoxin Aluminum Foil joint venture for approximately
$15 million. The sale is awaiting approval by the China Securities Regulatory Commission.

Alcoa completed the acquisition of Firth Rixson, a global leader in aerospace jet engine components, in
fourth quarter 2014. In addition to manufacturing jet engine rings, Firth Rixson manufactures a full range of forged complex shapes and is a supplier of integrated nickel ingot. Firth Rixson has five locations in the United States (Rochester, NY;
Fontana, CA; Rancho Cucamonga, CA; Verdi, NV, and Savannah, GA) and eight locations outside of the United States (United Kingdom, Hungary and China).

In December 2014, Alcoa announced a definitive agreement to acquire TITAL, a privately held company based in Germany. TITAL is a leader in titanium and aluminum structural castings for aircraft engines
and airframes. In addition, TITAL is a leader in process technology. The deal is expected to close in first quarter 2015.

Also in December
2014, Alcoa announced plans to double its high-technology coating capacity at its Whitehall, Michigan facility. The $17 million investment will position the Company to further capture growing demand for advanced jet engine parts. In 2014, Alcoa
commenced an expansion at its Hampton, Virginia facility to create the capability to employ a new process technology that improves jet engine blades. This $25 million investment will add equipment for a new production line and modify existing
machinery to produce the blades. It is expected to be complete by the fourth quarter of 2015.

In 2014, Alcoa completed construction of a $100
million greenfield facility adjacent to its Lafayette, Indiana plant, which expands Alcoa’s aluminum lithium capabilities. The facility can produce more than 20,000 mt of aluminum lithium and is capable of casting round and rectangular ingot
for rolled, extruded, and forged applications. Alcoa completed expanding aluminum lithium production at its Technical Center in Alcoa Center, PA in the third quarter of 2012. In June 2013, Alcoa also completed its expansion at its Kitts Green plant
in the United Kingdom, creating additional aluminum lithium casting capacity.

Also in 2014, Alcoa broke ground on its $100 million aerospace
expansion at its La Porte, Indiana facility where it will produce nickel-based superalloy jet engine parts. The new 320,000-square-foot facility will expand Alcoa’s reach from structural engine components for business and regional jets to large
commercial aircraft, including narrow- and wide-body and military airplanes. Construction is expected to be complete by the fourth quarter of 2015.

Alcoa invested $13 million to expand its wheel manufacturing plant in Europe, to meet growing demand for its lightweight, durable, low-maintenance aluminum truck wheels. Construction on the production
line expansion began in January 2014, and was completed on schedule in January 2015.

Alcoa and VSMPO-AVISMA Corporation signed a cooperation
agreement in October 2013, which will allow the companies to meet growing demand for high-end titanium and aluminum products for aircraft manufacturers worldwide. Once operational, the new joint venture will focus on manufacturing high-end aerospace
products, such as landing gear and forged wing components, at Alcoa’s plant in Samara, Russia. The definitive Shareholders’ Agreement was executed by the parties on July 16, 2014, and the deal is expected to close in 2015, with the
joint venture expected to become operational in 2016.

As discussed above, the joint venture between Alcoa and CPI, which the parties created
in November 2012 to produce high-end fabricated aluminum products in China, is currently suspended.

In July 2014, Alcoa announced a 10-year,
$1.1 billion agreement with Pratt & Whitney, a division of United Technologies Corp., for state-of-the-art jet engine components.

Explanatory Note: Certain aluminum produced by Alcoa also includes alloying materials. Because of the number of different
types of elements that can be used to produce Alcoa’s various alloys, providing a range of such elements would not be meaningful. With the exception of a very small number of internally used products, Alcoa produces its alloys in adherence to
an Aluminum Association standard. The Aluminum Association, of which Alcoa is an active member, uses a specific designation system to identify alloy types. In general, each alloy type has a major alloying element other than aluminum but will also
have other constituents as well, but of lesser amounts.

Energy

Employing the Bayer Process, Alcoa refines alumina from bauxite ore. Alcoa then produces aluminum from the alumina by an electrolytic process requiring substantial amounts of electric power. Energy
accounts for approximately 21% of the Company’s total alumina refining production costs. Electric power accounts for approximately 26% of the Company’s primary aluminum production costs. Alcoa generates approximately 25% of the power used
at its smelters worldwide and generally purchases the remainder under long-term arrangements. The paragraphs below summarize the sources of power and the long-term power arrangements for Alcoa’s smelters and refineries.

North America – Electricity

The Deschambault, Baie Comeau, and Bécancour smelters in Québec purchased electricity under existing contracts that expired on December 31, 2014. These were replaced by new long-term
contracts with Hydro-Québec executed in October 2014 (Deschambault and Baie Comeau smelters) and December 2014 (Bécancour smelter), both of which will expire on December 31, 2029. Upon expiration, Alcoa will have the option of
extending the term of the new Baie






Comeau contract to February 23, 2036. The smelter located in Baie Comeau, Québec purchases approximately 74% of its power needs under the Hydro-Québec contract, and the
remainder from a 40% owned hydroelectric generating company, Manicouagan Power Limited Partnership.

The Company’s wholly-owned
subsidiary, Alcoa Power Generating Inc. (APGI), generates approximately 35% of the power requirements for Alcoa’s smelters operating in the U.S. The Company purchases power under long-term contracts. APGI owns and operates the Yadkin
hydroelectric project, consisting of four dams in North Carolina, and the Warrick coal-fired power plant located in Indiana.

Pending completion of the relicensing process, APGI received year-to-year license renewals from FERC starting in May 2008, and will continue to operate
under annual licenses until a new Section 401 certification is issued and the FERC relicensing process is complete. Since the permanent closure of the Badin, North Carolina smelter, power generated from APGI’s Yadkin system is largely
being sold to an affiliate, Alcoa Power Marketing LLC, and then the wholesale market.

APGI generates substantially all of the power used at
the Company’s Warrick, Indiana smelter using nearby coal reserves. Since May 2005, Alcoa has owned the nearby Friendsville, Illinois coal reserves, with the Friendsville Mine being operated by Vigo Coal Company, Inc. The Friendsville Mine is
producing approximately one million tons of coal per year. In June 2011, the Red Brush West Mine, owned by Alcoa and operated by Vigo Coal, was opened and produced approximately 60,000 tons per month over an eighteen-month period, but operation
ceased in 2013. In the second quarter of 2013, Liberty Mine, also owned by Alcoa and operated by Vigo Coal, began producing coal and is operating at a level of approximately one million tons per year. Friendsville and Liberty Mines together combine
to supply 95% of the power plant’s future needs. The balance of the coal used is royalty coal or purchased coal from the Illinois basin.

In the State of Washington, Alcoa’s Wenatchee smelter operates under a contract with Chelan County Public Utility District (Chelan PUD) under which
Alcoa receives approximately 26% of the hydropower output of Chelan PUD’s Rocky Reach and Rock Island dams.

Starting on January 1,
2013, the Intalco smelter began receiving physical power from the Bonneville Power Administration (BPA) pursuant to a new contract executed between Alcoa and BPA, under which Alcoa receives physical power at the Northwest Power Act mandated
industrial firm power (IP) rate through September 30, 2022.






In the Northeast, the Massena West smelter
in New York receives physical power from the New York Power Authority (NYPA) pursuant to a contract between Alcoa and NYPA, which expires in 2045. The contract was amended in January 2011 to provide Alcoa with additional time to complete the
design and engineering work for its Massena East modernization plan, and further amended in March 2014 to provide for the temporary relinquishment of certain quantities of power by Alcoa following permanent closure of the remaining two Soderberg
potlines at the Massena East smelter in March 2014. Implementation of the Massena East modernization plan is subject to further approval of the Alcoa Board of Directors.

Australia – Electricity

In 2014 the Company concluded it would permanently close the
Point Henry smelter, coinciding with the expiration of the electricity contract with the State Electricity Commission of Victoria (SECV). AofA’s Anglesea power station continues to operate and sells electricity into the National Electricity
Market (NEM) after successfully being registered as a scheduled market generator in August 2014. The Portland smelter continues to purchase electricity from the SECV under a contract with Alcoa Portland Aluminium Pty Ltd, a wholly-owned subsidiary
of AofA, that extends to 2016. Upon the expiration of this contract, the Portland smelter will purchase power from the NEM variable spot market. In March 2010, AofA and Eastern Aluminium (Portland) Pty Ltd separately entered into a fixed for
floating swap contract with AGL Energy in order to manage their exposure to the variable energy rates from the NEM. The fixed for floating swap contract with AGL for the Point Henry smelter was terminated in 2013. The fixed for floating swap
contract with Loy Yang Power for the Portland smelter commences from the date of expiration of the current contract with the SECV and continues until December 2036.

Brazil – Electricity

Since May 2014 (after full curtailment of the Poços de
Caldas smelter and two of three lines of the Alumar smelter), the remaining smelting capacity at Alumar has been supplied by self-generation. The excess generation capacity has been sold into the market since then (around 350 MW).

Alumínio owns a 25.74% stake in Consórcio Machadinho, which is the owner of the Machadinho hydroelectric power plant located in southern
Brazil.






Alumínio has a 42.18% interest in Energética Barra Grande S.A.(BAESA), which built the Barra
Grande hydroelectric power plant in southern Brazil.

Alumínio also has a 34.97% share in Serra do Facão Energia S.A. (SEFAC),
which built the Serra do Facão hydroelectric power plant in the southeast of Brazil, which began commercial generation in July 2010. Alumínio’s share of the Serra do Facão output is currently being sold into the market.

Alumínio is also participating in the Estreito hydropower project in northern Brazil, through Estreito Energia S.A. (an
Alumínio wholly owned company) holding a 25.49% stake in Consórcio Estreito Energia, which is the owner of the hydroelectric power plant.

Consortia in which Alumínio participates have received concessions for the Pai Querê hydropower project in southern Brazil (Alumínio’s share is 35%). Development of this
concession has not yet begun.

Europe – Electricity

Alcoa’s smelters at San Ciprián, La Coruña and Avilés, Spain purchase electricity under bilateral power contracts that commenced on January 1, 2013. The contracts for San
Ciprián and Avilés smelters each have a four-year term (expiring December 31, 2016). The contract for the La Coruña smelter, which expired on December 31, 2014, has been extended for an additional year (expiring
December 31, 2015).

A competitive bidding mechanism to allocate interruptibility rights in Spain was settled
during 2014 to be applied starting from January 1, 2015. The first auction process to allocate rights took place in November 2014, where Alcoa secured 275MW of interruptibility rights for the 2015 period for the San Ciprián smelter. A
second auction process took place in December 2014, where Alcoa secured an additional 100MW of interruptibility rights for the 2015 period for the San Ciprián smelter (20x5MW), 120MW for the La Coruña smelter (24x5MW) and 110MW
for the Avilés smelter (22x5MW).

Alcoa owns two smelters in Norway, Lista and Mosjøen, which have long-term power arrangements
in place that continue until the end of 2019.






Iceland – Electricity

Alcoa’s Fjarðaál smelter in eastern Iceland began operation in 2007. Central to those operations is a forty-year power contract under which Landsvirkjun, the Icelandic national power
company, built the Kárahnjúkar dam and hydropower project, and supplies competitively priced electricity to the smelter. In late 2009, Iceland imposed two new taxes on power intensive industries, both for a period of three years, from
2010 through 2012. One tax is based on energy consumption; the other is a pre-payment of certain other charges, and will be recoverable starting in 2018. In 2012, Iceland extended the energy consumption tax though 2015.

Spain – Natural Gas

In order to facilitate the full conversion of the San Ciprian, Spain alumina refinery from fuel oil to natural gas, in October 2013, Alumina Española SA (AE) and Gas Natural Transporte SDG SL (GN)
signed a take or pay gas pipeline utilization agreement. Pursuant to that agreement, the ultimate shareholders of AE, Alcoa Inc. and Alumina Limited, have agreed to guarantee the payment of AE’s contracted gas pipeline utilization over the
four years of the commitment period in the event AE fails to do so, each shareholder being responsible for its respective proportionate share (i.e., 60/40). Such commitment will come into force six months after the gas pipeline is put into
operation by GN. The gas pipeline was completed in January 2015 and the refinery has switched to natural gas consumption for 100% of its needs.

Three supply contracts were signed in 2014 for the supply of natural gas to the San Ciprián, Spain alumina refinery during 2015 period with
Endesa, Union Fenosa Gas and BP, expiring by April 2016, December 2015 and December 2015, respectively. Pursuant to those agreements, Alcoa Inversiones España, S.L. and Alumina Limited have agreed to guarantee the payment of AE’s
obligations under the Endesa contract over the contract length, each shareholder being responsible for its respective proportionate share (i.e., 60/40). In the same way, Aluminio Español, S.A. and Alumina Limited have agreed to guarantee the
payment of AE’s obligations under the Union Fenosa Gas and BP contract over those contracts’ respective lengths, with each entity being responsible for its proportionate share (i.e., 60/40).

North America – Natural Gas

In order to supply its refinery and smelters in the U.S. and Canada, Alcoa generally procures natural gas on a competitive bid basis from a variety of sources including producers in the gas production
areas and independent gas marketers. For Alcoa’s larger consuming locations in Canada and the U.S., the gas commodity and the interstate pipeline transportation are procured to provide increased flexibility and reliability. Contract pricing for
gas is typically based on a published industry index or New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) price. The Company may choose to reduce its exposure to NYMEX pricing by hedging a portion of required natural gas consumption.

Australia – Natural Gas

Alcoa holds a 20% equity interest in the Dampier-to-Bunbury natural gas pipeline (this interest was purchased in October 2004). This pipeline transports gas from the northwest gas fields to Alcoa’s
alumina refineries and other users in the Southwest of Western Australia. Alcoa uses gas to co-generate steam and electricity for its alumina refining processes at the Kwinana, Pinjarra and Wagerup refineries. More than 90% of Alcoa’s gas
requirements for the remainder of the decade are secured under long-term contracts. Alcoa is considering multiple supply options to replace expiring contracts, including investing directly in projects that have the potential to deliver cost-based
gas.

Patents, Trade Secrets and Trademarks

The Company believes that its domestic and international patent, trade secret and trademark assets provide it with a significant competitive advantage. The Company’s rights under its patents, as well
as the products made and sold under them, are important to the Company as a whole and, to varying degrees, important to each business segment. The patents owned by Alcoa generally concern particular products or manufacturing equipment or techniques.
Alcoa’s business as a whole is not, however, materially dependent on any single patent, trade secret or trademark. As a result of product development and technological advancement, the Company continues to pursue patent protection in
jurisdictions throughout the world. At the end of 2014, the Company’s worldwide patent portfolio consisted of approximately 831 pending patent applications and 1,981 granted patents.

The Company has a number of trade secrets, mostly regarding manufacturing processes and material compositions that give many of its businesses important advantages in their markets. The Company continues
to strive to improve those processes and generate new material compositions that provide additional benefits.

The
Company also has a number of domestic and international registered trademarks that have significant recognition within the markets that are served. Examples include the name “Alcoa” and the Alcoa symbol for aluminum products, Howmet metal
castings, Huck®fasteners, Kawneer®building panels and
Dura-Bright®wheels with easy-clean surface treatments. The Company’s rights under its trademarks are
important to the Company as a whole and, to varying degrees, important to each business segment.

Competitive Conditions

Alcoa is subject to highly competitive conditions in all aspects of its aluminum and non-aluminum businesses. Competitors include a
variety of both U.S. and non-U.S. companies in all major markets. Price, quality, and service are the principal competitive factors in Alcoa’s markets. Where aluminum products compete with other materials—such as steel and plastics for
automotive and building applications; magnesium, titanium, composites, and plastics for aerospace and defense applications—aluminum’s diverse characteristics, particularly its strength, light weight, recyclability, and flexibility are also
significant factors. Alcoa’s technology, technical expertise, and innovation in multi-materials and in specialized alloys provide Alcoa a competitive advantage in certain markets and/or for certain






products. For Alcoa’s segments that market products under Alcoa’s brand names, brand recognition, and brand loyalty also play a role. In addition Alcoa’s competitive position
depends, in part, on the Company’s access to an economical power supply to sustain its operations in various countries.

Research
and Development

Alcoa, a light metals technology leader, engages in research and development programs that include process and
product development, and basic and applied research. Expenditures for research and development (R&D) activities were $218 million in 2014, $192 million in 2013, and $197 million in 2012.

During 2014, the Company continued to work on new developments for a number of strategic projects in all business segments. The Company also developed a portfolio of foundry alloys primarily for next
generation automotive engine and suspension applications.

The Company continued its progress leveraging new science and
technologies in 2014. For example, a new, higher strength wheel alloy (MagnaForce™) was developed for next
generation wheels, as was the development and deployment of a more corrosion resistant, more environmentally friendly Dura-Bright EVO™surface treatment. In addition, the Company launched in 2014 the Ultra ONETMwheel, a commercial truck wheel using the MagnaForceTMalloy.

In
the Global Rolled Products segment, the Company continued its progress leveraging new science and technologies in 2014. For example, the Company publicly disclosed the development of a high speed continuous casting and rolling technology for
aluminum sheet named the Micromill™. This technology converts molten metal to a full coil in 20 minutes versus current typical times of 20 days for traditional ingot based processes. In addition, significant product attributes can be improved
through this process including higher strengths, formability and corrosion resistance.

A number of products were
commercialized in 2014 including new fasteners, aluminum lithium (Al-Li), new brazing sheet alloys for stationary and automotive applications and more traditional 7xxx series alloys for various aerospace applications including the world’s
largest aluminum forming, which is the complete armored undercarriage of future transport vehicles termed the “monolithic hull.” The Company has also continued to externally license technology including the Alcoa 951 pretreatment
technology (an enabler for adhesive bonding of aluminum-intensive vehicles), shaping technology, and Colorkast™products for the consumer electronics market.

Environmental Matters

Information relating to environmental matters is included in Note N to the Consolidated Financial Statements under the caption “Environmental Matters” on pages 125-128. Approved capital
expenditures for new or expanded facilities for environmental control are approximately $120 million for 2015 and $180 million for 2016.

Employees

Total worldwide
employment at the end of 2014 was approximately 59,000 employees in 30 countries. About 37,000 of these employees are represented by labor unions. The Company believes that relations with its employees and any applicable union representatives
generally are good.

In the U.S., approximately 9,600 employees are represented by various labor unions. The largest of these is the master
collective bargaining agreement between Alcoa and the United Steelworkers (USW). On June 6, 2014, the USW ratified a new five-year labor agreement covering approximately 6,100 employees at 11 U.S. locations; the previous labor agreement expired
on May 15, 2014. There are 16 other collective bargaining agreements in the U.S. with varying expiration dates. On a regional basis, collective bargaining agreements with varying expiration dates cover approximately 15,500 employees in Europe
and Russia, 11,400 employees in North America, 5,600 employees in Central and South America, 3,500 employees in Australia, and 1,200 employees in China.
