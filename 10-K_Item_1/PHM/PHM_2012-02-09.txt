ITEM I.        BUSINESS

PulteGroup, Inc.

PulteGroup, Inc. is a Michigan corporation organized in 1956.  We are one of the largest homebuilders in the United States, and our common stock trades on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol “PHM”.  Unless the context otherwise requires, the terms "PulteGroup", the "Company", "we", "us", and "our" used herein refer to PulteGroup, Inc. and its subsidiaries.  While our subsidiaries engage primarily in the homebuilding business, we also have mortgage banking operations, conducted principally through Pulte Mortgage LLC (“Pulte Mortgage”), and title operations.

On

August 18, 2009

, we completed the acquisition of Centex Corporation (“Centex”) through the merger of PulteGroup’s merger subsidiary with and into Centex pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger dated as of

April 7, 2009

among PulteGroup, Pi Nevada Building Company, and Centex.  As a result of the merger, Centex became a wholly-owned subsidiary of PulteGroup.  Accordingly, the results of Centex are included in our consolidated financial statements from the date of the merger.

Homebuilding, our core business, includes the acquisition and development of land primarily for residential purposes within the United States and the construction of housing on such land.  Homebuilding offers a broad product line to meet the needs of home buyers in our targeted markets.  Through our brands, which include Pulte Homes, Del Webb, and Centex, we offer a wide variety of home designs, including single-family detached, townhouses, condominiums, and duplexes at different prices and with varying levels of options and amenities to our major customer segments: entry-level, move-up, and active adult.  Over our history, we have delivered nearly

600,000

homes.

As of

December 31, 2011

, we conducted our operations in


markets located throughout


states.  During


, we realigned our organizational structure and reportable segment presentation.  Accordingly, the segment information provided herein has been reclassified to conform to the current presentation for all periods presented.

We also have one reportable segment for our financial services operations, which consist principally of mortgage banking and title operations.  Our Financial Services segment operates generally in the same geographic markets as our Homebuilding segments.

Financial information for each of our reportable business segments is included in

Note 6

to our Consolidated Financial Statements.

Homebuilding Operations

Since early 2006, the U.S. housing market has been unfavorably impacted by severe weakness in new home sales attributable to, among other factors, weak consumer confidence, tightened mortgage standards, significant foreclosure activity, a more challenging appraisal environment, increased unemployment levels, and significant uncertainty in the global economy.  These conditions have contributed to sharply weakened demand for new homes and heightened pricing pressures on new and existing home sales.  New home sales in the U.S. declined to

302,000

new home sales in


, which represents the lowest level since at least 1962 and a decline of approximately 77% from the 2005 peak of 1.3 million new home sales.  We have experienced significant net losses in each year between 2007 - 2011, resulting from a combination of reduced operational profitability and significant asset impairments.

In response to these market conditions, we have made significant reductions in employee headcount and overhead costs, including a series of consolidations of our local operating divisions and corporate functions.  We also significantly curtailed our investments in inventory, implemented a more rigorous risk-based approach to land investment, and liquidated certain of our less strategic land positions.  We are seeking to better align the size and features of our homes with the current demand environment and achieve significant reductions in house cost by value-engineering our floor plans to improve the efficiency of construction, rebidding supplier contracts and working with suppliers to find cost savings, and focusing on lean production principles.  In recent years, we generated significant positive cash flow primarily through refunds of income taxes paid in prior years combined with limiting the level of reinvestment into inventory.  We have used this positive cash flow to, among other things, increase our cash reserves as well as retire outstanding debt.  Through the combination of these operational and capital structure activities, we have positioned the company for future profitability, even at the current low industry volumes.

In the long-term, we continue to believe that the national publicly-traded builders will have a competitive advantage over local builders through their ability to leverage economies of scale, access to more reliable and lower cost financing through the capital markets, ability to control and entitle large land positions, and greater geographic and product diversification.  Among the national publicly-traded peer group, we believe that builders with more significant land positions, broad geographic and product diversity, and sustainable capital positions will benefit as market conditions recover.  In the short-term, we expect that market conditions will remain challenging.  Our strategy to enhance shareholder value is centered around the following operational objectives:

•

Revenue enhancement by establishing clear business models for each of our brands based on systematic, consumer-driven input, optimizing our pricing through the expanded use of options and lot premiums, and lessening our reliance on "speculative" home sales (homes for which construction began prior to a customer order and which generally result in lower margins than pre-sold homes);

•

Reducing our house costs through common house plan management, value-engineering our house plans, working with suppliers to reduce costs, and following lean production principles;

•

Maintaining an efficient overhead structure; and

•

Improving our inventory turns.

As of

December 31, 2011

, our Homebuilding operations offered homes for sale in approximately 700 communities.  Sales prices of unit closings during


ranged from less than

$100,000

to greater than

$900,000

, with

88%

falling within the range of

$100,000

to

$400,000

.  The average unit selling price in


was

$259,000

, compared with

$259,000

in


,

$258,000

in


,

$284,000

in


, and

$322,000

in


.  The significant decrease in the average selling price of our homes since


resulted from a combination of pricing pressures due to challenging industry conditions, changes in the geographic mix of homes closed, adjusting our product offerings to better align with current market conditions, and an increase in the mix of entry-level buyers as the result of the Centex merger.


Sales of single-family detached homes, as a percentage of total unit sales, were

79%

in


, compared with

79%

in


,

77%

in


,

75%

in


, and

74%

in


.  The increase in the percentage of single-family detached homes can be attributed to a weakened demand for townhouses, condominiums, and other attached housing, as prices for detached new homes have become more affordable for entry-level and active adult homebuyers.

Our Homebuilding operations are geographically diverse and, as a result, help to insulate us from demand changes in individual markets.  Since 2006, however, such diversification has not insulated us from demand changes due to the nationwide downturn in the homebuilding industry that has had a significant adverse impact on our operations in each of our markets.

Ending backlog, which represents orders for homes that have not yet closed, was

$1.1 billion

(

3,924

units) at

December 31, 2011

and

$1.1 billion

(

3,984

units) at

December 31, 2010

.  For each order in backlog, we have received a signed customer contract and the required customer deposit, which is refundable in certain instances.  Of the orders in backlog at

December 31, 2011

, substantially all are scheduled to be closed during


, though all orders are subject to potential cancellation by or final negotiations with the customer.  In the event of cancellation, the majority of our sales contracts stipulate that we have the right to retain the customer’s deposit, though we may choose to refund the deposit in certain instances.

Land acquisition and development

We acquire land primarily for the construction of our homes for sale to homebuyers, though we periodically sell select parcels of land to third parties for commercial or other development.  Additionally, we may determine that certain land assets no longer fit into our strategic operating plans.  We select locations for development of homebuilding communities after completing a feasibility study, which includes, among other things, soil tests, independent environmental studies and other engineering work, an evaluation of the necessary zoning and other governmental entitlements, and extensive market research that enables us to match the location with our product offering to targeted consumer groups.  We consider factors such as proximity to developed areas, population and job growth patterns and, if applicable, estimated development costs.  We frequently manage a portion of the risk of controlling our land positions through the use of option contracts.  We typically acquire land with the intent to complete sales of housing units within 24 to 36 months from the date of opening a community, except in the case of certain Del Webb active adult developments and other large master-planned projects for which the completion of community build-out requires a longer time period.  As a result of the downturn in the homebuilding industry that began in 2006, however, our supply of controlled land is in excess of our short-term needs in many of our markets.

Land is generally purchased after it is properly zoned and developed or is ready for development.  In the normal course of business, we dispose of owned land not required by our homebuilding operations through sales to appropriate end users.  Where we develop land, we engage directly in many phases of the development process, including land and site planning, and obtaining environmental and other regulatory approvals, as well as constructing roads, sewers, water and drainage facilities, and community amenities, such as parks, pools, and clubhouses.  We use our staff and the services of independent engineers and consultants for land development activities.  Land development work is performed primarily by independent contractors and local government authorities who construct sewer and water systems in some areas.  At

December 31, 2011

, we controlled

131,010

lots, of which

116,933

were owned and

14,077

were under option agreements.

Sales and marketing

We are dedicated to improving the quality and value of our homes through innovative architectural and community designs.  Analyzing various qualitative and quantitative data obtained through extensive market research, we segment our potential customers into well-defined buyer groups.  Segmentation analysis provides a method for understanding the business opportunities and risks across the full spectrum of consumer groups in each market.  Once the demands of potential buyers are understood, we link our home design and community development efforts to the specific lifestyle of each targeted consumer group.  Through our portfolio of brands, each serving unique customer segments, we are able to provide a distinct experience to potential customers:

Our Centex brand is targeted to entry-level buyers, and these communities tend to be smaller with product offerings geared toward lower average selling prices.  The move-up buyers in our Pulte Homes communities tend to place more of a premium on location and amenities.  These communities typically offer larger homes at higher price points.  Through our Del Webb brand, we are better able to address the needs of active adults.  Our Del Webb brand offers both destination communities


and “in place” communities, for those buyers who prefer to remain in their current geographic area.  These highly amenitized communities offer a variety of features, including golf courses, recreational centers, and educational classes, to the age fifty-five and over buyer to maintain an active lifestyle.  In order to make the cost of these highly amenitized communities affordable to the individual homeowner, Del Webb communities tend to be very large, consisting in some cases of several thousand homes, and have longer life cycles, in some cases extending beyond 10 years.

We introduce our homes to prospective buyers through media advertising, illustrated brochures, Internet listings and link placements, mobile applications, and other advertising displays.  We have made significant enhancements in our tools and business practices to adapt our selling efforts to today's mobile customers.  In addition, our websites,

www.pulte.com, www.delwebb.com,

and

www.centex.com,

provide tools to help users find a home that meets their needs, investigate financing alternatives, communicate moving plans, maintain a home, learn more about us, and communicate directly with us.  Approximately

6.7 million

people visited our websites during


.

To meet the demands of our various customers, we have established design expertise for a wide array of product lines.  We believe that we are an innovator in home design, and we view our design capabilities as an integral aspect of our marketing strategy.  Our in-house architectural services teams and management, supplemented by outside consultants, create distinctive design features, both in exterior facades and interior options and features.  We typically offer a variety of potential options and upgrades, such as different flooring, countertop, and appliance choices, and design our base house and option packages to meet the needs of our customers as defined through rigorous market research.  Energy efficiency represents an important source of value for new homes compared to existing homes and represents a key area of focus for our home designs, including high efficiency HVAC systems and insulation, low-emissivity windows, solar power in certain geographies, and other energy-efficient features.

Typically, our sales teams, together with outside sales brokers, are responsible for guiding the customer through the sales process.  We are committed to industry-leading customer service through a variety of quality initiatives, including our customer care program, which ensures that homeowners are comfortable at every stage of the building process.  Fully furnished and landscaped model homes are used to showcase our homes and their distinctive design features.

Construction

The construction of our homes is conducted under the supervision of our on-site construction field managers.  Substantially all of our construction work is performed by independent subcontractors under contracts that, in many instances, cover both labor and materials on a fixed-price basis.  Using a selective process, we have teamed up with what we believe are premier subcontractors and suppliers to improve all aspects of the house construction process.

Continuous improvement in our house construction process is a key area of focus.  We maintain efficient construction operations by using standard materials and components from a variety of sources and utilizing standard construction practices, including lean production principles.  We also use component off-site manufacturing methods for certain portions of the construction process to provide high efficiency, high quality, and lower cost products to our customers.  During 2011, we began a more intensive effort to improve our product offerings and production processes through the following programs:

•

New product development to introduce new features and technologies based on customer validated data.

•

Common management of house plans in order to focus on building those house designs that customers value the most and that can be built at the highest quality and an efficient cost.

•

Value engineering our house plans to optimize house designs in terms of material content and ease of constructability while still providing a clear value to the consumer.  Value engineering eliminates items that add cost but that have little to no value to the customer.

•

Working with our suppliers to establish the "should cost", a data driven, collaborative effort to reduce construction costs to what the associated construction activities or materials “should cost” in the market.

We cannot determine the extent to which necessary building materials will be available at reasonable prices in the future. While the availability of materials and labor is not a significant concern under current market conditions, we have, on occasion, experienced shortages of skilled labor in certain trades and of building materials in some markets in previous years.  Additionally, the cost of certain building materials, especially lumber, steel, concrete, copper, and petroleum-based materials, is influenced by changes in global commodity prices.  To minimize the effects of changes in construction costs, the contracting and purchasing of building supplies and materials generally is negotiated at or near the time when related sales contracts are signed.  In addition, we leverage our size by actively negotiating certain materials on a national or regional basis to minimize production component cost.  We are also working to establish a more integrated system that can effectively link suppliers, contractors, and the production schedule through various strategic business partnerships and e-business initiatives.


Competition

The housing industry in the United States is fragmented and highly competitive.  While we are one of the largest homebuilders in the U.S., our national market share represented only 5% of new home sales in


.  In each of our local markets, there are numerous homebuilders with which we compete.  We also compete with sales of existing house inventory, and any provider of housing units, for sale or to rent, including apartment operators, may be considered a competitor. Conversion of apartments to condominiums further provides certain segments of the population an alternative to traditional housing, as does manufactured housing.  We compete primarily on the basis of location, price, quality, reputation, design, community amenities, and our customers' overall sales and homeownership experiences.

Seasonality

Our homebuilding operating cycle historically reflected increased revenues and cash flow from operations during the fourth quarter based on the timing of home closings.  However, the challenging market conditions experienced since early 2006 have lessened the seasonal variations of our results.  During


, we experienced a return to a somewhat more traditional demand pattern as new orders were higher in the first half of the year and home closings increased in each quarter throughout the year.  However, given the current significant uncertainty in the homebuilding industry, we can make no assurances as to when and to what degree our historical seasonality will recur.

Regulation and environmental matters

Our operations are subject to extensive regulations imposed and enforced by various federal, state, and local governing authorities.  These regulations are complex and include building codes, land zoning and other entitlement restrictions, health and safety regulations, labor practices, marketing and sales practices, environmental regulations, rules and regulations relating to mortgage financing operations, and various other laws, rules, and regulations.  Collectively, these regulations have a significant impact on the site selection and development of our communities, our house design and construction techniques, our relationships with customers, employees, and suppliers / subcontractors, and many other aspects of our business.  The applicable governing authorities frequently have broad discretion in administering these regulations, including inspections of our homes prior to closing with the customer in the majority of municipalities in which we operate.

In addition to existing regulations, more stringent requirements could be imposed in the future on homebuilders and developers, thereby increasing the cost of compliance.  On December 1, 2009, the Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) promulgated new regulations regarding effluent limitation guidelines (“ELG”) for discharges from construction and development sites.  The new regulations require all construction sites subject to National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System construction storm water permits issued by the EPA or an authorized state to implement certain sediment and erosion controls and pollution prevention measures.  These regulations also require sampling of storm water discharges and compliance with a numeric effluent limitation of 280 nephelometric turbidity units (“NTUs”) beginning August 1, 2011 for sites disturbing 20 or more acres at once and beginning February 2, 2014 for sites disturbing 10 or more acres at once.  Effective January 4, 2011, the effluent limitation standard of 280 NTUs has been stayed by the EPA until it can complete a new rulemaking to correct the numeric limitation.  The numeric limit is the only portion of the new regulations that has been stayed by the EPA.   The

EPA published a Federal Register notice on January 3, 2012 requesting additional data on the performance of technologies in controlling turbidity in stormwater discharges from construction sites.  Comments will be accepted for sixty days.  No date has yet been set by EPA for further rulemaking related to ELG.

In addition to the new ELG regulations, the EPA also announced that it is committed to and has begun a rulemaking to address post-construction storm water discharges from newly developed and redeveloped sites.  This rulemaking is expected to be completed by November 2012.  There can be no assurance whether the EPA will adopt final rules regarding post-construction storm water discharges, or, if it does, the form the final rules will take.  We are currently assessing the impact that the new ELG rules and potential post-construction rules will have on our business and results of operations.


Financial Services Operations

We conduct our financial services business, which includes mortgage and title operations, through Pulte Mortgage and other subsidiaries.  Pulte Mortgage arranges financing through the origination of mortgage loans primarily for the benefit of our homebuyers.  We are a lender approved by the FHA and VA and are a seller/servicer approved by Government National Mortgage Association (“GNMA” or "Ginnie Mae"), Federal National Mortgage Association (“FNMA” or "Fannie Mae"), Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (“FHLMC” or "Freddie Mac"), and other investors.  In our conventional mortgage lending activities, we follow underwriting guidelines established by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and private investors.  We believe that our customers’ use of our in-house mortgage and title operations provides us with a competitive advantage by enabling more control over the quality of the overall home buying process for our customers while also helping us align the timing of the house construction process with our customers’ financing needs.

During


,


, and


, we originated mortgage loans for

62%

,

63%

, and

70%

, respectively, of the homes we sold.  Such originations represented substantially all of our total originations in each of those years as the primary purpose for our mortgage operations is to support our homebuilding business.  Our capture rate, which we define as loan originations from our homebuilding business as a percentage of total loan opportunities from our homebuilding business excluding cash settlements, was

78.5%

in


,

77.5%

in


, and

85.3%

in


.

In originating mortgage loans, we initially use our own funds and subsequently sell such mortgage loans to outside investors.  Substantially all of the loans we originate are sold in the secondary market within a short period of time after origination.

We sell the servicing rights for the loans we originate on a flow basis through fixed price servicing sales contracts to reduce the risks and costs inherent in servicing loans. This strategy results in owning the servicing rights for only a short period of time.  The servicing sales contracts provide for the reimbursement of payments made when loans prepay within specified periods of time, usually 90 to 120 days after sale.

The mortgage industry in the United States is highly competitive.  We compete with other mortgage companies and financial institutions to provide attractive mortgage financing to our homebuyers.  We utilize a centralized fulfillment center staffed with loan consultants to perform our mortgage underwriting, processing and closing functions.  We believe centralizing both the fulfillment and origination of our loans improves the speed, efficiency, consistency, and quality of our mortgage operations, improving our profitability and allowing us to focus on providing attractive mortgage financing opportunities for our customers.

In originating and servicing mortgage loans, we are subject to the rules and regulations of the government-sponsored investors, and other investors, that purchase the loans we originate.  In addition to being affected by changes in these programs, our mortgage banking business is also affected by many of the same factors that impact our homebuilding business.

Our mortgage operations are also subject to potential losses associated with mortgage loans originated and sold to investors in the event of errors or omissions relating to representations and warranties that the loans sold meet certain requirements, including representations as to underwriting standards, the existence of primary mortgage insurance, and the validity of certain borrower representations in connection with the loan.  If determined to be at fault, we either repurchase the loans from the investors or reimburse the investors' losses (a "make-whole" payment).  Historically, losses related to these representations were not significant.  Beginning in 2009, we experienced a significant increase in losses as a result of the high level of loan defaults and related losses in the mortgage industry and increasing aggressiveness by investors in presenting such claims to us.  To date, the significant majority of these losses relates to loans originated in 2006 and 2007, during which period inherently riskier loan products became more common in the mortgage origination market.  Given the volatility in the mortgage industry and the uncertainty regarding the ultimate resolution of these claims, it is reasonably possible that future losses may exceed our current estimates.

Our subsidiary title insurance companies serve as title insurance agents in select markets by providing title insurance policies and examination and closing services to buyers of homes we sell.  We have only limited risk associated with our title operations due to the low incidence of claims related to underwriting risk associated with issued title insurance policies and fiduciary risk resulting from closing services.


Financial Information About Geographic Areas

Substantially all of our operations are located within the United States.  However, we have some non-operating foreign subsidiaries and affiliates, which are insignificant to our consolidated financial results.

Organization/Employees

All subsidiaries and operating units operate independently with respect to daily operations.  Homebuilding real estate purchases and other significant homebuilding, mortgage banking, financing activities, and similar operating decisions must be approved by the business unit’s management and/or corporate senior management.

At

December 31, 2011

, we employed

3,579

people, of which


people were employed in our Financial Services operations.  Except for a small group of employees in our St. Louis homebuilding division, our employees are not represented by any union.  Contracted work, however, may be performed by union contractors.  Our local and corporate management personnel are paid incentive compensation based on a combination of individual performance and the performance of the applicable business unit or the Company.  Each business unit is given a level of autonomy regarding employment of personnel, although our senior corporate management acts in an advisory capacity in the employment of subsidiary officers.  We consider our employee and contractor relations to be satisfactory.
