VULCAN’S VALUE PROPOSITION

We are

t

he

largest producer of construction aggregates

in the country with

coast-to-coast

aggregates operations. Our leading position is based upon:

§

a

favorable geographic footprint that provides attractive long-term growth prospects

§

the

largest proven and probable reserve base

in the United

States

T

hese factors allow us to provide attractive unit profitability through our strong operating expertise and price discipline.

STRATEGY FOR EXISTING AND NEW MARKETS

§

Our

aggregates

reserves are strategically located throughout the United States i

n a

reas

that are projected to grow faster than the national average and

that require large amounts of aggregates to meet

construction

demand. Vulcan-served states are estimated to generate


% of the total growth in U.S. population and



% of the total growth in U.S. household formations between 2010 and 2020.

§

We take a disciplined approach to strengthening our footprint by increasing our presence in

U.S.

metropolitan areas that are expected to grow

more

rapidly and

by

divesting assets that are no longer considered part of our long-term growth strategy. In 201

4, we

divested our Florida cement and concrete businesses for cash proceeds of $


21.4

million and

entered into

a twenty

-

year

aggregates

supply agreement

to provide aggregates

to the divested concrete operations. We redeployed $


31.8

million of this capital through acquisitions that added over




million tons of proven and probable

aggregates

reserves in key growth markets in Arizona, California, New Mexico, Texas, Virginia and Washington D.C.

§

W

here practical, we have operations located

close to our local markets because the cost of trucking

materials long distances is prohibitive.

Approximately


%

of

our total aggregates shipments are delivered exclusively

from the producing location to the customer

by truck, and another


%

are delivered by truck after reaching a

sales

yard by rail or water

.

The remaining


% of aggregates shipments are delivered directly to the customer by rail or water.

COMPETITORS

We operate in an industry that generally is fragmented with a large number of small, privately-held companies.

We estimate that the ten largest aggrega

tes producers account

ed

for approximately


% to


%

of to

tal U.S. aggregates production

in 201


. Despite being the industry leader, Vulcan’s total U.S. market share is less than


%.

O

ther publicly

traded companies among the ten largest U.S. aggregates producers include the following:

§

Cemex

S.A.B. de C.V.

§

CRH

plc

§

Heidelberg

Cement AG

§

Holcim

Ltd.

§

Lafarge

§

Martin Marietta Materials

, Inc.

§

MDU Resources

Group, Inc.

Because the U.S. aggregates industry is highly fragmented, with

over

5,000

companies managing

over

10,000

operations

during 201


, many opportunities for consolidation exist. Therefore, companies in the industry tend to grow by

acquiring existing facilities to

enter new markets or

by

extending

their

existing

market positions.

Part I


BUSINESS STRATEGY

Vulcan provides the basic materials for the infrastructure needed to

maintain and

expand the U.S. economy. Our strategy is based on our strength in aggregates. Aggregates are used in

most

types of construction and in the production of asphalt mix and ready-mixed concrete. Our materials are used to build the roads, tunnels, bridges, railroads and a

irports that connect us, and to

build the hospitals, churches,

schools,

shopping centers, and factories that are essential to our lives and the

economy.

Our

business strategies include: 1) aggregates focus, 2) coast-to-coast footprint, 3) profitable growth, 4)

managing volume, product

mix

and price to grow profitability

, and 5) effective land management.

1.

AGGREGATES FOCUS

Aggregates are used in virtually all types of public and private constructio

n a

nd practically no substitutes for quality aggregates exist. Our focus on aggregates allows

us to

:

§

BUILD AND HOLD SUBSTANTIAL RESERVES

:

T

our

reserves

are

critical to

our

long-term success

b

ecause of barriers to

entry created in

many metropolitan

markets by zoning and permitting regulations and hig

h c

osts

associated with transporting aggregates

. Our reserves are strategically located throughout the United States in high-growth areas that will require large amounts of aggregates to meet future construction demand. Aggregates operations have flexible production capabilities an

d, other than energy inputs required to process the materials,

require

virtually

no

other

raw materi

al. O

ur downstream businesses (asphalt mix and concrete

) u

se Vulcan-produced aggregates

almost exclusively

.

§

TAKE ADVANTAGE OF BEING THE LARGEST PRODUCER

:

Each aggregates operation is unique because of its location within a local market with particular

geological characteristics. Every operation, however, uses a similar group of assets to produce

saleable aggregates and provide customer service. Vulcan

is the largest aggregates company in the U.S., whether measured by

shipments

or by

aggregates

revenues.

The


ag

gregates

facilities

we operated during 201


provide

d

opportunities to standardize

operating practices

and procure equipment (fixed and mobile), parts, supplies and services in

an

efficient and cost-effective manner

,

both regionally and nationally. Additionally, we are able to share best practices across the organization and leverage our size for administrative support, customer service,

accounting,

accounts receivable and accounts payable, technical support and engineering.

2.

C

OAST-TO-COAST

FOOTPRINT

Demand for construction aggregates

correlates positively with changes in population growth, household formation and employment. We have pursued a strategy to increase our presence in

U.S.

metropolitan areas that are expected to grow the most rapidly.

In 201


, we

expanded our operational footprint i

n Arizona, California, Texa

s,

V

irginia

and Washington D.C.

, and accessed new markets in New Mexico through acquisitions. These acquisitions, totaling $


31.8

million

of investment, added more than




million tons of proven and probable

aggregates

reserves serving markets where reserves are relatively scarce.

PROFITABLE GROWTH

Our

long-term

growth is a result of

strategic

acquisition

s a

nd

investments in key operations

.

§

Strat

egic

acquisitions:

Since becoming a public company in 1956, Vulcan has principally grown by mergers and acquisitions. For example, in 1999 we acquired CalMat Co., thereby expanding our aggregates operations into California

and

Arizona and making us one of the nation’s leading producers of asphalt

mix. In

2007, we acquired Florida Rock Industries, Inc., the largest acquisition in our history. This acquisition

expanded our aggregates business in Florida and

our aggregates and ready-mixed concrete businesses in

other southeastern and

m

id-Atlantic

states

. In 2014, we completed eight transactions that expanded our aggregates

business in Arizona, California, New Mexico, Texas, Virginia and Washington D.

C.

our

asphalt mix

business in Arizona and New Mexic

te ma

ny opportunities to invest capital in high-return projects — projects that will add reserves, increase production capacity and improve

costs.

Part I


4.

MANAGING VOLUME, PRODUCT MIX AND PRICE TO GROW PROFITABILITY

We commonly think of three major profit drivers that must be managed in combination

.

§

Price for Service

—

We seek to receive full and fair value for the quality of products and service we provide. We should be paid appropriately for helping our customers be successful.

§

Operating Efficiency and Leverage

—

W

e

focus on

rigorous cost management throughout

the

economic cycl

e. Sm

all savings per ton add up to significant cost reductions.

§

Sales and Production Mix

—

W

e a

djust

production levels to meet

varying

market

conditions

. Managing inventories responsibly results in

improved cost performance and

an improved

return on capital

.

We manage these factors locally, and align

o

u

r

talent and incentives accordingly.

Our knowledgeable and

experienced

workforce and our flexible production capabilitie

s a

llo

w

us to manage

operational and overhead

costs aggressive

ly

.

As a result of these cost controls coupled with a disciplined approach to pricing

,

since 2012,

ou

r

Aggregates segment’s

g

ross profit

has

increased 55% on volume improvement of 15%.

While Aggregates

segment

gross profit has grown at a significantly greater rate than volume over the past couple of years, we have not yet fully realized

our maximum unit profitability.

§

On

Price for Service

—

Our

expanding margins have

yet to

benefit

from the

mid-to-high single digit price gains associated with cyclical recoveries

. We believe that these gains will begin to take hold in 2015.

§

On

Operating Efficiency and Leverage

—

We are operating a capital-intensive business at 50-60% capacity and are extremely well positioned to further leverage fixed costs to sales as we move forward.

§

On

Sales and Production Mix

—

As the recovery continues and as we see a larger portion of new construction activity in the

end

-

use

mix, we will sell the entire production mix much more efficiently and at fuller value.

5.

EFFECTIVE

LA

ND MANAGEMENT

We believe that effective land management is both a business strategy and a social responsibility that contributes to our success. Good stewardship requires the careful use of existing resources as well as long-term planning

because mining, ultimately, is an interim use of the land. Therefore, we strive to achieve a balance between the value we create through our mining activities and the value we create through effective post-mining land management. We continue t

o fo

cus our actions on

prudent

decisions regarding the life cycle management of the land we currently hold and will hold in the future.

Part I


PRODUCT LINES

We have four operating (and reportable) segments organized around our principal product lines:

1.

Aggregates

2.

Asphalt Mix

3.

Concrete

4.

Calcium (formerly

Cement

)

1. AGGREGATES

A number of factors affect the U.S. aggregates industry and our busines

s, i

ncluding markets,

the location and quality of

reserves and demand cycles.

§

Local markets:

Aggregates have a high weight-to-value ratio and, in most cases,

are

produced near where they are used; if not, transportation can cost more than the material

s, r

endering

them

uncompetitive compared to locally produced materials.

Exceptions to this typical market structure include areas along the U.S. Gulf Coast and the Eastern Seaboard where there are limited supplies of locally available high quality aggregates. We serve these markets fro

m q

uarries

that have access to long-haul transportation

— shipping by barge and rail — and from our quarry on Mexico’s Yucatan Peninsula. We transport aggregates from Mexico to the U.S. principally on our three Panamax-class, self-unloading ships.

§

Diverse markets

:

Large quantities of aggregates are used in virtually all types of public- and private-sector

construction project

s, su

ch as highways, airports, water and sewer systems, industrial manufacturing facilities, residential and nonresidential buildings. Aggregates also are used widely as railroad track ballast.

§

Location and quality of reserves:

We

currently ha

ve

15.8

billion

tons of permitted and proven or probable aggregates reserves. The bulk of these reserves are located in areas where we expect greater than average rates of growth in population, jobs and households, which require new infrastructure, housing, offices, schools and other development. Such growth

depends on

aggregates for construction. Zoning and permitting regulations in some markets have made it increasingly difficult for the aggregates industry to expand existing quarries or to develop new quarries. These restriction

s c

urtail expansion in certain areas, but th

ey al

so increase the value of our reserves at existing locations.

§

Demand cycles:

Long-term growth in

demand for aggregates is largely driven by growth in population, jobs and households. While short- and medium-term demand for aggregates fluctuates with economic cycles, declines have historically been followed by strong recoveries, with each peak esta

blishing a new historical

high.

Part I


I

n addition, the following factors influence the aggregates market:

§

Highly fragmented industry:

The U.S. aggregates industry is composed of

over

5,000

companies that manage

over

10,000

operations. This fragmented structure provides many opportunities for

consolidation. Companies in the industry commonly enter new markets or expand positions in existing markets through the acquisition of existing facilities.

§

Relatively stable demand from the public sector

:

Publicly funded construction activity has historically been more stable

and less cyclical

than privately funded construction

,

and

generally

requires more aggregates per dollar of construction spending. Private construction (primarily residential and nonresidential buildings) typically

is

more affected by general

economic cycles than

p

ublicly funded projects (particularly highways, roads and bridges

), w

hich

tend to

receive more consistent levels of funding throughout economic cycles.

§

Limited product substitution:

T

here are

limited

substitutes for quality aggregates.

R

ecycled concrete

and asphalt have

certain

applications as a lower-cost alternative to virgin aggregates. However,

due to technical specifications

many types of construction projects cannot be served by recycled concre

te,

but require the use of virgin aggregates to meet specifications and performance-based criteria for durability, strength and other qualities

.

Moreover,

the amount of

recycled asphalt

included in asphalt mix as a substitute for aggregates

is limited

due

to

specifications

.

§

Widely used in downstream products:

In the production process, aggregates are processed for specific applications or uses. Two products that use aggregates

as a raw material

are asphalt mix and ready-mixed concrete. By weight, aggregates comprise

approximately

95%

of asphalt mix and

78%

of ready-mixed concrete.

§

Flexible production capabilities:

The production of aggregates is a mechanical process in which stone is crushed and, through a series of screens, separated into various sizes depending on how it will be used. Production capacity can be flexible by adjusting operating hours to meet changing market demand.

§

raw material inputs

largely under our control

:

Unlike typical industrial manufacturing industries, the aggregates industry does not require the input of raw material beyond owned or leased aggregates reserves. Stone, sand and gravel are naturally occurring resources. However, production does require the use of explosives, hydrocarbon fuels and electric

power.

AGGREGATES

MARKETS

We focus on the U.S. markets with

above-average

long-term

expected population growth and where construction is expected to expand. Because transportation is a significant part of the delivered cost of aggregates, our facilities are typically located in the markets they serve or

have

access to economical transportation

via rail, barge or ship

to

a particular end market

. We serve both the public and the private sectors.

PUBLIC SECTOR

CONSTRUCTION

Public sector construction includes spending by federal, state, and local governments for highways,

bridges and airports as well as other infrastructure construction for sewer and waste disposal systems, water supply systems, dams, reservoirs and other public construction projects. Construction for power plants and other utilities is funded from both public and

private sources. In 2014

, publicly funded construction

accounted for

approximately


%

of

our total aggregates shipments.

§

Public Sector Funding:

Generally, public sector construction spending is more stable than private sector construction because public sector spending is less sensitive to interest rates and has historically been supported by multi-year legislation and programs. For example, the federal

surface

transportation bill is a principal source of funding for public infrastructure and transportation projects. For over two decades,

a portion of transportation

projects ha

s

been funded through a series of multi-year bills.

Some 40% of transportation projects are federally-funded, with special emphasis given to the largest and most complex projects.

The long-term

nature of such legislation

is

important

because it provides state departments of transportation with the ability to plan and execute long-

range

, com

plex highway projects. Federal highway spending is governed by multi-year authorization bills and annual budget appropriations using funds largely from the Federal Highway Trust Fund. This

T

rust

Fund

receives funding from taxes on gasoline and other levies. The level of state spending on infrastructure varies across the United States and depends on individual state needs and economies. In 201


,

approximately


%

of

our aggregates sales by volume

was

used in highway construction projects.

Part I


§

federal highway funding

:

On August 8, 2014,

Congress passed

an extension of

the Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21

st

Century Act (

MAP-21

)

. The two-year federal highway bill had received strong

bipartisan suppor

t i

n both the House and the Senate, an

d w

as signed into law by the President on July 6, 2012.

The extension of

MAP-2

1 provides

state departments of transportation with

federal highway program authority through May 31, 2015. The extension continues federal support for transportation infrastructure programs at current funding levels,

helping

rebuild America’s aging infrastructure by modernizing and reforming our current transportation system, while also protecting millions of jobs.

MAP-21

maintained

essentially level f

unding

in

Fiscal Year

s



and 2015

, w

ith approximately $105 billion

for

total

transportation

funding

through Fiscal Year 2014

. It extends the Highway Trust Fund and tax collections through Fiscal Year 2016, adding additional stability to the Federal Highway Program.

Congressional leaders have stated their intention to act in 2015 to replace the extension of MAP-21 with a multi-year authorization that includes revenue stability for federal surface transportation programs.

The extension of MAP-21 maintained the baseline increase to the

Transportation Infrastructure Finance & Innovation Act (TIFIA) program. Funding for this program increase

d

to $1.75 billion over the two-yea

r M

AP-21 period

,

from $122 million per year under the previous multi-year highway bill

known as SAFETEA-LU

. TIFIA funding is typically leveraged by a factor of 10

, creating the potential for $17.5 billion in additional major project funding for Fiscal Years 2013 and 2014.

The U.S. Department of Transportation estimates this TIFIA funding support

s

$30 to $50 billion in new construction.

G

iven administrative requirements and other factors,

the TIFIA program began to have a meaningful impact on aggregates shipments in 2014, and should continue to do so into 2015 and beyond.

TIFIA is a highly popular program that stimulates private capital investment for projects of national or regional significance in key growth areas throughout the United States, including

large portions of our footpri

nt.

The program provide

s c

redit assistance in the form of secured loans, loan guarantees and lines of credit to major transportation infrastructure project

s. E

ligible

sponsor

s i

nclude state and local governments, private firms, special authorities and transportation improvement districts. Eligible projects include highways and bridges, large multi-modal projects, as well as freight transfer and transit facilities. We are well positioned in states that are likely to get a disproportionate number of TIFIA-funded projects.

M

AP-21

’s

positive framework for future authorizations

was continued in the extension passed this summer. Its

significant reforms,

consolidation

and

simplification of

federal highway programs,

acceleration of

the project delivery process,

and expanded

project financing and

promotion of

public-private partnership opportunities

have paved the way for further progress as Congress works to pass a new multi-year highway bill.

§

WATER INFRASTRUCTURE

:

In June 2014, President Obama signed into law the

Water Resources

Reform and

Development Act (WR

R

DA),

providing

legal authority for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to

pursue

hundreds of navigation, flood control, and ecosystem restoration infrastructure projects along rivers, canals, ports and inland waterways throughout the natio

n. W

e, along with

numerous

business allies, strong

ly

supported WRRDA

for its

importance to the U.S. economy

, t

he pressing need to

upgrade U.S.

harbors, ports and inland waterways

, and for construction projects using our products. T

he

law

address

es

a significant backlog of water infrastructure projects,

focused on

improved

port

dredging, and

streamlines

permitting

to speed up project delivery.

Many of the large southern ports that would benefit from

WRRDA

, as they gear up for expected increases in freight volumes

related to

expansion of the Panama Canal, lie within our footprint.

Additionally,

WRRDA includes

innovative public-private

authorizations and a new

Water Infrastructure Financing and Innovation Act (WIFIA),

modeled after the TIFIA program

.

As enacted,

WIFIA is

authorized

to support large projects exceeding $


million that otherwise

would go unaddressed. A

s with TIFIA, it provides funding for up to 49% of a project's estimated cost, involves low interest rates, and includes favorable repayment terms as well as subrogation of the government's interest in order to encourage other investors.

Part I


Private sector

CONSTRUCTION

The private sector

construction

market

s i

nclude both nonresidential building

construction

and residential construction and

are

considerably

more cyclical than public construction. In 201


, privately-funded construction accounted

for

approximately


%

of our

total aggregates shipments.

§

Nonresidential Construction:

Private nonresidential

building

construction includes a wide array of projects. Such projects generally are more aggregates intensive than residential construction

.

Overall demand in private nonresidential construction generally

is

driven by job growth, vacancy rates, private infrastructure needs and demographic trends. The growth of the private workforce creates demand for offices, hotels and restaurants. Likewise, population growth generates demand for stores, shopping centers, warehouses and parking decks as well as hospitals, churches and entertainment facilities. Large industrial projects, such as a new manufacturing facility, can increase the need for other manufacturing plants to supply parts and assemblies. Construction activity in this end market is influenced by a firm's ability to finance a project and the cost of such financing.

C

ontract awards are a leading indicator of future construction activity and a continuation of the recent trend in awards should translate to growth in demand for

aggregates. In



,

total

nonresidential

contract awards, as measured in square feet, increased for the

4th

year in a row.

P

rivate nonresidential contract awards were up approximately


million square feet, or


%.

Office buildings, retail construction and manufacturing facilities

accounted for all of this growt

h. Em

ployment

gro

wth, att

ractive lending standards and general recovery in the economy will help drive

continued

growth in construction activity in this end market.

§

Residential Construction:

The majority of residential construction is for single-family houses with the remainder consisting of multi-family construction (i.e., two family houses, apartment buildings and condominiums). Public housing comprises only a small portion of housing demand. Household formations in

our m

arkets

continue to outpace household formations in

the

rest of the

U

nited

S

tates

.

Construction activity in this end market is influenced by the cost and availability of mortgage

financing.

U.S.

housing starts, as measured by

Dodge Analytics

data, peaked in early 2006 at over 2 million units annually. By the end of 2009, total housing starts had declined to less than 600,000 units, well below prior historical lows of approximately 1 million units annually.

In 2014, total

annual

housing starts

surpassed 1 million

unit

s.

The growth in residential construction bodes well for continued recovery in our markets.

ADDITIONAL AGGREGATES PRODUCTS

AND MARKETS

We sell

aggregates that are used as

balla

st fo

r construction and maintenance of railroad track

s

. We also sell riprap and jetty stone for erosion control along

roads and

waterways.

In addition, stone can be used as a feedstock for cement and lime plants and for making a variety of adhesives, fillers and extenders. Coal-burning power plants use

limestone in scrubbers to reduce harmful emissions. Limestone that is crushed to a

fine powder can be sold as

agricultural lime.

We

sell a relatively small amount of construction aggregates outside of the United States, principally in the areas surrounding our large quarry on the Yucatan Peninsula in Mexico. Nondomestic sales and long-lived assets outside the United States are reported in Note 15 "

-

RELATED ITEMS

SEASONALITY AND CYCLICAL NATURE OF OUR BUSINESS

Almost all

of

our products are produced and consumed outdoors. Seasonal changes and other weather-related conditions can affect the production and sales volumes of our products. Therefore, the financial results for any quarter do not necessarily indicate the results expected for the year. Normally, the highest sales and earnings are in the third quarter and the lowest are in the first quart

er. Fu

rthermore, our sales and earnings are sensitive to national, regional and local economic conditions and particularly to cyclical swings in construction spending, primarily in the private sector. The levels of construction spending are affected by

a number of factors including

changing interest rates and demographic and population fluctuations.

CUSTOMERS

No material part of our business

depends

upon any

single

customer whose loss would have

a significant

adverse effect on our business. In 201


, ou

r f

ive

largest

customers accounted

for

6.4

%

of our total revenues (excluding internal sales), and no single customer accounted for more than

2.2

%

of our total revenues. Our products typically are sold to private industry and not directly to governmental entities. Although approximately


% to



%

of our

aggregates shipments have historically been used in publicly funded construction, such as highways, airports and government buildings, relatively insignificant sales are made directly to federal, state, county or municipal governments/agencies. Therefore, although reductions in state and federal funding can curtail publicly funded construction, our business is not directly subject to renegotiation of profits or termination of contracts with state or federal governments.

Part I


ENVIRONMENTAL COSTS AND GOVERNMENTAL REGULATION

Our operations are subject to

numerous

federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the

protection of the

environment and

worker

health and saf

ety;

examples include

regulation of

facility air emissions and water discharges, waste management, protection of wetlands, listed and threatened species, noise and dust exposure control for workers, and safety regulations under both

Mine Safety and Health Administration (

MSHA

)

and

Occupational Safety and Health Administration (

OSHA). Compliance with these various regulations requires a substantial capital investment, and ongoing expenditures for the operation and maintenance of systems and implementation of programs.

We estimate that capital expenditures for environmental control facilities in 201


and 201


will be approximately

$

11.0

million and $

10.7

million, respectively

. These anticipated expenditures are not expected to have

a

material impact on our earnings or competitive position.

Frequently, we are required by state and local regulations or contractual obligations to reclaim our former mining sites. These reclamation liabilities are recorded in our financial statements as a liability at the time the obligation arises. The fair value of such obligations is capitalized and depreciated over the estimated useful life of the owned or leased site. The liability is accreted through charges to operating expenses. To determine the fair value, we estimate the cost for a third party to perform the legally required reclamation, which is adjusted for inflation and risk and includes a reasonable profit margin. All reclamation obligations are reviewed at least annually. Reclaimed quarries often have potential for use in commercial or residential development or as reservoirs or landfills. However, no projected cash flows from these anticipated uses have been considered to offset or reduce the estimated reclamation liability.

For additional information regarding reclamation obligations (referred to in our financial statements as asset retirement obligations), see Notes 1 and 17 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data."

PATENTS AND TRADEMARKS

We do not own or have a license or other rights under any patents,

registered

trademarks or trade names that are material to any of our reporting segments.
