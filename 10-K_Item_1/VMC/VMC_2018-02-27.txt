BUSINESS STRATEGY

We provide

the basic materials for the infrastructure needed to

maintain and

expand the U.S. economy.

We operate primarily in the U.S. and

are t

he nation’s largest

supplier

of construction aggregates (primarily crushed stone, sand and gravel) and a major producer of asphalt mix and ready-mixed concrete.

Our strategy

and competitive advantage are

based on our strength in aggregates. Aggregates are used in

most

types of construction and in the production of asphalt mix and ready-mixed concrete. Our materials are used to build the roads, tunnels, bridges, railroads and a

irports that connect us, and to

build the hospitals,

s

chools,

shopping centers,

f

actories

and places of worship

that are essential to our lives and

the

economy.

AGGREGATES FOCUS

Aggregates are used in virtually all types of public and private constructio

n a

nd practically no substitutes for quality aggregates exist.

Given o

ur focus on aggregates

, we

:

BUILD AND HOLD SUBSTANTIAL RESERVES

:

O

ur

reserves

are

critical to

our

long-term success

. They

are strategically located throughout the United States in high-growth areas that

are expected to

require large amounts of aggregates to meet future construction demand.

Moreover, there are significant

barriers to entry in many metropolitan markets

due to stringent

zoning and permitting regulation

s.

Aggregates operations have flexible production capabilities an

d, other than energy inputs required to process the materials,

require

virtually

no

other

raw materi

al. O

ur downstream businesses (asphalt and concrete

) u

se Vulcan-produced aggregates

almost exclusively

.

TAKE ADVANTAGE OF

SIZE AND SCALE

:

Each aggregates operation is unique because of its location within a local market with particular

geological characteristics. Every operation, however, uses a similar group of assets to produce

saleable aggregates and provide customer

service.

We are

t

he largest aggregates

supplier

in the U.S. Our


active

aggregates facilities as of December 31, 201


,

provide opportunities to standardize operating practices and procure equipment (fixed and mobile), parts, supplies and services in an efficient and cost-effective manner, both regionally and nationally. Additionally, we are able to share best practices across the organization and leverage our size for administrative support, customer service, accounting,

procurement

, technical support and engineering.

COAST-TO-COAST FOOTPRINT

Demand for construction aggregates correlates positively with changes in population growth, household formation and employment. We have pursued a strategy to increase our presence in U.S. metropolitan areas that are expected to grow the most rapidly. Our strategic locations serve


of the top 25

highest-growth

U.S. metropolitan areas

in


states

plus the District of Columbia

.

PROFITABLE GROWTH

Our

long-term

growth is a result of

strategic

acquisition

s a

nd

investments in key operations

.

Strategic

acquisitions

AND DISPOSITIONS

:

Since becoming a public company in



, Vulcan has principally grown by mergers and acquisitions. For example, in 1999 we acquired CalMat Co., thereby expanding our aggregates operations into California

and

Arizona and making us one of the nation’s leading producers of asphalt

mix. In

2007, we acquired Florida Rock Industries, Inc., the largest acquisition in our history. This acquisition

expanded our aggregates business in Florida and

our aggregates and ready-mixed concrete businesses in

other southeastern and

m

id-Atlantic

states

.

Additionally, throughout our history

we have completed many bolt-on acquisitions that have c

ontributed significantly to our growth.

In

2017, we

made a number of bolt-on acquisitions, making attractive additions to our coast-to-coast footprint in states ranging from Georgia to California and up to Illinois and Virginia. We added approximately 615 million tons of proven and probable reserves to our leading reserve base, further strengthened our best-in-class

aggregates

distribution network (adding 16 new rail yards in our Florida, Georgia and South Carolina markets) and

added asphalt operations in Tennessee to take further advantage of our strong aggregates position.

MANAGING VOLUME, PRODUCT MIX AND PRICE TO GROW PROFITABILITY

We

focus on three major profit drivers that must be managed in combination.

§

Price for Service

—

We seek to receive full and fair value for the quality of products and service

s

we provide. We should be paid appropriately for helping our customers be successful.

O

ur expanding margins will continue to benefit from the compounding pricing gains associated with cyclical recoveries

.

§

Operating Efficiency and Leverage

—

We focus on rigorous cost management throughout the economic cycle. Small savings per ton add up to significant cost reductions.

W

e are operating a capital-intensive business

well below full

capacity and are extremely well positioned to further leverage fixed costs to sales as we move forward.

§

Sales and Production Mix

—

We adjust production levels to meet varying market conditions. Managing inventories responsibly results in improved cost performance and an improved return on capital.

A

s the recovery continues and as we see a larger portion of new construction activity in the

end-use

mix, we will sell the entire production mix much more efficiently and at fuller value.

We manage these factors locally, and align our talent and incentives accordingly. Our knowledgeable and experienced workforce and our flexible production capabilities allow us to manage operational and overhead costs aggressively. Recovery in demand serves as a tailwind for all three major profit

drivers

.

Part I

EFFECTIVE

LA

ND MANAGEMENT

We own or lease well over 200,000 acres of land, and we manage it carefully throughout all phases of its productive use.

We believe that effective land management is both a business strategy and a social responsibility that contributes to our success.

As a land-based company, we feel a special responsibility to the environment and the communities around us.

Good stewardship requires the careful use of existing resources as well as long-term planning

because mining, ultimately, is an interim use of the land. Therefore, we strive to achieve a balance between the value we create through our mining activities and the value we create through effective post-mining land management. We continue t

o fo

cus our actions on

prudent

decisions regarding the life cycle management of

the land we own.

PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT

Our

aggregates

reserves are strategically located throughout the United States i

n a

reas

that are projected to grow faster than the national average and

that require large amounts of aggregates to meet

construction

demand. Vulcan-served states are estimated to generate

1. AGGREGATES

Our construction aggregates are used in a number of ways:

§

as a base material underneath highways, walkways, airport runways, parking lots and railroads

§

to aid in water filtration, purification and erosion control

§

as a raw material used in combination with other resources to construct many of the items we rely on to sustain our quality of life including:

§

houses and apartments

§

roads, bridges and parking lots

§

schools and hospitals

§

commercial buildings and retail space

§

sewer systems

§

power plants

§

airports and runways

Factors that affect the U.S. aggregates industry and our busine

ss i

nclude:

§

Lo

catio

n o

f reserves:

We

currently ha

ve

16.0

billion

tons of permitted and proven or probable aggregates reserves. The bulk of these reserves are located in areas where we expect greater than average rates of growth in population, jobs and households, which require new infrastructure, housing, offices, schools and other developmen

t. Z

oning and permitting regulations in some markets have made it increasingly difficult for the aggregates industry to expand existing quarries or to develop new quarries. These restriction

s c

urtail expansion in certain areas, but th

ey al

so increase the value of our reserves at existing locations.

§

Limited product substitution:

There are limited substitutes for quality aggregates. Recycled concrete and asphalt have certain applications as a lower-cost alternative to virgin aggregates. However, due to technical specifications many types of construction projects cannot

be served by recycled concret

e

and

require the use of virgin aggregates to meet specifications and performance-based criteria for durability, strength and other qualities. Moreover, the amount of recycled asphalt included in asphalt mix as a substitute for aggregates is limited due to specifications.

§

H

ighly fragmented industry:

The U.S. aggregates industry is composed of over

5,700

companies that manage

more than

10,000

operations. This fragmented structure provides many opportunities for consolidation. Companies in the industry commonly enter new markets or expand positions in existing markets through the acquisition of existing facilities.

Through strategic acquisitions and investments, we have

developed

an unmatched coast-to-coast footprint of

strategically located

permitted reserves

concentrated in and serving the nation’s key growth centers. We have over

20,000

customers in


states, the District of Columbia, Mexico and the Bahamas.

§

F

lexible production capabilities:

The production of aggregates is a mechanical process in which stone is crushed and, through a series of screens, separated into various sizes depending on how it will be used. Production capacity can be flexible by adjusting operating hours to meet changing market demand.

§

raw material inputs largely under our control:

Unlike typical industrial manufacturing industries, the aggregates industry does not require the input of raw material beyond owned or leased aggregates reserves. Stone, sand and gravel are naturally occurring resources. However, production does require the use of explosives, hydrocarbon fuels and electric

power.

Part I


§

Local markets:

Aggregates have a high weight-to-value ratio and, in most cases,

must be

produced near where they are used; if not, transportation can cost more than the materials, rendering them uncompetitive compared to locally produced materials. Exceptions to this typical market structure include areas along the U.S. Gulf Coast and the Eastern Seaboard where there are limited sup

plies of locally

available

high-

quality aggregates. We serve these markets from quarries that have access to

cost-effective

long-haul transportation — shipping by barge and rail — and from our quarry on Mexico’s Yucatan

Peninsula with our

fleet of Panamax-class, self-unloading ships

.

We operate an extensive logistics network along the U.S. Gulf Coast and the Eastern Seaboard as shown below:

﻿

W

here practical, we have operations located

close to our local markets because the cost of trucking

materials long distances is prohibitive.

Approximately



%

of

our total aggregates shipments are delivered exclusively

from the producing location to the customer

by truck, and another


%

are delivered by truck after reaching a

sales

yard by rail or water

.

The remaining


% of aggregates shipments are delivered directly to the customer by rail or water.

Part I


§

Demand cycles:

Long-term growth in demand for aggregates is largely driven by growth in population, jobs and households. While short-

term

and medium-term demand for aggregates fluctuates with economic cycles, declines have historically been followed by strong recoveries, with each peak establishing a new historical high.

The drivers underpinning demand recovery — and sustained, multi-year volume and pricing growth — remain firmly in place, in both the public and private sectors of the economy. They include: population growth; gains in total employment and in household income and wages; a continuing increase in household formations; the

growing need for additional

housing stock and housing demand; a multi-year federal transportation law in place and continuing increases in transportation funding at sta

te

and local

le

vels; record stat

e ta

x receipts; public investment in infrastructure that is still well below the long-term trend-line

,

and increasing political awareness and acceptance of the need to invest in infrastructure.

AGGREGATES MARKETS

We focus on the U.S. markets with above-average long-term expected population growth and where construction is expected to expand. Because transportation is a significant part of the delivered cost of aggregates, our facilities are typically located in the markets they serve or have access to economical transportation via rail, barge or ship to a particular end market. We serve both the public and the private sectors.

Public sector construction activity has historically been more stable and less cyclical than privatel

y-f

unded construction, and generally requires

more aggregates per dollar of construction spending.

Private sector construction

(primarily residential and nonresidential buildings) typically

is

more affected by general

economic cycles than

p

ublicly funded projects (particularly highways, roads and bridges

), w

hich

tend to

receive more consistent levels of funding throughout economic cycles.

Part I


PUBLIC SECTOR

CONSTRUCTION

Public sector construction includes spending by federal, state, and local governments for highways,

bridges

, buildings

, airports, schools and

prisons

as well as other infrastructure construction for sewer and waste disposal systems, water supply systems, dams, reservoirs and other public construction projects. Construction for power plants and other utilities is funded from both public and

private sources. In 201


, publicly funded construction

accounted for

approximately


%

of

our total aggregates

shipments

,

and

approximately


%

of

our aggregates sales by volume

were

used in highway construction projects.

§

Public Sector Funding:

Generally, public sector construction spending is more stable than private sector construction

spending;

public sector spending is less sensitive to interest rates an

d s

pending

has historically been supported by multi-year

laws

, which provide certainty

in

funding amounts, program structures, and rules and regulations

.

Federal spending is governed by authorization, budget and appropriations laws. The level of state and local spending on infrastructure varies across the United States and depends on individual state needs and economies.

In


7,

seve

n

state

legislatures voted to raise

motor fuel

taxes for

transportation investments

, bringing the total to


states since



. States are also raising revenues through one-time increases in revenues outside of fuel taxes

. In

the 2017 general election

,

voters in twenty states approved more than 80% of local transportation investment ballot measures; since 2007, 74% of more than 1,200 measures have been approved.

§

federal highway funding

:

I

n Decemb

e

r 2

015,

President

Obama

signed a new, long-term federal highway

and transit authorization

bill

,

Fixing America’s Surface Transportation Infrastructure Act (FAST Act),

into law after the final legislation

received strong, bipartisan support in both the House and the

Senate.

The FAST Act provides multi-year funding to state and local governments in support of road, bridge, intermodal and public transportation projects.

The FAST Act increases Federal-Aid Highway Program funding from $41 billion in the federal fiscal year (FFY)


to $47 billion in FFY 2020.

Federal

spending

for highways

is supported by

$

208 billion

in

excise taxes on gasoline and diesel fuels, taxes on heavy truck sales and use, and heavy truck tire taxes

a

nd by a $70 billion transfer of general funds to the

F

ederal Highway Trust F

und.

The long-term nature of t

he FAST

Act is

important. T

he Federal-Aid Highway Program is the largest component of the law and has provided, on average, 52% of all state capital investment in roads and bridges over the last 10

years.

This multi-year authorization and the associated dedicated funding provides state departments of transportation with the ability to plan and execute long-range, complex highway projects.

The FAST Act also contains important policy changes.

To further accelerate the project delivery process, it augments the environmental review and permitting process reforms contained in the prior law, Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21

st

Century Act (MAP-21). The new law also provides assistance for states making investments in major capital projects

—

particularly freight projects. In states where

we

operate, we are well-positioned to serve the large general contractors who will compete for new freight and other major capacity projects that will move forward with this FAST Act funding

and policy implementation

.

Project financing remains an

important additional component of overall

surface transportation

spending

, with

the

Transportation Infrastructure Finance & Innovation Act (TIFIA) program

authorized at

$275 million

(

in line with the previous program outlays

) and

growing to $300 million by 2020

.

The FAST Act also created a new National Surface Transportation and Innovative Finance Bureau to provide technical assistance to states seeking to pursue public-private partnerships and other financing arrangements

for transportation projects

.

§

WATER INFRASTRUCTURE:

The Water Infrastructure Improvements for the Nation Act of 2016 (

WIIN

), which we and numerous other business allies strongly supported, was signed into law in December 2016. This law is the successor to the

Water Resources Reform and Development Act of 2014 (WRRDA).

It reauthorizes needed investment in America’s ports, channels, locks, dams, and other infrastructure that supports the maritime and waterways transportation system and provides flood protection for communities. It also provides funding to the Water Infrastructure Financing and Innovation Act (WIFIA), which was

modeled after the highly popular TIFIA program in the surface transportation sector.

Created in WRRD

A,

WIFIA will allow for federal credit assistance to water resources projects

in the form of low-cost loans, loan guarantees and lines of credit

.

Part I


Private sector

CONSTRUCTION

The private sector

construction

market

s i

nclude both nonresidential building

construction

and residential construction and

are

considerably

more cyclical than public construction. In 201


, privately-funded construction accounted

for

approximately


%

of our

total aggregates shipments.

§

Nonresidential

Construction:

Private

nonresidential

building

construction includes a wide array of projects. Such projects generally are more aggregates intensive than residential construction

.

Overall demand in private nonresidential construction generally

is

driven by job growth, vacancy rates, private infrastructure needs and demographic trends. The growth of the private workforce creates demand for offices, hotels and restaurants. Likewise, population growth generates demand for stores, shopping centers, warehouses and parking decks as well as hospitals,

places of worship

and entertainment facilities. Large industrial projects, such as a new manufacturing facility, can increase the need for other manufacturing plants to supply parts and assemblies. Construction activity in this end market is influenced by a firm's ability to finance a project and the cost of such financing.

This end market also includes capital investments in public nonresidential facilities to meet the needs of a growing population.

Nonresidential construction is expected to continue to be a stable source of volume growth in



based on the following assumptions: (1) continuing employment growth should provide support, as it has in the past, (2) current backlogs that our customers

,

industry groups

and outside economists

are reporting should continue to be a source of deman

d

,

a

nd (3)

with a stable tax base, local governments should use

funds to make capital investments in schools and other public nonresidential facilities to meet the needs of a growing population.

§

Residential Construction:

Household

formations in

our m

arkets

continue to outpace household formations in

the

rest of the

U

nited

States.

The majority of residential construction is for single-family hous

ing

with the remainder consisting of multi-family construction (i.e., two family houses, apartment buildings and condominiums). Public housing comprises only a small portion of housing demand.

Construction activity in this end market is influenced by the cost and availability of mortgage

financing

and builders’ ability to maintain skilled labor

.

U.S.

housing starts, as measured by

Dodge

Data &

Analytics

data, peaked in early 2006 at over 2 million units annually. By the end of 2009, total housing starts had declined to less than

0.6 million

units, well below prior historical lows of approximately 1 million units annually.

In 201


, total

annual

housing starts

in the U.S.

reached almost 1.3 million units

. Housing

starts were

particularly robust in our markets, which grew at almost twice the rate of the nation as a whole

.

The

consistent

growth in residential construction bodes well for continued recovery in our markets.

ADDITIONAL AGGREGATES PRODUCTS

AND MARKETS

We sell

aggregates that are used as

balla

st fo

r construction and maintenance of railroad track

s

. We also sell riprap and jetty stone for erosion control along

roads and

waterways.

In addition, stone can be used as a feedstock for cement and lime plants and for making a variety of adhesives, fillers and extenders. Coal-burning power plants use

limestone in scrubbers to reduce harmful emissions. Limestone that is crushed to a

fine powder can be sold as

agricultural lime.

We

sell a relatively small amount of construction aggregates outside of the United States, principally in the areas surrounding our large quarry on the Yucatan Peninsula in Mexico. Nondomestic sales and long-lived assets outside the United States are reported in Note 15 "

Segment Reporting

"

in Item 8 "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data."

VERTICAL INTEGRATION

While aggregates is our focus and primary business, we believe vertical integration between aggregates and downstream products, such as asphalt mix and ready-mixed concrete, can be managed effectively in certain markets

generati

ng

acceptable financial returns

and enhancing financial returns in our core Aggregates segment

. We produce and sell asphalt mix and/or ready-mixed concrete primarily in our mid-Atlantic, Georgia, Southwestern

, Tennessee

and Western markets. Aggregates comprise approximately 95% of asphalt mix by weight and 80% of ready-mixed concrete by weight. In both of these downstream businesses, aggregates are primarily supplied from our operations.

Part I



. ASPHALT

We produce and sell asphalt mix

in

Arizona, California,

New Mexico

, Tennessee

and Texas

.

In December 2017, we strengthened our asphalt position in Arizona by swapping ready-mixed concrete operations for an asphalt mix operation.

In January 2017

,

we

entered the Tennessee market through the acquisition of several asphalt mix operations and a

construction

paving business.

This segment relies on our reserves of aggregates, functioning essentially as a customer to our aggregates operations. Aggregates are a major component in asphalt mix, comprising approximately

95%

by weight

of this product

. We meet the aggregates requirements for our Asphalt

segment

primarily

through our Aggregates

segment. These product transfers are made at local market prices for the particular grade and quality of material required.

Because asphalt mix hardens rapidly, delivery

typically is within close proximity

to the producing facility.

The asphalt

mix

production process requires liquid asphalt

cement

, which we purchas

e fr

om third-party producers.

We do not anticipate any

significant

difficulties in obtaining the raw materials necessary for this segment to operate.

We serve our Asphalt segment customers

either directly f

rom

our local production facilities

or

through

our distribution yards

.


.

CONCRETE

We produce and sell ready-mixed concrete

i

n

C

alifornia,

Georgia, Maryland, New Mexico, Texas, Virginia, Washington D.C. and the Bahamas. In May 2015, we entered the Arizona ready-mixed concrete market

through the acquisition of

ready-mixed concrete operations in

conjunction with the acquisition of aggregates operations in

Arizona and New Mexico.

As noted above, in December 2017 we exited the Arizona ready-mixed concrete market via a swap for an asphalt mix operation continuing our strategy to focus on asphalt

mix

in that market.

In January 2015, we swapped our ready-mixed concrete operations in California for asphalt mix operations, primarily in Arizona

.

In March 2017, we reentered the California ready-mixed concrete market through an acquisition.

For additional details see Note 19 “Acquisitions and Divestitures” in Item 8 “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”

This segment relies on our reserves of aggregates, functioning essentially as a customer to our aggregates operations. Aggregates are a major component in ready-mixed concrete, comprising approximately 80% by weight of this product

. We meet the aggregates requirements of our Concrete segment primarily through our Aggregates

segment. These product transfers are made at local market prices for

the particular grade and quality of material required.

We serve our Concrete segment customers from our local production facilities or by truck. Because ready-mixed concrete hardens rapidly, delivery typically is within close proximity to the producing facility. Ready-

mixed concrete production also requires cement

which w

e purchase

from

third-

party

producers

. We do not anticipate any

significant

difficulties in obtaining the raw materials necessary for this segment to operate.

OTHER BUSINESS

-

RELATED ITEMS

SEASONALITY AND CYCLICAL NATURE OF OUR BUSINESS

Almost all

of

our products are produced and consumed outdoors. Seasonal changes and other weather-related conditions can affect the production and sales volumes of our products. Therefore, the financial results for any quarter do not necessarily indicate the results expected for the year. Normally, the highest sales and earnings are in the third quarter and the lowest are in the first quart

er. Fu

rthermore, our sales and earnings are sensitive to national, regional and local economic conditions

, demographic and population fluctuations,

and particularly to cyclical swings in construction spending, primarily in the private sector.

Part I


COMPETITORS

We operate in a

generally fragmented

industr

y w

ith a large number of small, privately-held companies.

We estimate that the ten largest aggrega

tes producers account

ed

for

less than one-third

of to

tal U.S. aggregates production

in 201


. Despite being the industry leader, Vulcan’s total U.S. market share is less than


%.

O

ther publicly

traded companies among the ten largest U.S. aggregates producers include the following:

§

Cemex

S.A.B. de C.V.

§

CRH

plc

§

Heidelberg

Cement AG

§

Lafarge

Holcim

§

Martin Marietta Materials

, Inc.

§

MDU Resources

Group, Inc.

§

Summit Materials

, Inc.

Because the U.S. aggregates industry is highly fragmented, with

over

5,700

companies managing

more than

10,000

operations

during 201


, many opportunities for consolidation exist. Therefore, companies in the industry tend to grow by

acquiring existing facilities to

enter new markets

or extend

their

existing

market positions.

CUSTOMERS

No material part of our business

depends

upon any

single

customer whose loss would have

a significant

adverse effect on our business. In 201


, ou

r f

ive

largest

customers accounted

for

7.3

%

of our total revenues (excluding internal sales), and no single customer accounted for more than

2.4

%

of our total revenues. Our products typically are sold to private industry and not directly to governmental entities. Although approximately


% to


%

of our

aggregates shipments have historically been used in publicly funded construction, such as highways, airports and government buildings, relatively insignificant sales are made directly to federal, state, county or municipal governments/agencies. Therefore, although reductions in state and federal funding can curtail publicly funded construction, our business is not directly subject to renegotiation of profits or termination of contracts with state or federal governments.

ENVIRONMENTAL COSTS AND GOVERNMENTAL REGULATION

Our operations are subject to

numerous

federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the

protection of the

environment and

worker

health and saf

ety;

examples include

regulation of

facility air emissions and water discharges, waste management, protection of wetlands, listed and threatened species, noise and dust exposure control for workers, and safety regulations under both

Mine Safety and Health Administration (

MSHA

)

and

Occupational Safety and Health Administration (

OSHA). Compliance with these various regulations requires a substantial capital investment, and ongoing expenditures for the operation and maintenance of systems and implementation of programs.

We estimate that capital expenditures for environmental control facilities in 201


and 201


will b

e $

14.9

million and $

29.4

million, respectively

. These anticipated expenditures are not expected to have

a

material impact on our earnings or competitive position.

We have received notices from the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) or similar state or local agencies that we are considered a potentially responsible party (PRP) at a limited number of sites under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA or Superfund) or similar state and local environmental laws. Generally we share the cost of remediation at these sites with other PRPs or alleged PRPs in accordance with negotiated or prescribed allocations. There is inherent uncertainty in determining the potential cost of remediating a given site and in determining any individual party's share in that cost. As a result, estimates can change substantially as additional information becomes available

about

the nature or extent of site contamination, remediation methods, other PRPs and their probable level of involvement, and actions by or against governmental agencies or private parties.

For additional information

about

litigation and environmental matters, see Notes 1 and 12 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data."

Part I


Frequently, we are required by state and local regulations or contractual obligations to reclaim our former mining sites. These reclamation liabilities are recorded in our financial statements as a liability at the time the obligation arises. The fair value of such obligations is capitalized and depreciated over the estimated useful life of the owned or leased site. The liability is accreted through charges to operating expenses. To determine the fair value, we estimate the cost for a third party to perform the legally required reclamation, which is adjusted for inflation and risk and includes a reasonable profit margin. All reclamation obligations are reviewed at least annually. Reclaimed quarries often have potential for use in commercial or residential development or as reservoirs or landfills. However, no projected cash flows from these anticipated uses have been considered to offset or reduce the estimated reclamation liability.

For additional information

about

reclamation obligations (referred to in our financial statements as asset retirement obligations), see Notes 1 and 17 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data."
