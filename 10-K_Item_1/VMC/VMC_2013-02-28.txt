ITEM 1 BUSINESS

Vulcan Materials Company is a New Jersey corporation and the nation’s largest producer of construction aggregates: primarily crushed stone, sand, and gravel. We have 341 active aggregates facilities. We
also are a major producer of asphalt mix and ready-mixed concrete as well as a leading producer of cement in Florida.

VULCAN’S VALUE PROPOSITION

We are the leading construction materials business in the country with superior aggregates operations. Our leading position is based upon:

§

being the largest aggregates producer in the U.S.

§

having a favorable geographic footprint that provides attractive long-term growth prospects

§

having the largest proven and probable reserve base

§

having operational expertise and pricing discipline which provides attractive unit profitability

STRATEGY FOR EXISTING AND NEW MARKETS

§

Our aggregates reserves are strategically located throughout the United States in high-growth areas that are projected to grow faster than the national average and that
require large amounts of aggregates to meet construction demand. Vulcan-served states are estimated to generate 75% of the total growth in U.S. population and 70% of the total growth in U.S. household formations between 2010 and 2020. Our top ten
revenue producing states in 2012 were Alabama, California, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas and Virginia.

§

We take a disciplined approach to strengthening our footprint by increasing our presence in metropolitan areas that are expected to grow most rapidly and divesting assets
that are no longer considered part of our long-term growth strategy.

§

Where practical, we have operations located close to our local markets because the cost of trucking materials long distances is prohibitive. Approximately 81% of our total
aggregates shipments are delivered exclusively from the producing location to the customer by truck, and another 12% are delivered by truck after reaching a sales yard by rail or water.

COMPETITORS

We operate in an industry that generally is fragmented with a large number of small, privately-held companies. We estimate that the ten largest aggregates producers account for approximately 30% to 35% of
the total U.S. aggregates production. Despite being the industry leader, Vulcan’s total U.S. market share is less than 10%. Other publicly traded companies among the ten largest U.S. aggregates producers include the following:

§

Cemex S.A.B. de C.V.

§

CRH plc

§

HeidelbergCement AG

§

Holcim Ltd.

§

Lafarge

§

Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.

§

MDU Resources Group, Inc.

Because the U.S.
aggregates industry is highly fragmented, with over 5,000 companies managing almost 10,000 operations, many opportunities for consolidation exist. Therefore, companies in the industry tend to grow by acquiring existing facilities to enter new
markets or by enhancing their existing market positions.

BUSINESS STRATEGY

Vulcan provides the basic materials for the infrastructure needed to expand the U.S. economy. Our strategy is based on our strength in aggregates. Aggregates are used in all types of construction and in the
production of asphalt mix and ready-mixed concrete. Our materials are used to build the roads, tunnels, bridges, railroads and airports that connect us, and to build the hospitals, churches, shopping centers, and factories that are essential to our
lives and the economy. The following graphs illustrate the relationship of our four operating segments to sales.

AGGREGATES-LED
VALUE CREATION — 2012 NET SALES

* Represents sales to external customers of our aggregates and our downstream products that use our aggregates.

Our business strategies include: 1) aggregates focus, 2) coast-to-coast footprint, 3) profitable growth, 4) tightly managed operational and
overhead costs, and 5) effective land management.

1. AGGREGATES FOCUS

Aggregates are used in virtually all types of public and private construction projects and practically no substitutes for quality aggregates exist. Our focus on aggregates allows us to:

§

BUILD AND HOLD SUBSTANTIAL RESERVES

: The locations of our reserves are critical to our long-term success because of barriers to entry created in many metropolitan
markets by zoning and permitting regulations and high transportation costs. Our reserves are strategically located throughout the United States in high-growth areas that will require large amounts of aggregates to meet future construction demand.
Aggregates operations have flexible production capabilities and, other than energy inputs required to process the materials, require virtually no other raw material other than aggregates reserves which we own or control by leases. Our downstream
businesses (asphalt mix and concrete) use Vulcan-produced aggregates almost exclusively.

§

TAKE ADVANTAGE OF BEING THE LARGEST PRODUCER

: Each aggregates operation is unique because of its location within a local market with particular geological
characteristics. Every operation, however, uses a similar group of assets to produce saleable aggregates and provide customer service. Vulcan is the largest aggregates company in the U.S., whether measured by production or by revenues. Our 341
active aggregates facilities provide opportunities to standardize operating practices and procure equipment (fixed and mobile), parts, supplies and services in an efficient and cost-effective manner, both regionally and nationally. Additionally, we
are able to share best practices across the organization and leverage our size for administrative support, customer service, accounting, accounts receivable and accounts payable, technical support and engineering.

2. COAST-TO-COAST FOOTPRINT

Demand for construction aggregates correlates positively with changes in population growth, household formation and employment. We have pursued a strategy to increase our presence in metropolitan areas that
are expected to grow the most rapidly.

3. PROFITABLE GROWTH

Our growth is a result of acquisitions, cost management and investment activities.

§

STRATEGIC ACQUISITIONS:

Since becoming a public company in 1956, Vulcan has principally grown by mergers and acquisitions. For example, in 1999 we acquired CalMat
Co., thereby expanding our aggregates operations into California and Arizona and making us one of the nation’s leading producers of asphalt mix and ready-mixed concrete.

In 2007, we acquired Florida Rock Industries, Inc., the largest acquisition in our history. This acquisition expanded our aggregates business
in Florida and other southeastern and Mid-Atlantic states, as well as adding to our ready-mixed concrete business and added cement manufacturing and distribution facilities in Florida.

In addition to these large acquisitions, we have completed many smaller acquisitions that have contributed significantly to our growth.

§

REINVESTMENT OPPORTUNITIES WITH HIGH RETURNS:

During this decade, Moody’s Analytics projects that 75% of the U.S. population growth will occur in Vulcan-served
states. The close proximity of our production facilities and our aggregates reserves to this projected population growth creates many opportunities to invest capital in high-return projects — projects that will add reserves, increase production
capacity and improve costs.

4. TIGHTLY MANAGED OPERATIONAL AND OVERHEAD COSTS

In a business where aggregates sell, on average, for approximately $10.00 per ton, we are accustomed to rigorous cost management throughout economic cycles.
Small savings per ton add up to significant cost reductions. We are able to adjust production levels to meet varying market conditions without jeopardizing our ability to take advantage of future increased demand.

Our knowledgeable and experienced workforce and our flexible production capabilities have allowed us to manage operational and overhead costs aggressively
during the prolonged recession. In addition to cost reduction steps taken in previous years, in 2012 we continued to control costs aggressively in our operations which improved our per-ton margins. As a result, our cash earnings for each ton of
aggregates sold in 2012 was 27% higher than at the peak of demand in 2005 (refer to Item 7 “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” for Non-GAAP disclosures). In 2012, we also
reorganized our company structure enabling us to make significant reductions in our Selling, Administrative and General (SAG) expense.

5. EFFECTIVE LAND MANAGEMENT

We believe that effective land management is both a business strategy and a social responsibility that contributes to our success. Good stewardship requires the careful use of existing resources as well as
long-term planning because mining, ultimately, is an interim use of the land. Therefore, we strive to achieve a balance between the value we create through our mining activities and the value we create through effective post-mining land management.
We continue to expand our thinking and focus our actions on wise decisions regarding the life cycle management of the land we currently hold and will hold in the future.

1. AGGREGATES

A number of factors affect the U.S. aggregates industry and our business including markets, reserves and demand cycles.

§

LOCAL MARKETS:

Aggregates have a high weight-to-value ratio and, in most cases, must be produced near where they are used; if not, transportation can cost more than
the materials rendering such material uncompetitive compared to locally produced materials. Exceptions to this typical market structure include areas along the U.S. Gulf Coast and the Eastern Seaboard where there are limited supplies of locally
available high quality aggregates. We serve these markets from inland quarries — shipping by barge and rail — and from our quarry on Mexico’s Yucatan Peninsula. We transport aggregates from Mexico to the U.S. principally on our three
Panamax-class, self-unloading ships.

§

DIVERSE MARKETS:

Large quantities of aggregates are used in virtually all types of public- and private-sector construction projects such as highways, airports,
water and sewer systems, industrial manufacturing facilities, residential and nonresidential buildings. Aggregates also are used widely as railroad track ballast.

§

LOCATION AND QUALITY OF RESERVES:

We currently have 15.0 billion tons of permitted and proven or probable aggregates reserves. The bulk of these reserves are
located in areas where we expect greater than average rates of growth in population, jobs and households, which require new infrastructure, housing, offices, schools and other development. Such growth requires aggregates for construction. Zoning and
permitting regulations in some markets have made it increasingly difficult for the aggregates industry to expand existing quarries or to develop new quarries. These restrictions could curtail expansion in certain areas, but they also could increase
the value of our reserves at existing locations.

Part I



Index to Financial Statements

§

DEMAND CYCLES:

Long-term growth in demand for aggregates is largely driven by growth in population, jobs and households. While short- and medium-term demand for
aggregates fluctuates with economic cycles, declines have historically been followed by strong recoveries, with each peak establishing a new historical high. In comparison to all other recent demand cycles, the current downturn has been unusually
steep and long, making it difficult to predict the timing or strength of future recovery.

However, there are signs the current
cyclical downturn is drawing to a close and a recovery in private construction is taking hold. Residential construction, as measured by housing starts, has bottomed out, and a sustained recovery appears to be underway. Since October 2011,
year-over-year growth in trailing twelve month housing starts has been increasing. This is significant because housing contributes to Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in two basic ways: through fixed investment and through consumption spending and
housing services. Residential investment, which includes construction of both new single-family and multi-family structures, has the most direct impact on construction activity. During the last four housing recoveries after economic downturns,
increased construction activity in other end markets has followed growth in housing starts.

The diagram below depicts how housing starts can
have a direct and indirect impact on the overall economy and construction end markets. Housing starts lead to growth in demand for private investment as well as initial and ongoing sources of tax revenue, both of which drive increased construction
activity. Historically, housing has contributed 17% to 18% of GDP, according to the National Association of Home Builders.

In addition, the following factors influence the aggregates market:

§

HIGHLY FRAGMENTED INDUSTRY:

The U.S. aggregates industry is composed of over 5,000 companies that manage almost 10,000 operations. This fragmented structure
provides many opportunities for consolidation. Companies in the industry commonly enter new markets or expand positions in existing markets through the acquisition of existing facilities.

§

RELATIVELY STABLE DEMAND FROM THE PUBLIC SECTOR:

Publicly funded construction activity has historically been more stable and less cyclical than privately funded
construction, and generally requires more aggregates per dollar of construction spending. Private construction (primarily residential and nonresidential buildings) typically is more affected by general economic cycles than publicly funded projects
(particularly highways, roads and bridges) which tend to receive more consistent levels of funding throughout economic cycles.

Part I



Index to Financial Statements

§

LIMITED PRODUCT SUBSTITUTION:

There are limited substitutes for quality aggregates. In urban locations, recycled concrete and asphalt have applications as a
lower-cost alternative to virgin aggregates. However, many types of construction projects cannot be served by recycled concrete or asphalt but require the use of virgin aggregates to meet specifications and performance-based criteria for durability,
strength and other qualities.

§

WIDELY USED IN DOWNSTREAM PRODUCTS:

In the production process, aggregates are processed for specific applications or uses. Two products that use aggregates as a raw
material are asphalt mix and ready-mixed concrete. By weight, aggregates comprise approximately 95% of asphalt mix and 78% of ready-mixed concrete.

§

FLEXIBLE PRODUCTION CAPABILITIES:

The production of aggregates is a mechanical process in which stone is crushed and, through a series of screens, separated into
various sizes depending on how it will be used. Production capacity can be flexible by adjusting operating hours to meet changing market demand.

§

RAW MATERIAL INPUTS LARGELY UNDER OUR CONTROL:

Unlike typical industrial manufacturing industries, the aggregates industry does not require the input of raw
material beyond owned or leased aggregates reserves. Stone, sand and gravel are naturally occurring resources. However, production does require the use of explosives, hydrocarbon fuels and electric power.

OUR MARKETS

We focus on the U.S. markets with the greatest expected population growth and where construction is expected to expand. Because transportation is a significant part of the delivered cost of aggregates, our
facilities are typically located in the markets they serve or with access to economical transportation to their markets. We serve both the public and the private sectors.

PUBLIC SECTOR

Public sector construction includes spending by federal, state, and local
governments for highways, bridges and airports as well as other infrastructure construction for sewer and waste disposal systems, water supply systems, dams, reservoirs and other public construction projects. Construction for power plants and other
utilities is funded from both public and private sources. In 2012, publicly funded construction accounted for approximately 54% of our total aggregates shipments.

¡

PUBLIC SECTOR FUNDING:

Generally, public sector construction spending is more stable than private sector construction because public sector spending is less
sensitive to interest rates and has historically been supported by multi-year legislation and programs. For example, the federal transportation bill is a principal source of funding for public infrastructure and transportation projects. For over two
decades, a portion of transportation projects has been funded through a series of multi-year bills. The long-term aspect of these bills is critical because it provides state departments of transportation with the ability to plan and execute
long-term and complex highway projects. Federal highway spending is governed by multi-year authorization bills and annual budget appropriations using funds largely from the Federal Highway Trust Fund. This Trust Fund receives funding from taxes on
gasoline and other levies. The level of state spending on infrastructure varies across the United States and depends on individual state needs and economies. In 2012, approximately 30% of our aggregates sales by volume were used in highway
construction projects.

¡

FEDERAL HIGHWAY FUNDING:

In June 2012, Congress passed MAP-21, a new multi-year highway bill. There was overwhelming bipartisan support for this legislation in both
the House and the Senate, and it was signed into law by the President on July 6, 2012. This bill provides state departments of transportation with the funding certainty to move forward on infrastructure programs, and it helps rebuild
America’s aging infrastructure by modernizing and reforming our current transportation system, while also protecting millions of jobs.

MAP-21 maintains essentially level funding for the next two fiscal years, with approximately $105 billion for total funding through Fiscal Year 2014. It extends the
Highway Trust Fund and tax collections through Fiscal Year 2016 adding additional stability to the Federal Highway Program. The bill’s substantial highway provisions are more reform-focused than previous bills, with a strong emphasis on
improving project delivery and eliminating red tape that has slowed the construction of highway projects. Funding directly for highways provides a floor of $82 billion for Fiscal Years 2013 and 2014. On top of this, there is a very significant
increase in the Transportation Infrastructure Finance & Innovation Act (TIFIA) program. Funding for this program will increase to $1.75 billion over the next two-year period from $122 million per year under the previous multi-year highway
bill known as SAFETEA-LU. TIFIA funding is typically leveraged by a factor of 10, so that there is the potential for $17.5 billion in additional major project funding for Fiscal Years 2013 and 2014. The U.S. Department of Transportation estimates
this new TIFIA funding will support $30 to $50 billion in new construction. However, given administrative requirements and other factors, it is expected that TIFIA will not have a meaningful impact on aggregates shipments until 2014 and beyond.

TIFIA is a highly popular program that stimulates private capital investment for projects of national or regional significance in key growth areas throughout the United
States, including large portions of our footprint. The program provides credit assistance in the form of secured loans, loan guarantees and lines of credit to major transportation infrastructure projects. Eligible sponsors for TIFIA projects include
state and local governments, private firms, special authorities and transportation improvement districts. Eligible projects include highways and bridges, large multi-modal projects, as well as freight transfer and transit facilities. We are well
positioned in states that are likely to get a disproportionate number of TIFIA-funded projects.

Overall, MAP-21 creates a positive framework for future authorizations through its significant reforms, consolidating and simplifying federal highway
programs, accelerating the project delivery process, expanding project financing and promoting public-private partnership opportunities. The fact that Congress was able to pass the bill given the political climate in Washington, maintaining funding
levels while also adding an additional year of program funding beyond what

Part I



Index to Financial Statements

was expected, has its own significance and makes us even more optimistic about the ability of Congress to continue to work towards long-term solutions that will rebuild America’s
infrastructure.

PRIVATE SECTOR

The private sector markets include both nonresidential building construction and residential construction and is considerably more cyclical than public construction. In 2012, privately-funded construction
accounted for approximately 46% of our total aggregates shipments.

¡

NONRESIDENTIAL CONSTRUCTION:

Private nonresidential building construction includes a wide array of projects. Such projects generally are more aggregates intensive
than residential construction. Overall demand in private nonresidential construction generally is driven by job growth, vacancy rates, private infrastructure needs and demographic trends. The growth of the private workforce creates demand for
offices, hotels and restaurants. Likewise, population growth generates demand for stores, shopping centers, warehouses and parking decks as well as hospitals, churches and entertainment facilities. Large industrial projects, such as a new
manufacturing facility, can increase the need for other manufacturing plants to supply parts and assemblies. Construction activity in this end market is influenced by a firm’s ability to finance a project and the cost of such financing.

Consistent with past cycles of private sector construction, private nonresidential construction activity remained strong after residential construction peaked in 2006.
Contract awards are a leading indicator of future construction activity and a continuation of the recent trend in awards should translate to growth in demand for aggregates. However, in late 2007, contract awards for private nonresidential buildings
peaked. In 2008, contract awards in the U.S. declined 23% from the prior year and in 2009 fell sharply, declining 54% from 2008 levels. However, after bottoming in 2010, trailing twelve-month contract awards for private nonresidential buildings
began to improve in 2011, ending the year up 16% from 2010 levels. In 2012, private nonresidential building awards grew another 14%, which was entirely attributable to strength in contract awards for stores and office buildings, up 34% and 17%,
respectively. Employment growth, more attractive lending standards and general recovery in the economy will help drive continued growth in construction activity in this end market.

Part I

¡

RESIDENTIAL CONSTRUCTION:

The majority of residential construction is for single-family houses with the remainder consisting of multi-family construction (i.e., two
family houses, apartment buildings and condominiums). Public housing comprises only a small portion of housing demand. Household formations in our markets continue to outpace household formations in the rest of the U.S. Construction activity in this
end market is influenced by the cost and availability of mortgage financing. Demand for our products generally occurs early in the infrastructure phase of residential construction and later as part of driveways or parking lots.

U.S. housing starts, as measured by McGraw-Hill data, peaked in early 2006 at over 2 million units annually. By the end of 2009, total housing starts had declined to
less than 600,000 units, well below prior historical lows of approximately 1 million units annually. In 2012, total housing starts increased to 783,000 units annually. The growth in residential construction bodes well for continued recovery in
our markets.

ADDITIONAL AGGREGATES PRODUCTS AND MARKETS

We sell aggregates that are used as ballast to railroads for construction and maintenance of railroad tracks. We also sell riprap and jetty stone for erosion control along waterways. In addition, stone can
be used as a feedstock for cement and lime plants and for making a variety of adhesives, fillers and extenders. Coal-burning power plants use limestone in scrubbers to reduce harmful emissions. Limestone that is crushed to a fine powder can be sold
as agricultural lime.

Our Brooksville, Florida calcium plant produces calcium products for the animal feed, paint, plastics, water treatment and
joint compound industries. This facility is supplied with high quality calcium carbonate material mined at the Brooksville quarry.

We sell a
relatively small amount of construction aggregates outside of the United States, principally in the areas surrounding our large quarry on the Yucatan Peninsula in Mexico. Nondomestic sales and long-lived assets outside the United States are reported
in Note 15 “Segment Reporting” in Item 8 “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”

¡

zoning and permitting regulations in many metropolitan markets have made it increasingly difficult to expand existing quarries or to develop new quarries

¡

such regulations, while potentially curtailing expansion in certain areas, could also increase the value of our reserves at existing locations

2. CONCRETE

We produce and sell ready-mixed
concrete in California, Florida, Georgia, Maryland, Texas, Virginia and the District of Columbia. Additionally, we produce and sell, in a limited number of these markets, other concrete products such as block. We also resell purchased building
materials for use with ready-mixed concrete and concrete block.

This segment relies on our reserves of aggregates, functioning essentially as a
customer to our aggregates operations. Aggregates are a major component in ready-mixed concrete, comprising approximately 78% by weight of this product. We meet the aggregates requirements of our Concrete segment almost wholly through our Aggregates
segment. These product transfers are made at local market prices for the particular grade and quality of material required.

We serve our
Concrete segment customers from our local production facilities or by truck. Because ready-mixed concrete hardens rapidly, delivery typically is within close proximity to the producing facility.

Ready-mixed concrete production also requires cement. In the Florida market, cement requirements for ready-mixed concrete production are supplied
substantially by our Cement segment. In other markets, we purchase cement from third-party suppliers. We do not anticipate any material difficulties in obtaining the raw materials necessary for this segment to operate.

3. ASPHALT MIX

We produce and sell asphalt mix in Arizona, California, and Texas. This segment relies on our reserves of aggregates, functioning essentially as a customer to our aggregates operations. Aggregates are a
major component in asphalt mix, comprising approximately 95% by weight of this product. We meet the aggregates requirements for our Asphalt Mix segment almost wholly through our Aggregates segment. These product transfers are made at local market
prices for the particular grade and quality of material required.

Because asphalt mix hardens rapidly, delivery typically is within close
proximity to the producing facility. The asphalt mix production process requires liquid asphalt cement, which we purchase entirely from third-party producers. We do not anticipate any material difficulties in obtaining the raw materials necessary
for this segment to operate. We serve our Asphalt Mix segment customers from our local production facilities.

4. CEMENT

Our Newberry, Florida cement plant produces Portland and masonry cement that we sell in both bulk and bags to the concrete products industry. Our Tampa,
Florida distribution facility can import and export cement and slag. Cement can be resold, blended, bagged, or reprocessed into specialty cements that we then sell. The slag is ground and sold in blended or unblended form.

The Cement segment’s largest single customer is our own ready-mixed concrete operations within the Concrete segment.

An expansion of production capacity at our Newberry, Florida cement plant was completed in 2010. Total annual production capacity is 1.6 million tons
per year. This plant is supplied by limestone mined at the facility. These limestone reserves total 189.8 million tons.

OTHER BUSINESS-RELATED ITEMS

SEASONALITY AND CYCLICAL NATURE OF OUR BUSINESS

Almost all of our products are
produced and consumed outdoors. Seasonal changes and other weather-related conditions can affect the production and sales volumes of our products. Therefore, the financial results for any quarter do not necessarily indicate the results expected for
the year. Normally, the highest sales and earnings are in the third quarter and the lowest are in the first quarter because of winter weather in the first quarter. Furthermore, our sales and earnings are sensitive to national, regional and local
economic conditions and particularly to cyclical swings in construction spending, primarily in the private sector. The levels of construction spending are affected by changing interest rates and demographic and population fluctuations.

CUSTOMERS

No material part
of our business is dependent upon any single customer whose loss would have an adverse effect on our business. In 2012, our top five customers accounted for 5.6% of our total revenues (excluding internal sales), and no single customer accounted for
more than 1.4% of our total revenues. Our products typically are sold to private industry and not directly to governmental entities. Although approximately 45% to 55% of our aggregates shipments have historically been used in publicly funded
construction, such as highways, airports and government buildings, relatively insignificant sales are made directly to federal, state, county or municipal governments/agencies. Therefore, although reductions in state and federal funding can curtail
publicly funded construction, our business is not directly subject to renegotiation of profits or termination of contracts with state or federal governments.

ENVIRONMENTAL COSTS AND GOVERNMENTAL REGULATION

Our operations are subject to numerous federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment and worker health and
safety; examples include regulation of facility air emissions and water discharges, waste management, protection of wetlands, listed and threatened species, noise and dust exposure control for workers, and safety regulations under both MSHA and
OHSA. Compliance with these various regulations requires a substantial capital investment, and ongoing expenditures for the operation and maintenance of systems and implementation of programs. We estimate that capital expenditures for environmental
control facilities in 2013 and 2014 will be approximately $11.4 million and $17.1 million, respectively. These anticipated expenditures are not expected to have any material impact on our earnings or competitive position.

Frequently, we are required by state and local regulations or contractual obligations to reclaim our former mining sites. These reclamation liabilities are
recorded in our financial statements as a liability at the time the obligation arises. The fair value of such obligations is capitalized and depreciated over the estimated useful life of the owned or leased site. The liability is accreted through
charges to operating expenses. To determine the fair value, we estimate the cost for a third party to perform the legally required reclamation, which is adjusted for inflation and risk and includes a reasonable profit margin. All reclamation
obligations are reviewed at least annually. Reclaimed quarries often have potential for use in commercial or residential development or as reservoirs or landfills. However, no projected cash flows from these anticipated uses have been considered to
offset or reduce the estimated reclamation liability.

For additional information regarding reclamation obligations (referred to in our financial
statements as asset retirement obligations), see Notes 1 and 17 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”

PATENTS AND TRADEMARKS

We do not own or have a license or other rights under
any patents, registered trademarks or trade names that are material to any of our reporting segments.
