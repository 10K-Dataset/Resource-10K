ITEM 1 BUSINESS

Vulcan Materials Company is a New Jersey corporation and the nation’s

largest producer of construction aggregates:

primarily crushed stone,

san

d

and gravel.

We

operated

342 a

ggregates facilities

during 2013

. We also are a major producer of asphalt mix and ready-mixed

concrete

as well as a leading producer of cement in Florida

.

VULCAN’S VALUE PROPOSITION

We are

t

he leading construction materials business in the country with superior aggregates operations. Our leading position is based upon:

§

a

favorable geographic footprint that provides attractive long-term growth prospects

§

the

largest proven and probable reserve base

in the United States

§

oper

ational expertise and pricing disciplin

e p

rovid

ing

attractive unit profitability

STRATEGY FOR EXISTING AND NEW MARKETS

§

Our

aggregates

reserves are strategically located throughout the United States i

n a

reas

that are projected to grow faster than the national average and

that require large amounts of aggregates to meet

construction

demand. Vulcan-served states are estimated to generate


% of the total growth in U.S. population and


% of the total growth in U.S. household formations between 2010 and 2020. Our top ten revenue producing states in 201


were

Alabama

,

California

,

Florida

,

Georgia

,

Illinois

,

North Carolina

,

South Carolina

,

Tennessee, Texas

and

Virginia

.

§

We take a disciplined approach to strengthening our footprint by increasing our presence in

U.S.

metropolitan areas that are expected to grow

more

rapidly and

by

divesting assets that are no longer considered part of our long-term growth strategy. In 2013, we acquired

three aggregates production

facilities in fast-growing markets in Georgia and Texas

; added substantially to our reserves in

Georgia, Texas and

Virginia;

considerably improved our reserve position in California and commenced development of a major quarry in California. Conversely, we

divested non-strategic assets in Wisconsin.

§

W

here practical, we have operations located

close to our local markets because the cost of trucking

materials long distances is prohibitive.

Approximately


%

of

our total aggregates shipments are delivered exclusively

from the producing location to the customer

by truck, and another


%

are delivered by truck after reaching a

sales

yard by rail or water

.

The remaining 7% of aggregates shipments are delivered directly to the customer by rail or water.

COMPETITORS

We operate in an industry that generally is fragmented with a large number of small, privately-held companies.

We estimate that the ten largest aggrega

tes producers account

ed

for approximately


% to


%

of to

tal U.S. aggregates production

in 2013

. Despite being the industry leader, Vulcan’s total U.S. market share is less than


%.

O

ther publicly

traded companies among the ten largest U.S. aggregates producers include the following:

§

Cemex

S.A.B. de C.V.

§

CRH

plc

§

Heidelberg

Cement AG

§

Holcim

Ltd.

§

Lafarge

§

Martin Marietta Materials

, Inc.

§

MDU Resources

Group, Inc.

Because the U.S. aggregates industry is highly fragmented, with

over

5,000

companies managing almost

9,000

operations

during 2013

, many opportunities for consolidation exist. Therefore, companies in the industry tend to grow by

acquiring existing facilities to

enter new markets or

by

extending

their

existing

market positions.

Part I


BUSINESS STRATEGY

Vulcan provides the basic materials for the infrastructure needed to

maintain and

expand the U.S. economy. Our strategy is based on our strength in aggregates. Aggregates are used in

most

types of construction and in the production of asphalt mix and ready-mixed concrete. Our materials are used to build the roads, tunnels, bridges, railroads and a

irports that connect us, and to

build the hospitals, churches,

schools,

shopping centers, and factories that are essential to our lives and the economy.

The following

graphs illustrate the relationship of our

four operating segments

to sales.

AGGREGATES-LED VALUE CREATION —


NET SALES

*Represents sales to external customers of our aggregates and our downstream products that use our aggregates.

Our business strategies include: 1) aggregates focus, 2) coast-to-coast footprint, 3) profitable growth, 4) tightly managed operational and overhead costs, and 5) effective land management.

§

TAKE ADVANTAGE OF BEING THE LARGEST PRODUCER

:

Each aggregates operation is unique because of its location within a local market with particular

geological characteristics. Every operation, however, uses a similar group of assets to produce

saleable aggregates and provide customer service. Vulcan

is the largest aggregates company in the U.S., whether measured by

shipments

or by revenues.

The

342 ag

gregates

facilities

we operated during 2013

provide

d

opportunities to standardize

operating practices

and procure equipment (fixed and mobile), parts, supplies and services in

an

efficient and cost-effective manner

,

both regionally and nationally. Additionally, we are able to share best practices across the organization and leverage our size for administrative support, customer service,

accounting,

accounts receivable and accounts payable, technical support and engineering.

LARGE AND STRATEGICALLY LOCATED, COAST-TO-COAST

Demand for construction aggregates

correlates positively with changes in population growth, household formation and employment. We have pursued a strategy to increase our presence in

U.S.

metropolitan areas that are expected to grow the most rapidly.

In 2013, we divested non-s

trategic assets in Wisconsin

;

increased our presence in fast-growing markets in Georgia

,

Texas

and Virginia; considerably improved our reserve position in California; and commenced development of a major quarry in California

PROFITABLE GROWTH

Our

long-term

growth is a result of

strategic

acquisition

s a

nd

investments in key operations

.

§

Strat

egic

acquisitions:

Since becoming a public company in 1956, Vulcan has principally grown by mergers and acquisitions. For example, in 1999 we acquired CalMat Co., thereby expanding our aggregates operations into California

and

Arizona and making us one of the nation’s leading producers of asphalt mix and ready-mixed concrete.

In 2007, we acquired Florida Rock Industries, Inc., the largest acquisition in our history. This acquisition

expanded our aggregates business in Florida and other southeastern and

m

id-Atlantic

states.

In addition to these large acquisitions, we have completed many smaller acquisitions that have contributed significantly to our growth.

that


%

of

the U.S.

population growth

, 70% of household formation and 63% of new jobs

will

occur in Vulcan-served states. The close proximity of our production facilities and our aggregates reserves to this projected population growth crea

te ma

ny opportunities to invest capital in high-return projects — projects that will add reserves, increase production capacity and improve

costs.

TIGHTLY MANAGED OPERATIONAL AND OVERHEAD COSTS

W

e

focus on

rigorous cost management throughout

the

economic cycl

e. Sm

all savings per ton add up to significant cost reductions. We are able to

adjust

production levels to meet

varying

market

conditions

without jeopardizing our ability to take advanta

ge of future increased demand.

Our knowledgeable and

experienced

workforce and our flexible production capabilities have allowed us to manage

operational and overhead

costs aggressively during the

prolonged

recession

in the construction industry

.

In 2012, we initiated a Profit Enhancement Plan that focused on

improving profitability through more effective

sourcing,

reducing

general & administrative

expenses

and

improving

transportation/logistics

programs

. W

e also reorganized our company structure

in 2012

enabling us to make significant reductions in our

Selling, Administrative and General (

SAG

)

expense.

In addition to cost reduction steps taken in previous years, in 201


we

continued to control costs aggressively in our operation

s.

As a result of these cost controls coupled with a disciplined approach to pricing

, our cash

gross profit

for each ton of aggregates sold in 201


was


%

higher than at the peak of demand in 2005

(refer to Item 7 "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" for Non-GAAP disclosures)

LA

ND MANAGEMENT

We believe that effective land management is both a business strategy and a social responsibility that contributes to our success. Good stewardship requires the careful use of existing resources as well as long-term planning

because mining, ultimately, is an interim use of the land. Therefore, we strive to achieve a balance between the value we create through our mining activities and the value we create through effective post-mining land management. We continue to expand our thinking and focus our actions on wise decisions regarding the life cycle management of the land we currently hold and will hold in the future.

PRODUCT LINES

We have four operating (and reportable) segments organized around our principal product lines:

1.

Aggregates

2.

Concrete

3.

Asphalt Mix

4.

Cement

1. AGGREGATES

A number of factors affect the U.S. aggregates industry and our busines

s, i

ncluding markets,

the location and quality of

reserves and demand cycles.

§

Local markets:

Aggregates have a high weight-to-value ratio and, in most cases,

are

produced near where they are used; if not, transportation can cost more than the material

s, r

endering

them

uncompetitive compared to locally produced materials.

Exceptions to this typical market structure include areas along the U.S. Gulf Coast and the Eastern Seaboard where there are limited supplies of locally available high quality aggregates. We serve these markets fro

m q

uarries

that have access to long-haul transportation

— shipping by barge and rail — and from our quarry on Mexico’s Yucatan Peninsula. We transport aggregates from Mexico to the U.S. principally on our three Panamax-class, self-unloading ships.

§

Diverse markets

:

Large quantities of aggregates are used in virtually all types of public- and private-sector

construction project

s, su

ch as highways, airports, water and sewer systems, industrial manufacturing facilities, residential and nonresidential buildings. Aggregates also are used widely as railroad track ballast.

§

Location and quality of reserves:

We

currently ha

ve

15.0

billion

tons of permitted and proven or probable aggregates reserves. The bulk of these reserves are located in areas where we expect greater than average rates of growth in population, jobs and households, which require new infrastructure, housing, offices, schools and other development. Such growth

depends on

aggregates for construction. Zoning and permitting regulations in some markets have made it increasingly difficult for the aggregates industry to expand existing quarries or to develop new quarries. These restrictions could curtail expansion in certain areas, but they also could increase the value of our reserves at existing locations.

§

Demand cycles:

Long-term growth in

demand for aggregates is largely driven by growth in population, jobs and households. While short- and medium-term demand for aggregates fluctuates with economic cycles, declines have historically been followed by strong recoveries, with each peak esta

blishing a new historical

high.

Part I


I

n addition, the following factors influence the aggregates market:

§

Highly fragmented industry:

The U.S. aggregates industry is composed of

over

5,000

companies that manage almost

9,000

operations. This fragmented structure provides many opportunities for

consolidation. Companies in the industry commonly enter new markets or expand positions in existing markets through the acquisition of existing facilities.

§

Relatively stable demand from the public sector

:

Publicly funded construction activity has historically been more stable

and less cyclical

than privately funded construction

,

and

generally

requires more aggregates per dollar of construction spending. Private construction (primarily residential and nonresidential buildings) typically

is

more affected by general

economic cycles than

p

ublicly funded projects (particularly highways, roads and bridges

), w

hich

tend to

receive more consistent levels of funding throughout economic cycles.

§

Limited product substitution:

T

here are

limited

substitutes for quality aggregates.

R

ecycled concrete

and asphalt have

certain

applications as a lower-cost alternative to virgin aggregates. However,

due to technical specifications

many types of construction projects cannot be served by recycled concre

te,

but require the use of virgin aggregates to meet specifications and performance-based criteria for durability, strength and other qualities

.

Moreover,

the amount of

recycled asphalt

included in asphalt mix as a substitute for aggregates

is limited

due

to

specifications

.

§

Widely used in downstream products:

In the production process, aggregates are processed for specific applications or uses. Two products that use aggregates

as a raw material

are asphalt mix and ready-mixed concrete. By weight, aggregates comprise

approximately

95%

of asphalt mix and

78%

of ready-mixed concrete.

§

Flexible production capabilities:

The production of aggregates is a mechanical process in which stone is crushed and, through a series of screens, separated into various sizes depending on how it will be used. Production capacity can be flexible by adjusting operating hours to meet changing market demand.

§

raw material inputs

largely under our control

:

Unlike typical industrial manufacturing industries, the aggregates industry does not require the input of raw material beyond owned or leased aggregates reserves. Stone, sand and gravel are naturally occurring resources. However, production does require the use of explosives, hydrocarbon fuels and electric

power.

AGGREGATES

MARKETS

We focus on the U.S. markets with

above-average

long-term

expected population growth and where construction is expected to expand. Because transportation is a significant part of the delivered cost of aggregates, our facilities are typically located in the markets they serve or

have

access to economical transportation

via rail, barge or ship

to

a particular end market

. We serve both the public and the private sectors.

Part I


PUBLIC SECTOR

CONSTRUCTION

Public sector construction includes spending by federal, state, and local governments for highways,

bridges and airports as well as other infrastructure construction for sewer and waste disposal systems, water supply systems, dams, reservoirs and other public construction projects. Construction for power plants and other utilities is funded from both public and

private sources. In 2013

, publicly funded construction

accounted for

approximately


%

of

our total aggregates shipments.

§

Public Sector Funding:

Generally, public sector construction spending is more stable than private sector construction because public sector spending is less sensitive to interest rates and has historically been supported by multi-year legislation and programs. For example, the federal

surface

transportation bill is a principal source of funding for public infrastructure and transportation projects. For over two decades,

a portion of transportation

projects ha

s

been funded through a series of multi-year bills.

Some 40% of transportation projects are federally-funded, with special emphasis given to the largest and most complex projects.

The long-term aspect of these bills is

important

because it provides state departments of transportation with the ability to plan and execute long-

range

, com

plex highway projects. Federal highway spending is governed by multi-year authorization bills and annual budget appropriations using funds largely from the Federal Highway Trust Fund. This

T

rust

Fund

receives funding from taxes on gasoline and other levies. The level of state spending on infrastructure varies across the United States and depends on individual state needs and economies. In 201


,

approximately


%

of

our aggregates sales by volume

was

used in highway construction projects.

§

federal highway funding

:

In June 2012, Congress passed

the Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21

st

Century Act (

MAP-21

)

, a new multi-year highway bill. There was overwhelming bipartisan support for this legislation in both the House and the Senate, and it was signed into law by the President on July 6, 2012.

MAP-21

has provided state departments of transportation with the funding certainty to move forward on infrastructure programs, and it helps rebuild America’s aging infrastructure by modernizing and reforming our current transportation system, while also protecting millions of jobs.

MAP-21 maintains essentially level f

unding through Fiscal Year 201

4, w

ith approximately $105 billion of total funding. It extends the Highway Trust Fund and tax collections through Fiscal Year 2016, adding additional stability to the Federal Highway Program. The

act’s

substantial highway provisions are more reform-focused than previous bills, with a strong emphasis on improving project delivery and eliminating red tape that has slowed the construction of highway projects

.

Funding directly for highways has provided a floor of $82 billion for Fiscal Years 2013 and 2014.

In addition,

MAP-21 provides a

significant increase in

funding for

the Transportation Infrastructure Finance & Innovation Act (TIFIA) program. Funding for this program will increase to $1.75 billion over the two-year period of this

act,

from $122 million per year under the previous multi-year highway bill. TIFIA funding is typically leveraged by a factor of 10. The U.S. Department of Transportation estimates this TIFIA funding will support $30 to $50 billion in new construction. However, given administrative requirements and other factors, it is

difficult to predict

the timing of shipments for

TIFIA

projects

.

TIFIA is a highly popular program that stimulates private capital investment for projects of national or regional significance in key growth areas throughout the United States, including

large portions of our footpri

nt.

The program provides

low-cost

credit assistance in the form of secured loans, loan guarantees and lines of credit to major transportation infrastructure projects

for up to 49% of a project’s estimated cost. Repayment terms are generous and at favorable interest

rates. Eligible

sponsors for TIFIA projects include state and local governments, private firms, special authorities and transportation improvement districts. Eligible projects include highways and bridges, large multi-modal projects, as well as freight transfer and transit facilities. We are well positioned in states that are likely to get a disproportionate number of TIFIA-funded projects.

Overall, MAP-21 creates a positive framework for future authorizations through its significant reforms, consolidating and simplifying federal highway programs, accelerating the project delivery process, expanding project financing and promoting public-private partnership opportunities. The fact that Congress was able to pass the bill given the political climate in Washington, maintaining funding levels while also adding an additional year of program funding beyond what  was expected, has its own significance and has contributed to our optimism about the ability of Congress to continue to work towards long-term solutions that will rebuild America’s infrastructure.

WATER INFRASTRUCTURE

:

Congress is currently working to complete the Water Resources Development Act (WRDA), which will provide legal authority for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to proceed with major planned improvements on hundreds of navigation, flood control, and ecosystem restoration infrastructure projects along rivers, canals, ports and inland waterways throughout the nation. In 2013, the U.S. House of Representatives and the Senate both passed versions of the bill with sweeping majorities. Negotiators from each chamber are currently working to produce a conference report that could pass both chambers and go to the president for his signature. We, along with our business allies, have been strong supporters of the WRDA bill given its overall importance to the U.S. economy, and the pressing

Part I


need to make material improvements to America’s harbors, ports and inland waterways, which are extensively used by us and our customers. The final bill is expected to address a significant backlog of water infrastructure projects, help enable improved dredging at certain ports, and speed up permitting in order to improve the pace of project completion. Many of the large southern ports that would benefit from WRDA, as they gear up for expected increases in freight volumes with the expansion of the Panama Canal, lie within our footprint. Additionally, both the House and Senate bills introduce new innovative public-private financing opportunities; the Senate's proposal is modeled after the Highway program's TIFIA program and is called WIFIA (Water Infrastructure Financing and Innovation Act). It seeks to fund large projects exceeding $25 million that are otherwise unachievable. Further, as with TIFIA, it provides funding for up to 49% of a project's estimated cost, involves low interest rates, and includes favorable repayment terms as well as subrogation of the government's interest in order to encourage other investors.

Private sector

CONSTRUCTION

The private sector

construction

market

s i

nclude both nonresidential building

construction

and residential construction and

are

considerably

more cyclical than public construction. In 201


, privately-funded construction accounted

for

approximately


%

of our

total aggregates shipments.

§

Nonresidential Construction:

Private nonresidential

building

construction includes a wide array of projects. Such projects generally are more aggregates intensive than residential construction

.

Overall demand in private nonresidential construction generally

is

driven by job growth, vacancy rates, private infrastructure needs and demographic trends. The growth of the private workforce creates demand for offices, hotels and restaurants. Likewise, population growth generates demand for stores, shopping centers, warehouses and parking decks as well as hospitals, churches and entertainment facilities. Large industrial projects, such as a new manufacturing facility, can increase the need for other manufacturing plants to supply parts and assemblies. Construction activity in this end market is influenced by a firm's ability to finance a project and the cost of such financing.

C

ontract awards are a leading indicator of future construction activity and a continuation of the recent trend in awards should translate to growth in demand for

aggrega

tes. Af

ter bottoming in 2010, trailing twelve-month contract awards for private nonresidential buildings began to improve in 2011, ending the year up 16% from 2010 levels. In 2012, private nonresidential building awards grew another 14%, which was entirely attributable to strength in contract awards for stores and office buildings, up 34% and 17%, respectively

. In 2013,

contract awards, as measured in square feet, increased for the third year in a row. Total private nonresidential contract awards were up approximately 5 million square feet, or 11%. Stores and office buildings again accounted for all of this growth, up 19% and 20%, respectively.

Employment

gro

wth, att

ractive lending standards and general recovery in the economy will help drive

continued

growth in construction activity in this end market.

§

Residential Construction:

The majority of residential construction is for single-family houses with the remainder consisting of multi-family construction (i.e., two family houses, apartment buildings and condominiums). Public housing comprises only a small portion of housing demand. Household formations in

our m

arkets

continue to outpace household formations in

the

rest of the

U.S.

Construction activity in this end market is influenced by the cost and availability of mortgage

financing.

U.S.

housing starts, as measured by McGraw-Hill data, peaked in early 2006 at over 2 million units annually. By the end of 2009, total housing starts had declined to less than 600,000 units, well below prior historical lows of approximately 1 million units annually.

In 2013, total

annual

housing starts

increased to

951,000

unit

s.

The growth in residential construction bodes well for continued recovery in our markets.

ADDITIONAL AGGREGATES PRODUCTS

AND MARKETS

We sell

aggregates that are used as

balla

st fo

r construction and maintenance of railroad track

s

. We also sell riprap and jetty stone for erosion control along

roads and

waterways.

In addition, stone can be used as a feedstock for cement and lime plants and for making a variety of adhesives, fillers and extenders. Coal-burning power plants use

limestone in scrubbers to reduce harmful emissions. Limestone that is crushed to a

fine powder can be sold as

agricultural lime.

We

sell a relatively small amount of construction aggregates outside of the United States, principally in the areas surrounding our large quarry on the Yucatan Peninsula in Mexico. Nondomestic sales and long-lived assets outside the United States are reported in Note 15 "

CONCRETE

We produce and sell ready-mixed concrete in

California, Florida, Georgia, Maryland, Texas, Virginia and the District of Columbia

and the Bahamas

.

Additionally, we produce and sell, in a limited number of these markets, other concrete products such as block

.

We also resell purchased building materials for use with ready-mixed concrete and concrete block.

This segment relies on our reserves of aggregates, functioning essentially as a customer to our aggregates operations. Aggregates are a major component in ready-mixed concrete, comprising

approximately

78%

by

weight of this product

. We meet the aggregates requirements of our Concrete segment almost wholly through our Aggregates

segment. These product transfers are made at local market prices for the particular grade and quality of material required.

We serve our Concrete segment customers from our local production facilities or by truck. Because ready-mixed concrete hardens rapidly, delivery typically is within close proximity to the producing facility.

Ready-

mixed concrete production also requires cement. In

the

Florida

market, cement requirements for ready-mixed concrete production

were

mostly

supplie

d b

y our Cement segment. In other markets, we purchase cement from third-

party suppliers. We do not anticipate any material difficulties in obtaining the raw materials necessary for this segment to operate.

In Januar

014, we entered into an agreement to sell our cement and concrete businesses in the Florida area to Cementos Argos. The transaction is expected to close

in the first quarter of 2014.

We do not anticipate any material difficulties in obtaining the raw materials necessary for this segment to operate.

We serve our Asphalt

M

4. CEMENT

Our Newberry, Florida cement plant produces Portland and masonry cement that we sell in both bulk and bags to the concrete products industry. Our Tampa, Florida

distribution

facility can import and export cement and slag.

Cement can be

resold, blended, bagged, or reprocessed into specialty cements that we then sell.

The slag is ground and sold in blended or unblended

form. The

Cement segment’s largest single customer is our own ready-mixed concrete operations within the Concrete segment.

Ou

r Brooksville, Florida calcium plant produces calcium products for the animal feed, paint, plastics, water treatment and joint compound industries. This facility is supplied with high quality calcium carbonate material mined at the Brooksville

quarry.

An expansion of production capacity at our Newberry, Florida cement plant was completed in 2010. Total annual production capacity is

1.6

million tons per year.

This plant is supplied by limestone mined at the facility.

As of December 31, 2013, t

hese limestone reserves

total

OTHER BUSINESS

-

RELATED ITEMS

SEASONALITY AND CYCLICAL NATURE OF OUR BUSINESS

Almost all

of

our products are produced and consumed outdoors. Seasonal changes and other weather-related conditions can affect the production and sales volumes of our products. Therefore, the financial results for any quarter do not necessarily indicate the results expected for the year. Normally, the highest sales and earnings are in the third quarter and the lowest are in the first quart

er. Fu

rthermore, our sales and earnings are sensitive to national, regional and local economic conditions and particularly to cyclical swings in construction spending, primarily in the private sector. The levels of construction spending are affected by changing interest rates and demographic and population fluctuations.

Part I


CUSTOMERS

No material part of our business

depends

upon any

single

customer whose loss would have

a significant

adverse effect on our business. In 201


, ou

r f

ive

largest

customers accounted

for

4.8

%

of our total revenues (excluding internal sales), and no single customer accounted for more than

1.1

%

of our total revenues. Our products typically are sold to private industry and not directly to governmental entities. Although approximately

45% to 55%

of our

aggregates shipments have historically been used in publicly funded construction, such as highways, airports and government buildings, relatively insignificant sales are made directly to federal, state, county or municipal governments/agencies. Therefore, although reductions in state and federal funding can curtail publicly funded construction, our business is not directly subject to renegotiation of profits or termination of contracts with state or federal governments.

ENVIRONMENTAL COSTS AND GOVERNMENTAL REGULATION

Our operations are subject to

numerous

federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the

protection of the

environment and

health and saf

ety;

examples include

regulation of

facility air emissions and water discharges, waste management, protection of wetlands, listed and threatened species, noise and dust exposure control for workers, and safety regulations under both

Mine Safety and Health Administration (

MSHA

)

and

Occupational Safety and Health Administration (

OSHA). Compliance with these various regulations requires a substantial capital investment, and ongoing expenditures for the operation and maintenance of systems and implementation of programs.

We estimate that capital expenditures for environmental control facilities in 201


and 201


will be approximately

$

10.6

million and $

22.7

million, respectively

. These anticipated expenditures are not expected to have

a

material impact on our earnings or competitive position.

Frequently, we are required by state and local regulations or contractual obligations to reclaim our former mining sites. These reclamation liabilities are recorded in our financial statements as a liability at the time the obligation arises. The fair value of such obligations is capitalized and depreciated over the estimated useful life of the owned or leased site. The liability is accreted through charges to operating expenses. To determine the fair value, we estimate the cost for a third party to perform the legally required reclamation, which is adjusted for inflation and risk and includes a reasonable profit margin. All reclamation obligations are reviewed at least annually. Reclaimed quarries often have potential for use in commercial or residential development or as reservoirs or landfills. However, no projected cash flows from these anticipated uses have been considered to offset or reduce the estimated reclamation liability.

For additional information regarding reclamation obligations (referred to in our financial statements as asset retirement obligations), see Notes 1 and 17 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data."
