Summary
    Description of Chevron



Chevron
    Corporation,*a Delaware corporation, manages its investments in subsidiaries
    and affiliates and provides administrative, financial,
    management and technology support to U.S. and international
    subsidiaries that engage in fully integrated petroleum
    operations, chemicals operations, mining operations, power
    generation and energy services. Upstream operations consist
    primarily of exploring for, developing and producing crude oil
    and natural gas; processing, liquefaction, transportation and
    regasification associated with liquefied natural gas;
    transporting crude oil by major international oil export
    pipelines; transporting, storage and marketing of natural gas;
    and agas-to-liquidsproject. Downstream operations consist primarily of refining of
    crude oil into petroleum products; marketing of crude oil
    and refined products; transporting of crude oil and refined
    products by pipeline, marine vessel, motor equipment and
    rail car; and manufacturing and marketing of commodity
    petrochemicals, plastics for industrial uses and fuel and
    lubricant additives.



A list of the company’s major subsidiaries is presented onpages E-4andE-5.As
    of December 31, 2010, Chevron had approximately
    62,000 employees (including about 3,900 service station
    employees). Approximately 30,000 employees (including about
    3,600 service station employees), or 48 percent, were
    employed in U.S. operations.



Overview
    of Petroleum Industry



Petroleum industry operations and profitability are influenced
    by many factors, and individual petroleum companies have little
    control over some of them. Governmental policies, particularly
    in the areas of taxation, energy and the environment have a
    significant impact on petroleum activities, regulating how
    companies are structured and where and how companies conduct
    their operations and formulate their products and, in some
    cases, limiting their profits directly. Prices for crude oil,
    natural gas, petroleum products and petrochemicals are generally
    determined by supply and demand for these commodities. However,
    some governments impose price controls on refined products such
    as gasoline or diesel fuel. The members of the Organization of
    Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) are typically the
    world’s swing producers of crude oil and their production
    levels are a major factor in determining worldwide supply.
    Demand for crude oil and its products and for natural gas is
    largely driven by the conditions of local, national and global
    economies, although weather patterns and taxation relative to
    other energy sources also play a significant part. Seasonality
    is not a primary driver of changes in the company’s
    quarterly earnings during the year.



Strong competition exists in all sectors of the petroleum and
    petrochemical industries in supplying the energy, fuel and
    chemical needs of industry and individual consumers. Chevron
    competes with fully integrated, major global petroleum
    companies, as well as independent and national petroleum
    companies, for the acquisition of crude oil and natural gas
    leases and other properties and for the equipment and labor
    required to develop and operate those properties. In its
    downstream business, Chevron also competes with fully
    integrated, major petroleum companies and other independent
    refining, marketing, transportation and chemicals entities and
    national petroleum companies in the sale or acquisition of
    various goods or services in many national and international
    markets.



Operating
    Environment



Refer to pages FS-2 through FS-10 of thisForm 10-Kin Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
    Condition and Results of Operations for a discussion of the
    company’s current business environment and outlook.







*Incorporated

    in Delaware in 1926 as Standard Oil Company of California, the
    company adopted the name Chevron Corporation in 1984 and
    ChevronTexaco Corporation in 2001. In 2005, ChevronTexaco
    Corporation changed its name to Chevron Corporation. As used in
    this report, the term “Chevron” and such terms as
    “the company,” “the corporation,”
    “our,” “we” and “us” may refer to
    Chevron Corporation, one or more of its consolidated
    subsidiaries, or all of them taken as a whole, but unless stated
    otherwise it does not include “affiliates” of
    Chevron — i.e., those companies accounted for by the
    equity method (generally owned 50 percent or less) or
    investments accounted for by the cost method. All of these terms
    are used for convenience only and are not intended as a precise
    description of any of the separate companies, each of which
    manages its own affairs.





Chevron
    Strategic Direction



Chevron’s primary objective is to create shareholder value
    and achieve sustained financial returns from its operations that
    will enable it to outperform its competitors. In the upstream,
    the company’s strategies are to grow profitably in core
    areas, build new legacy positions and commercialize the
    company’s equity natural gas resource base while growing a
    high-impact global gas business. In the downstream, the
    strategies are to improve returns and grow earnings across the
    value chain. The company also continues to utilize technology
    across all its businesses to differentiate performance, and to
    invest in profitable renewable energy and energy efficiency
    solutions.



(b)Description
    of Business and Properties



The upstream and downstream activities of the company and its
    equity affiliates are widely dispersed geographically, with
    operations in North America, South America, Europe, Africa, Asia
    and Australia. Tabulations of segment sales and other operating
    revenues, earnings and income taxes for the three years ending
    December 31, 2010, and assets as of the end of 2010 and
    2009 — for the United States and the company’s
    international geographic areas — are in Note 11
    to the Consolidated Financial Statements beginning onpage FS-41.Similar comparative data for the company’s investments in
    and income from equity affiliates and property, plant and
    equipment are in Notes 12 and 13 on pages FS-43 through
    FS-45.

Capital
    and Exploratory Expenditures



Total expenditures for 2010 were $21.8 billion, including
    $1.4 billion for the company’s share of
    equity-affiliate expenditures. In 2009 and 2008, expenditures
    were $22.2 billion and $22.8 billion, respectively,
    including the company’s share of affiliates’
    expenditures of $1.6 billion in 2009 and $2.3 billion
    in 2008.



Of the $21.8 billion in expenditures for 2010,
    87 percent, or $18.9 billion, was related to upstream
    activities. Approximately 80 percent was expended for
    upstream operations in 2009 and 2008. International upstream
    accounted for about 82 percent of the worldwide upstream
    investment in 2010, more than 80 percent in 2009 and about
    70 percent in 2008, reflecting the company’s
    continuing focus on opportunities available outside the United
    States.



In 2011, the company estimates capital and exploratory
    expenditures will be $26.0 billion, including
    $2.0 billion of spending by affiliates. Approximately
    85 percent of the total, or $22.6 billion, is budgeted
    for exploration and production activities, with
    $17.2 billion of that amount for projects outside the
    United States. Acquisition costs associated with the announced
    purchase of Atlas Energy, Inc., are not included.



Refer also to a discussion of the company’s capital and
    exploratory expenditures onpage FS-13.

Upstream



The table on the following page summarizes the net production of
    liquids and natural gas for 2010 and 2009 by the company and its
    affiliates. Worldwide oil-equivalent production, including
    volumes from synthetic oil in 2010 and oil sands in 2009, was
    2.763 million barrels per day, up about 2 percent from
    2009. The increase was mainly associated with thestart-upandramp-upof
    several major capital projects — the expansion at
    Tengiz in Kazakhstan, the Tahiti Field in the U.S. Gulf of
    Mexico, Frade in Brazil, Agbami in Nigeria, andTombua-Landanaand Mafumeira Norte in Angola. Normal field declines and the
    impact of higher prices on cost-recovery volumes and other
    contractual provisions decreased net production from last
    year’s comparative period. Refer to the “Results of
    Operations” section beginning onpage FS-7for a detailed discussion of the factors explaining the
    2008 — 2010 changes in production for crude oil and
    natural gas liquids, and natural gas.



The company estimates its average worldwide oil-equivalent
    production in 2011 will be approximately 2.790 million
    barrels per day based on the average West Texas Intermediate
    crude oil price of $79 per barrel in 2010. This estimate is
    subject to many factors and uncertainties, including additional
    quotas that may be imposed by OPEC, price effects on production
    volumes calculated under production-sharing and variable-royalty
    provisions of certain agreements, changes in fiscal terms or
    restrictions on the scope of company operations, delays in
    project startups, fluctuations in demand for natural gas in
    various markets, weather conditions that may shut in production,
    civil unrest, changing geopolitics, delays in completion of
    maintenance turnarounds,greater-than-expecteddeclines in production from mature fields, or other disruptions
    to operations. The outlook for future production levels is also
    affected by the size and number of economic investment
    opportunities and, for new large-scale projects, the time lag
    between initial exploration and the beginning of production.
    Refer to the “Review of Ongoing Exploration and Production
    Activities in Key Areas,” beginning on page 9, for a
    discussion of the company’s major crude oil and natural gas
    development projects.

    synthetic oil operations totaled 48 and 9, respectively.
    Developed acreage is acreage associated with productive mines.
    Undeveloped acreage is acreage on which mines have not been
    established and that may contain undeveloped proved reserves.3Developed acreage is spaced or assignable to productive wells.
    Undeveloped acreage is acreage on which wells have not been
    drilled or completed to permit commercial production and that
    may contain proved undeveloped reserves. The gross undeveloped
    acres that will expire in 2011, 2012 and 2013 if production is
    not established by certain required dates are 6,458, 2,672 and
    5,996, respectively.








Delivery
    Commitments



The company sells crude oil and natural gas from its producing
    operations under a variety of contractual obligations. Most
    contracts generally commit the company to sell quantities based
    on production from specified properties, but some natural gas
    sales contracts specify delivery of fixed and determinable
    quantities, as discussed below.



In the United States, the company is contractually committed to
    deliver to third parties 253 billion cubic feet of natural
    gas through 2013. The company believes it can satisfy these
    contracts through a combination of equity production from the
    company’s proved developed U.S. reserves and third
    party purchases. These contracts include a variety of pricing
    terms, including both index and fixed-price contracts.



Outside the United States, the company is contractually
    committed to deliver a total of 953 billion cubic feet of
    natural gas from 2011 through 2013 from Australia, Colombia,
    Denmark and the Philippines to third parties. The sales
    contracts contain variable pricing formulas that are generally
    referenced to the prevailing market price for crude oil, natural
    gas or other petroleum products at the time of delivery. The
    company believes it can satisfy these contracts from quantities
    available from production of the company’s proved developed
    reserves in these countries.

Review of
    Ongoing Exploration and Production Activities in Key
    Areas



Chevron’s 2010 key upstream activities, some of which are
    also discussed in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
    Financial Condition and Results of Operations beginning onpage FS-2,are presented below. The comments include references to
    “total production” and “net production,”
    which are defined under “Production” in
    Exhibit 99.1 onpage E-25.



The discussion that follows references the status of proved
    reserves recognition for significant long-lead-time projects not
    on production and for projects recently placed on production.
    Reserves are not discussed for recent discoveries that have not
    advanced to a project stage or for mature areas of production
    that do not have individual projects requiring significant
    levels of capital or exploratory investment. Amounts indicated
    for project costs represent total project costs, not the
    company’s share of costs for projects that are less than
    wholly owned.






Chevron has exploration and production activities in most of the
    world’s major hydrocarbon basins. The company’s
    upstream strategy is to grow profitably in core areas, build new
    legacy positions and commercialize the company’s equity
    natural gas resource base while growing a high-impact global gas
    business. The map at left indicates Chevron’s primary areas
    of exploration and production.





a)United
    States



Upstream activities in the United States are concentrated in
    California, the Gulf of Mexico, Louisiana, Texas,
    New Mexico, the Rocky Mountains and Alaska. Average net
    oil-equivalent production in the United States during 2010 was
    708,000 barrels per day.



In California, the company has significant production in the
    San Joaquin Valley. In 2010, average net oil-equivalent
    production was 199,000 barrels per day, composed of
    178,000 barrels of crude oil, 96 million cubic feet of
    natural gas and 5,000 barrels of natural gas liquids.
    Approximately 84 percent of the crude oil production is
    considered heavy oil (typically with API gravity lower than 22
    degrees).



Average net oil-equivalent production during 2010 for the company’s combined interests in the Gulf of Mexico shelf and deepwater areas, and the onshore fields in the region was 260,000 barrels per day. The dailyoil-equivalentproduction was composed of 169,000 barrels of crude oil, 445 million cubic feet of natural gas and 17,000 barrels of natural gas liquids.In April 2010, an accident occurred at the BP-operated Macondo prospect in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, resulting in a loss of life, the sinking of the rig and a significant oil spill. Chevron was not a participant in the well. Subsequent to the event, the U.S. Department of the Interior placed a moratorium on the drilling of wells using subsea blowout preventers (BOPs) or surface BOPs on a floating facility in the Gulf of Mexico and the Pacific



regions. During the moratorium, Chevron participated in a number
    of industry efforts to identify opportunities to improve
    industry standards in prevention, intervention and spill
    response. In July 2010, Chevron and several other major energy
    companies announced plans to build and deploy a rapid response
    system that will be available to capture and contain oil in the
    unlikely event of a potential future well blowout in the
    deepwater Gulf of Mexico. In October 2010, the Secretary of the
    Interior lifted the moratorium on deepwater drilling activity,
    provided that operators certify compliance with new rules and
    requirements. The drilling moratorium and the ensuing slowdown
    in issuing drilling permits have resulted in delays in shallow
    water drilling activity, delayed drilling of exploratory
    deepwater wells and impacted development drilling on both
    operated and nonoperated projects in the Gulf of Mexico. In
    addition, the company’s net oil-equivalent production in
    the Gulf of Mexico was reduced by about 10,000 barrels per
    day for the full year.



Chevron was engaged in various exploration and development
    activities in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico during 2010. First
    oil at the Perdido Regional Development was achieved in first
    quarter 2010. The development includes a 37.5 percent
    nonoperated working interest in a producing host facility in
    Alaminos Canyon designed to service multiple nonoperated fields,
    including Chevron’s 33.3 percent-owned Great White,
    60 percent-owned Silvertip and 57.5 percent-owned
    Tobago. The development has an expected production life of
    approximately 25 years.



The final investment decision was made for the Tahiti 2
    waterflood project in third quarter 2010. Tahiti 2 is the second
    development phase for the 58 percent-owned and operated
    Tahiti Field and is designed to increase recovery and maintain





production near the facility capacity of 125,000 barrels of
    oil per day. The project includes three water injection wells,
    two additional production wells and the facilities required to
    deliver water to the injection wells. Drilling began on the
    first water injection well in September 2010. The field has an
    estimated production life of 30 years. As of the end of
    2010, proved reserves had not been recognized for this second
    development phase of the Tahiti Field.



During 2010, work continued at the 60 percent-owned and
    operated Big Foot discovery. The project completed front-end
    engineering and design (FEED) in June 2010 and a final
    investment decision was made in December 2010. Total maximum
    production is expected to reach 79,000 barrels of
    oil-equivalent per day. First production is expected in 2014,
    and at the end of 2010 proved reserves had not been recognized.
    The field has an estimated production life of 20 years.



The topsides modifications to the host facility of the
    Caesar/Tonga Project were completed in 2010. The company has a
    20.3 percent nonoperated working interest in the Caesar and
    Tonga partnerships unitized area. Development plans include a
    total of four wells and a subsea tieback to a nearby third-party
    production facility. Work on the subsea system, commissioning of
    the topsides and the initial well completion program carried
    over into 2011. A recent mechanical issue involving the
    production riser system has delayed first production. Proved
    reserves have been recognized for the project.



The Jack and St. Malo fields are located within 25 miles of
    each other and are being jointly developed. Chevron has a
    50 percent working interest in Jack and a 51 percent
    working interest in St. Malo, following the acquisition of an
    additional 9.8 percent equity interest in St. Malo in March
    2010. Both fields are company operated. The FEED activities
    initiated in 2009 continued into 2010, and a final investment
    decision was achieved in October 2010. The facility is planned
    to have an initial design capacity of 177,000 barrels of
    oil-equivalent per day. Total project costs for the initial
    phase of development are estimated at $7.5 billion andstart-upis
    expected in 2014. The project has an estimated production life
    of 30 years. At the end of 2010, proved reserves had not
    been recognized.



Assessment of development concepts continued in 2010 for the
    appraised resource potential on the Mad Dog II Development
    Project, in which the company has a 15.6 percent
    nonoperated working interest. These areas are outside the
    drilling radius of the existing floating production facility. A
    decision on the development concept, followed by the project
    moving into the FEED stage, is expected to occur in the
    second-half 2011. At the end of 2010, proved reserves had not
    been recognized.



Studies to screen and evaluate future development alternatives
    in the Tubular Bells unitized area, in which the company has a
    30 percent nonoperated working interest, continued into
    2010, and a subsea tieback to a planned third-party host
    facility was selected as the development concept. FEED commenced
    in fourth quarter 2010 with a final investment decision expected
    in second quarter 2011. At the end of 2010, proved reserves had
    not been recognized.



Deepwater exploration activities in 2010 included participation
    in five exploratory wells — two wildcat, two appraisal
    and one delineation. Drilling operations on two exploratory
    wells were interrupted and stopped in second quarter 2010 as a
    result of the deepwater drilling moratorium in the Gulf of
    Mexico, including drilling of the first appraisal well at the
    55 percent-owned and operated Buckskin discovery. The first
    appraisal well at Knotty Head was completed in March 2010 and
    interpretation of well results continued into 2011. Chevron has
    a 25 percent nonoperated working interest in the Knotty
    Head discovery. At the end of 2010, the company had not
    recognized proved reserves for any of these exploration projects.



During 2010, the company added 15 new leases to its deepwater
    portfolio as a result of bid awards stemming from a Gulf of
    Mexico lease sale early in the year.



Besides the activities connected with the development and
    exploration projects in the Gulf of Mexico, the company also has
    contracted capacity of 1 billion cubic feet per day at the
    third-party Sabine Pass liquefied natural gas (LNG)
    regasification terminal in Louisiana to enable the import of
    natural gas for the North America market. Chevron has also
    contracted 1.6 billion cubic feet per day of capacity in a
    third-party pipeline system connecting the Sabine Pass LNG
    terminal to the natural gas pipeline grid. The pipeline provides
    access to two major salt dome storage fields and 10 major
    interstate pipeline systems, including an interconnect with
    Chevron’s Sabine Pipeline, which connects to the Henry Hub.
    The Henry Hub interconnects to nine interstate and four
    intrastate pipelines and is the pricing point for natural gas
    futures contracts traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange.



Outside California and the Gulf of Mexico, the company manages
    operations across the mid-continental United States and Alaska.
    During 2010, the company’s U.S. production outside
    California and the Gulf of Mexico averaged 249,000 net
    oil-equivalent barrels per day, composed of 91,000 barrels
    of crude oil, 773 million cubic feet of natural gas and
    29,000 barrels of natural gas liquids.





The company continues to pursue its interest in tight carbonate
    oil resources in West Texas in the Wolfcamp and associated
    formations where advances in drilling and completion
    technologies have opened up widespread targets such as the
    100 percent-owned and operated Lupin Project, where first
    oil was realized in mid-2010. Additional production growth is
    expected from both operated and nonoperated interests in these
    formations in future years through continued use of these
    advances in drilling and completion technologies. The company
    also continued the appraisal of the Haynesville shale gas play
    in East Texas.



In the Piceance Basin in northwestern Colorado, the company
    continued development of its 100 percent-owned and operated
    natural gas field. Development drilling and completion
    activities continued in 2010, with 115 completed wells available
    to supply natural gas to the central processing facility. The
    2010 work plan focused on optimization of the existing wells and
    facilities, completion of previously drilled wells, and
    designing a pilot to test liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) as an
    alternative fracture fluid beginning in fourth quarter 2011.
    Future work is expected to be completed in multiple stages. The
    full development plan includes drilling more than
    2,000 wells from multi-well pads over the next 30 to
    40 years. Proved reserves for subsequent stages of the
    project had not been recognized at year-end 2010.



In February 2011, Chevron acquired Atlas Energy, Inc. The
    acquisition provides an attractive natural gas resource position
    in the Appalachian basin, primarily located in southwestern
    Pennsylvania, and consists of approximately 850,000 total acres
    of Marcellus Shale and Utica Shale. The acquisition provides a
    49 percent interest in Laurel Mountain Midstream, LLC, an
    affiliate that owns more than 1,000 miles of natural gas
    gathering lines servicing the Marcellus. The acquisition also
    provides assets in Michigan, which include Antrim Shale
    producing assets and approximately 380,000 total acres in the
    Antrim and Collingwood/Utica Shale.

    is expected in 2014. The project’s estimated economic life
    exceeds 40 years from the time ofstart-up.



FEED activities for the company’s majority-owned and
    operated Wheatstone Project continued in 2010. Chevron holds an
    80 percent interest in the foundation natural gas
    processing facilities, which include a two-train
    8.9 million-metric-ton-per-year LNG facility and a separate
    domestic gas plant located at Ashburton North, along the
    northwest coast of Australia. The company plans to supply
    natural gas to the facilities from two Chevron-operated licenses
    comprising the majority of the Wheatstone Field and the nearby
    Iago Field.



Through the end of 2010, Chevron has signed nonbinding HOAs with
    three Asian customers for the delivery of about 80 percent
    of Chevron’s net LNG offtake from the Wheatstone Project.
    Under these HOAs, the customers also agreed to acquire a
    combined 21.8 percent nonoperated working interest in the
    Wheatstone field licenses and a 17.5 percent interest in
    the foundation natural gas processing facilities at the time of
    the final investment decision. Negotiations continue to move the
    three nonbinding HOAs to binding SPAs with these customers.
    Agreements were also signed in 2009 and amended in 2010 with two
    companies to participate in the Wheatstone Project as combined
    20 percent LNG facility owners and suppliers of natural gas
    for the project’s first two LNG trains. During 2010, a
    Native Title Heads of Agreement was reached with the local
    indigenous people for the land required at Ashburton North and
    submissions were made for various additional environmental
    approvals. The final investment decision for the project is
    expected insecond-half2011. At the end of 2010, the company had not recognized proved
    reserves for this project.



In the Browse Basin, the Browse LNG development participants
    commenced design evaluation for the Brecknock, Calliance and
    Torosa fields in early 2010. At the end of 2010, proved reserves
    had not been recognized.



During 2010, Chevron announced natural gas discoveries at the
    50 percent-owned Brederode prospect in BlockWA-364-P,the 50 percent-owned Yellowglen prospect in Block WA-268-P,
    the 50 percent-owned Sappho prospect in Block WA-392-P, and
    the 67 percent-owned Clio and Acme prospects in Block
    WA-205-P. In February 2011, the company announced a natural gas
    discovery in the 50 percent-owned Orthrus prospect in Block
    WA-24-R. All prospects are Chevron operated. The Clio and Acme
    prospects are expected to help support potential expansion
    opportunities at the Wheatstone LNG facilities while the
    Yellowglen, Sappho and Orthrus prospects are expected to help
    underpin further expansion opportunities on the Gorgon
    Project. Proved reserves had not been recognized for any of
    these exploration discoveries.



f)Europe



In Europe, the company is engaged in exploration and production
    activities in Denmark, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Romania
    and the United Kingdom. Net oil-equivalent production in Europe
    averaged 159,000 barrels per day during 2010.



Denmark:Chevron has a 15 percent working
    interest in the partner-operated Danish Underground Consortium
    (DUC), which produces crude oil and natural gas from 13 of 15

    85 percent-owned and operated Captain Field, the
    23.4 percent-owned and operated Alba Field, and the
    32.4 percent-owned and jointly operated Britannia Field.



The 70 percent-owned and operated Alder discovery entered
    FEED in 2010, following selection of the development concept.
    The final investment decision is planned for late 2011.
    Evaluation of development alternatives continued during 2010 for
    the Clair Ridge Project, located west of the Shetland Islands,
    in which the company has a 19.4 percent nonoperated working
    interest. Evaluation resulted in the selection of a preferred
    alternative consisting of a bridge-linked, twin-jacket
    structure. The final investment decision is expected mid-2011.
    In the 40 percent-owned and operated Rosebank area
    northwest of the Shetland Islands, seismic, geophysical,
    geotechnical and environmental surveys were conducted during
    2010, and feasibility engineering activities are scheduled to
    continue through 2011. At the end of 2010, proved reserves had

    early 2008 and is operated as a terminal.2Chevron holds 100 percent of
    the common stock issued by Chevron South Africa (Pty) Limited,
    which owns the Cape Town Refinery. A consortium of South African
    partners owns preferred shares ultimately convertible to a
    25 percent equity interest in Chevron South Africa (Pty)
    Limited. None of the preferred shares had been converted as of
    February 2011.3Includes 3,000 and
    6,000 barrels per day of refinery inputs in 2009 and 2008,
    respectively, for interests in refineries that were sold during
    those periods.



Average crude oil distillation capacity utilization during 2010
    was 92 percent, compared with 91 percent in 2009. At
    the U.S. fuel refineries, crude oil distillation capacity
    utilization averaged 95 percent in 2010, compared with
    96 percent in 2009, and cracking and coking capacity
    utilization averaged 90 percent and 85 percent in 2010
    and 2009, respectively. Cracking and coking units are the
    primary facilities used in fuel refineries to convert feedstocks
    into gasoline and other light products. Chevron processes both
    imported and domestic crude oil in its U.S. refining
    operations. Imported crude oil accounted for about
    84 percent and 85 percent of Chevron’s
    U.S. refinery inputs in 2010 and 2009, respectively.



At the Pascagoula Refinery, the company commissioned a
    continuous catalytic reformer that is expected to improve
    equipment reliability and utilization and to allow the refinery
    to optimize production of high-value products. Also in
    Pascagoula, a final investment decision was reached in first
    quarter 2011 to construct a facility to produce approximately
    25,000 barrels per day of premium base oil for use in
    manufacturing high-performance finished lubricants, such as
    motor oils for consumer and commercial applications. Project
    completion is expected by year-end 2013.





At the refinery in El Segundo, construction began in late 2010
    on a new processing unit designed to further improve the
    facility’s overall reliability, enhance high-value product
    yield and provide additional flexibility to process a broad
    range of crude slates. Project completion is expected in 2012.
    At the Richmond Refinery, the company continued to evaluate its
    options with respect to permitting of the Renewal Project. The
    project is designed to improve the refinery’s ability to
    process higher sulfur crudes, without changing the
    refinery’s capacity to process crude blends in the
    intermediate-light gravity range. Improved ability to process
    higher sulfur crudes is expected to provide increased
    flexibility to process lower API-gravity crudes within the
    refinery’s existing capacity range. Refer also to a
    discussion of contingencies related to this project in
    Note 24 to the Consolidated Financial Statements onpage FS-59.

Other
    Businesses

Mining



Chevron’sU.S.-basedmining company produces and markets coal and molybdenum. Sales
    occur in both U.S. and international markets.



The company owns and is the operator of an underground coal
    mine, North River, in Alabama, and surface coal mines in
    Kemmerer, Wyoming, and McKinley, New Mexico. The company also
    owns a 50 percent interest in Youngs Creek Mining Company,
    LLC, which was formed to develop a coal mine in northern Wyoming.



As of early 2011, the sale of the North River Mine and other
    coal-related assets in Alabama was under negotiation.
    Additionally, in January 2011, the company announced the intent
    to divest its remaining coal mining operations. Activities
    related to full reclamation continued in 2010 at the
    company’s McKinley, New Mexico, mine, which ceased coal
    production at the end of 2009.



At year-end 2010, Chevron controlled approximately
    189 million tons of proven and probable coal reserves in
    the United States, including reserves of low-sulfur coal.
    The company is contractually committed to deliver between
    7 million and 8 million tons of coal per year through
    the end of 2013 and believes it will satisfy these contracts
    from existing coal reserves. Coal sales from wholly owned mines
    in 2010 were 8 million tons, down about 2 million tons
    from 2009.



In addition to the coal operations, Chevron owns and operates
    the Questa molybdenum mine in New Mexico. Atyear-end2010, Chevron controlled approximately 53 million pounds of
    proven molybdenum reserves at Questa. Production and underground
    development at Questa continued at reduced levels in 2010 in
    response to weak prices for molybdenum.





Power
    Generation



Chevron’s Global Power Company manages interests in 13
    power assets with a total operating capacity of more than 3,100
    megawatts, primarily through joint ventures in the United States
    and Asia. Twelve of these are efficient combined-cycle and
    gas-fired cogeneration facilities that utilize waste heat
    recovery to produce electricity and support industrial thermal
    hosts. The thirteenth facility is a wind farm, located in
    Casper, Wyoming, that is designed to optimize the use of a
    decommissioned refinery site for delivery of clean, renewable
    energy to the local utility.



The company has major geothermal operations in Indonesia and the
    Philippines and is investigating several advanced solar
    technologies for use in oil field operations as part of its
    renewable-energy strategy. For additional information on the
    company’s geothermal operations and renewable energy
    projects, refer to pages 21 and 22 and “Research and
    Technology” below.

Chevron
    Energy Solutions (CES)



CES is a wholly owned subsidiary that develops and builds
    sustainable energy projects to increase energy efficiency and
    renewable power, reduce energy costs, and ensure reliable,
    high-quality energy for government, education and business
    facilities. Since 2000, CES has developed hundreds of projects
    that help customers reduce their energy costs and environmental
    impact. Projects announced in 2010 include the City of Brea
    Energy Efficiency and Solar Project in California, the Marine
    Corps Logistics Base Albany Landfill Gas Project in Georgia, and
    the University of Utah Thermal Storage and New Central Plant
    Project.

Research
    and Technology



The company’s energy technology organization supports
    Chevron’s upstream and downstream businesses by providing
    technology, services and competency development in earth
    sciences; reservoir and production engineering; drilling and
    completions; facilities engineering; manufacturing; process
    technology; catalysis; technical computing; and health,
    environment and safety disciplines. The information technology
    organization integrates computing, telecommunications, data
    management, security and network technology to provide a
    standardized digital infrastructure and enable Chevron’s
    global operations and business processes.



Chevron Technology Ventures (CTV) manages investments and
    projects in emerging energy technologies and their integration
    into Chevron’s core businesses. As of the end of 2010, CTV
    continued to explore technologies such as next-generation
    biofuels and advanced solar. In 2010, the company constructed
    and commissioned a one megawatt concentrating photovoltaic (CPV)
    solar facility on the tailing site of Chevron’s molybdenum
    mine in Questa, New Mexico. This beneficial reuse project
    is one of the largest CPV installations in the world. Also in
    2010, the company constructed and commissioned a 0.74 megawatt
    next generation solar photovoltaic installation on a former
    refinery site in Bakersfield, California. Seven solar panel
    technologies are being tested to establish the viability of
    these solar technologies at other Chevron sites.



Chevron’s research and development expenses were
    $526 million, $603 million and $702 million for
    the years 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.



Some of the investments the company makes in the areas described
    above are in new or unproven technologies and business
    processes, and ultimate technical or commercial successes are
    not certain.

Environmental
    Protection



Virtually all aspects of the company’s businesses are
    subject to various U.S. federal, state and local
    environmental, health and safety laws and regulations and
    to similar laws and regulations in other countries. These
    regulatory requirements continue to change and increase in both
    number and complexity and to govern not only the manner in which
    the company conducts its operations, but also the products it
    sells. Most of the costs of complying with the many laws and
    regulations pertaining to its operations are, or are expected to
    become, embedded in the normal costs of conducting business.



In 2010, the company’s U.S. capitalized environmental
    expenditures were $639 million, representing about
    12 percent of the company’s total consolidated
    U.S. capital and exploratory expenditures. These
    environmental expenditures include capital outlays to retrofit
    existing facilities as well as those associated with new
    facilities. The expenditures relate mostly to air- and
    water-quality projects and activities at the company’s
    refineries, oil and gas producing facilities, and marketing
    facilities. For 2011, the company estimates U.S. capital
    expenditures for environmental control facilities will be





approximately $800 million. The future annual capital costs
    are uncertain and will be governed by several factors, including
    future changes to regulatory requirements.





The EPA also finalized its revised Renewable Fuel Standard
    (RFS2) regulations as required by the Energy Independence and
    Security Act of 2007. The regulations require fuel providers to
    blend increased volumes of renewable fuels into gasoline and
    diesel each year and establish specific greenhouse gas reduction
    and feedstock criteria for subcategories of renewable fuel,
    including cellulosic fuel, advanced biofuel and biomass-based
    diesel. The specific impacts of this regulation are determined
    by many factors, including fluctuating markets for renewable
    fuels and EPA regulatory decisions on potential waivers of
    volume requirements.



Additionally, under California’s Global Warming Solutions
    Act, enacted in 2006, the California Air Resources Board (CARB),
    charged with implementing the law, has adopted a new low-carbon
    fuel standard intended to reduce the carbon intensity of
    transportation fuels. The state is behind schedule in completing
    certain elements of the standard. Consequently, initial carbon
    intensity reduction requirements are effective as of January
    2011, but CARB has delayed other aspects of compliance until it
    completes further updates to the regulation later in the year.
    In December 2010, CARB adopted regulations implementing the cap
    and trade program requirements of the Global Warming Solutions
    Act. The first compliance period of the cap and trade program
    begins in 2012 and ends in December 2014. CARB has yet to
    develop detailed regulations to implement this portion of the
    Act, including the determination of how emissions allowances
    will be allocated and traded during this period. The effect of
    any such regulation on the company’s business is uncertain.
