Summary Description of Chevron

Chevron Corporation,*a Delaware corporation, manages its investments in subsidiaries and affiliates and provides administrative, financial, management and technology support to U.S. and international subsidiaries that engage in fully integrated petroleum operations, chemicals operations, and power and energy services. Upstream operations consist primarily of exploring for, developing and producing crude oil and natural gas; processing, liquefaction, transportation and regasification associated with liquefied natural gas; transporting crude oil by major international oil export pipelines; transporting, storage and marketing of natural gas; and a gas-to-liquids plant. Downstream operations consist primarily of refining crude oil into petroleum products; marketing of crude oil and refined products; transporting crude oil and refined products by pipeline, marine vessel, motor equipment and rail car; and manufacturing and marketing of commodity petrochemicals, plastics for industrial uses and fuel and lubricant additives.

A list of the company’s major subsidiaries is presented on page E-4. As of December 31,2014, Chevron had approximately 64,700 employees (including about 3,300 service station employees). Approximately 31,800 employees (including about 3,100 service station employees), or 49 percent, were employed in U.S. operations.

Overview of Petroleum Industry

Petroleum industry operations and profitability are influenced by many factors. Prices for crude oil, natural gas, petroleum products and petrochemicals are generally determined by supply and demand. Production levels from the members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) are a major factor in determining worldwide supply. Demand for crude oil and its products and for natural gas is largely driven by the conditions of local, national and global economies, although weather patterns and taxation relative to other energy sources also play a significant part. Laws and governmental policies, particularly in the areas of taxation, energy and the environment, affect where and how companies conduct their operations and formulate their products and, in some cases, limit their profits directly.

Strong competition exists in all sectors of the petroleum and petrochemical industries in supplying the energy, fuel and chemical needs of industry and individual consumers. Chevron competes with fully integrated, major global petroleum companies, as well as independent and national petroleum companies, for the acquisition of crude oil and natural gas leases and other properties and for the equipment and labor required to develop and operate those properties. In its downstream business, Chevron competes with fully integrated, major petroleum companies and other independent refining, marketing, transportation and chemicals entities and national petroleum companies in the sale or acquisition of various goods or services in many national and international markets.

Reserves

Refer to Table V beginning on page FS-65 for a tabulation of the company’s proved net liquids (including crude oil, condensate, natural gas liquids and synthetic oil) and natural gas reserves by geographic area, at the beginning of2012and each year-end from2012through2014. Reserves governance, technologies used in establishing proved reserves additions, and major changes to proved reserves by geographic area for the three-year period ended December 31,2014, are summarized in the discussion for Table V. Discussion is also provided regarding the nature of, status of, and planned future activities associated with the development of proved undeveloped reserves. The company recognizes reserves for projects with various development periods, sometimes exceeding five years. The external factors that impact the duration of a project include scope and complexity, remoteness or adverse operating conditions, infrastructure constraints, and contractual limitations.

At December 31, 2014, 20 percent of the company's net proved reserves were located in Kazakhstan and 19 percent were located in the United States.

The net proved reserve balances at the end of each of the three years2012through2014are shown in the following table:

Delivery Commitments

The company sells crude oil and natural gas from its producing operations under a variety of contractual obligations. Most contracts generally commit the company to sell quantities based on production from specified properties, but some natural gas sales contracts specify delivery of fixed and determinable quantities, as discussed below.

In the United States, the company is contractually committed to deliver 239 billion cubic feet of natural gas to third parties through2017. The company believes it can satisfy these contracts through a combination of equity production from the company’s proved developed U.S. reserves and third-party purchases. These commitments include a variety of pricing terms, including both indexed and fixed-price contracts.










Outside the United States, the company is contractually committed to deliver a total of 705 billion cubic feet of natural gas to third parties from2015through2017from operations in Australia, Colombia, Denmark and the Philippines. These sales contracts contain variable pricing formulas that are generally referenced to the prevailing market price for crude oil, natural gas or other petroleum products at the time of delivery. The company believes it can satisfy these contracts from quantities available from production of the company’s proved developed reserves in these countries.



Development Activities

Review of Ongoing Exploration and Production Activities in Key Areas

Chevron has exploration and production activities in most of the world's major hydrocarbon basins. Chevron’s2014key upstream activities, some of which are also discussed in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, beginning on page FS-3, are presented below. The comments include references to “total production” and “net production,” which are defined under “Production” in Exhibit 99.1 on page E-10.

The discussion that follows references the status of proved reserves recognition for significant long-lead-time projects not on production as well as for projects recently placed on production. Reserves are not discussed for exploration activities or recent discoveries that have not advanced to a project stage, or for mature areas of production that do not have individual projects requiring significant levels of capital or exploratory investment. Amounts indicated for project costs represent total project costs, not the company’s share of costs for projects that are less than wholly owned.



United States

Upstream activities in the United States are primarily located in California, the Gulf of Mexico, Colorado, Louisiana, Michigan, New Mexico, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Texas, West Virginia and Wyoming. Average net oil-equivalent production in the United States during 2014 was 664,000 barrels per day.

In California, the company has significant production in the San Joaquin Valley. In 2014, net daily production averaged 163,000 barrels of crude oil, 66 million cubic feet of natural gas and 3,000 barrels of natural gas liquids (NGLs). Approximately 86 percent of the crude oil production is considered heavy oil (typically with API gravity lower than 22 degrees).

During 2014, net daily production in the Gulf of Mexico averaged 133,000 barrels of crude oil, 320 million cubic feet of natural gas and 15,000 barrels of NGLs. Chevron was engaged in various exploration and development activities in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico during 2014.

The Jack and St. Malo fields are being jointly developed with a host floating production unit (FPU) located between the two fields. Chevron has a 50 percent interest in the Jack Field and a 51 percent interest in the St. Malo Field. Both fields are company-operated. Chevron's interest in the production host facility is 40.6 percent. The facility has a design capacity of 170,000 barrels of crude oil and 42 million cubic feet of natural gas per day to accommodate production from the Jack/St. Malo development as well as third-party tiebacks. First production was achieved in December 2014, and production from three of 10 planned wells ramped-up during first quarter 2015. In addition, front-end engineering and design (FEED) activities continued in 2014 on the second phase of the development plan for the Jack and St. Malo fields, and construction is expected to commence on Stage 2 in 2016. Proved reserves have been recognized for this project. Production from the Jack/St. Malo development is expected to ramp up to a total daily rate of 94,000 barrels of crude oil and 21 million cubic feet of natural gas. The Jack and St. Malo fields have an estimated production life of 30 years from the time of start-up.

Construction and commissioning activities for the 60 percent-owned and operated Big Foot Project progressed during 2014, reaching 93 percent complete by year end.The project facilities have a design capacity of 75,000 barrels of crude oil and 25 million cubic feet of natural gas per day. First production is anticipated in late 2015. The field has an estimated production life of 35 years from the time of start-up. Proved reserves have been recognized for this project.

At the 58 percent-owned and operated Tahiti Field, work continued during 2014 on Tahiti 2 – a project that is designed to increase recovery from the main producing interval. The last injection well is expected to be completed in first quarter 2015.Additional infill drilling is scheduled for the Tahiti Field through 2016, with production from the first well expected in second-half 2015. The initial recognition of proved reserves occurred in 2014 for the infill drilling. The Tahiti Field has an estimated remaining production life of at least 20 years.

The company has a 42.9 percent nonoperated working interest in the Tubular Bells Field. First production was achieved in November 2014.

The company has a 15.6 percent nonoperated working interest in the Mad Dog Field. The next development phase, the Mad Dog 2 Project, is planned to develop the southern portion of the field. The development plan was re-evaluated in 2013, and FEED was re-entered on a new development concept in third quarter 2014. At the end of 2014, proved reserves had not been recognized for this project.

Chevron holds a 25 percent nonoperated working interest in the Stampede Project, which includes the joint development of the Knotty Head and Pony fields. The planned facilities have a design capacity of 80,000 barrels of crude oil and 40 million cubic feet of natural gas per day. A final investment decision was reached in third quarter 2014. Drilling is planned to commence in fourth quarter 2015 with first oil expected in 2018. The fields have an estimated production life of 30 years from the time of start-up. The initial recognition of proved reserves occurred in 2014 for this project.










FEED activities commenced in early 2015 on a project to jointly develop the 55 percent-owned and operated Buckskin Field and the 87.5 percent-owned and operated Moccasin Field, which are located 12 miles apart. The development plan includes a subsea tieback to a third-party production facility with 30,000 barrels of crude oil and 15 million cubic feet of natural gas per day of firm capacity and rights to additional available capacity. A final investment decision is expected in 2016. At the end of 2014, proved reserves had not been recognized for this project.

In early 2015, the company announced a joint venture to explore and appraise 24 jointly held offshore leases in the northwest portion of Keathley Canyon. Chevron will be the operator. The joint venture includes the Tiber and Gila discoveries and the Gibson exploratory prospect, located between Gila and Tiber. The company acquired a 36 percent interest in the Gila leases and a 31 percent interest in the Tiber leases and also holds a 36 percent interest in the Gibson prospect. The scope of the joint venture includes further exploration and appraisal of the leases and evaluation of the potential for a centralized production facility. Separately, during 2014, the company exchanged its interest in the Coronado prospect for interests in other prospective deepwater exploration opportunities.

During 2014 and early 2015, the company participated in four appraisal wells and eight exploration wells in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. An appraisal well and a sidetrack were completed at the Buckskin Field in 2014, and results are under evaluation. In October 2014, the company completed drilling an exploration well at the 42.5 percent-owned and operated Guadalupe prospect, which resulted in a significant crude oil discovery in the Lower Tertiary Wilcox Sands, adjacent to Keathley Canyon. Drilling at the 55 percent-owned and operated Anchor prospect was completed in December 2014, resulting in a significant crude oil discovery, also in the Lower Tertiary Wilcox Sands. In late 2014, drilling commenced on an appraisal well of the Tiber discovery as well as on a sidetrack of the Gila discovery well, and drilling is expected to continue until mid-2015. In January 2015, drilling commenced at the 40 percent-owned and operated Sweetwater and the 50 percent-owned and operated Sicily exploration wells, and both wells are expected to be completed in second quarter 2015.

In addition, Chevron added eleven leases to its deepwater portfolio as a result of awards from Gulf of Mexico lease sales held in 2014.

The company produces crude oil and natural gas in the midcontinent region of the United States, primarily in Colorado, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Texas and Wyoming. During 2014, the company’s net daily production in these areas averaged 110,000 barrels of crude oil, 595 million cubic feet of natural gas and 31,000 barrels of NGLs.

In the Permian Basin of West Texas and southeast New Mexico, the company continued to ramp-up development of shale and tight resources with drilling activities focused in the Midland and Delaware basins where the company holds approximately 500,000 and 1,000,000 net acres, respectively. The company drilled 550 wells in the Midland and Delaware basins in 2014.

The company holds leases in the Marcellus Shale and the Utica Shale, primarily located in southwestern Pennsylvania, eastern Ohio, and the West Virginia panhandle, and in the Antrim Shale and Collingwood/Utica Shale in Michigan. During 2014, the company's net daily production in these areas averaged 269 million cubic feet of natural gas. In 2014, development of the Marcellus Shale continued at a measured pace, focused on improving execution capability and reservoir understanding. Activities in the Utica Shale during 2014 focused on exploration drilling to acquire data necessary for potential future development.
