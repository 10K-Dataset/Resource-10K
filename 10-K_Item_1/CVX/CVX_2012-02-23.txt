Summary
    Description of Chevron



Chevron
    Corporation,*a Delaware corporation, manages its investments in subsidiaries
    and affiliates and provides administrative, financial,
    management and technology support to U.S. and international
    subsidiaries that engage in fully integrated petroleum
    operations, chemicals operations, mining operations, power
    generation and energy services. Upstream operations consist
    primarily of exploring for, developing and producing crude oil
    and natural gas; processing, liquefaction, transportation and
    regasification associated with liquefied natural gas;
    transporting crude oil by major international oil export
    pipelines; transporting, storage and marketing of natural gas;
    and agas-to-liquidsproject. Downstream operations consist primarily of refining
    crude oil into petroleum products; marketing of crude oil and
    refined products; transporting crude oil and refined products by
    pipeline, marine vessel, motor equipment and rail car; and
    manufacturing and marketing of commodity petrochemicals,
    plastics for industrial uses and fuel and lubricant additives.



A list of the company’s major subsidiaries is presented on
    pagesE-4andE-5.As
    of December 31, 2011, Chevron had approximately
    61,000 employees (including about 3,800 service station
    employees). Approximately 30,000 employees (including about
    3,500 service station employees), or 49 percent, were
    employed in U.S. operations.



Overview
    of Petroleum Industry



Petroleum industry operations and profitability are influenced
    by many factors. Prices for crude oil, natural gas, petroleum
    products and petrochemicals are generally determined by supply
    and demand. The members of the Organization of Petroleum
    Exporting Countries (OPEC) are typically the world’s swing
    producers of crude oil and their production levels are a major
    factor in determining worldwide supply. Demand for crude oil and
    its products and for natural gas is largely driven by the
    conditions of local, national and global economies, although
    weather patterns and taxation relative to other energy sources
    also play a significant part. Laws and governmental policies,
    particularly in the areas of taxation, energy and the
    environment affect where and how companies conduct their
    operations and formulate their products and, in some cases,
    limit their profits directly.



Strong competition exists in all sectors of the petroleum and
    petrochemical industries in supplying the energy, fuel and
    chemical needs of industry and individual consumers. Chevron
    competes with fully integrated, major global petroleum
    companies, as well as independent and national petroleum
    companies, for the acquisition of crude oil and natural gas
    leases and other properties and for the equipment and labor
    required to develop and operate those properties. In its
    downstream business, Chevron also competes with fully
    integrated, major petroleum companies and other independent
    refining, marketing, transportation and chemicals entities and
    national petroleum companies in the sale or acquisition of
    various goods or services in many national and international
    markets.



Operating
    Environment



Refer to pages FS-2 through FS-8 of thisForm 10-Kin Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
    Condition and Results of Operations for a discussion of the
    company’s current business environment and outlook.







*Incorporated

    in Delaware in 1926 as Standard Oil Company of California, the
    company adopted the name Chevron Corporation in 1984 and
    ChevronTexaco Corporation in 2001. In 2005, ChevronTexaco
    Corporation changed its name to Chevron Corporation. As used in
    this report, the term “Chevron” and such terms as
    “the company,” “the corporation,”
    “our,” “we” and “us” may refer to
    Chevron Corporation, one or more of its consolidated
    subsidiaries, or all of them taken as a whole, but unless stated
    otherwise it does not include “affiliates” of
    Chevron — i.e., those companies accounted for by the
    equity method (generally owned 50 percent or less) or
    investments accounted for by the cost method. All of these terms
    are used for convenience only and are not intended as a precise
    description of any of the separate companies, each of which
    manages its own affairs.





Chevron’s
    Strategic Direction



Chevron’s primary objective is to create shareholder value
    and achieve sustained financial returns from its operations that
    will enable it to outperform its competitors. In the upstream,
    the company’s strategies are to grow profitably in core
    areas, build new legacy positions and commercialize the
    company’s equity natural gas resource base while growing a
    high-impact global natural gas business. In the downstream, the
    strategies are to improve returns and grow earnings across the
    value chain. The company also continues to utilize technology
    across all its businesses to differentiate performance, and to
    invest in profitable renewable energy and energy efficiency
    solutions.



(b)Description
    of Business and Properties



The upstream and downstream activities of the company and its
    equity affiliates are widely dispersed geographically, with
    operations in North America, South America, Europe, Africa, Asia
    and Australia. Tabulations of segment sales and other operating
    revenues, earnings and income taxes for the three years ending
    December 31, 2011, and assets as of the end of 2011 and
    2010 — for the United States and the company’s
    international geographic areas — are in Note 11
    to the Consolidated Financial Statements beginning onpage FS-37.Similar comparative data for the company’s investments in
    and income from equity affiliates and property, plant and
    equipment are in Notes 12 and 13 on pages FS-39 throughFS-41.

Capital
    and Exploratory Expenditures



Total expenditures for 2011 were $29.1 billion, including
    $1.7 billion for the company’s share of
    equity-affiliate expenditures. In 2010 and 2009, expenditures
    were $21.8 billion and $22.2 billion, respectively,
    including the company’s share of affiliates’
    expenditures of $1.4 billion in 2010 and $1.6 billion
    in 2009.



Of the $29.1 billion in expenditures for 2011,
    89 percent, or $25.9 billion, was related to upstream
    activities. Approximately 87 and 80 percent was expended
    for upstream operations in 2010 and 2009, respectively.
    International upstream accounted for about 68 percent of
    the worldwide upstream investment in 2011, about 82 percent
    in 2010 and about 80 percent in 2009. These amounts exclude
    the acquisition of Atlas Energy, Inc. in 2011. Refer to a
    discussion of the acquisition of Atlas Energy, Inc., in
    Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements onpage FS-30.



In 2012, the company estimates capital and exploratory
    expenditures will be $32.7 billion, including
    $3 billion of spending by affiliates. Approximately
    87 percent of the total, or $28.5 billion, is budgeted
    for exploration and production activities, with
    $22.3 billion, or about 78 percent, of this amount for
    projects outside the United States.



Refer also to a discussion of the company’s capital and
    exploratory expenditures on pages FS-11 through FS-12.

Upstream



The table on the following page summarizes the net production of
    liquids and natural gas for 2011 and 2010 by the company and its
    affiliates. Worldwide oil-equivalent production was
    2.673 million barrels per day, down about three percent
    from 2010. The decrease was mainly associated with normal field
    declines, maintenance-related downtime and the impact of higher
    prices on entitlement volumes. Thestart-upandramp-upof
    several major capital projects — the Perdido project
    in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, the expansion at the Athabasca
    Oil Sands Project in Canada, the Frade Field in Brazil, and the
    Platong II natural gas project in Thailand — as
    well as acquisitions in the Marcellus Shale, partially offset
    the decrease in net production from 2010. Refer to the
    “Results of Operations” section beginning onpage FS-6for a detailed discussion of the factors explaining the
    2009 — 2011 changes in production for crude oil and
    natural gas liquids, and natural gas.



The company estimates its average worldwide oil-equivalent
    production in 2012 will be approximately 2.680 million
    barrels per day based on the average Brent price of $111 per
    barrel in 2011. This estimate is subject to many factors and
    uncertainties, including quotas that may be imposed by OPEC,
    price effects on entitlement volumes, changes in fiscal terms or
    restrictions on the scope of company operations, delays in
    project startups, fluctuations in demand for natural gas in
    various markets, weather conditions that may shut in production,
    civil unrest, changing geopolitics, delays in completion of
    maintenance turnarounds,greater-than-expecteddeclines in production from mature fields, or other disruptions
    to operations. The outlook for future production levels is also
    affected by the size and number of economic investment
    opportunities and, for new, large-scale projects, the time lag
    between initial exploration and the beginning of production.
    Refer to the “Review of Ongoing Exploration and Production
    Activities in Key Areas,” beginning on page 8, for a
    discussion of the company’s major crude oil and natural gas
    development projects.

Reserves



Refer to Table V beginning onpage FS-67for a tabulation of the company’s proved net crude oil and
    natural gas reserves by geographic area, at the beginning of
    2009 and each year-end from 2009 through 2011. Reserves
    governance, technologies used in establishing proved reserves
    additions, and major changes to proved reserves by geographic
    area for the three-year period ended December 31, 2011, are
    summarized in the discussion for Table V. Discussion is also
    provided regarding the nature of, status of and planned future
    activities associated with the development of proved undeveloped
    reserves. The company recognizes reserves for projects with
    various development periods, sometimes exceeding five years. The
    external factors that impact the duration of a project include
    scope and complexity, remoteness or adverse operating
    conditions, infrastructure constraints, and contractual
    limitations.



The net proved reserve balances at the end of each of the three
    years 2009 through 2011 are shown in the following table.

Delivery
    Commitments



The company sells crude oil and natural gas from its producing
    operations under a variety of contractual obligations. Most
    contracts generally commit the company to sell quantities based
    on production from specified properties, but some natural gas
    sales contracts specify delivery of fixed and determinable
    quantities, as discussed below.



In the United States, the company is contractually committed to
    deliver to third parties 232 billion cubic feet of natural
    gas through 2014. The company believes it can satisfy these
    contracts through a combination of equity production from the
    company’s proved developed U.S. reserves and
    third-party purchases. These contracts include a variety of
    pricing terms, including both indexed and fixed-price contracts.



Outside the United States, the company is contractually
    committed to deliver a total of 891 billion cubic feet of
    natural gas from 2012 through 2014 from operations in Australia,
    Colombia, Denmark and the Philippines to third parties. The
    sales contracts contain variable pricing formulas that are
    generally referenced to the prevailing market price for crude
    oil, natural gas or other petroleum products at the time of
    delivery. The company believes it can satisfy these contracts
    from quantities available from production of the company’s
    proved developed reserves in these countries.

Review of
    Ongoing Exploration and Production Activities in Key
    Areas



Chevron’s 2011 key upstream activities, some of which are
    also discussed in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
    Financial Condition and Results of Operations, beginning onpage FS-2,are presented below. The comments include references to
    “total production” and “net production,”
    which are defined under “Production” in
    Exhibit 99.1on page E-11.





The discussion that follows references the status of proved
    reserves recognition for significant long-lead-time projects not
    on production and for projects recently placed on production.
    Reserves are not discussed for exploration activities or recent
    discoveries that have not advanced to a project stage or for
    mature areas of production that do not have individual projects
    requiring significant levels of capital or exploratory
    investment. Amounts indicated for project costs represent total
    project costs, not the company’s share of costs for
    projects that are less than wholly owned.



Chevron has exploration and production activities in most of the
    world’s major hydrocarbon basins. The company’s
    upstream strategy is to grow profitably in core areas, build new
    legacy positions and commercialize the company’s equity
    natural gas resource base while growing a high-impact global gas
    business. The map at left indicates Chevron’s primary areas
    of exploration and production.





a)United
    States



Upstream activities in the United States are concentrated in
    California, the Gulf of Mexico, the Appalachian Basin, Colorado,
    Michigan, New Mexico, Ohio, Oklahoma, Texas, Wyoming and Alaska.
    Average net oil-equivalent production in the United States
    during 2011 was 678,000 barrels per day.



In California, the company has significant production in the
    San Joaquin Valley. In 2011, average net oil-equivalent
    production was 183,000 barrels per day, composed of
    165,000 barrels of crude oil, 83 million cubic feet of
    natural gas and 4,000 barrels of natural gas liquids.
    Approximately 84 percent of the crude oil production is
    considered heavy oil (typically with API gravity lower than 22
    degrees).



Average net oil-equivalent production during 2011 for the company’s combined interests in the Gulf of Mexico shelf and deepwater areas, and the onshore fields in the region was 244,000 barrels per day. The daily oil-equivalent production was composed of 161,000 barrels of crude oil, 401 million cubic feet of natural gas and 16,000 barrels of natural gas liquids.Chevron was engaged in various exploration and development activities in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico during 2011. The Jack and St. Malo fields are located within 25 miles of each other and are being jointly developed. Chevron has a 50 percent working interest in Jack and a 51 percent working interest in St. Malo. Both fields are company operated. All major installation contracts have been awarded and construction began for



the floating production unit hull and topsides modules during
    2011. Development drilling operations commenced in fourth
    quarter 2011. The facility is planned to have a design capacity
    of 177,000 barrels of oil-equivalent per day to accommodate
    production from the Jack/St. Malo development, which is
    estimated to have maximum total daily production of
    94,000 barrels of oil equivalent, plus production from a
    nearby third-party field. Total project costs for the initial
    phase of development are estimated at $7.5 billion andstart-upis
    expected in 2014. The project has an estimated production life
    of 30 years. The initial recognition of proved reserves for
    the project occurred in 2011.





Work continued at the 60 percent-owned and operated Big
    Foot discovery. The development plan includes a 15-slot drilling
    and production tension leg platform with water injection
    facilities and a design capacity of 79,000 barrels of oil
    equivalent per day. Fabrication of topsides, hull and other
    components began in first-half 2011 and initial development
    drilling commenced in fourth quarter 2011. First production is
    anticipated in 2014. The field has an estimated production life
    of 20 years. Initial proved reserves were recognized in
    2011.



Tahiti 2 is the second development phase for the
    58 percent-owned and operated Tahiti Field and is designed
    to increase recovery and return well capacity to
    125,000 barrels of oil per day. The project includes three
    water injection wells, two additional production wells and the
    water injection facilities required to deliver water to the
    injection wells. Two water injection wells have been completed
    and drilling commenced on the first production well in early
    2012. The water injection facilities have been installed and
    water injection began in first quarter 2012.Start-upof
    the first production well of the second phase is expected by
    2013. Initial proved reserves for the Tahiti 2 project were
    recognized in 2011, and the field has an estimated production
    life of 30 years.



The final investment decision was made for the Tubular Bells
    deepwater project in fourth quarter 2011. The company has a
    42.9 percent nonoperated working interest in the Tubular
    Bells unitized area after receiving an additional
    12.9 percent equity interest relinquished by a partner in
    2011. Development drilling is scheduled to begin in second
    quarter 2012, and plans include three producing and two
    injection wells, with a subsea tieback to a third-party
    production facility. First oil is anticipated in 2014, and
    maximum total daily production is expected to reach 40,000 to
    45,000 barrels of oil-equivalent. At the end of 2011,
    proved reserves had not been recognized for this project.



The company has a 20.3 percent nonoperated working interest
    in the Caesar and Tonga unitized area. Development plans include
    a total of four wells and a subsea tieback to a nearby
    third-party production facility. Three of the four development
    wells have been drilled and completed as of year-end 2011.
    Drilling of the fourth well is expected to begin in mid-2012.
    Work on the subsea system, commissioning of the topsides and the
    initial well completion program continued into 2012.
    Installation of the production riser and first production are
    expected in mid-2012. Maximum total production is expected to be
    46,000 barrels of oil-equivalent per day. Proved reserves
    have been recognized for the project.



The company has a 15.6 percent nonoperated working interest
    in the Mad Dog II Project. Front-end engineering and design
    (FEED) is expected to commence by second quarter 2012. It is
    anticipated that this future development would require new
    production facilities to support planned maximum total daily
    production of 120,000 to 140,000 barrels of oil equivalent.
    At the end of 2011, proved reserves had not been recognized for
    this project.



Development planning and unitization talks with owners of an
    adjacent field continued in 2011 for the Knotty Head project.
    Chevron has a 25 percent nonoperated working interest in
    this subsalt, Green Canyon Block 512 discovery. At the end
    of 2011, proved reserves had not been recognized for this
    project.



Deepwater exploration activities in 2011 included participation
    in four exploratory wells — two wildcats, one
    appraisal and one delineation. Following successful permitting
    under new, more stringent, U.S. Department of Interior
    guidelines, two wells resumed drilling activities after
    operations were halted in 2010 as a result of the deepwater
    drilling moratorium in the Gulf of Mexico. Drilling operations
    at the 43.8 percent-owned and operated Moccasin prospect
    resumed in first quarter 2011 and resulted in a new discovery in
    the Lower Tertiary Wilcox Trend. Drilling operations resumed in
    second quarter 2011 at the 55 percent-owned and operated
    Buckskin prospect, resulting in a successful appraisal well.
    These two discoveries, located 12 miles apart, could
    facilitate future co-development upon the successful completion
    of additional appraisal drilling planned at each prospect in
    2012. Drilling was terminated at the Coronado wildcat well due
    to drilling conditions in the shallow section of the wellbore.
    The company plans to drill a replacement well at an alternate
    location by mid-2012.



Besides the activities connected with the development and
    exploration projects in the Gulf of Mexico, the company also has
    contracted capacity at the third-party Sabine Pass liquefied
    natural gas (LNG) regasification terminal in Louisiana and in a
    third-party pipeline system connecting the Sabine Pass LNG
    terminal to the natural gas pipeline grid. The pipeline provides
    access to two major salt dome storage fields and 10 major
    interstate pipeline systems, including access to Chevron’s
    Sabine Pipeline, which connects to the Henry Hub. The Henry Hub
    interconnects to nine interstate and four intrastate pipelines
    and is the pricing point for natural gas futures contracts
    traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange.







Company activities outside California and the Gulf of Mexico include operated and nonoperated interests in properties across the mid-continental United States, the Appalachian Basin, Michigan, Ohio and Alaska. During 2011, the company’s U.S. production outside California and the Gulf of Mexico averaged 251,000 net oil-equivalent barrels per day, composed of 91,000 barrels of crude oil, 795 million cubic feet of natural gas and 28,000 barrels of natural gas liquids.In West Texas, the company continues to pursue development of tight carbonates, tight sands, and liquids-rich shale resources in the Midland Basin’s Wolfcamp play and several plays in the Delaware Basin through use of advanced drilling and completion technologies. Additional production growth is expected from interests in these formations in



future years.



In February 2011, Chevron acquired Atlas Energy, Inc. The
    acquisition provided a natural gas resource position in the
    Marcellus Shale and Utica Shale, primarily located in
    southwestern Pennsylvania and Ohio. The acquisition also
    provided a 49 percent interest in Laurel Mountain
    Midstream, LLC, an affiliate that owns more than
    1,000 miles of natural gas gathering lines servicing the
    Marcellus. In addition, the acquisition provided assets in
    Michigan, which include Antrim Shale producing assets and
    approximately 350,000 total acres in the Antrim and
    Collingwood/Utica Shale formations. Additional asset
    acquisitions in 2011 expanded the company’s holdings in the
    Marcellus and Utica to approximately 700,000 and 600,000 total
    acres, respectively. In the Marcellus, 61 natural gas wells were
    completed in 2011.

Kazakhstan:Chevron participates in two major
    upstream developments in western Kazakhstan. The company holds a
    50 percent interest in the Tengizchevroil (TCO) affiliate,
    which is operating and developing the Tengiz and Korolev crude
    oil fields under a concession that expires in 2033.
    Chevron’s net oil-equivalent production in 2011 from these
    fields averaged 296,000 barrels per day, composed of
    244,000 barrels of crude oil and natural gas liquids and
    312 million cubic feet of natural gas. During 2011, the
    majority of TCO’s crude oil production was exported through
    the Caspian Pipeline Consortium (CPC) pipeline that runs from
    Tengiz in Kazakhstan to tanker-loading facilities at
    Novorossiysk on the Russian coast of the Black Sea. The balance
    was exported via rail to Black Sea ports.



Also during 2011, TCO continued to evaluate alternatives for
    another expansion project to increase total daily crude oil
    production between 250,000 and 300,000 barrels. The
    expansion project will rely on sour gas injection technology
    utilized in current operations. Approval of FEED is anticipated
    in 2012. As of year-end 2011, proved reserves had not been
    recognized for this expansion project.





Chevron holds a 20 percent nonoperated working interest in
    the Karachaganak project, which is conducted under a
    PSC that expires in 2038. During 2011, Karachaganak net
    oil-equivalent production averaged 62,000 barrels per day,
    composed of 38,000 barrels of liquids and 144 million
    cubic feet of natural gas. In 2011, access to the CPC andAtyrau-Samara(Russia) pipelines enabled approximately 204,000 barrels
    per day (34,000 net barrels) of Karachaganak liquids to be
    sold at world-market prices. The remaining liquids were sold
    into local and Russian markets. During 2011, a fourth train
    entered production and increased total liquids-stabilization
    capacity by 56,000 barrels per day, allowing increased
    sales of condensate into world markets. Karachaganak project
    partners have reached an agreement allowing the government of
    Kazakhstan to become a 10 percent equity owner in the
    Karachaganak project. The transfer of equity to the government
    is anticipated to occur in June 2012 and will result in
    Chevron’s working interest being reduced to 18 percent.



During 2011, Chevron and its partners continued to evaluate
    alternatives for a Phase III development of Karachaganak.
    The timing of the project remains uncertain until a project
    design is finalized. At the end of 2011, proved reserves had not
    been recognized for the project.



Kazakhstan/Russia:Chevron has a 15 percent
    interest in the CPC affiliate. During 2011, CPC transported an

The foreign-flagged vessels are engaged primarily in
    transporting crude oil from the Middle East, Southeast Asia, the
    Black Sea, South America, Mexico and West Africa to ports in the
    United States, Europe, Australia and Asia. The company’s
    foreign-flagged vessels also transport refined products to and
    from various locations worldwide.



In addition to the vessels described above, the company has
    contracts in place to build LNG carriers and a
    dynamic-positioning shuttle tanker to support future upstream
    projects. The company also owns a one-sixth interest in each of
    seven LNG carriers transporting cargoes for the North West Shelf
    Venture in Australia.

Other
    Businesses

Mining



Chevron’sU.S.-basedmining company continues its efforts to divest its remaining
    coal mining operations. The company completed the sale of the
    North River Mine and other coal-related assets in Alabama in
    second quarter 2011, and the sale of its Kemmerer, Wyoming,
    surface coal mine in first quarter 2012. The company is pursuing
    the sale of its 50 percent interest in Youngs Creek Mining
    Company, LLC, which was formed to develop a coal mine in
    northern Wyoming. Activities related to final reclamation
    continued in 2011 at the company-operated surface coal mine in
    McKinley, New Mexico, which ceased coal production at the
    end of 2009.



At year-end 2011, Chevron had 153 million tons of proven
    and probable coal reserves in the United States, including
    reserves of low-sulfur coal. Coal sales from wholly owned mines
    in 2011 were 6 million tons, down about 2 million tons
    from 2010.





In addition to the coal operations, Chevron owns and operates
    the Questa molybdenum mine in New Mexico. At year-end 2011,
    Chevron had 53 million pounds of proven molybdenum reserves
    at Questa. Production and underground development at Questa
    continued at reduced levels in 2011 in response to weak prices
    for molybdenum.

Power
    Generation



Chevron’s Global Power Company manages interests in 13
    power assets with a total operating capacity of more than 3,100
    megawatts, primarily through joint ventures in the United States
    and Asia. Twelve of these are efficient combined-cycle and
    gas-fired cogeneration facilities that utilize recovered waste
    heat to produce electricity and support industrial thermal
    hosts. The 13th facility is a wind farm, located in Casper,
    Wyoming, that is designed to optimize the use of a
    decommissioned refinery site for delivery of clean, renewable
    energy to the local utility.



The company has major geothermal operations in Indonesia and the
    Philippines and is investigating several advanced solar
    technologies for use in oil field operations as part of its
    renewable energy strategy. For additional information on the
    company’s geothermal operations and renewable energy
    projects, refer to pages 19 and 20 and “Research and
    Technology” below.

Chevron

CES is a wholly owned subsidiary that develops and builds
    sustainable energy projects that increase energy efficiency and
    production of renewable power, reduce energy costs, and ensure
    reliable, high-quality energy for government, education and
    business facilities. Since 2000, CES has developed hundreds of
    projects that have helped customers reduce their energy costs
    and environmental impact. Projects announced in 2011 include the
    City of Dinuba solar project in California; the Houston
    Independent School District renewable and energy efficiency
    project in Texas; the Eglin Air Force Base energy management
    systems upgrade project in Florida; and the Oceanic Time Warner
    solar project in Hawaii.

Research
    and Technology



The company’s energy technology organization supports
    Chevron’s upstream and downstream businesses by providing
    technology, services and competency development in earth
    sciences; reservoir and production engineering; drilling and
    completions; facilities engineering; manufacturing; process
    technology; catalysis; technical computing; and health,
    environment and safety disciplines. The information technology
    organization integrates computing, telecommunications, data
    management, security and network technology to provide a
    standardized digital infrastructure and enable Chevron’s
    global operations and business processes.



Chevron Technology Ventures (CTV) manages investments and
    projects in emerging energy technologies and their integration
    into Chevron’s core businesses. As of the end of 2011, CTV
    continued to explore technologies such as next-generation
    biofuels and advanced solar. In 2011, the company completed
    construction and commissioned the world’s largest
    solar-to-steam generation project for use in
    enhanced-oil-recovery operations in Coalinga, California. The
    project will test the viability of using solar power to produce
    steam to improve oil recovery.



Chevron’s research and development expenses were
    $627 million, $526 million and $603 million for
    the years 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.



Some of the investments the company makes in the areas described
    above are in new or unproven technologies and business
    processes, and ultimate technical or commercial successes are
    not certain.

Environmental
    Protection



The company designs, operates and maintains its facilities to
    avoid potential spills or leaks and minimize the impact of those
    that may occur. Chevron requires its facilities and operations
    to have operating standards and processes and emergency response
    plans that address all credible and significant risks identified
    by site-specific risk and impact assessments. Chevron also
    requires that sufficient resources be available to execute these
    plans. In the unlikely event that a major spill or leak occurs,
    Chevron also maintains a Worldwide Emergency Response Team
    comprised of employees who are trained in various aspects of
    emergency response, including post-incident remediation.





To complement the company’s capabilities, Chevron maintains
    active membership in international oil spill response
    cooperatives, including the Marine Spill Response Corporation,
    which operates in U.S. territorial waters, and Oil Spill
    Response, Ltd. (OSRL), which operates globally. The company is a
    founding member of the Marine Well Containment Company, whose
    primary mission is to expediently deploy containment equipment
    and systems to capture and contain crude oil in the unlikely
    event of a future loss of control of a deepwater well in the
    Gulf of Mexico. In addition, the company is a member of the
    Subsea Well Response Project (SWRP). SWRP’s objective is to
    further develop the industry’s capability to contain and
    shut in subsea well control incidents in different regions of
    the world. In late 2011, upon detection of ocean floor oil seeps
    in the deepwater Frade Field in Brazil, Chevron rapidly deployed
    capabilities and processes in coordination with OSRL. In early
    2012, the company rapidly deployed response capabilities to
    address a natural gas well control incident in Nigeria.



Virtually all aspects of the company’s businesses are
    subject to various U.S. federal, state and local
    environmental, health and safety laws and regulations and to
    similar laws and regulations in other countries. These
    regulatory requirements continue to change and increase in both
    number and complexity and to govern not only the manner in which
    the company conducts its operations, but also the products it
    sells. Most of the costs of complying with the many laws and
    regulations pertaining to the company’s operations are, or
    are expected to become, embedded in the normal costs of
    conducting business.



In 2011, the company’s U.S. capitalized environmental
    expenditures were $345 million, representing about
    3 percent of the company’s total consolidated
    U.S. capital and exploratory expenditures. These
    environmental expenditures include capital outlays to retrofit
    existing facilities as well as those associated with new
    facilities. The expenditures relate mostly to air- and
    water-quality projects and activities at the company’s
    refineries, oil and gas producing facilities, and marketing
    facilities. For 2012, the company estimates U.S. capital
    expenditures for environmental control facilities will be
    approximately $410 million. The future annual capital costs
    are uncertain and will be governed by several factors, including
    future changes to regulatory requirements.



Regulations intended to protect the environment, including those
    intended to address concerns about greenhouse gas emissions and
    global climate change, continue to evolve. Legislation,
    regulations and market-based programs that could affect the
    company’s operations exist at the international or
    multinational (such as the Kyoto Protocol and the European
    Union’s Emissions Trading System), national (such as the
    U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s rules for
    stricter emission standards and increased renewable fuel content
    for transportation fuels), and regional (such as
    California’s Global Warming Solutions Act) levels.



Refer to Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
    Condition and Results of Operations on pages FS-14 through FS-16
    for additional information on environmental matters and their
    impact on Chevron and on the company’s 2011 environmental
    expenditures, remediation provisions and year-end environmental
    reserves. Refer also to Item 1A. Risk Factors on pages 29
    through 31 for a discussion of greenhouse gas regulation and
    climate change.
