Summary
    Description of Chevron



Chevron Corporation,* a Delaware corporation, manages its
    investments in subsidiaries and affiliates and provides
    administrative, financial, management and technology support to
    U.S. and international subsidiaries that engage in fully
    integrated petroleum operations, chemicals operations, mining
    operations, power generation and energy services. Exploration
    and production (upstream) operations consist of exploring for,
    developing and producing crude oil and natural gas and also
    marketing natural gas. Refining, marketing and transportation
    (downstream) operations relate to refining crude oil and
    converting natural gas into finished petroleum products;
    marketing crude oil and the many products derived from
    petroleum; and transporting crude oil, natural gas and petroleum
    products by pipeline, marine vessel, motor equipment and rail
    car. Chemicals operations include the manufacture and marketing
    of commodity petrochemicals, plastics for industrial uses, and
    fuel and lubricant oil additives.



A list of the company’s major subsidiaries is presented on
    pagesE-23andE-24.As
    of December 31, 2009, Chevron had approximately
    64,000 employees (including about 4,000 service station
    employees). Approximately 31,500 employees (including about
    3,500 service station employees), or 49 percent, were
    employed in U.S. operations.



Overview
    of Petroleum Industry



Petroleum industry operations and profitability are influenced
    by many factors, and individual petroleum companies have little
    control over some of them. Governmental policies, particularly
    in the areas of taxation, energy and the environment, have a
    significant impact on petroleum activities, regulating how
    companies are structured and where and how companies conduct
    their operations and formulate their products and, in some
    cases, limiting their profits directly. Prices for crude oil,
    natural gas, petroleum products and petrochemicals are generally
    determined by supply and demand for these commodities. However,
    some governments impose price controls on refined products such
    as gasoline or diesel fuel. The members of the Organization of
    Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) are typically the
    world’s swing producers of crude oil, and their production
    levels are a major factor in determining worldwide supply.
    Demand for crude oil and its products and for natural gas is
    largely driven by the conditions of local, national and global
    economies, although weather patterns and taxation relative to
    other energy sources also play a significant part. Seasonality
    is not a primary driver of changes in the company’s
    quarterly earnings during the year.



Strong competition exists in all sectors of the petroleum and
    petrochemical industries in supplying the energy, fuel and
    chemical needs of industry and individual consumers. Chevron
    competes with fully integrated major global petroleum companies,
    as well as independent and national petroleum companies, for the
    acquisition of crude-oil and natural-gas leases and other
    properties and for the equipment and labor required to develop
    and operate those properties. In its downstream business,
    Chevron also competes with fully integrated major petroleum
    companies and other independent refining, marketing and
    transportation entities and national petroleum companies in the
    sale or acquisition of various goods or services in many
    national and international markets.



Operating
    Environment



Refer to pages FS-2 through FS-9 of thisForm 10-Kin Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
    Condition and Results of Operations for a discussion of the
    company’s current business environment and outlook.







*Incorporated in Delaware in
    1926 as Standard Oil Company of California, the company adopted
    the name Chevron Corporation in 1984 and ChevronTexaco
    Corporation in 2001. In 2005, ChevronTexaco Corporation changed
    its name to Chevron Corporation. As used in this report, the
    term “Chevron” and such terms as “the
    company,” “the corporation,” “our,”
    “we” and “us” may refer to Chevron
    Corporation, one or more of its consolidated subsidiaries, or
    all of them taken as a whole, but unless stated otherwise, it
    does not include “affiliates” of Chevron —
    i.e., those companies accounted for by the equity method
    (generally owned 50 percent or less) or investments
    accounted for by the cost method. All of these terms are used
    for convenience only and are not intended as a precise
    description of any of the separate companies, each of which
    manages its own affairs.





Chevron
    Strategic Direction



Chevron’s primary objective is to create stockholder value
    and achieve sustained financial returns from its operations that
    will enable it to outperform its competitors. In the upstream,
    the company’s strategies are to grow profitably in core
    areas, build new legacy positions and commercialize the
    company’s equity natural-gas resource base while growing a
    high-impact global gas business. In the downstream, the
    strategies are to improve returns and selectively grow, with a
    focus on integrated value creation. The company also continues
    to invest in renewable-energy technologies, with an objective of
    capturing profitable positions.



(b)Description
    of Business and Properties



The upstream, downstream and chemicals activities of the company
    and its equity affiliates are widely dispersed geographically,
    with operations in North America, South America, Europe, Africa,
    the Middle East, Asia and Australia. Tabulations of segment
    sales and other operating revenues, earnings and income taxes
    for the three years ending December 31, 2009, and assets as
    of the end of 2009 and 2008 — for the United States
    and the company’s international geographic
    areas — are in Note 11 to the Consolidated
    Financial Statements beginning onpage FS-40.Similar comparative data for the company’s investments in
    and income from equity affiliates and property, plant and
    equipment are in Notes 12 and 13 on pages FS-43 through
    FS-45.

Capital
    and Exploratory Expenditures



Total expenditures for 2009 were $22.2 billion, including
    $1.6 billion for the company’s share of
    equity-affiliate expenditures. In 2008 and 2007, expenditures
    were $22.8 billion and $20 billion, respectively,
    including the company’s share of affiliates’
    expenditures of $2.3 billion in both periods.



Of the $22.2 billion in expenditures for 2009, about
    three-fourths, or $17.1 billion, was related to upstream
    activities. Approximately the same percentage was also expended
    for upstream operations in 2008 and 2007. International upstream
    accounted for about 80 percent of the worldwide upstream
    investment in 2009 and about 70 percent in 2008 and 2007,
    reflecting the company’s continuing focus on opportunities
    available outside the United States.



In 2010, the company estimates capital and exploratory
    expenditures will be $21.6 billion, including
    $1.6 billion of spending by affiliates. About
    80 percent of the total, or $17.3 billion, is budgeted
    for exploration and production activities, with
    $13.2 billion of that amount for projects outside the
    United States.



Refer also to a discussion of the company’s capital and
    exploratory expenditures onpage FS-12.

5Volumes

include natural gas consumed in operations of 521 million
and 520 million cubic feet per day in 2009 and 2008,
respectively.





Worldwide oil-equivalent production, including volumes from oil
    sands (refer to footnote 2 above), was 2.7 million barrels
    per day, up about 7 percent from 2008. The increase was
    mostly associated with thestart-upof
    the Blind Faith and Tahiti fields in the U.S. Gulf of
    Mexico in late 2008 and the second quarter 2009, respectively,
    the commencement of operations in the third quarter 2008 at the
    Agbami Field in Nigeria, and the expansion at Tengiz in
    Kazakhstan. Refer to the “Results of Operations”
    section beginning onpage FS-6for a detailed discussion of the factors explaining the2007-2009changes in production for crude oil and natural gas liquids, and
    natural gas.



The company estimates that its average worldwide oil-equivalent
    production in 2010 will be approximately 2.73 million
    barrels per day. This estimate is subject to many uncertainties,
    including quotas that may be imposed by OPEC, the price effect
    on production volumes calculated under cost-recovery and
    variable-royalty provisions of certain contracts, changes in
    fiscal terms or restrictions on the scope of company operations,
    delays in projectstart-ups,fluctuations in demand for natural gas in various markets, and
    production that may have to be shut in due to weather
    conditions, civil unrest,





changing geopolitics or other disruptions to operations. Future
    production levels also are affected by the size and number of
    economic investment opportunities and, for new large-scale
    projects, the time lag between initial exploration and the
    beginning of production. Refer to the “Review of Ongoing
    Exploration and Production Activities in Key Areas,”
    beginning on page 9, for a discussion of the company’s
    major crude-oil and natural-gas development projects.

    include wholly owned wells and the sum of the company’s
    fractional interests in gross wells.3Canadian synthetic oil is not
    produced through wells and therefore is not presented in the
    table above.

Reserves



Refer to Table V beginning onpage FS-69for a tabulation of the company’s proved net crude-oil and
    natural-gas reserves by geographic area, at the beginning of
    2007 and each year-end from 2007 through 2009, and an
    accompanying discussion of major changes to proved reserves by
    geographic area for the three-year period ending
    December 31, 2009. During 2009, the company provided
    crude-oil and natural-gas reserves estimates for 2008 to the
    Department of Energy, Energy Information Administration (EIA)
    that agree with the 2008 reserve volumes in Table V. This
    reporting fulfilled the requirement that such estimates be
    consistent with, and not differ more than 5 percent from,
    the information furnished to the Securities and Exchange
    Commission (SEC) in the company’s 2008 Annual Report onForm 10-K.During 2010, the company will file estimates of crude-oil and
    natural-gas reserves with the Department of Energy, EIA,
    consistent with the 2009 reserve data reported in Table V.





The net proved-reserve balances at the end of each of the three
    years 2007 through 2009 are shown in the table below:

    activity.

Acreage



At December 31, 2009, the company owned or had under lease
    or similar agreements undeveloped and developed crude-oil and
    natural-gas properties located throughout the world. The
    geographical distribution of the company’s acreage is shown
    in the following table.

    acreage associated with the synthetic oil production in Canada.
    At year-end 2009, undeveloped gross and net acreage totaled 235
    and 31, respectively. Developed gross and net acreage totaled 35
    and 7, respectively. Developed acreage is acreage associated
    with productive mines. Undeveloped acreage is acreage on which
    mines have not been established and that may contain undeveloped
    proved reserves.3Developed acreage is spaced or
    assignable to productive wells. Undeveloped acreage is acreage
    on which wells have not been drilled or completed to permit
    commercial production and that may contain undeveloped proved
    reserves. The gross undeveloped acres that will expire in 2010,
    2011 and 2012 if production is not established by certain
    required dates are 13,526, 9,784 and 3,662, respectively.





Delivery
    Commitments



The company sells crude oil and natural gas from its producing
    operations under a variety of contractual obligations. Most
    contracts generally commit the company to sell quantities based
    on production from specified properties, but some natural-gas
    sales contracts specify delivery of fixed and determinable
    quantities, as discussed below.



In the United States, the company has no fixed and determinable
    delivery commitments to third-parties or affiliates.



Outside the United States, the company is contractually
    committed to deliver to third parties a total of
    821 billion cubic feet of natural gas from 2010 through
    2012 from Australia, Colombia, Denmark and the Philippines. The
    sales contracts contain variable pricing formulas that are
    generally referenced to the prevailing market price for crude
    oil, natural gas or other petroleum products at the time of
    delivery. The company believes it can satisfy these contracts
    from quantities available from production of the company’s
    proved developed reserves in Australia, Colombia, Denmark and
    the Philippines.

Review of
    Ongoing Exploration and Production Activities in Key
    Areas



Chevron’s 2009 key upstream activities, some of which are
    also discussed in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
    Financial Condition and Results of Operations beginning onpage FS-2,are presented below. The comments include references to
    “total production” and “net production,”
    which are defined under “Production” in
    Exhibit 99.1 onpage E-42.



The discussion that follows references the status of proved
    reserves recognition for significant long-lead-time projects not
    yet on production and for projects recently placed on
    production. Reserves are not discussed for recent discoveries
    that have yet to advance to a project stage or for mature areas
    of production that do not have individual projects requiring
    significant levels of capital or exploratory investment. Amounts
    indicated for project costs represent total project costs, not
    the company’s share of costs for projects that are less
    than wholly owned.





Chevron has production and exploration activities in most of the
    world’s major hydrocarbon basins. The company’s
    upstream strategy is to grow profitably in core areas, build new
    legacy positions and commercialize the company’s equity
    natural-gas resource base while growing a high-impact global gas
    business. The map at left indicates Chevron’s primary areas
    of production and exploration.





a)United
    States



Upstream activities in the United States are concentrated in
    California, the Gulf of Mexico, Louisiana, Texas, New Mexico,
    the Rocky Mountains and Alaska. Average net oil-equivalent
    production in the United States during 2009 was
    717,000 barrels per day.



In California, the company has significant production in the
    San Joaquin Valley. In 2009, average net oil-equivalent
    production was 211,000 barrels per day, composed of
    191,000 barrels of crude oil, 91 million cubic feet of
    natural gas and 5,000 barrels of natural gas liquids.
    Approximately 84 percent of the crude-oil production is
    considered heavy oil (typically with API gravity lower than 22
    degrees).



Average net oil-equivalent production during 2009 for the
    company’s combined interests in the Gulf of Mexico shelf
    and deepwater areas, and the onshore fields in the region was
    243,000 barrels per day. The daily oil-equivalent
    production comprised 149,000 barrels of crude oil,
    484 million cubic feet of natural gas and
    14,000 barrels of natural gas liquids.



During 2009, Chevron was engaged in various development and exploration activities in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. The 75 percent-owned and operated Blind Faith development, which achieved first oil in the fourth quarter 2008, reached maximum total production of 70,000 barrels per day of oil-equivalent in 2009. Blind Faith has an estimated production life of 20 years.At the 58 percent-owned and operated Tahiti Field, first oil was achieved in the second quarter 2009. Maximum total production of 135,000 barrels per day of oil-equivalent was achieved in the third quarter 2009. A second development phase is under evaluation, including additional development drilling and a probable waterflood, with a final investment decision planned formid-2010. The waterflood includes water injection topsides



equipment, subsea equipment and water injection wells. Tahiti
    has an estimated production life of 30 years. As of the end
    of 2009, proved reserves had been recognized for the first
    development phase of the Tahiti Field.



The company is participating in the ultra-deepwater Perdido
    Regional Development. The project encompasses the installation
    of a producing host facility to service multiple fields,
    including Chevron’s 33.3 percent-owned Great White,
    60 percent-owned Silvertip and 57.5 percent-owned
    Tobago. Chevron has a 37.5 percent interest in the Perdido
    Regional Host. All of these fields and the production facility
    are partner-operated. Activities during 2009 included
    installation of the topsides on the spar, installation of
    umbilicals,hook-upand
    commissioning of the facility systems, and ongoing development
    drilling. First oil is expected in the first half of 2010, with
    the facility designed to handle 130,000 barrels of
    oil-equivalent per day. The project has an expected life of
    approximately 25 years. Proved reserves have been
    recognized for the project.





The company has a 60 percent-owned and operated interest in
    Big Foot. Two successful appraisal wells have been drilled, the
    most recent in the first quarter 2009. The company also acquired
    the rights to an adjacent block during 2009. The project entered
    front-end engineering and design (FEED) in October 2009 and a
    final investment decision is expected in late 2010. Total
    maximum production from the project is expected to be
    63,000 barrels of oil-equivalent per day. At the end of
    2009, proved reserves had not been recognized.



The Caesar and Tonga partnerships for properties located in a
    number of blocks in the Green Canyon area have formed a unit
    agreement for the area, with Chevron having a 20.3 percent
    nonoperated working interest. A final investment decision on the
    joint Caesar-Tonga project was made in the first quarter 2009.
    Development plans include four wells and a subsea tie-back to a
    nearby third-party production facility. Two development
    sidetracks were completed during the year. Proved reserves have
    been recognized for the project and first oil is expected in
    2011.



The Jack and St. Malo fields are located within 25 miles of
    each other and are being considered for joint development.
    Chevron has a 50 percent-owned interest in Jack and a
    51 percent-owned interest in St. Malo, following the
    anticipated acquisition of an additional 9.8 percent equity
    interest in St. Malo in March 2010. Both fields are company
    operated. The project entered FEED in May 2009 and a final
    investment decision is expected in late 2010. The facility is
    planned to have an initial design capacity of
    150,000 barrels of oil-equivalent per day andstart-upis
    expected in 2014. At the end of 2009, proved reserves had not
    been recognized.



Deepwater exploration activities in 2009 and early 2010 included
    participation in 10 exploratory wells — five wildcat,
    three appraisal and two delineation. Exploratory work included
    the following:



•Buckskin — 55 percent-owned and operated. A
    successful wildcat discovery was announced in February 2009. The
    first appraisal well is scheduled to begin drilling in the
    second quarter 2010.•Knotty Head — 25 percent nonoperated working
    interest. The first appraisal well began drilling in October
    2009 at this 2005 discovery.•Puma — 21.8 percent nonoperated working interest.
    An appraisal well completed drilling in early 2009. Leases were
    relinquished in mid-2009.•Tubular Bells — 30 percent nonoperated working
    interest. Studies to screen and evaluate future development
    alternatives were continuing at the end of 2009.



At the end of 2009, the company had not recognized proved
    reserves for any of the exploration projects discussed above.



Besides the activities connected with the development and
    exploration projects in the Gulf of Mexico, the company also has
    contracted capacity of 1 billion cubic feet per day at the
    third-party Sabine Pass liquefied natural gas (LNG)
    regasification terminal in Louisiana. The20-yearcapacity reservation agreement became effective in July 2009 and
    enables import of natural gas for the North America market. In
    September 2009, Chevron began to utilize a portion of the
    reserved capacity under this agreement.



Chevron has also contracted 1.6 billion cubic feet per day
    of capacity in a third-party pipeline system connecting the
    Sabine Pass LNG terminal to the natural-gas pipeline grid. The
    new pipeline, which was placed in service in July 2009, provides
    access to two major salt dome storage fields and 10 major
    interstate pipeline systems, including an interconnect with
    Chevron’s Sabine Pipeline, which connects to the Henry Hub.
    An interconnect to Chevron’s Bridgeline Pipeline is
    scheduled to be completed in the third quarter 2010. The Henry
    Hub interconnects to nine interstate and four intrastate
    pipelines and is the pricing point for natural gas futures
    contracts traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange.



Outside California and the Gulf of Mexico, the company manages
    operations across the mid-continental United States and Alaska.
    During 2009, the company’s U.S. production outside
    California and the Gulf of Mexico averaged 263,000 net
    oil-equivalent barrels per day, composed of 94,000 barrels
    of crude oil, 824 million cubic feet of natural gas and
    31,000 barrels of natural gas liquids.



In the Piceance Basin in northwestern Colorado, additional
    production came on line in September 2009 from the
    company’s 100 percent-owned and operated natural-gas
    development. Development drilling, which began in 2007,
    surpassed 190 wells in 2009, with 81 completed wells
    available to supply natural gas to the central processing
    facility. Construction of compression and dehydration facilities
    to produce 65 million cubic feet per day of natural gas was
    completed in the third quarter 2009. Future work is expected to
    be completed in multiple stages. The full development plan
    includes drilling more than 2,000 wells from multi-well
    pads over the next 30 to 40 years. Proved reserves for
    subsequent stages of the project had not been recognized at
    year-end 2009.





b)Africa



In Africa, the company is engaged in exploration and production
    activities in Angola, Chad, Democratic Republic of the Congo,
    Nigeria and Republic of the Congo. Net oil-equivalent production

Angola:Chevron holds company-operated working interests in offshore Blocks 0 and 14 and nonoperated working interests in offshore Block 2 and the onshore Fina Sonangol Texaco (FST) area. Net production from these operations in 2009 averaged 150,000 barrels of oil-equivalent per day.The company operates the 39.2 percent-owned Block 0, which averaged 105,000 barrels per day of net liquids production in 2009. The Block 0 concession extends through 2030.Initial production from the northern portion of the Mafumeira Field in Block 0 occurred in July 2009, and total maximum crude-oil production of 42,000 barrels per day was achieved in first quarter 2010. Front-end engineering and design (FEED) started in January 2010 on Mafumeira Sul, a project to develop the southern portion of the Mafumeira Field. A final investment decision is expected in 2011. Maximum production from Mafumeira Sul is expected to be 95,000 barrels of crude oil per day. At year
- -end 2009, no proved reserves had been recognized for this project.





In the Greater Vanza/Longui Area of Block 0, development
    concept selection was under way and continued into 2010. FEED is
    planned for 2011. FEED activities continued on the south
    extension of the N’Dola Field development. At year-end
    2009, no proved reserves had been recognized for these projects.



Four gas management projects in Block 0 are expected to
    eliminate routine flaring of natural gas by injecting excess
    natural gas into various reservoirs. The Takula Flare and Relief
    Modification Project and the Cabinda Gas Plant Project entered
    service in June 2009 and December 2009, respectively. These
    projects are expected to reduce flaring by up to 60 million
    cubic feet per day. Work continued on the Nemba Enhanced
    Secondary Recovery and Flare Reduction Project and the Malongo
    Flare and Relief Modification Project, which are scheduled forstart-upin
    the fourth quarter 2010 and in 2011, respectively.



Also in Block 0, a successful two-well exploration and
    appraisal program was completed. The exploration well was
    completed in March 2009, and the appraisal well was completed in
    May 2009. Drilling began on another exploration well in November
    2009 and was completed in the first quarter 2010. The results
    are under evaluation.



In the 31 percent-owned Block 14, net production in
    2009 averaged 33,000 barrels of liquids per day from the
    Benguela Belize — Lobito Tomboco development and the
    Kuito, Tombua and Landana fields. Development and production
    rights for the various fields in Block 14 expire between
    2027 and 2029.



Development of the Tombua and Landana fields continued in 2009.
    First production occurred in August 2009 from new production
    facilities that were installed in late 2008. Proved developed
    reserves were recognized at start of production. Development
    drilling is expected to continue, with maximum total daily
    production of 100,000 barrels of crude oil anticipated in
    2011.



During 2009, studies to evaluate development alternatives for
    the Lucapa Field continued. The project is expected to enter
    FEED in the fourth quarter 2010. A successful appraisal well was
    completed in the fourth quarter 2009 in the Malange area. As of
    the end of 2009, development of the Negage Field was suspended
    until cooperative arrangements between Angola and Democratic
    Republic of the Congo could be finalized. At the end of 2009,
    proved reserves had not been recognized for these projects.



The 39.2 percent-owned and operated Malongo Terminal Oil
    Export project was completed in November 2009. The new export
    system more than doubled export capacity from the area, which
    includes Blocks 0 and 14. In the 20 percent-owned
    Block 2 and the 16.3 percent-owned FST areas, combined
    production during 2009 averaged 3,000 barrels of net
    liquids per day.





Equity Affiliate Operations:In addition to the
    exploration and producing activities in Angola, Chevron has a
    36.4 percent ownership interest in the Angola LNG affiliate
    that began construction in early 2008 of an onshore natural gas
    liquefaction plant located in Soyo, Angola. The plant is
    designed to process more than 1 billion cubic feet of
    natural gas per day. Construction continued on schedule during
    2009 with plantstart-upscheduled for 2012. The life of the LNG plant is estimated to be
    in excess of 20 years. Proved reserves have been recognized
    for the producing operations associated with this project.



Angola — Republic of the Congo Joint Development
    Area:Chevron operates and holds a 31.3 percent
    interest in the Lianzi Development Area located between Angola
    and Republic of the Congo. In late 2008, the development project

    3,000 barrels of oil-equivalent.



Chad/Cameroon:Chevron participates in a project to
    develop crude-oil fields in southern Chad and transport the
    produced volumes by pipeline to the coast of Cameroon for
    export. Chevron has a 25 percent nonoperated working
    interest in the producing operations and an approximate
    21 percent interest in two affiliates that own the
    pipeline. Average daily net production from the Chad fields in
    2009 was 27,000 barrels of oil-equivalent. In September
    2009, first production was achieved at the Timbre Field in the
    Doba area. The Chad producing operations are conducted under a
    concession that expires in 2030.



Libya:After an unsuccessful exploration well was
    completed, the company elected to relinquish its
    100 percent interest in the onshore Block 177
    exploration license in the fourth quarter 2009.



Nigeria:Chevron holds a 40 percent interest in 13 concessions in the onshore and near-offshore region of the Niger Delta. The company operates under a joint-venture arrangement in this region with the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation, which owns a 60 percent interest. The company also owns varying interests in deepwater offshore blocks. In 2009, the company’s net oil-equivalent production in Nigeria averaged 232,000 barrels per day, composed of 225,000 barrels of liquids and 48 million cubic feet of natural gas.In deepwater Oil Mining Lease (OML) 127 and OML 128, the 68.2 percent-owned and operated Agbami Field reached maximum total liquids production of 250,000 barrels per day in August 2009, following completion of development drilling. In December 2009, a subsequent 10-well development program was initiated and is expected to offset field decline. The leases that contain the Agbami Field expire in 2023 and 2024.Also in the deepwater area, t
he Aparo Field in OML 132 and OML 140 and the Bonga SW Field in offshore OML 118 share a common geologic structure and are planned to be jointly developed under a proposed unitization agreement. Work continued in 2009 on a final unitization agreement between Chevron and



partners in OML 118. At the end of 2009, no proved reserves were
    recognized for this project.





Chevron operates and holds a 95 percent interest in the
    deepwater Nsiko discovery on OML 140. Development activities
    continued in 2009, with FEED expected to start after commercial
    terms are resolved. At the end of 2009, the company had not
    recognized proved reserves for this project.



The company also holds a 30 percent nonoperated working
    interest in the deepwater Usan project in OML 138. The
    development plans involve subsea wells producing to a floating
    production, storage and offloading vessel. Development drilling
    started in June 2009. Productionstart-upis
    scheduled for 2012, and maximum total production of
    180,000 barrels of crude oil per day is expected to be
    achieved within one year ofstart-up.Total costs for the project are estimated at $8.4 billion.
    Usan has an estimated production life of 20 years. Proved
    reserves have been recognized for this project.



Chevron participated in one successful deepwater exploration
    well during 2009 in Oil Prospecting License (OPL) 223. The
    company has a 30 percent nonoperated working interest in
    the license. At the end of 2009, proved reserves had not been
    recognized for the exploration project.



In the Niger Delta, construction on the Phase 3A expansion of
    the Escravos Gas Plant (EGP) was completed in late 2009 and
    start of production is expected in March 2010. EGP Phase 3A
    scope includes offshore natural-gas gathering and compression
    infrastructure and the addition of a second natural-gas
    processing facility. The modifications are designed to increase
    processing capacity from 285 million to 680 million
    cubic feet of natural gas per day and increase LPG and
    condensate export capacity from 15,000 to 58,000 barrels
    per day. EGP Phase 3A is designed to process natural gas from
    the Meji, Delta South, Okan and Mefa fields. The anticipated
    life of EGP Phase 3A is 25 years. Phase 3B of the EGP
    project is designed to gather natural gas from eight offshore
    fields and to compress and transport natural gas to onshore
    facilities beginning in 2012. The engineering, procurement,
    construction, and installation contract for the pipelines was
    awarded and work commenced in late 2009. Proved reserves have
    been recognized for these projects.



The 40 percent-owned and operated Onshore Asset Gas
    Management project is designed to restore approximately
    125 million cubic feet per day of natural-gas production
    from certain onshore fields that have been shut in since 2003
    due to civil unrest. Natural gas from these fields is sold in
    the Nigerian domestic gas market. The mainon-siteconstruction contracts are expected to be awarded in the second
    quarter 2010.

    Operations” beginning on page 26 for a discussion of
    the West African Gas Pipeline operations.





c)  Asia



Major producing countries in Asia include Azerbaijan,
    Bangladesh, Indonesia, Kazakhstan, the Partitioned Zone located
    between Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, and Thailand. During 2009, net
    oil-equivalent production averaged 1,044,000 barrels per
    day in Asia.



Azerbaijan:Chevron holds a 10.3 percent nonoperated working interest in the Azerbaijan International Operating Company (AIOC), which produces crude oil in the Caspian Sea from the Azeri-Chirag-Gunashli (ACG) project. Chevron also has an 8.9 percent interest in the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan (BTC) affiliate, which transports AIOC production by pipeline from Baku, Azerbaijan, through Georgia to Mediterranean deepwater port facilities in Ceyhan, Turkey. (Refer to “Pipelines” under “Transportation Operations” beginning on page 26 for a discussion of BTC operations.)In 2009, the company’s daily net production from AIOC averaged 30,000 barrels of oil-equivalent. The final investment decision on the next development phase is expected in the first half 2010. AIOC operations are conducted under a30-yearproduction-sharing contract (PSC) that expires in 2024.Kazakhstan:Chevron holds a 20 p
ercent nonoperated working interest in the Karachaganak project, which is being developed in phases. During 2009, Karachaganak net oil-equivalent production averaged 69,000 barrels per day, composed of 42,000 barrels of liquids and 161 million cubic feet of natural gas. In 2009, access to the Caspian Pipeline Consortium (CPC) and Atyrau-Samara (Russia) pipelines enabled approximately 184,000 barrels per day (33,000 net barrels) of Karachaganak liquids to be sold at world-market



prices. The remaining liquids were sold into Russian markets.
    During 2009, work continued on a fourth train that is designed
    to increase total export of processed liquids by
    56,000 barrels per day. The fourth train is expected tostart-upin
    2011.



During 2009, Chevron and its partners continued to evaluate
    alternatives for a Phase III development of Karachaganak.
    Timing for the recognition of Phase III proved reserves is
    uncertain and depends on finalizing a project design and
    achieving project milestones. Karachaganak operations are
    conducted under a40-yearPSC
    that expires in 2038.



Equity Affiliate Operations:The company
    holds a 50 percent interest in Tengizchevroil (TCO), which
    is operating and developing the Tengiz and Korolev crude-oil
    fields, located in western Kazakhstan, under a40-yearconcession that expires in 2033. Chevron’s net
    oil-equivalent production in 2009 from these fields averaged
    274,000 barrels per day, composed of 226,000 barrels
    of crude oil and natural gas liquids and 289 million cubic
    feet of natural gas.



In 2009, TCO continuedramp-upof
    the Sour Gas Injection (SGI) and Second Generation Plant (SGP)
    facilities. The SGI facility injects approximately one-third of
    the sour gas separated from the crude oil back into the
    reservoir. The injected gas maintains higher reservoir pressure
    and displaces oil towards producing wells. TCO is evaluating
    options for another expansion project based on SGI/SGP
    technologies.



During 2009, the majority of TCO’s crude-oil production was
    exported through the Caspian Pipeline Consortium (CPC) pipeline
    that runs from Tengiz in Kazakhstan to tanker-loading facilities
    at Novorossiysk on the Russian coast of the Black Sea. The
    balance was shipped via other export routes, which included
    shipment via tanker to Baku for transport by the BTC pipeline to
    Ceyhan or by rail to Black Sea ports. (Refer to
    “Pipelines” under “Transportation
    Operations” beginning on page 26 for a discussion of
    CPC operations.)





Turkey:Chevron holds a 25 percent nonoperated
    working interest in the Silopi licenses in southeast Turkey,
    which is on trend with production in Iraq’s northern Zagros
    Fold Belt. An exploration well in the Lale prospect completed
    drilling in the first quarter 2010, and is under evaluation.



Bangladesh:Chevron holds interests in three
    operated PSCs covering onshore Blocks 12, 13 and 14 and
    offshore Block 7. The company has a 98 percent
    interest in Blocks 12, 13 and 14. Government approval of a
    2009 farm-out in Block 7 was received in February 2010,
    reducing the company’s interest from 88 percent to
    43 percent. The farm-out was to GS Caltex, a 50
    percent-owned affiliate of the company. Net oil-equivalent
    production from these operations in 2009 averaged
    66,000 barrels per day, composed of 387 million cubic
    feet of natural gas and 2,000 barrels of liquids. In 2009,
    a final investment decision was achieved after the government
    approved the development of a compression project that is
    expected to support additional production starting in 2012 from
    the Bibiyana, Jalalabad and Moulavi Bazar natural-gas fields.
    Proved reserves have been recognized for this project. The
    government also approved an amendment to the PSC for
    Blocks 13 and 14 that allows the company to acquire
    additional3-Dseismic
    over the Jalalabad Field. Also in 2009, the company acquired
    seismic data on Block 7. Evaluation and data processing is
    under way, and an exploration well is planned to be completed by
    2011.



Cambodia:Chevron operates the1.2 million-acre(4,709 sq-km) Block A, located offshore in the Gulf of Thailand,
    and expects to reduce its ownership to 30 percent pending
    government approval of the farm-out that is anticipated in the
    second quarter 2010. In 2009, commercial evaluation of the
    prospects continued. The company was granted an extension for
    the Block A exploration period to the third quarter 2010 in
    exchange for the obligation to drill three exploration wells.
    Information gained from the drilling program is expected to
    provide improved definition of the resource in the block. Proved
    reserves had not been recognized as of the end of 2009.



Myanmar:Chevron has a 28.3 percent nonoperated
    working interest in a PSC for the production of natural gas from
    the Yadana and Sein fields offshore in the Andaman Sea. The
    company also has a 28.3 percent interest in a pipeline
    company that transports the natural gas from Yadana to the
    Myanmar-Thailand border for delivery to power plants in
    Thailand. Most of the natural gas is purchased by
    Thailand’s PTT Public Company Limited (PTT). The
    company’s average net natural gas production in 2009 was
    76 million cubic feet per day. During 2009, the platform
    for a compression project was completed. Projectstart-upis
    expected in 2011.



Thailand:Chevron has operated and nonoperated working interests in several different offshore blocks. The company’s net oil-equivalent production in 2009 averaged 198,000 barrels per day, composed of 65,000 barrels of crude oil and condensate and 794 million cubic feet of natural gas. All of the company’s natural-gas production is sold to PTT under long-term sales contracts.Operated interests are in Pattani and other fields with ownership interests ranging from 35 percent to 80 percent in Blocks 10 through 13, B12/27, B8/32, 9A, G4/43 and G4/48. Blocks B8/32 and 9A produce crude oil and natural gas from eight operating areas, and Blocks 10 through 13 and B12/27 produce crude oil, condensate and natural gas from 16 operating areas.



Chevron has a 16 percent nonoperated working interest in
    Blocks 14A, 15A, 16A, G9/48 and G8/50, known collectively
    as the Arthit Field.



During 2009, construction at the 69.8 percent-owned and
    operated Platong Gas II project continued. The project is
    designed to add 420 million cubic feet per day of
    processing capacity in 2012. Proved reserves have been
    recognized for this project. Concessions for Blocks 10
    through 13 expire in 2022.



During 2009, 14 exploration wells were drilled in the Gulf of
    Thailand, 13 were successful and one nonoperated well in the
    Arthit Field was unsuccessful. Two3-Dseismic
    surveys and geological studies for Block G4/50 were also
    completed in 2009. At the end of 2009, proved reserves had not
    been recognized for these activities. Three exploratory wells in
    Block G4/50 are planned for the second quarter 2010. For Blocks
    G6/50 and G7/50, one exploration well is scheduled in each block
    for completion by the third quarter 2010. In addition, Chevron
    holds exploration interests in a number of blocks that are
    currently inactive, pending resolution of border issues between
    Thailand and Cambodia.





Vietnam:The company operates off the southwest
    coast and has a 42.4 percent interest in a PSC that
    includes Blocks B and 48/95, and a 43.4 percent interest in
    another PSC for Block 52/97. In August 2009, Chevron
    reduced its ownership interest in a third operated PSC to
    20 percent in Block B122 offshore eastern Vietnam. No
    production occurred in these areas during 2009.



In the blocks off the southwest coast, the Vietnam Gas Project
    is aimed at developing an area in the Malay Basin to supply
    natural gas to state-owned Petrovietnam. The project includes
    installation of wellhead and hub platforms, a floating storage
    and offloading vessel, field pipelines and a central processing
    platform. The project is expected to enter front-end engineering
    and design (FEED) in the first quarter 2010, and a final
    investment decision is expected in 2011. Maximum total
    production is planned to be about 500 million cubic feet of
    natural gas per day. At the end of 2009, proved reserves had not
    been recognized for this project.



In conjunction with the Vietnam Gas Project, a
    Petrovietnam-operated pipeline will be required to support the
    offshore development. Chevron will have a 28.7 percent
    interest in the pipeline, which is planned to transport natural
    gas from the offshore development to customers in southern
    Vietnam.



During the year, the company continued to analyze well results
    and seismic processing from Block B and Block 52/97. In
    Block 122,2-Dseismic
    data processing and geologic studies were completed. An
    exploration well is planned for 2011. Proved reserves had not
    been recognized as of the end of 2009. Future activity in
    Block 122 may be affected by an ongoing territorial
    dispute between Vietnam and China.



China:Chevron has one operated and three nonoperated working interests in several areas. Net oil-equivalent production from the nonoperated areas in 2009 averaged 19,000 barrels per day, composed of 17,000 barrels of crude oil and condensate and 16 million cubic feet of natural gas.The company holds a 49 percent-owned and operated interest in the Chuandongbei area in the onshore Sichuan Basin, where the company entered into a30-yearPSC effective February 2008 to develop natural-gas resources. Project plans included two sour-gas purification plants with an aggregate design capacity of 740 million cubic feet per day. During 2009, general infrastructure for the plant site and well pads progressed. Development drilling and the construction and installation of additional processing facilities and gathering systems are expected to start in 2010. Proved reserves have been recognized for this project. The PSC for Chuandongbei e
xpires in 2038.In the South China Sea, the company has nonoperated working interests of 32.7 percent in Blocks 16/08 and 16/19 located in the Pearl River Delta Mouth Basin, 24.5 percent in the QHD-32-6 Field in Bohai Bay, and 16.2 percent in the unitized and producing BZ25-1and BZ19-4crude-oil fields in Bohai Bay Block 11/19. In



November 2009, a storm damaged the floating production, storage
    and offloading (FPSO) vessel utilized by the company’s
    nonoperated assets in Block 11/19. Temporary and permanent
    recovery options are under development and production is
    expected to fully resume in 2012.



The joint development of the HZ25-3 and HZ25-1 crude-oil fields
    in Block 16/19 continued through the end of 2009. First
    production was delayed from the third quarter 2009 and is
    expected to be fully restored in the fourth quarter 2010
    following damage to the FPSO vessel caused by a typhoon that
    struck the area in September 2009.



In 2009, Chevron relinquished its nonoperated working interest
    in four exploration blocks in the Ordos Basin. Government
    approval is expected in mid-2010.





Indonesia:Chevron’s operated interests in
    Indonesia are managed by several wholly owned subsidiaries,
    including PT Chevron Pacific Indonesia (CPI). CPI holds operated
    interests of 100 percent in the Rokan and Siak PSCs and
    90 percent in the MFK (Mountain Front Kuantan) PSC. Other
    subsidiaries operate four PSCs in the Kutei Basin, located
    offshore East Kalimantan, and one PSC in the East Ambalat Block,
    located offshore northeast Kalimantan. These interests range
    from 80 percent to 100 percent. Chevron also has
    nonoperated working interests in a joint venture in Block B in
    the South Natuna Sea and in the NE Madura III Block inthe
    East Java Sea Basin. Chevron’s interests in these PSCs
    range from 25 percent to 40 percent.







The company’s net oil-equivalent production in 2009 from
    all of its interests in Indonesia averaged 243,000 barrels
    per day. The daily oil-equivalent rate comprised
    199,000 barrels of liquids and 268 million cubic feet
    of natural gas. The largest producing field is Duri, located in
    the Rokan PSC. Duri has been under steamflood operation since
    1985 and is one of the world’s largest steamflood
    developments. The North Duri Development is divided into
    multiple expansion areas. The first expansion in Area 12 started
    steam injection in June 2009. Maximum total daily production
    from Area 12 is estimated at 34,000 barrels of crude oil in
    2012. A final investment decision regarding North Duri Area 13
    is expected by year-end 2010. The Rokan PSC expires in 2021.



Chevron advanced its development plans for the Gendalo and Gehem
    deepwater natural-gas fields located in the Kutei Basin. FEED
    started in December 2009, with completion dependent upon
    achieving project milestones and receipt of government
    approvals. The Bangka deepwater natural-gas project was
    progressed during the year under a revised, lower-cost
    development plan. The project is expected to enter FEED in the
    second quarter 2010. Under the terms of the PSCs for both
    projects, the company’s 80 percent-owned and operated
    interest is expected to be reduced to 72 percent in 2010
    with the farm-in of an Indonesian company. At the end of 2009,
    the company had not recognized proved reserves for either of
    these projects.



Also in the Kutei Basin, first production at the Seturian Field
    occurred in September 2009, which is providing natural gas to a
    state-owned refinery. During 2009, evaluation of the
    50 percent-owned and operated Sadewa project in the Kutei
    Basin was suspended.



A drilling campaign continued through 2009 in South Natuna Sea
    Block B to provide additional supply for long-term natural-gas
    sales contracts with additional development drilling planned for
    2010. The North Belut development project achieved first
    production in November 2009. The South Belut development project
    was under review during the year.



A two-well exploration program was conducted in the Central
    Sumatra Basin in 2009. One commercial discovery was made in the
    Rokan Block, and a second well in the Siak Block resulted in a
    dry hole. Chevron’s working interests in two exploration
    blocks in western Papua, West Papua I and West Papua III, are
    expected to be reduced to 51 percent interests in 2010.
    Completion of geological studies for those blocks was ongoing at
    year-end 2009, and2-Dseismic
    acquisition is planned for the second half 2010.



In West Java, Chevron operates the wholly owned Salak geothermal
    field with a total power-generation capacity of
    377 megawatts. Also in West Java, Chevron holds a
    95 percent interest in a power generation company that
    operates the Darajat geothermal contract area with a total
    capacity of 259 megawatts. Chevron also operates a
    95 percent-owned300-megawattcogeneration facility in support of CPI’s operation in
    North Duri, Sumatra.







Partitioned Zone (PZ):Chevron holds a30-yearagreement with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia to operate on behalf of the Saudi government its 50 percent interest in the petroleum resources of the onshore area of the PZ between Saudi Arabia and Kuwait. Under the agreement, the company has rights to this 50 percent interest in the hydrocarbon resource and pays royalty and taxes on the associated volumes produced until 2039.During 2009, the company’s average net oil-equivalent production was 105,000 barrels per day, composed of 101,000 barrels of crude oil and 21 million cubic feet of natural gas. In June 2009, steam injection was initiated in the second phase of a steamflood pilot project.



The pilot is an application of steam injection into a carbonate
    reservoir and, if successful, could significantly increase heavy
    oil recovery. The Central Gas Utilization Project was initiated
    in 2009 to assess alternatives to increase natural-gas
    utilization and eliminate routine flaring. A final investment
    decision is expected in 2011. No reserves have been recognized
    for these projects.



Philippines:The company holds a 45 percent
    nonoperated working interest in the Malampaya natural-gas field
    located 50 miles (80 km) offshore Palawan Island. Net
    oil-equivalent production in 2009 averaged 27,000 barrels
    per day, composed of 137 million cubic feet of natural gas
    and 4,000 barrels of condensate. Chevron also develops and
    produces geothermal resources under an agreement with the
    Philippine government. Chevron expects to sign a new25-yearcontract with the government by the end of 2010 to operate the
    steam fields, which supply geothermal resources to the 637
    megawatt geothermal facilities.



d)  Other



“Other” is composed of Australia, Argentina, Brazil,
    Colombia, Trinidad and Tobago, Venezuela, Canada, Greenland,
    Denmark, Faroe Islands, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland and the
    United Kingdom. Net oil-equivalent production from countries
    included in this section averaged 484,000 barrels per day
    during 2009. In addition, the company’s share of production
    from oil sands (for upgrading into synthetic oil) from the
    Athabasca Oil Sands Project in Canada was 26,000 barrels
    per day.



Australia:During 2009, the average net oil-equivalent production from Chevron’s interests in Australia was 108,000 barrels per day, composed of 35,000 barrels of liquids and 434 million cubic feet of natural gas.Chevron has a 16.7 percent nonoperated working interest in the North West Shelf (NWS) Venture offshore Western Australia. Daily net production from the project during 2009 averaged 26,000 barrels of crude oil and condensate, 433 million cubic feet of natural gas, and 5,000 barrels of LPG. Approximately 70 percent of the natural gas was sold in the form of LNG to major utilities in Japan, South Korea and China, primarily under long-term contracts. The remaining natural gas was sold to the Western Australia domestic market.The NWS Venture continues to progress two major capital projects that achieved final investment decision in 2008. Fabrication of platform topsides for the North Rankin 2 project commenced in June 2009. The proj
ect is designed to recover remaining low-pressure natural gas from the North Rankin and Perseus natural-gas fields to meet gas supply needs and includes necessary tie-ins to, and refurbishment of, the North Rankin A platform. Upon completion, both platforms are







designed to be operated as a single integrated facility. The
    project is scheduled to start production in 2013. Proved
    reserves have been recognized for the project.



The NWS Venture is also advancing plans to extend the period of
    crude-oil production. The NWS Oil Redevelopment Project is
    designed to replace the present floating production, storage and
    offloading vessel and a portion of existing subsea
    infrastructure that services production from the Cossack,
    Hermes, Lambert and Wanaea offshore fields. In 2009, work
    commenced on conversion of the replacement vessel. The project
    is expected tostart-upin
    early 2011 and extend production past 2020. The concession for
    the NWS Venture expires in 2034.



On Barrow and Thevenard islands off the northwest coast of
    Australia, Chevron operates crude-oil producing facilities that
    had combined net production of 4,000 barrels per day in
    2009. Chevron’s interests in these operations are
    57.1 percent for Barrow and 51.4 percent for Thevenard.



Also off the northwest coast of Australia, Chevron holds
    significant equity interests in the large natural-gas resource
    of the Greater Gorgon Area. The company initially held a
    50 percent ownership interest across most of the area and
    is the operator of the Gorgon Project. Chevron and its
    joint-venture partners are proceeding with the combined
    development of Gorgon and nearby natural-gas fields as one
    large-scale project. Environmental approval from the Australian
    Commonwealth Government was issued in August 2009. In September
    2009, the company announced the final investment decision and
    total estimated project costs for the first phase of development
    of $37 billion (AU$ 43 billion). The
    project’s scope includes a three-train,
    15 million-metric-ton-per-year LNG facility; a carbon
    sequestration project; and a domestic natural-gas plant. Natural
    gas for the project is expected to be supplied from the Gorgon
    and Io/Jansz fields.



In 2009, long-term, binding agreements were finalized with four
    Asian customers for the delivery of about 4.4 million
    metric tons per year of LNG from the Gorgon Project. Equity
    sales agreements with three of the customers reduced
    Chevron’s interest in the project to 47.3 percent at
    the end of 2009. Nonbinding Heads of Agreements (HOA) for
    delivery of an additional 2.1 million metric tons per year
    of LNG were also signed with three additional Asian customers in
    2009 and early 2010. Negotiations continue to finalize binding
    sales agreements, which would bring LNG delivery commitments to
    a combined total of about 90 percent of Chevron’s
    share of LNG from the project. During 2009, the company
    recognized proved reserves for the Greater Gorgon Area fields
    included in the project. First production of natural gas from
    these fields is expected in 2014. The project’s estimated
    economic life exceeds 40 years from the time ofstart-up.



Development of the company’s majority-owned and operated
    Wheatstone and Iago fields, located offshore Western Australia,
    continued with the project entering front-end engineering and
    design (FEED) in July 2009. Chevron operates the project and
    plans to supply natural gas to its 75 percent-owned and
    operated LNG facilities from two 100 percent-owned licenses
    comprising the majority of the Wheatstone Field and part of the
    nearby Iago Field. In October 2009, agreements were signed with
    two companies to join the Wheatstone Project as combined
    25 percent LNG facility owners and suppliers of natural gas
    for the project’s first two LNG trains. In December 2009
    and January 2010, nonbinding HOAs were signed with two Asian
    customers to take delivery of 4.9 million tons of LNG per
    year from the project, representing about 60 percent of the
    total LNG available from the foundation project. In addition,
    under these same HOAs the parties would acquire a combined
    16.8 percent nonoperated working interest in the Wheatstone
    Field licenses and a 12.6 percent interest in the
    foundation natural-gas processing facilities at the final
    investment decision. At the end of 2009, the company had not
    recognized proved reserves for this project.



In the Browse Basin, the company continued engineering and
    survey work on two potential development concepts for the
    Brecknock, Calliance and Torosa fields. At the end of 2009,
    proved reserves had not been recognized.



In May 2009, the company announced the successful completion of
    a well at the Clio prospect to further explore and appraise the
    66.7 percent-owned Block WA-205-P. In 2009 and early 2010,
    the company also announced natural-gas discoveries at the
    Kentish Knock prospect in the 50 percent-owned Block
    WA-365-P, the Achilles and Satyr prospects in the
    50 percent-owned Block WA-374-P and the Yellowglen prospect
    in the 50 percent-owned WA-268-P Block. All prospects are
    Chevron-operated. At the end of 2009, proved reserves had not
    been recognized.







Argentina:Chevron holds operated interests in eight concessions in the Neuquen Basin. Working interests range from 18.8 percent to 100 percent. Net oil-equivalent production in 2009 averaged 38,000 barrels per day, composed of 33,000 barrels of crude oil and natural gas liquids and 27 million cubic feet of natural gas. The company also holds a 14 percent interest in the Oleoductos del Valle S.A. pipeline. In 2009, Chevron sold its oil and gas concession in the Austral Basin and its interest in the Confluencia Field in the Neuquen Basin.Brazil:Chevron holds working interests in three deepwater blocks in the Campos Basin. Chevron also holds a nonoperated working interest in one block in the Santos Basin. Net oil-equivalent production in 2009 averaged 2,000 barrels per day.The Frade Field, located in the Campos Basin, achieved first oil in June 2009. Chevron is the operator and has a 51.7 percent interest in the field. Additional
 development drilling is under way, with an estimated maximum total production of 72,000 oil-equivalent barrels per day. The concession that includes the Frade project expires in 2025.In the partner-operated Campos Basin Block BC-20, two areas — 37.5 percent-owned Papa-Terra and 30 percent-owned Maromba — were retained for developmentfollowing the end of the exploration phase of this block. The Papa-Terra project progressed through FEED, and a



final investment decision was made in January 2010. The project
    operator estimates total costs of $5.2 billion and expects
    first production in 2013. The facility is expected to be capable
    of producing up to 140,000 barrels of crude oil per day.
    Evaluation of design options for Maromba continued into 2010. At
    the end of 2009, proved reserves had not been recognized for
    these projects.



In the Santos Basin, evaluation of investment options continued
    into 2010 for the 20 percent-owned and partner-operated
    Atlanta and Oliva fields. At the end of 2009, proved reserves
    had not been recognized for these fields.



Colombia:The company operates the offshore Chuchupa
    and the onshore Ballena and Riohacha natural-gas fields as part
    of the Guajira Association contract. In exchange, Chevron
    receives 43 percent of the production for the remaining
    life of each field and a variable production volume from a
    fixed-fee Build-Operate-Maintain-Transfer agreement based on
    prior Chuchupa capital contributions. Daily net production
    averaged 245 million cubic feet of natural gas in 2009.



Trinidad and Tobago:Company interests include
    50 percent ownership in three partner-operated blocks in
    the East Coast Marine Area offshore Trinidad, which includes the
    Dolphin and Dolphin Deep producing natural-gas fields and the
    Starfish discovery. Chevron also holds a 50 percent
    operated interest in the Manatee area of Block 6(d). Net
    production in 2009 averaged 199 million cubic feet of
    natural gas per day. Incremental production associated with a
    new domestic sales agreement commenced at Dolphin in the third
    quarter 2009.



Venezuela:The company operates in two exploratory
    blocks offshore Plataforma Deltana, with working interests of
    60 percent in Block 2 and 100 percent in
    Block 3. Chevron also holds a 100 percent operated
    interest in the Cardon III exploratory block, located north
    of Lake Maracaibo in the Gulf of Venezuela. Petróleos de
    Venezuela, S.A. (PDVSA), Venezuela’s national crude-oil and
    natural-gas company, has the option to increase its ownership in
    each of the three company-operated blocks up to 35 percent
    upon declaration of commerciality. In February 2010, a
    Chevron-led consortium was selected to participate in a
    heavy-oil project composed of three blocks in the Orinoco Oil
    Belt of eastern Venezuela. The consortium is expected to acquire
    a 40 percent interest in the project, with PDVSA holding
    the remaining interest.



The Loran Field in Block 2 is projected to provide the
    initial supply of natural gas for Delta Caribe LNG (DCLNG) Train
    1, Venezuela’s first LNG train. A DCLNG framework agreement
    was signed in 2008, which provides Chevron with





a 10 percent nonoperated interest in the first train and
    the associated offshore pipeline. An interim operating agreement
    governing activities prior to a final investment decision was
    signed by Chevron and its Train 1 partners in March 2009. In May
    2009, the company relinquished part of Block 3 and retained
    the portion containing the 2005 Macuira natural-gas discovery.
    An unsuccessful exploration well was drilled in the
    Cardon III block in 2009. The company plans to continue to
    evaluate exploration potential in the Cardon III block in
    2010. At the end of 2009, proved reserves had not been
    recognized in these exploratory blocks.



Equity Affiliate Operations:Chevron also holds
    interests in two affiliates located in western Venezuela and in
    one affiliate in the Orinoco Belt. Chevron has a 30 percent
    interest in the Petropiar affiliate that operates the Hamaca
    heavy-oil production and upgrading project located in
    Venezuela’s Orinoco Belt, a 39.2 percent interest in
    the Petroboscan affiliate that operates the Boscan Field in the
    western part of the country, and a 25.2 percent interest in
    the Petroindependiente affiliate that operates the LL-652 Field
    in Lake Maracaibo. The company’s share of average net
    oil-equivalent production during 2009 from these operations was
    54,000 barrels per day, composed of 51,000 barrels of
    crude oil and natural gas liquids and 23 million cubic feet
    of natural gas.



Canada:Company activities in Canada include nonoperated working interests of 26.9 percent in the Hibernia Field and 26.6 percent in the Hebron Field, both offshore eastern Canada, and 20 percent in the Athabasca Oil Sands Project (AOSP) and operated interests of 60 percent in the Ells River Oil Sands Project. Excluding volumes mined at AOSP, average net oil-equivalent production during 2009 was 28,000 barrels per day, composed of 27,000 barrels of crude oil and natural gas liquids and 4 million cubic feet of natural gas.Substantially all of this production was from the Hibernia Field, where the working interest owners are also pursuing development of the Hibernia Southern Extension (HSE). Development of the HSE nonunitized area was approved by the provincial regulator in 2009, and the first producing well for the project was completed at year-end.



In February 2010, binding agreements were signed with the
    Government of Newfoundland and Labrador on the development of
    the HSE unitized area, providing Chevron with a
    23.6 percent nonoperated working interest in the unitized
    area.



For Hebron, agreements were reached during 2008 with the
    Government of Newfoundland and Labrador that allow development
    activities to begin. At the end of 2009, proved reserves had not
    been recognized for this project.



At AOSP, the company’s production from oil sands (for
    upgrading into synthetic oil) averaged 26,000 barrels per
    day during 2009. The first phase of an expansion project is
    under way and is expected to increase total production from oil
    sands by 100,000 barrels per day. The expansion would
    increase total AOSP design capacity to more than
    255,000 barrels per day in late 2010. The projected cost of
    this expansion is $14.3 billion.



The Ells River project consists of heavy-oil leases of more than
    85,000 acres (344 sq km). The area contains significant
    volumes with potential for recovery by using Steam Assisted
    Gravity Drainage, an industry-proven technology that employs
    steam and horizontal drilling to extract the production from oil
    sands through wells rather than through mining operations.
    Additional field appraisal activity is not planned in the
    near-term. At the end of 2009, proved reserves had not been
    recognized.



The company also holds exploration leases in the Mackenzie Delta
    and Beaufort Sea region, including a 34 percent nonoperated
    working interest in the offshore Amauligak discovery. Three
    exploration wells were drilled on company leases in the
    Mackenzie Delta region in 2009, and assessment of development
    concept alternatives for Amauligak continues. The company holds
    additional exploration acreage in eastern Labrador and the
    Orphan Basin. In 2009, the company was also successful in
    acquiring a western Canada lease position to explore for shale
    gas. At the end of 2009, proved reserves had not been recognized
    for any of these areas.





Greenland:Processing of the2-Dseismic
    survey acquired over License 2007/26 in Block 4 offshore
    West Greenland in 2008 continued in 2009, and evaluation will
    commence in the first-half 2010. Chevron has a 29.2 percent
    nonoperated working interest in this exploration license.



Denmark:Chevron has a 15 percent working interest in the partner-operated Danish Underground Consortium (DUC), which produces crude oil and natural gas from 15 fields in the Danish North Sea. Net oil-equivalent production in 2009 from DUC averaged 55,000 barrels per day, composed of 35,000 barrels of crude oil and 119 million cubic feet of natural gas. DUC development activity in the region includes the ongoing Halfdan Phase IV project, which achieved first production in July 2009.Faroe Islands:Chevron withdrew from License 008 in 2009, but continues to assess exploration opportunities in the area.Netherlands:Chevron operates and holds interests ranging from 34.1 percent to 80 percent in eight blocks in the Dutch sector of the North Sea. In 2009, the company’s net oil-equivalent production from the five producing blocks was 9,000 barrels per day, composed of 2,000 barrels of crude oil and 41 
;million cubic feet of natural gas. In 2009 Chevron divested its 48 percent interest in the L11/b license.



Norway:The company holds a 7.6 percent
    interest in the partner-operated Draugen Field. The
    company’s net production averaged 5,000 barrels of
    oil-equivalent per day during 2009. In 2009, Chevron was awarded
    a 40 percent working interest as operator of the
    exploration license PL 527 in the deepwater portion of the
    Norwegian Sea. Data acquisition was completed on a2-Dseismic
    survey, and evaluation is under way.



Poland:In December 2009, Chevron was awarded three
    five-year exploration licenses in the Zwierzyniec, Kransnik and
    Frampol concessions, and in February 2010, Chevron acquired the
    exploration rights to the Grabowiec concession. Chevron has a
    100 percent-owned and operated interest in these four
    concessions to explore for shale gas.



United Kingdom:The company’s average net
    oil-equivalent production in 2009 from 10 offshore fields was
    110,000 barrels per day, composed of 73,000 barrels of
    crude oil and natural gas liquids and 222 million cubic
    feet of natural gas. Most of the production was from the
    85 percent-owned and operated Captain Field, the
    23.4 percent-owned and operated Alba Field and the
    32.4 percent-owned and jointly operated Britannia Field.



Evaluation of development alternatives continued during 2009 for
    the 19.4 percent-owned and partner-operated Clair Phase 2
    project west of the Shetland Islands. In the
    40 percent-owned and operated Rosebank/Lochnagar area
    northwest of the Shetland Islands, an exploration well in
    Rosebank North was completed in the second quarter 2009 and an
    appraisal well in Rosebank/Lochnagar was completed in the third
    quarter 2009. Also northwest of the Shetland Islands, a
    three-well exploration and appraisal drilling program was
    completed in 2009 at the Cambo prospect. Technical studies have
    commenced to select a preferred development alternative.
    Additional exploration drilling in the region is expected to
    occur in the second-half 2010. As of the end of 2009, proved
    reserves had not been recognized for any of these prospects.



In February 2010, the company sold its 10 percent nonoperated
    interest in the Laggan/Tormore discovery.

Sales of
    Natural Gas and Natural Gas Liquids



The company sells natural gas and natural gas liquids from its
    producing operations under a variety of contractual
    arrangements. In addition, the company also makes third-party
    purchases and sales of natural gas and natural gas liquids in
    connection with its trading activities.





During 2009, U.S. and international sales of natural gas
    were 5.9 billion and 4.1 billion cubic feet per day,
    respectively, which includes the company’s share of equity
    affiliates’ sales. Outside the United States, substantially
    all of the natural-gas sales from the company’s producing
    interests are from operations in Australia, Bangladesh,
    Kazakhstan, Indonesia, Latin America, the Philippines, Thailand
    and the United Kingdom.



U.S. and international sales of natural gas liquids were
    161 thousand and 111 thousand barrels per day, respectively, in
    2009. Substantially all of the international sales of natural
    gas liquids are from company operations in Africa, Australia and
    Indonesia.

1Perth Amboy has been idled since
    early 2008 and is operated as a terminal.2Chevron holds 100 percent of
    the common stock issued by Chevron South Africa (Pty) Limited,
    which owns the Cape Town Refinery. A consortium of South African
    partners owns preferred shares ultimately convertible to a
    25 percent equity interest in Chevron South Africa (Pty)
    Limited. None of the preferred shares had been converted as of
    February 2010.3Includes 3,000, 6,000 and
    35,000 barrels per day of refinery inputs in 2009, 2008 and
    2007, respectively, for interests in refineries that were sold
    during those periods.



Average crude oil distillation capacity utilization during 2009
    was 91 percent, compared with 87 percent in 2008,
    largely a result of improved utilization at the refineries in
    Mississippi, Canada and Thailand. At the U.S. fuel
    refineries, crude oil distillation capacity utilization averaged
    96 percent in 2009, compared with 95 percent in 2008,
    and cracking and coking capacity utilization averaged
    85 percent and 86 percent in 2009 and 2008,
    respectively. Cracking and coking units are the primary
    facilities used in fuel refineries to convert heavier feedstocks
    into gasoline and other light products.



The company’s refineries in the United States, the United
    Kingdom, Canada, South Africa and Australia produce low-sulfur
    fuels. During 2009, GS Caltex, the company’s
    50 percent-owned affiliate, continued construction on a new
    heavy-oil hydrocracker designed to increase high-value product
    yield and lower feedstock costs at the Yeosu, South Korea





complex. Project completion is expected in 2010. Modifications
    were completed in 2009 that enable the company’s
    50 percent-owned Singapore Refining Company’s refinery
    to meet regional specifications for clean diesel fuels.



At the Pascagoula Refinery, construction progressed on a
    continuous catalytic reformer that is expected to improve
    refinery reliability. Planning continued for a premium base-oil
    facility at the company’s Pascagoula Refinery. The facility
    is being designed to produce approximately 25,000 barrels
    per day of premium base oil for use in manufacturing
    high-performance lubricants, such as motor oils for consumer and
    commercial applications. At the refinery in El Segundo,
    California, design, engineering and construction work advanced
    during 2009 on projects that will reduce feedstock costs and
    improve yields.



At the beginning of 2009, Chevron held a 5 percent interest
    in Reliance Petroleum Limited, a company formed by Reliance
    Industries Limited to construct a new refinery in Jamnagar,
    India. During the year, the company sold its 5 percent
    interest to Reliance Industries Limited.



Chevron processes imported and domestic crude oil in its
    U.S. refining operations. Imported crude oil accounted for
    about 85 percent and 88 percent of Chevron’s
    U.S. refinery inputs in 2009 and 2008, respectively.

Gas-to-Liquids



In Nigeria, Chevron and the Nigerian National Petroleum
    Corporation are developing a33,000 barrel-per-daygas-to-liquidsfacility at Escravos designed to process 325 million cubic
    feet per day of natural gas supplied from the Phase 3A expansion
    of the Escravos Gas Plant (EGP). At the end of 2009,
    construction was under way with twogas-to-liquidsreactors and the process modules delivered to the site. Chevron
    has a 75 percent interest in the plant, which is expected
    to be operational by 2012. The estimated cost of the plant is
    $5.9 billion. Refer also to page 14 for a discussion
    on the EGP Phase 3A expansion.

In the United States, the company markets under the Chevron and
    Texaco brands. At year-end 2009, the company supplied directly
    or through retailers and marketers approximately 9,600 Chevron-
    and Texaco-branded motor vehicle service stations, primarily in
    the mid-Atlantic, southern and western states. Approximately 500
    of these outlets are company-owned or -leased stations. The
    company plans to discontinue, by mid-2010, sales of Chevron- and
    Texaco-branded motor fuels in the mid-Atlantic and other eastern
    states, where the company sold to retail customers through
    approximately 1,100 stations and to commercial and industrial
    customers through supply arrangements. Sales in these markets
    represent approximately 8 percent of the company’s
    total U.S. retail fuels sales volumes. Additionally, in
    January 2010, the company sold the rights to the Gulf trademark
    in the United States and its territories that it had previously
    licensed for use in the U.S. Northeast and Puerto Rico.



Outside the United States, Chevron supplied directly or through
    retailers and marketers approximately 12,400 branded service
    stations, including affiliates. In British Columbia, Canada, the
    company markets under the Chevron brand. The company markets in
    the United Kingdom, Ireland, Latin America and the Caribbean
    using the Texaco brand. In the Asia-Pacific region, southern
    Africa, Egypt and Pakistan, the company uses the Caltex brand.



The company also operates through affiliates under various brand
    names. In South Korea, the company operates through its
    50 percent-owned affiliate, GS Caltex, and in Australia
    through its 50 percent-owned affiliate, Caltex Australia
    Limited.



In 2009, the company completed the sale of businesses in Brazil,
    Haiti, Nigeria, Benin, Cameroon, Republic of the Congo,
    Côte d’Ivoire, Togo, Kenya, Uganda, India, Italy, Peru
    and Chile. The company retained its lubricants business in
    Brazil. In addition, the company sold its interest in about 465
    individual service-station sites in various other countries,
    including the United States. The majority of these sites
    continue to market company-branded gasoline through new supply
    agreements.



The company also manages other marketing businesses globally.
    Chevron markets aviation fuel at more than 875 airports. The
    company also markets an extensive line of lubricant and coolant
    products under brand names that include Havoline, Delo, Ursa,
    Meropa and Taro.

    international crude-oil and natural-gas production function.3Includes the company’s share of chemical pipelines managed
    by the 50 percent-owned Chevron Phillips Chemical Company
    LLC.





During 2009, work progressed on a project that is designed to
    expand capacity by about 2 billion cubic feet at the
    Keystone natural-gas storage facility near Midland, Texas, which
    would bring the total capacity of the facility to nearly
    7 billion cubic feet. The project completion is anticipated
    in the second quarter 2010.





Work commenced in late 2009 to bring the Cal-Ky Pipeline, which
    was decommissioned in 2002, back into crude-oil service as a
    supply line for the Pascagoula Refinery. This crude-oil pipeline
    is also expected to provide additional outlets for the
    company’s equity production. The pipeline is expected to
    return to service in 2011. The company is also leading the
    evaluation and negotiations associated with a 136 mile,24-inchpipeline from the proposed Jack and St. Malo production facility
    to Green Canyon 19 in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. In December
    2009, the company sold its interest in the western portion of
    the Texaco Expanded NGL Distribution System and its
    64 percent ownership interest in Southcap Pipeline Company,
    which included Chevron’s 13.4 percent ownership
    interest in the Capline Pipeline.



Chevron has a 15 percent interest in the Caspian Pipeline
    Consortium (CPC) affiliate. CPC operates a crude-oil export
    pipeline from the Tengiz Field in Kazakhstan to the Russian
    Black Sea port of Novorossiysk. During 2009, CPC transported an
    average of approximately 743,000 barrels of crude oil per
    day, including 597,000 barrels per day from Kazakhstan and
    146,000 barrels per day from Russia. In December 2009,
    partners approved the Expansion Project Implementation Plan,
    which is expected to increase the pipeline capacity to
    1.4 million barrels per day. A final investment decision is
    expected in late 2010.



The company has an 8.9 percent interest in the
    Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan (BTC) affiliate that owns and operates a
    pipeline that primarily transports crude oil produced by
    Azerbaijan International Operating Company (AIOC) (owned
    10.3 percent by Chevron) from Baku, Azerbaijan, through
    Georgia to deepwater port facilities in Ceyhan, Turkey. The BTC
    pipeline has a crude-oil capacity of 1.2 million barrels
    per day and transports the majority of the AIOC production.
    Another production export route for crude oil is the Western
    Route Export Pipeline, wholly owned by AIOC, with capacity to
    transport 145,000 barrels per day from Baku, Azerbaijan, to
    the marine terminal at Supsa, Georgia.



Chevron is the largest shareholder, with a 37 percent
    interest, in the West African Gas Pipeline Company Limited
    affiliate, which constructed, owns and operates the421-mile(678-km)West African Gas Pipeline. The pipeline is designed to supply
    Nigerian natural gas to customers in Benin, Ghana and Togo for
    industrial applications and power generation. Compression
    facilities are expected to be installed in the second quarter
    2010 that are designed to increase capacity to 170 million
    cubic feet per day.



Tankers:All tankers in Chevron’s controlled
    seagoing fleet were utilized during 2009. At any given time
    during 2009, the company had 42 deep-sea vessels chartered on a
    voyage basis, or for a period of less than one year.
    Additionally, the following table summarizes the capacity of the
    company’s controlled fleet.

    and those used exclusively for storage.2Tankers chartered for more than one year.



Federal law requires that cargo transported between
    U.S. ports be carried in ships built and registered in the
    United States, owned and operated by U.S. entities, and
    manned by U.S. crews. The company’sU.S.-flaggedfleet is engaged primarily in transporting refined products
    between the Gulf Coast and the East Coast and from California
    refineries to terminals on the West Coast and in Alaska and
    Hawaii. As part of its fleet modernization program, the company
    has twoU.S.-flaggedtankers scheduled for delivery in 2010 and plans to retire threeU.S.-flaggedproduct tankers between 2010 and 2011. The new tankers are
    expected to bring improved efficiencies to Chevron’sU.S.-flaggedfleet.



The foreign-flagged vessels are engaged primarily in
    transporting crude oil from the Middle East, Asia, the Black
    Sea, Mexico and West Africa to ports in the United States,
    Europe, Australia and Asia. The company’s foreign-flagged
    vessels also transport refined products to and from various
    locations worldwide.





In addition to the vessels described above, the company owns a
    one-sixth interest in each of seven liquefied-natural-gas (LNG)
    tankers transporting cargoes for the North West Shelf (NWS)
    Venture in Australia. The NWS project also has two LNG tankers
    under long-term time charter.



The Federal Oil Pollution Act of 1990 requires the phase-out by
    year-end 2010 of all single-hull tankers trading to
    U.S. ports or transferring cargo in waters within the
    U.S. Exclusive Economic Zone. As of the end of 2009, the
    company’s owned and chartered fleet was completely
    double-hulled. The company is a member of many
    oil-spill-response cooperatives in areas in which it operates
    around the world.

Chemicals



Chevron Phillips Chemical Company LLC (CPChem) is equally owned
    with ConocoPhillips Corporation. At the end of 2009, CPChem
    owned or had joint-venture interests in 34 manufacturing
    facilities and five research and technical centers in Belgium,
    Brazil, China, Colombia, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, South
    Korea and the United States.

    performance and extend engine life. During 2009, production
    began at the detergent expansion facility in Palau Sakra,
    Singapore. This additional capacity enhances the company’s
    ability to produce detergent components for applications in
    marine and automotive engines.

Other
    Businesses

Mining



Chevron’sU.S.-basedmining company produces and markets coal and molybdenum. Sales
    occur in both U.S. and international markets.



The company owns and is the operator of a surface coal mine in
    Kemmerer, Wyoming, an underground coal mine, North River,
    in Alabama, and a surface coal mine in McKinley, New Mexico. The
    company continues to actively market for sale its coal reserves
    at the North River Mine and elsewhere in Alabama. The decision
    was made in late 2009 to suspend production at the McKinley
    Mine, and conduct reclamation activities in 2010. The company
    also owns a 50 percent interest in Youngs Creek Mining
    Company LLC, which was formed to develop a coal mine in northern
    Wyoming. Coal sales from wholly owned mines in 2009 were
    10 million tons, down about 1 million tons from 2008.



At year-end 2009, Chevron controlled approximately
    193 million tons of proven and probable coal reserves in
    the United States, including reserves of low-sulfur coal.
    The company is contractually committed to deliver between
    7 million and 9 million tons of coal per year through
    the end of 2012 and believes it will satisfy these contracts
    from existing coal reserves.





In addition to the coal operations, Chevron owns and operates
    the Questa molybdenum mine in New Mexico. At year-end 2009,
    Chevron controlled approximately 53 million pounds of
    proven molybdenum reserves at Questa. Underground development
    and production plans at Questa were scaled back in 2009 in
    response to weakening prices for molybdenum.

Power
    Generation



Chevron’s power generation business has interests in 13
    power assets with a total operating capacity of more than 3,100
    megawatts, primarily through joint ventures in the United States
    and Asia. Twelve of these are efficient combined-cycle and
    gas-fired cogeneration facilities that utilize waste heat
    recovery to produce electricity and support industrial thermal
    hosts. The thirteenth facility is a wind farm, located in
    Casper, Wyoming, that began operating in late 2009. The
    100 percent-owned and operated Casper Wind Farm is a
    small-scale wind power facility designed to optimize the
    efficient use of a decommissioned refinery site for delivery of
    clean, renewable energy to the local utility provider.



The company has major geothermal operations in Indonesia and the
    Philippines and is investigating several advanced solar
    technologies for use in oil-field operations as part of its
    renewable-energy strategy. For additional information on the
    company’s geothermal operations and renewable energy
    projects, refer to page 18 and “Research and
    Technology” below.

Chevron
    Energy Solutions



Chevron Energy Solutions (CES) is a wholly owned subsidiary that
    designs and implements sustainable solutions for public
    institutions and businesses to increase energy efficiency and
    reliability, reduce energy costs, and utilize renewable and
    alternative-power technologies. Since 2000, CES has developed
    hundreds of projects that help governments, educational
    institutions and other customers reduce their energy costs and
    environmental impact. Major projects completed by CES in 2009
    included solar and energy-efficiency installations for the Los
    Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority and the
    San Jose Unified School District, which were the largest
    projects of their kind for a U.S. transit authority and
    school district.

Research
    and Technology



The company’s energy technology organization supports
    Chevron’s upstream and downstream businesses by providing
    technology, services and competency development in earth
    sciences; reservoir and production engineering; drilling and
    completions; facilities engineering; manufacturing; process
    technology; catalysis; technical computing; and health,
    environment and safety. The information technology organization
    integrates computing, telecommunications, data management,
    security and network technology to provide a standardized
    digital infrastructure and enable Chevron’s global
    operations and business processes.



Chevron Technology Ventures (CTV) manages investments and
    projects in emerging energy technologies and their integration
    into Chevron’s core businesses. As of the end of 2009, CTV
    continued to explore technologies such as next-generation
    biofuels and advanced solar.



Chevron’s research and development expenses were
    $603 million, $702 million and $510 million for
    the years 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively.



Some of the investments the company makes in the areas described
    above are in new or unproven technologies and business
    processes, and ultimate technical or commercial successes are
    not certain. The company’s overall investment in this area
    is not significant to the company’s consolidated financial
    position.

Environmental
    Protection



Virtually all aspects of the company’s businesses are
    subject to various U.S. federal, state and local
    environmental, health and safety laws and regulations and to
    similar laws and regulations in other countries. These
    regulatory requirements continue to change and increase in both
    number and complexity and to govern not only the manner in which
    the company conducts its operations, but also the products it
    sells. Most of the costs of complying with the many laws and
    regulations pertaining to its operations are, or are expected to
    become, embedded in the normal costs of conducting business.



In 2009, the company’s U.S. capitalized environmental
    expenditures were approximately $887 million, representing
    approximately 15 percent of the company’s total
    consolidated U.S. capital and exploratory expenditures.
    These environmental expenditures include capital outlays to
    retrofit existing facilities as well as those associated with
    new





facilities. The expenditures relate mostly to air- and
    water-quality projects and activities at the company’s
    refineries, oil and gas producing facilities, and marketing
    facilities. For 2010, the company estimates U.S. capital
    expenditures for environmental control facilities will be
    approximately $831 million. The future annual capital costs
    are uncertain and will be governed by several factors, including
    future changes to regulatory requirements.



Chevron expects an increase in environment-related regulations,
    including those that are intended to address concerns about
    greenhouse gas emissions and global climate change, in the
    countries where it has operations. For instance, under
    California’s Global Warming Solutions Act enacted in 2006,
    the California Air Resources Board (CARB), charged with
    implementing the law, has adopted a new low-carbon fuel standard
    intended to reduce the carbon intensity of transportation fuels,
    which is expected to apply beginning in 2011. Additionally, CARB
    is expected to propose regulations to implement the “cap
    and trade” emissions regulation provisions of the law, for
    adoption in the second half 2010. The effect of any such
    regulation on the company’s business is uncertain.



Refer to Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
    Condition and Results of Operations on pages FS-16 through FS-17
    for additional information on environmental matters and their
    impact on Chevron and on the company’s 2009 environmental
    expenditures, remediation provisions and year-end environmental
    reserves. Refer also to Item 1A. Risk Factors on pages 30
    through 32 for a discussion of greenhouse gas regulation and
    climate change.
