General Development of Business







Summary Description of Chevron

Chevron Corporation,*a Delaware corporation, manages its investments in subsidiaries and affiliates and provides administrative, financial, management and technology support to U.S. and international subsidiaries that engage in fully integrated petroleum operations, chemicals operations, mining operations, and power and energy services. Upstream operations consist primarily of exploring for, developing and producing crude oil and natural gas; processing, liquefaction, transportation and regasification associated with liquefied natural gas; transporting crude oil by major international oil export pipelines; transporting, storage and marketing of natural gas; and a gas-to-liquids project. Downstream operations consist primarily of refining crude oil into petroleum products; marketing of crude oil and refined products; transporting crude oil and refined products by pipeline, marine vessel, motor equipment and rail car; and manufacturing and marketing of commodity petrochemicals, plastics for industrial uses and fuel and lubricant additives.

A list of the company’s major subsidiaries is presented on page E-4. As of December 31,2013, Chevron had approximately 64,600 employees (including about 3,200 service station employees). Approximately 32,000 employees (including about 3,000 service station employees), or 50 percent, were employed in U.S. operations.





Overview of Petroleum Industry



Petroleum industry operations and profitability are influenced by many factors. Prices for crude oil, natural gas, petroleum products and petrochemicals are generally determined by supply and demand. The members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) are typically the world’s swing producers of crude oil and their production levels are a major factor in determining worldwide supply. Demand for crude oil and its products and for natural gas is largely driven by the conditions of local, national and global economies, although weather patterns and taxation relative to



other energy sources also play a significant part. Laws and governmental policies, particularly in the areas of taxation, energy and the environment affect where and how companies conduct their operations and formulate their products and, in some cases, limit their profits directly.



Strong competition exists in all sectors of the petroleum and petrochemical industries in supplying the energy, fuel and chemical needs of industry and individual consumers. Chevron competes with fully integrated, major global petroleum companies, as well as independent and national petroleum companies, for the acquisition of crude oil and natural gas leases and other properties and for the equipment and labor required to develop and operate those properties. In its downstream business, Chevron competes with fully integrated, major petroleum companies and other independent refining, marketing, transportation and chemicals entities and national petroleum companies in the sale or acquisition of various goods or services in many national and international markets.





Operating Environment



Refer to pages FS-2 through FS-8 of this Form 10-K in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for a discussion of the company’s current business environment and outlook.



Chevron’s Strategic Direction



Chevron’s primary objective is to create shareholder value and achieve sustained financial returns from its operations that will enable it to outperform its competitors. In the upstream, the company’s strategies are to grow profitably in core areas and build new legacy positions. In the downstream, the strategies are to deliver competitive returns and grow earnings across the value chain. The company also continues to apply commercial excellence to enable the success of the upstream and downstream strategies, to utilize technology across all its businesses to differentiate performance, and to invest in profitable renewable energy and energy efficiency solutions.





___________________________________





*Incorporated in Delaware in 1926 as Standard Oil Company of California, the company adopted the name Chevron Corporation in 1984 and ChevronTexaco Corporation in 2001. In 2005, ChevronTexaco Corporation changed its name to Chevron Corporation. As used in this report, the term “Chevron” and such terms as “the company,” “the corporation,” “our,” “we” and “us” may refer to Chevron Corporation, one or more of its consolidated subsidiaries, or all of them taken as a whole, but unless stated otherwise they do not include “affiliates” of Chevron — i.e., those companies accounted for by the equity method (generally owned 50 percent or less) or investments accounted for by the cost method. All of these terms are used for convenience only and are not intended as a precise description of any of the separate companies, each of which manages its own affairs.














Description of Business and Properties

The upstream and downstream activities of the company and its equity affiliates are widely dispersed geographically, with operations and projects* in North America, South America, Europe, Africa, Asia and Australia. Tabulations of segment sales and other operating revenues, earnings and income taxes for the three years ending December 31,2013, and assets as of the end of2013and2012— for the United States and the company’s international geographic areas — are in Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements beginning on page FS-35. Similar comparative data for the company’s investments in and income from equity affiliates and property, plant and equipment are in Notes 12 and 13 on pages FS-37 through FS-39.







Capital and Exploratory Expenditures



Total expenditures for2013were$41.9 billion, including$2.7 billionfor the company’s share of equity-affiliate expenditures. In2012and2011, expenditures were$34.2 billionand$29.1 billion, respectively, including the company’s share of affiliates’ expenditures of$2.1 billionin2012and$1.7 billionin2011.



Of the$41.9 billionin expenditures for2013,90 percent, or$37.9 billion, was related to upstream activities. Approximately89 percentwas expended for upstream operations in both2012and2011. International upstream accounted for about78 percentof the worldwide upstream investment in2013, about72 percentin2012and about68 percentin2011. These amounts exclude the acquisition of Atlas Energy, Inc. in 2011.



In2014, the company estimates capital and exploratory expenditures will be $39.8 billion, including $4.8 billion of spending by affiliates. Approximately 90 percent of the total, or $35.8 billion, is budgeted for exploration and production activities, with $27.9 billion, or about 78 percent, of this amount for projects outside the United States.



Refer also to a discussion of the company’s capital and exploratory expenditures on page FS-12.









Upstream



The table on the following page summarizes the net production of liquids and natural gas for2013and2012by the company and its affiliates. Worldwide oil-equivalent production of2.597 millionbarrels per day in 2013 was essentially unchanged from2012. The benefits of lower maintenance-related downtime and higher reliability at the Tengizchevroil facilities in Kazakhstan, and ramp-ups at the Usan Project in Nigeria, in the Marcellus Shale in western Pennsylvania and in the Delaware Basin in New Mexico were offset by normal field declines. Refer to the “Results of Operations” section beginning on pageFS-6for a detailed discussion of the factors explaining the2011through2013changes in production for crude oil and natural gas liquids, and natural gas.



The company estimates its average worldwide oil-equivalent production in2014will be approximately2.610 millionbarrels per day based on an average Brent price of$109per barrel in2013. This estimate is subject to many factors and uncertainties, including quotas that may be imposed by OPEC, price effects on entitlement volumes, changes in fiscal terms or restrictions on the scope of company operations, delays in project start-ups and ramp-ups, fluctuations in demand for natural gas in various markets, weather conditions that may shut in production, civil unrest, changing geopolitics, delays in completion of maintenance turnarounds, greater-than-expected declines in production from mature fields, or other disruptions to operations. The longer-term outlook for production levels is also affected by the size and number of economic investment opportunities and, for new, large-scale projects, the time lag between initial exploration and the beginning of production. Refer to the “Review of Ongoing Exploration and Production Activities in Key Areas,” beginning on page 9, for a discussion of the company’s major crude oil and natural gas development projects.

Delivery Commitments

The company sells crude oil and natural gas from its producing operations under a variety of contractual obligations. Most contracts generally commit the company to sell quantities based on production from specified properties, but some natural gas sales contracts specify delivery of fixed and determinable quantities, as discussed below.

In the United States, the company is contractually committed to deliver to third parties 285 billion cubic feet of natural gas through2016. The company believes it can satisfy these contracts through a combination of equity production from the company’s proved developed U.S. reserves and third-party purchases. These commitments include a variety of pricing terms, including both indexed and fixed-price contracts.



Outside the United States, the company is contractually committed to deliver a total of 871 billion cubic feet of natural gas to third parties from2014through2016from operations in Australia, Colombia, Denmark, the Netherlands and the Philippines. These sales contracts contain variable pricing formulas that are generally referenced to the prevailing market price for crude oil, natural gas or other petroleum products at the time of delivery. The company believes it can satisfy these contracts from quantities available from production of the company’s proved developed reserves in these countries.

Review of Ongoing Exploration and Production Activities in Key Areas



Chevron’s2013key upstream activities, some of which are also discussed in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, beginning on page FS-6, are presented below. The comments include references to “total production” and “net production,” which are defined under “Production” in Exhibit 99.1 on page E-10.

The discussion that follows references the status of proved reserves recognition for significant long-lead-time projects not on production and for projects recently placed on production. Reserves are not discussed for exploration activities or recent discoveries that have not advanced to a project stage, or for mature areas of production that do not have individual projects requiring significant levels of capital or exploratory investment. Amounts indicated for project costs represent total project costs, not the company’s share of costs for projects that are less than wholly owned.





Chevron has exploration and production activities in most of the world’s major hydrocarbon basins. The map above indicates Chevron’s primary areas for exploration and production.







United States



Upstream activities in the United States are concentrated in California, the Gulf of Mexico, Colorado, Louisiana, Michigan, New Mexico, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Texas, West Virginia and Wyoming. Average net oil-equivalent production in the United States during 2013 was 657,000 barrels per day.

In California, the company has significant production in the San Joaquin Valley. In 2013, net daily production averaged 162,000 barrels of crude oil, 69 million cubic feet of natural gas and 4,000 barrels of natural gas liquids (NGLs). Approximately 86 percent of the crude oil production is considered heavy oil (typically with API gravity lower than 22 degrees).









During 2013, net daily production for the company’s combined interests in the Gulf of Mexico averaged 143,000 barrels of crude oil, 347 million cubic feet of natural gas and 15,000 barrels of NGLs.

Chevron was engaged in various exploration and development activities in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico during 2013. The Jack and St. Malo fields are being jointly developed with a host floating production unit (FPU) located between the two fields. Chevron has a 50 percent interest in the Jack Field and a 51 percent interest in the St. Malo Field. Both fields are company-operated. Chevron's interest in the production host facility was reduced to 40.6 percent in 2013, after the owners of a third-party oil field acquired an interest in the host. The facility has a design capacity of 170,000 barrels of crude oil  and 42 million cubic feet of natural gas per day to accommodate production from the Jack/St. Malo development and third-party tiebacks. Development drilling activities continued during the year, and the FPU was moored at the offshore location in fourth quarter 2013. At the end of 2013, project activities were 74 percent complete and first oil is expected in late 2014. Total project costs for the initial phase of development are estimated at $7.5 billion. Proved reserves have been recognized for this project.

In 2013, work continued on the evaluation of additional development opportunities for the Jack and St. Malo fields. Stage 2, the first phase of future development work, is expected to include four additional development wells, two each at the Jack and the St. Malo fields. Front-end engineering and design (FEED) activities began in mid-2013, and a final investment decision is expected in 2015. At the end of 2013, proved reserves had not been recognized for the Jack/St. Malo Stage 2 Project.

Production from the Jack/St. Malo development is expected to ramp up to a total daily rate of 94,000 barrels of crude oil and 21 million cubic feet of natural gas. The Jack and St. Malo fields have an estimated production life of 30 years.
















Fabrication continued in 2013 for the 60 percent-owned and operated Big Foot Project. The development plan includes a 15-slot drilling and production platform with water injection facilities and a design capacity of 75,000 barrels of crude oil and 25 million cubic feet of natural gas per day. At the end of 2013, project activities were 84 percent complete, and the platform is expected to be towed to the location in third quarter 2014. Total project costs are estimated at $5.1 billion, and first production is anticipated in 2015. The field has an estimated production life of 20 years. Proved reserves have been recognized for this project.

Tahiti 2 is the second development phase for the 58 percent-owned and operated Tahiti Field, and is designed to increase recovery from the main producing interval by adding

two production wells, three water injection wells and water injection facilities. Start-up of the first production well occurred in fourth quarter 2013. Additional infill drilling is scheduled for the Tahiti Field from 2014 through 2016. The next development phase, the Tahiti Vertical Expansion Project, is being planned, with FEED expected in 2015. At the end of 2013, proved reserves had not been recognized for the infill drilling or the Tahiti Vertical Expansion Project. The Tahiti Field has an estimated production life of 30 years.

The company has a 42.9 percent nonoperated working interest in the Tubular Bells Field. Development drilling continued during 2013, and plans include three producing and two injection wells, with a subsea tieback to a third-party production facility. First oil is planned for third quarter 2014, with total production expected to reach 44,000 barrels of oil-equivalent per day. The field has an estimated production life of 25 years. Proved reserves have been recognized for this project.

The company has a 15.6 percent nonoperated working interest in the Mad Dog Field. The next development phase, the Mad Dog II Project, is planned to develop the southern portion of the Mad Dog Field. The project was recycled in 2013 and is expected to reenter FEED in late 2014. At the end of 2013, proved reserves had not been recognized for this project.

Chevron holds a 20 percent nonoperated working interest in the Stampede Project, which includes the joint development of the Knotty Head and Pony fields. The development plans include a tension leg platform with a planned design capacity of 80,000 barrels of crude oil and 40 million cubic feet of natural gas per day. The project entered FEED in second quarter 2013, and a final investment decision is expected in fourth quarter 2014. At the end of 2013, proved reserves had not been recognized for this project.

Pre-FEED activities continue at the 55 percent-owned and operated Buckskin Project. The project is expected to enter FEED in 2015. The Moccasin discovery, located 12 miles from Buckskin, is a potential tieback opportunity into Buckskin.

Deepwater exploration activities in 2013 included participation in six exploratory wells — three appraisal and three wildcat. Drilling of the first appraisal well at the 43.8 percent-owned and operated Moccasin discovery was



completed in third quarter 2013. Drilling of an appraisal well at the Buckskin discovery is expected to be completed in second quarter 2014. Drilling at the 40 percent-owned and operated Coronado prospect resulted in a crude oil discovery in the Lower Tertiary Wilcox formation in first quarter 2013. Drilling commenced on the first Coronado appraisal well in December 2013. The company also completed drilling a wildcat well at the 30 percent-owned and operated Rio Grande prospect in December 2013 and at the 67.5 percent-owned and operated Oceanographer prospect in January 2014.

Chevron added eight leases to its deepwater portfolio as a result of awards from the central Gulf of Mexico lease sale held in first quarter 2013. In addition, Chevron acquired three deepwater leases from the western Gulf of Mexico lease sale held in third quarter 2013.











Company activities in the midcontinental United States include operated and nonoperated interests in properties primarily in Colorado, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Texas and Wyoming. During 2013, the company’s net daily production in these areas averaged 96,000 barrels of crude oil, 610 million cubic feet of natural gas and 28,000 barrels of NGLs.

In West Texas, the company continues to pursue development of shale and tight resources in the Midland Basin’s Wolfcamp play and several plays in the Delaware Basin through use of advanced drilling and completion technologies. Additional production growth is expected from interests in these formations in future years. In June 2013, the company reached a joint development agreement covering 104,000 total acres in the Delaware Basin. In East Texas, the company continued development, at a managed pace, of multiple stacked reservoirs, including the Travis Peak, Cotton Valley, Bossier and Haynesville zones, during 2013.














The company holds leases in the Marcellus Shale and the Utica Shale, primarily located in southwestern Pennsylvania, eastern Ohio, and the West Virginia panhandle, and in the Antrim Shale and Collingwood/Utica Shale in Michigan. During 2013, the company's net daily production in these areas averaged 220 million cubic feet of natural gas. In 2013, development of the Marcellus Shale continued at a measured pace, focused on improving execution capability and reservoir understanding. Activities in the Utica Shale during 2013 included drilling seven exploratory wells. This initial activity was focused on acquiring data necessary for potential future development.





Other Americas

“Other Americas” is composed of Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Colombia, Greenland, Suriname, Trinidad and Tobago, and Venezuela. Net oil-equivalent production from these countries averaged 226,000 barrels per day during 2013.

Canada:Chevron has interests in oil sands projects and shale acreage in Alberta; shale acreage and a liquefied natural gas (LNG) project in British Columbia; exploration, development and production projects offshore in the Atlantic region; and exploration and discovered resource interests in the Beaufort Sea region of the Northwest Territories. Average net oil-equivalent production during 2013 was 71,000 barrels per day, composed of 27,000 barrels of crude oil, 9 million cubic feet of natural gas and 43,000 barrels of synthetic oil from oil sands.

The company holds a 20 percent nonoperated working interest in the Athabasca Oil Sands Project (AOSP). Oil sands are mined from both the Muskeg River and the Jackpine mines, and bitumen is extracted from the oil sands and upgraded into





synthetic oil. Construction work progressed during 2013 on the Quest Project, a carbon capture and sequestration project that is designed to capture and store more than one million tons of carbon dioxide produced annually by bitumen processing at the AOSP by 2015.

In February 2013, Chevron acquired a 50 percent-owned and operated interest in the Kitimat LNG and Pacific Trail Pipeline projects, and a 50 percent nonoperated working interest in 644,000 total acres in the Horn River and Liard shale gas basins in British Colombia. The Kitimat LNG Project is planned to include a two-train, 10.0 million-metric-ton-per-year LNG facility. The total production capacity for the project is expected to be 1.6 billion cubic feet of natural gas per day. Activities during 2013 included FEED, early site preparation and LNG marketing activities.

Chevron holds a 26.9 percent nonoperated working interest in the Hibernia Field and a 23.6 nonoperated working interest in the unitized Hibernia Southern Extension (HSE) areas offshore Atlantic Canada. The HSE development is expected to increase the economic life of the Hibernia Field. During 2013, two subsea water injection wells began drilling, and installation of subsea equipment was initiated. Full production start-up is expected in 2015. Proved reserves have been recognized for this project.

The company holds a 26.6 percent nonoperated working interest in the heavy oil Hebron Field, also offshore Atlantic Canada. The development plan includes a concrete, gravity-based platform with a design capacity of 150,000 barrels of crude oil per day. Procurement and construction activities progressed in 2013. Project costs are estimated at $14 billion. The project has an expected economic life of 30 years, and first oil is expected in 2017. Proved reserves have been recognized for this project.

In 2013, the company acquired 86,000 total additional acres in the Duvernay shale formation in Alberta.Drilling for these tight resources continued in 2013, with completion of a












multiwell program. Nine wells were completed and tied into production facilities by early 2014.

The company also holds a 40 percent nonoperated working interest in exploration rights for two blocks in the Flemish Pass Basin offshore Newfoundland. During 2013, the company relinquished its license in the Orphan Basin located offshore Newfoundland and Exploration License 1109 located offshore Labrador. The company also holds two exploration licenses in the Beaufort Sea region of the Northwest Territories and a 40 percent nonoperated working interest in the Amauligak discovery.
