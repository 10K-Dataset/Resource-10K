ITEM 1.BUSINESS



Raymond James Financial, Inc. (“RJF,” the “firm” or the “Company”) is a leading diversified financial services company providing private client group, capital markets, asset management, banking and other services to individuals, corporations and municipalities.  The firm, together with its subsidiaries, is engaged in various financial services activities, including providing investment management services for retail and institutional clients, the underwriting, distribution, trading and brokerage of equity and debt securities and the sale of mutual funds and other investment products.  The firm also provides corporate and retail banking services, and trust services.



Established in 1962 and public since 1983, RJF is listed on the New York Stock Exchange (the “NYSE”) under the symbol “RJF.”  As a bank holding company and financial holding company, RJF is subject to supervision, examination and regulation by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the “Fed”).



Among the keys to our historical and continued success, our emphasis on putting the client first is at the core of our corporate values.  We also believe in maintaining a conservative, long-term focus in our decision making.  We believe that this disciplined decision-making approach translates to a strong, stable financial services firm for clients, advisors, associates and shareholders.





REPORTABLE SEGMENTS



We currently operate through five segments.  Our business segments are Private Client Group (“PCG”), Capital Markets, Asset Management and Raymond James Bank, N.A. (“RJ Bank”).  Our Other segment captures private equity activities as well as certain corporate overhead costs of RJF that are not allocated to our business segments.



The following graph depicts the relative net revenue contribution of each of our business segments for the fiscalyear ended September 30, 2018.





*The preceding chart does not include intersegment eliminations or the Other segment.







PRIVATE CLIENT GROUP



We provide financial planning and securities transaction services through branch office systems.  Financial advisors have multiple affiliation options, which we refer to as AdvisorChoice.  Our two primary affiliation options for financial advisors are the employee option and the independent contractor option.



We recruit experienced financial advisors from a wide variety of competitors.  As a part of their agreement to join us, we may make loans to financial advisors and to certain other key revenue producers primarily for recruiting, transitional cost assistance and retention purposes.



Total assets under administration in the PCG segment as ofSeptember 30, 2018were to$755.7 billion.  We had7,813financial advisors affiliated with us as ofSeptember 30, 2018.






RAYMOND JAMES FINANCIAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES



Employee financial advisors



Employee financial advisors work in a traditional branch setting supported by local management and administrative staff.  They provide services predominately to individual clients.  These financial advisors are our employees, and their compensation primarily includes commission payments and participation in the firm’s benefit plans.



Independent contractor financial advisors



Our financial advisors who are independent contractors are responsible for all of their direct costs and, accordingly, receive a higher payout percentage than employee financial advisors.  Our independent contractor financial advisor option is designed to help our advisors build their businesses with as much or as little of our support as they determine they need.  With specific approval, they are permitted to conduct, on a limited basis, certain other approved business activities, such as offering insurance products, independent registered investment advisory services, and accounting and tax services.



Irrespective of the affiliation choice, our financial advisors offer a broad range of investments and services, including both third-party and proprietary products, and a variety of financial planning services.  Revenues from this segment are typically driven by total client assets under administration, and are generally either recurring fee-based or transactional in nature.  Recurring revenues include asset-based fees, trailing commissions from mutual funds and variable annuities/insurance products, mutual fund and annuity service fees, fees earned on our multi-bank sweep program and interest.  The proportion of our securities commissions and fees revenues originating from the employee versus the independent contractor affiliation models is relatively balanced.



Securities commissions and fees revenues by affiliation, as well as the portion of segment net revenues that was recurring versus transactional in nature, for the fiscal year endedSeptember 30, 2018, are presented in the following graphs.










RAYMOND JAMES FINANCIAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES



We provide the following services through this segment.



•We provide investment services for which we charge sales commissions or asset-based fees based on established schedules.



•We offer investment advisory services.  Fee revenues for such services are computed as either a percentage of the assets in the client account or a flat periodic fee charged to the client for investment advice.



•We provide insurance and annuity products.



•We offer a number of professionally managed mutual funds.



•We earn fees from banks to which we sweep client cash in our Raymond James Bank Deposit Program (“RJBDP”).  Such fees are generally based on client cash balances in the program and short-term interest rates relative to the interest paid to clients on balances in the RJBDP.



•We provide margin loans to clients that are collateralized by the securities purchased or by other securities owned by the client.  Interest is charged to clients on the amount borrowed based on current interest rates.



•We provide custodial, trading, research and other support and services (including access to clients’ account information and the services of the Asset Management segment) to the independent registered investment advisors who are affiliated with us.



•We conduct securities borrowing and lending activities with other broker-dealers, financial institutions and other counterparties.  The net revenues of this business consist of the interest spreads generated on these activities.



•We provide diversification strategies and alternative investment products to qualified clients of our affiliated financial advisors.  We provide strategies and products for portfolio investment allocation opportunities.





CAPITAL MARKETS



Our capital markets segment conducts institutional sales, securities trading, equity research, investment banking and the syndication and management of investments that qualify for tax credits (referred to as our “tax credit funds”).  Within our management structure, we distinguish between activities that support equity and fixed income products and services.  We primarily conduct these activities in the U.S., Canada, and Europe.



Investment banking revenues by revenue type as well as the portions of this segment’s revenues that were derived from equity securities and products, fixed income securities and products, and our tax credit funds activities for the fiscal year endedSeptember 30, 2018are presented in the following graphs.












RAYMOND JAMES FINANCIAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES



We provide the following services through this segment.



Equity capital markets



•We earn institutional sales commissions on the sale of equity products.  Sales volume is influenced by a combination of general market activity and the Capital Markets group’s ability to identify and promote attractive investment opportunities for our institutional clients.  Commission amounts on equity transactions are based on trade size and the amount of business conducted annually with each institution.



•We provide various investment banking services including public and private equity financing for corporate clients and merger & acquisition and advisory services.  Our investment banking activities include a comprehensive range of strategic and financial advisory services tailored to our clients’ business life cycles and backed by our strategic industry focus.



•Our global research department supports our institutional and retail sales efforts and publishes research on a wide variety of companies.  This research primarily focuses on U.S., European and Canadian companies in specific industries, including agricultural, consumer, energy, clean energy, energy services, financial services, healthcare, industrial, mining and natural resources, forest products, real estate, technology, and communication and transportation.  Proprietary industry studies and company-specific research reports are made available to both institutional and individual clients.



Fixed income



•We earn revenues from institutional clients who purchase and sell both taxable and tax-exempt fixed income products, primarily municipal, corporate, government agency and mortgage-backed bonds, and whole loans.  We carry inventories of taxable and tax-exempt securities to facilitate client transactions.



•Our fixed income investment banking services include public finance and debt underwriting activities where we serve as a financial advisor, placement agent or underwriter to various issuers, including state and local government agencies (and their political subdivisions), housing agencies, and non-profit entities including healthcare and higher education institutions.  When underwriting new issue securities, we may agree to purchase the issue through a negotiated sale or submission of a competitive bid.



•We enter into interest rate swaps and futures contracts either to facilitate client transactions or to actively manage risk exposures that arise from our client activity, including a portion of our trading inventory.  In addition, we conduct a “matched book” derivatives business where we may enter into interest rate derivative transactions with clients.  In this matched book business, for every derivative transaction we enter into with a client, we enter into an offsetting derivative transaction with a credit support provider that is a third-party financial institution.



•Through our fixed income public finance operations, we enter into forward commitments to purchase agency mortgage-backed securities (“MBS”).  Such MBS are issued on behalf of various state and local housing finance agencies (“HFA”) and consist of the mortgages originated through their lending programs.



Tax credit funds



•In our syndication of tax credit investments, one of our subsidiaries acts as the general partner or managing member in partnerships and limited liability companies that invest in real estate project entities which qualify for tax credits under Section 42 of the Internal Revenue Code.  We earn fees for the origination and sale of these investment products as well as for the oversight and management of the investments over the statutory tax credit compliance period.





ASSET MANAGEMENT



Our Asset Management segment provides investment advisory and related administrative services to our PCG clients through our asset management services division (“AMS”) and through Raymond James Trust, N.A. (“RJ Trust”).  The segment also provides investment advisory and asset management services to individual and institutional investors, including through third-party broker-dealers, through Carillon Tower Advisers and its affiliates (collectively, “Carillon Tower”), which also sponsors a family of mutual funds.



We earn investment advisory fees and related administrative fees based on assets under management in both AMS and Carillon Tower, where decisions are made by in-house or third-party portfolio managers or investment committees on how to invest client assets.



The Asset Management segment also earns administrative fees on certain asset-based programs offered to PCG clients which are not






RAYMOND JAMES FINANCIAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES



managed by our Asset Management segment, but for which the segment provides administrative support, including trade execution, record-keeping and periodic investor reporting.



Financial assets under management in managed programs and our financial assets under management in our managed programs by objective as ofSeptember 30, 2018are presented in the following graphs.







RJ BANK



RJ Bank provides corporate (commercial and industrial (“C&I”), commercial real estate (“CRE”) and CRE construction), securities-based (“SBL”), tax-exempt and residential loans.  RJ Bank is active in corporate loan syndications and participations.  RJ Bank also provides Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”)-insured deposit accounts, including to clients of our broker-dealer subsidiaries.  RJ Bank generates net interest revenue principally through the interest income earned on loans and an investment portfolio of securities, which is offset by the interest expense it pays on client deposits and on its borrowings.



As ofSeptember 30, 2018, corporate and tax-exempt loans represented approximately 65% of RJ Bank’s loan portfolio, of which 89% were U.S. and Canadian syndicated loans.  Residential mortgage loans are originated or purchased and held for investment or sold in the secondary market.  RJ Bank’s investment portfolio is comprised primarily of agency MBS and collateralized mortgage obligations (“CMOs”) and is classified as available-for-sale.  RJ Bank’s liabilities primarily consist of deposits that are cash balances swept from the investment accounts of PCG clients.



RJ Bank had total assets of$22.92 billionatSeptember 30, 2018, which are detailed in the following graph.












RAYMOND JAMES FINANCIAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES



OTHER



Our Other segment includes our private equity activities as well as certain corporate overhead costs of RJF, such as the interest cost on our public debt and the acquisition and integration costs associated with certain acquisitions (SeeNote 3of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of this Annual Report on Form 10-K (“Form 10-K”) for additional information on our acquisitions).



Our private equity activities include various direct and third-party private equity investments and various private equity funds which we sponsor.





EMPLOYEES AND INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS



Our employees and independent contractors (collectively “associates”) are vital to our success in the financial services industry.  As ofSeptember 30, 2018, we had approximately 13,900 employees and approximately 4,650 affiliated independent contractor financial advisors.





OPERATIONS AND INFORMATION PROCESSING



We have operations personnel at various locations who are responsible for processing securities transactions, custody of client securities, support of client accounts, the receipt, identification and delivery of funds and securities, and compliance with regulatory and legal requirements for most of our securities brokerage operations.



The information technology department develops and supports the integrated solutions that provide a differentiated platform for our businesses.  This platform is designed to allow our financial advisors to spend more time with their clients and enhance and grow their businesses.



In the area of information security, we have developed and implemented a framework of principles, policies and technology to protect both our own information as well as that of our clients.  We apply numerous safeguards to maintain the confidentiality, integrity and availability of both client and Company information.



Our business continuity program has been developed to provide reasonable assurance that we will continue to operate in the event of disruptions at our critical facilities.  Our business departments have developed operational plans for such disruptions, and we have a full time staff devoted to maintaining those plans.  Our business continuity plan continues to be enhanced and tested to allow for continuous operations in the event of weather-related or other interruptions at our corporate headquarters in Florida, one of our operations processing or data center sites (located in Florida, Colorado, Tennessee or Michigan) as well as our branch and office locations throughout the U.S., Canada and Europe.





COMPETITION



The financial services industry is intensely competitive.  We compete with many other financial services firms, including a number of larger securities firms, most of which are affiliated with major financial services companies, insurance companies, banking institutions and other organizations.  We also compete with companies that offer web-based financial services and discount brokerage services, usually with lower levels of service, to individual clients.  We compete principally on the basis of the quality of our associates, services, product selection, location and reputation in local markets.



Our ability to compete effectively is substantially dependent on our continuing ability to attract, retain and motivate qualified associates, including successful financial advisors, investment bankers, trading professionals, portfolio managers and other revenue producing or specialized personnel.





REGULATION



RJF is a bank holding company (“BHC”) under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (the “BHC Act”) that has made an election to be a financial holding company (“FHC”).  Under the BHC Act, the activities of BHCs and FHCs are limited generally to those activities closely related to banking and with respect to FHCs, activities financial in nature as outlined in the BHC Act and related regulations.  For RJF to remain a FHC, it and its depository institution subsidiaries must remain “well capitalized” and “well managed” in accordance with the standards of the Fed and, with respect to its depository institution subsidiaries, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (“OCC”).  As a FHC, RJF is subject to regulation, oversight, and consolidated supervision, including periodic examination, by the Fed.  Under existing regulation, the Fed has authority to examine and take action with respect to all of our subsidiaries.  RJ Bank is a national bank and insured depository regulated, supervised and examined by the OCC and the Consumer






RAYMOND JAMES FINANCIAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES



Financial Protection Bureau (“CFPB”).  Our trust company subsidiary also is regulated, supervised and examined by the OCC.  The Fed and the FDIC also regulate and may examine RJ Bank and RJ Trust.  Collectively, the rules and regulations of the Fed, the OCC, the FDIC and the CFPB cover all aspects of the banking business, including, for example, lending practices, the receipt of deposits, capital structure, transactions with affiliates, conduct and qualifications of personnel and, as discussed further below, capital requirements.  This regulatory, supervisory and oversight framework is subject to significant changes that can affect the operating costs and permissible businesses of RJF, RJ Bank and RJ Trust.  As a part of their supervisory functions, the Fed, the OCC, the FDIC, and the CFPB also have the power to bring enforcement actions for violations of law and, in the case of the Fed, the OCC and the FDIC, for unsafe or unsound practices.  Our broker-dealer subsidiaries, which are also registered investment advisors, are subject to regulation and oversight by various regulatory and self-regulatory authorities discussed under “Other regulations applicable to our operations” below.



The following discussion summarizes the principal elements of the regulatory and supervisory framework applicable to RJF.  The framework is intended to protect our clients, the integrity of the financial markets, our depositors and the Federal Deposit Insurance Fund and is not intended to protect our creditors or shareholders.  These rules and regulations limit our ability to engage in certain activities, as well as our ability to submit funds to RJF from our regulated subsidiaries, which include RJ Bank and our broker-dealer subsidiaries.  To the extent that the following information describes statutory and regulatory provisions, it is qualified in its entirety by reference to the particular statutory and regulatory provisions that are referenced.  A change in applicable statutes or regulations or in regulatory or supervisory policy may have a material effect on our business.



Rules and regulations resulting from the Dodd-Frank Act



Since 2010, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the “Dodd-Frank Act”) has imposed significant new regulatory and compliance requirements, although some provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act remain subject to further rulemaking proceedings and studies and will take effect over the next several years.



As a result of the Dodd-Frank Act and its implementing regulations, we continue to experience a period of notable change in financial regulation and supervision.  These changes could have a significant impact on how we conduct our business.  Many regulatory or supervisory policies remain in a state of flux and may be subject to amendment in the near future, particularly due to the President’s executive order issued in February 2017 to evaluate the current regulatory framework, particularly as it relates to the financial services industry.  As a result, we cannot specifically quantify the impact that such regulatory or supervisory requirements will have on our business and operations (see Item 1A “Risk Factors” within this report for further discussion of the potential future impact on our operations).  In the following sections, we highlight certain of the more significant changes brought about as a result of the Dodd-Frank Act and related measures.



FDIC assessment rates



Since RJ Bank provides deposits covered by FDIC insurance, generally up to $250,000 per account ownership type, RJ Bank is subject to the Federal Deposit Insurance Act.  For banks with greater than $10 billion in assets, the FDIC’s current assessment rate calculation relies on a scorecard designed to measure financial performance and ability to withstand stress, in addition to measuring the FDIC’s exposure should the bank fail.



CFPB oversight



The CFPB has supervisory and enforcement powers under several consumer protection laws, including the: (i) Equal Credit Opportunity Act; (ii) Truth in Lending Act; (iii) Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act; (iv) Fair Credit Reporting Act; (v) Fair Debt Collection Act; (vi) Consumer Financial Privacy provisions of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act and (vii) unfair, deceptive or abusive acts or practices under section 1031 of the Dodd-Frank Act.  Since the beginning of fiscal year 2014, the CFPB has had supervisory authority over RJ Bank for its compliance with the various federal consumer protection laws.  The CFPB also has authority to promulgate regulations, issue orders, draft policy statements, conduct examinations, and bring enforcement actions.  The creation of the CFPB has led to enhanced enforcement of consumer protection laws.  To the extent that, as a result of such heightened scrutiny and oversight, we become the subject of any enforcement activity, we may be required to pay fines, incur penalties, or engage in certain remediation efforts.



Stress tests



On May 24, 2018, the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act (the “EGRRCPA”) was signed into law, making certain limited amendments to the Dodd-Frank Act, as well as certain targeted modifications to other post-financial crisis regulations.  Among other things, the law raises the asset thresholds for Dodd-Frank Act company-run stress testing, liquidity coverage and living will requirements for bank holding companies to $250 billion, subject to the ability of the Fed to apply such requirements






RAYMOND JAMES FINANCIAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES



to institutions with assets of $100 billion or more to address financial stability risks or safety and soundness concerns.  On July 6, 2018, the Fed, the OCC and the FDIC issued a joint interagency statement regarding the impact of the EGRRCPA.  As a result of this statement and the EGRRCPA, RJF and RJ Bank are no longer subject to Dodd-Frank Act stress testing requirements.



The Volcker Rule



RJF is subject to the Volcker Rule, a provision of the Dodd-Frank Act, which generally prohibits, subject to exceptions, insured depository institutions, bank holding companies and their affiliates (together, “banking entities”) from engaging in proprietary trading and limits investments in and relationships with hedge funds and private equity funds (“covered funds”).  Banking entities must establish a Volcker Rule-specific compliance program.  We have adopted a program, which is designed to be effective in ensuring compliance with the Volcker Rule; however, in connection with their examinations, regulators will assess the sufficiency and adequacy of our program.



We maintain a number of private equity investments, some of which meet the definition of covered funds under the Volcker Rule.  The conformance period for compliance with the rule with respect to investments in covered funds was July 2017; however, banking entities were able to apply for an extension to provide up to an additional five years to conform investments in certain illiquid funds.  The majority of our covered fund investments meet the criteria to be considered an illiquid fund under the Volcker Rule and we received approval from the Fed to continue to hold such investments until July 2022.  The extension of the conformance deadline provides us with additional time to realize the value of these investments in due course and to execute appropriate strategies to comply with the Volcker Rule at such time.  However, our current focus is on the divestiture of our existing portfolio.



On June 5, 2018, the five federal regulatory agencies having oversight over the Volcker Rule announced publication of proposed amendments to the rule.  The notice of proposed rulemaking contains certain revisions to the Volcker Rule’s covered fund restrictions.  RJF is evaluating the proposal to determine the impact such proposal will have, if any, if it becomes effective.



Basel III and U.S. Capital Rules



Both RJF and RJ Bank are subject to capital requirements that have increased due to regulatory actions in recent years.  In July 2013, the OCC, the Fed and the FDIC released final U.S. rules implementing the Basel III capital framework developed by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and certain Dodd-Frank Act and other capital provisions and updated the prompt corrective action framework to reflect the new regulatory capital minimums (the “U.S. Basel III Rules”).  The U.S. Basel III Rules: (i) increase the quantity and quality of regulatory capital; (ii) establish a capital conservation buffer; and (iii) make changes to the calculation of risk-weighted assets.  The U.S. Basel III Rules became effective for RJF on January 1, 2015, subject to applicable phase-in periods.  The rules governing the capital conservation buffer became effective for both RJF and RJ Bank as of January 1, 2016, subject to applicable phase-in periods.  See

Note 21

of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10-K for information regarding RJF and RJ Bank regulatory capital levels and ratios, including information regarding the capital conservation buffer.  The increased capital requirements could restrict our abilities to grow during favorable market conditions and to return capital to shareholders, or require us to raise additional capital.  As a result, our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects could be adversely affected.  See Item 1A “Risk Factors” within this report for more information.



Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can trigger discretionary, and in certain cases, mandatory actions by regulators that could have a direct material effect on the financial results of RJF and RJ Bank.  Under capital adequacy guidelines, RJF and RJ Bank must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of assets, liabilities, and certain off-balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices.  The capital amounts and classification for RJF and RJ Bank are also subject to the qualitative judgments of U.S. regulators based on components of capital, risk-weightings of assets, off-balance sheet transactions, and other factors.  Quantitative measures established by federal banking regulations to ensure capital adequacy require that RJF and RJ Bank maintain minimum amounts and ratios of: (i) Common Equity Tier 1 (or “CET1”), Tier 1 and Total capital to risk-weighted assets; (ii) Tier 1 capital to average assets; and (iii) capital conservation buffers.  SeeNote 21of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10-K for further information.



Fiduciary duty standard



In April 2016, the U.S. Department of Labor (the “DOL”) issued a final regulation (the “DOL Rule”) expanding the definition of who is deemed an “investment advice fiduciary” under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (“ERISA”), as a result of giving investment advice to a “plan,” “plan participant” or “beneficiary,” as well as under the Internal Revenue Code for individual retirement arrangements (“IRAs”) and non-ERISA plans (collectively, “qualified plans”).  However, in June 2018, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit vacated the DOL Rule, and thus it is no longer in effect.








RAYMOND JAMES FINANCIAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES



Separately, pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) was charged with considering whether broker-dealers should be subject to a standard of care similar to the fiduciary standard applicable to registered investment advisors.  In April 2018, the SEC proposed Regulation Best Interest.  The proposed Regulation Best Interest would, among other things, require a broker-dealer to act in the best interest of a retail customer when making a recommendation of any securities transaction or investment strategy involving securities to such customer.  We anticipate the adoption of any new rule by the SEC will require us to review and possibly modify our compliance activities, which may lead to additional costs.  In addition, state laws that impose a fiduciary duty also may require monitoring, as well as require that we undertake additional compliance measures.



Holding company support



Under the Dodd-Frank Act, the Fed must require that bank holding companies, such as RJF, serve as a source of financial strength for any subsidiary depository institution. The term “source of financial strength” is defined as the ability of a company to provide financial assistance to its insured depository institution subsidiaries in the event of financial distress at such subsidiaries. Under this requirement, RJF in the future could be required to provide financial assistance to RJ Bank should it experience financial distress.



Incentive-based compensation arrangements



Pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, six federal agencies are charged with jointly prescribing regulations or guidelines related to the prohibition of incentive-based compensation arrangements that encourage inappropriate risks at certain financial institutions.  The agencies released a proposed rule in 2016 that, if implemented, would prohibit certain forms of incentive-based compensation arrangements for financial institutions with greater than $1 billion in total assets (the “Incentive-Based Compensation Proposal”).  No final rule has been issued to date.



Other regulations applicable to our operations



The SEC is the federal agency charged with administration of the federal securities laws in the U.S.  Our broker-dealer subsidiaries are subject to SEC regulations relating to their business operations, including sales and trading practices, public offerings, publication of research reports, use and safekeeping of client funds and securities, capital structure, record-keeping, privacy requirements, and the conduct of directors, officers and employees.  Financial services firms are also subject to regulation by state securities commissions in those states in which they conduct business.  RJ&A and Raymond James Financial Services, Inc. (“RJFS”) are currently registered as broker-dealers in all 50 states.



Broker-dealers are required to maintain the minimum net capital deemed necessary to meet their continuing commitments to customers and others, and are required to keep their assets in relatively liquid form.  These rules also limit the ability of broker-dealers to transfer capital to parent companies and other affiliates.  The SEC has adopted amendments to its financial stability rules, many of which became effective as of October 2013 and are applicable to our broker-dealer subsidiaries, including changes to the: (i) net capital rule; (ii) customer protection rule; (iii) record-keeping rules; and (iv) notification rules.



Financial services firms are subject to regulation by various foreign governments, securities exchanges, central banks and regulatory bodies, particularly in those countries where they have established offices. Outside of the U.S., we have additional offices primarily in Canada and Europe and are subject to regulations in those areas.  Much of the regulation of broker-dealers in the U.S. and Canada, however, has been delegated to self-regulatory organizations (“SROs”) (i.e., the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (“FINRA”), the Investment Industry Regulatory Organization of Canada (“IIROC”) and securities exchanges).  These SROs adopt and amend rules for regulating the industry, subject to the approval of government agencies.  These SROs also conduct periodic examinations of member broker-dealers.



The SEC, SROs and state securities regulators may conduct administrative proceedings that can result in censure, fine, suspension or expulsion of a broker-dealer, its officers or employees.  Such administrative proceedings, whether or not resulting in adverse findings, can require substantial expenditures and may adversely impact the reputation of a broker-dealer.



Our U.S. broker-dealer subsidiaries are subject to the Securities Investor Protection Act (“SIPA”) and are required by federal law to be members of the Securities Investors Protection Corporation (“SIPC”).  The SIPC was established under SIPA, and oversees the liquidation of broker-dealers during liquidation or financial distress.  The SIPC fund provides protection for cash and securities held in client accounts up to $500,000 per client, with a limitation of $250,000 on claims for cash balances.



Our investment advisory operations, including the mutual funds that we sponsor, are also subject to extensive regulation in the U.S.  Our U.S. asset managers are registered as investment advisers with the SEC under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 as amended (the “Investment Advisers Act”), and are also required to make notice filings in certain states. Virtually all aspects of our asset






RAYMOND JAMES FINANCIAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES



management business are subject to various federal and state laws and regulations.  These laws and regulations are primarily intended to benefit the asset management clients.



RJ Bank is also subject to the Community Reinvestment Act (the “CRA”).  The CRA is intended to encourage banks to help meet the credit needs of their communities, including low and moderate income neighborhoods, consistent with safe and sound bank operations.  Under the CRA, the Fed, the FDIC and the OCC are required to periodically examine and assign to each bank a public CRA rating.  Members of the public may submit comments on a bank’s performance under the CRA and such comments will form part of the bank’s performance evaluation.  The results of the evaluation, together with the bank’s CRA rating, are also taken into consideration when evaluating mergers, acquisitions, and applications to open a branch or facility.  RJ Bank could face additional requirements and limitations should it fail to adequately meet the criteria stipulated under the CRA.  In August 2018, the OCC requested comment on ways to modernize its regulations that implement the CRA, which could affect how the CRA is applied to RJ Bank, but no proposed regulations have been issued at this time.



U.S. federal law establishes minimum federal standards for financial privacy by, among other provisions, requiring financial institutions to adopt and disclose privacy policies with respect to consumer information and setting forth certain limitations on disclosure to third parties of consumer information. U.S. state law and regulations adopted under U.S. federal law impose obligations on RJF and its subsidiaries for protecting the security, confidentiality and integrity of client information, and require notice of data breaches to certain U.S. regulators, and in some cases, to clients.  The General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) imposes additional requirements for companies that collect or store personal data of European Union residents.  GDPR expands the scope of the EU data protection law to all foreign companies processing personal data of EU residents, imposes a strict data protection compliance regime, and includes new rights.  RJF has adopted and disseminated privacy policies, and communicates required information relating to financial privacy and data security, in accordance with applicable law.



Raymond James Limited (“RJ Ltd.”) is currently registered in all provinces and territories in Canada.  The financial services industry in Canada is subject to comprehensive regulation under both federal and provincial laws.  Securities commissions have been established in all provinces and territorial jurisdictions, which are charged with the administration of securities laws.  Investment dealers in Canada are also subject to regulation by SROs, including the Montreal Exchange and IIROC, which are responsible for the enforcement of, and conformity with, securities legislation for their members and have been granted the powers to prescribe their own rules of conduct and financial requirements of members.  RJ Ltd. is regulated by each of the securities commissions in the jurisdictions of registration, as well as by the SROs including IIROC.  IIROC requires that RJ Ltd. be a member of the Canadian Investors Protection Fund (the “CIPF”), whose primary role is investor protection.  The CIPF provides protection for securities and cash held in client accounts up to 1 million Canadian dollars (“CAD”) per client, with separate coverage of CAD 1 million for certain types of accounts.  SeeNote 21of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10-K for further information on SEC, FINRA and IIROC regulations pertaining to broker-dealer regulatory minimum net capital requirements.



In Europe, the Markets in Financial Instruments Regulation and a revision of the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (together, “MiFID II”), generally took effect on January 3, 2018, and introduced comprehensive, new trading and market infrastructure reforms in the European Union, including new trading venues, enhancements to pre- and post-trading transparency, and additional investor protection requirements, among others.  We have made changes to our European operations, including systems and controls, in order to be in compliance with MiFID II.



Central banks around the world, including the Fed, have commissioned working groups of market participants and official sector representatives with the goal of finding suitable replacements for the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) based on observable market transactions. It is expected that a transition away from the widespread use of LIBOR to alternative rates will occur over the course of the next few years. Although the full impact of a transition, including the potential or actual discontinuance of LIBOR publication, remains unclear, this change may have an adverse impact on the value of, return on and trading markets for a broad array of financial products, including any LIBOR-based securities, loans and derivatives that are included in our financial assets and liabilities.

customer identification at account opening; and rules to produce certain records upon request of a regulator or law enforcement and to promote cooperation among financial institutions, regulators, and law enforcement in identifying parties that may be involved in terrorism, money laundering and other crimes.  In May 2016, FinCEN issued a new rule that, since May 2018, has required certain financial institutions, including our U.S. bank and broker-dealer subsidiaries, to obtain certain beneficial ownership information from legal entity clients.  Failure to meet the requirements of the Bank Secrecy Act, the Patriot Act or FinCEN can lead to supervisory actions including fines.
