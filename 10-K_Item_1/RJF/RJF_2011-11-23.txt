ITEM 1.BUSINESS



Raymond James Financial, Inc. (“RJF”), the parent company of a business established in 1962 and a public company since 1983, is a financial services holding company headquartered in St. Petersburg, Florida whose subsidiaries are engaged in various financial services businesses predominantly in the United States of America (“U.S.”) and Canada. At September 30, 2011, its principal subsidiaries include Raymond James & Associates, Inc. (“RJ&A”), Raymond James Financial Services, Inc. (“RJFS”), Raymond James Financial Services Advisors, Inc.

RJF and its subsidiaries are hereinafter collectively referred to as “our,” “we” or “us.”



PRINCIPAL SUBSIDIARIES



Our principal subsidiary, RJ&A, is the largest full service brokerage and investment firm headquartered in the state of Florida and with over 220 locations throughout the U.S, is one of the largest retail brokerage firms in the country. RJ&A is a self-clearing broker-dealer engaged in most aspects of securities distribution, trading, investment banking and asset management.

RJ Bank purchases and originates corporate loans secured by corporate assets, commercial and industrial (“C&I”) loans, commercial and residential real estate loans, as well as consumer loans, all of which are funded primarily by cash balances swept from the investment accounts of our broker-dealer subsidiaries’ clients.



BUSINESS SEGMENTS



We have eight business segments: “Private Client Group” or “PCG”; “Capital Markets”; “Asset Management”; RJ Bank; “Emerging Markets”; “Securities Lending” (formerly named “Stock Loan/Borrow”); “Proprietary Capital” and certain corporate activities combined in the “Other” segment.  Our financial information for each of the fiscal years ended September 30, 2011, September 30, 2010, and September 30, 2009 is included in the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto.



PRIVATE CLIENT GROUP



We provide securities transaction and financial planning services to approximately two million client accounts through the branch office systems of RJ&A, RJFS, RJFSA, RJ Ltd. and Raymond James Investment Services Limited (“RJIS"), a joint venture in the United Kingdom. Our financial advisors offer a broad range of investments and services, including both third-party and proprietary products, and a variety of financial planning services. We charge sales commissions or asset-based fees for investment services we provide to our Private Client Group clients based on established schedules. Varying discounts may be given, generally based upon the client's level of business, the trade size, service level provided, and other relevant factors. In fiscal year 2011, the portion of revenues from this segment that we consider recurring include sources such as asset-based fees including mutual fund and annuity trailing commissions, and interest income and represented approximately 61% of the Private Client Group's total revenues.  Revenues of this segment are correlated with total client assets under administration.  As of September 30, 2011, total client assets under administration amounted to $256 billion.








The majority of our U.S. financial advisors are also licensed to sell insurance and annuity products through our general insurance agency, Planning Corporation of America (“PCA”), a wholly owned subsidiary of RJ&A. Through the financial advisors of our broker-dealer subsidiaries, PCA provides product and marketing support for a broad range of insurance products, principally fixed and variable annuities, life insurance, disability insurance and long-term care coverage.



Our financial advisors offer a number of professionally managed load mutual funds, as well as a selection of no-load funds. RJ&A and RJFS maintain dealer sales agreements with most major distributors of mutual fund shares sold through broker-dealers.

Net interest revenue in the Private Client Group is generated by customer balances, predominantly the earnings on margin loans and assets segregated pursuant to regulations, less interest paid on customer cash balances (“Client Interest Program”). Beginning in September 2009, we began a multi-bank sweep program which generates fee revenue in lieu of interest revenue. See Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” in this report for information regarding our net interest revenues.



Clients' transactions in securities are affected on either a cash or margin basis. RJ&A makes margin loans to clients collateralized by the securities purchased or by other securities owned by the client. Interest is charged to clients on the amount borrowed.  The interest rate charged to a client on a margin loan is based on current interest rates and on the size of the loan balance in the client's account.



Typically, broker-dealers utilize bank borrowings and equity capital as the primary sources of funds to finance clients' margin account borrowings. RJ&A's source of funds to finance clients' margin account balances has been cash balances in brokerage clients' accounts, which are funds awaiting investment. In addition, pursuant to written agreements with clients, broker-dealers are permitted by the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) and FINRA rules to lend client securities in margin accounts to other financial institutions. SEC regulations, however, restrict the use of clients' funds derived from pledging and lending clients' securities, as well as funds awaiting investment, to the financing of margin account balances; to the extent not so used, such funds are required to be deposited in a special segregated account for the benefit of clients. The regulations also require broker-dealers, within designated periods of time, to obtain possession or control of, and to segregate, clients' fully paid and excess margin securities.



No single client accounts for a material percentage of this segment's total business.



Raymond James & Associates



RJ&A is a full service broker-dealer that employs financial advisors throughout the U.S. RJ&A's financial advisors work in a traditional branch setting supported by local management and administrative staffs. The number of financial advisors per office ranges from one to 30.

Experienced financial advisors are hired from a wide variety of competitors.  As a part of their agreement to join us we may make loans to financial advisors and to certain key revenue producers, primarily for recruiting and/or retention purposes. In addition, individuals are trained each year to become financial advisors at the Robert A. James National Training Center in St. Petersburg, Florida.










Raymond James Financial Services



RJFS is a broker-dealer that supports independent contractor financial advisors in providing products and services to their Private Client Group clients throughout the U.S. The number of financial advisors in RJFS offices ranges from one to 45.  Independent contractors are responsible for all of their direct costs and, accordingly, are paid a larger percentage of commissions. They are permitted to conduct, on a limited basis, certain other approved businesses unrelated to their RJFS activities such as offering insurance products, independent registered investment advisory services and accounting and tax services, among others, with the approval of RJFS management.



The Financial Institutions Division (“FID”) is a subdivision of RJFS. Through FID, RJFS services financial institutions such as banks, thrifts and credit unions, and their clients.  RJFS also provides custodial, trading and other services (including access to clients' account information and the services of the Asset Management segment) to unaffiliated independent registered investment advisors through its Investment Advisor Division (“IAD”).

Raymond James &Associates – Operations and Information Technology



RJ&A's operations personnel are responsible for the execution of orders, processing of securities transactions, custody of client securities, support of client accounts, receipt, identification and delivery of funds and securities, and compliance with certain regulatory and legal requirements for most of our U.S. securities brokerage operations.



The information technology department develops and supports the integrated solutions that provide a differentiated platform for our business.  This platform is designed to allow our advisors to spend more time with their clients and enhance and grow their business.



Our business continuity program has been developed to provide reasonable assurance of business continuity in the event of disruptions at our critical facilities.  Business departments have developed operational plans for such disruptions, and we have a staff which devotes their full time to monitoring and facilitating those plans.  Our business continuity plan continues to be enhanced and tested to allow for continuous business processing in the event of weather-related or other interruptions of operations at the headquarters complex. We have also developed a business continuity plan for our PCG branches in the event these branches are impacted by severe weather. Each branch is assigned a “contingency branch” in another part of the country that allows the impacted branch the ability to communicate through the contingency branch.



In the area of information security, we have developed and implemented a framework of principles, policies and technology to protect the information assets of the firm and its clients.  Safeguards are applied to maintain the confidentiality, integrity and availability of information resources.



CAPITAL MARKETS



Capital Markets activities consist primarily of equity and fixed income products and services. No single client accounts for a material percentage of this segment's total business.



Institutional Sales



Institutional sales commissions account for a significant portion of this segment's revenue, which is fueled by a combination of general market activity and the Capital Markets group’s ability to identify and promote attractive investment opportunities.  Our institutional clients are serviced by institutional equity departments of RJ&A and RJ Ltd.; the RJ&A fixed income department; RJ&A’s European offices; Raymond James Financial International, Ltd, an institutional UK broker-dealer headquartered in London, England; and Raymond James European Securities, Inc., a joint venture that is headquartered in Paris, France in which we hold a controlling interest. We charge commissions on equity transactions based on trade size and the amount of business conducted annually with each institution.  Fixed income commissions are based on trade size and the characteristics of the specific security involved.

Over 100 domestic and overseas professionals located in offices in the U.S. and Europe comprise RJ&A's institutional equity sales and sales trading departments and maintain relationships with approximately 1,200 institutional clients.  Some European and U.S. offices also provide services to high net worth clients. RJ Ltd. has approximately 40 institutional equity sales and trading professionals servicing predominantly Canadian, U.S. and European institutional investors from offices in Canada and Europe.



From offices in various locations within the U.S., RJ&A distributes to institutional clients both taxable and tax-exempt fixed income products, primarily municipal, corporate, government agency and mortgage-backed bonds. RJ&A carries inventory positions of taxable and tax-exempt securities to facilitate institutional sales activities.










Trading



Trading equity securities involves the purchase and sale of securities from and to our clients or other dealers. Profits and losses are derived from the spreads between bid and asked prices, as well as market trends for the individual securities during the period we hold them.  RJ&A makes markets in over 900 common stocks.  Similar to the equity research department, this operation serves to support both our institutional and Private Client Group sales efforts.  The RJ Ltd. trading desks not only support client activity, but also take proprietary positions that are closely monitored within well defined limits. RJ Ltd. also provides specialist services in approximately 150 TSX listed common stocks.



RJ&A trades both taxable and tax-exempt fixed income securities. The taxable and tax-exempt RJ&A fixed income traders purchase and sell corporate, municipal, government, government agency, and mortgage-backed bonds, asset-backed securities, preferred stock and certificates of deposit from and to our clients or other dealers. RJ&A enters into future commitments such as forward contracts and “to be announced” securities (e.g., securities having a stated coupon and original term to maturity, although the issuer and/or the specific pool of mortgage loans is not known at the time of the transaction). Low levels of proprietary trading positions are also periodically taken by RJ&A for various purposes and are closely monitored within well defined limits. In addition, a subsidiary of RJF, RJ Capital Services, Inc., participates in the interest rate swaps market as a principal, either to economically hedge RJ&A fixed income inventory, for transactions with customers, or for its own account.



Equity Research



The domestic analysts in RJ&A's research department support our institutional and retail sales efforts and publish research on approximately 900 companies. This research primarily focuses on U.S. companies in specific industries including technology, telecommunications, consumer, financial services, transportation and industrial services, healthcare, real estate and energy. Proprietary industry studies and company-specific research reports are made available to both institutional and individual clients. RJ Ltd. has 15 analysts who publish research on approximately 250 primarily Canadian companies focused in the energy, energy services, mining, forest products, agricultural, technology, clean technology, consumer and industrial products, and real estate sectors. Additionally, we provide coverage of approximately 60 European and approximately 70 Latin American companies through joint ventures in which we hold interests.



Investment Banking



The nearly 125 professionals of RJ&A's investment banking group reside in various locations within the U.S. and are involved in a variety of activities including public and private equity financing for corporate clients, and merger and acquisition advisory services. RJ Ltd.'s investment banking group consists of approximately 30 professionals who reside in various locations within Canada and provide equity financing and financial advisory services to corporate clients. Our investment banking activities provide a comprehensive range of strategic and financial advisory services tailored to our clients’ business life cycles and backed by our strategic industry focus.



Fixed income investment banking includes debt underwriting and public finance activities. The over 70 professionals in the RJ&A public finance division operate out of various offices located throughout the U.S., and serve as a financial advisor, placement agent or underwriter to various issuers who include municipal agencies (including political subdivisions), housing developers and non-profit health care institutions.



RJ&A acts as a consultant, underwriter or selling group member for corporate bonds, mortgage-backed securities, agency bonds, preferred stock and unit investment trusts. When underwriting new issue securities, RJ&A agrees to purchase the issue through a negotiated sale or submits a competitive bid.



Syndicate



The syndicate department consists of professionals who coordinate the marketing, distribution, pricing and stabilization of lead and co-managed equity underwritings. In addition to lead and co-managed offerings, this department coordinates the firm's syndicate and selling group activities in transactions managed by other investment banking firms.










Raymond James Tax Credit Funds, Inc.



Raymond James Tax Credit Funds, Inc. (“RJTCF”) is the general partner or managing member in a number of limited partnerships and limited liability companies. These partnerships and limited liability companies invest in real estate project entities that qualify for tax credits under Section 42 of the Internal Revenue Code. RJTCF has been an active participant in the tax credit program since its inception in 1986 and currently focuses on tax credit funds for institutional investors that invest in a portfolio of tax credit-eligible multi-family apartments. The investors’ expected returns on their investments in these funds are primarily derived from tax credits and tax losses that investors can use to reduce their federal tax liability. During fiscal 2011, RJTCF invested approximately $615 million for large institutional investors in 80 real estate transactions for properties located throughout the U.S. Since inception, RJTCF has raised over $3.5 billion in equity and has sponsored over 70 tax credit funds, with investments in over 1,350 tax credit apartment properties in 45 states and one U.S. Territory.



ASSET MANAGEMENT



Our Asset Management segment includes the operations of Eagle, the Eagle Family of Funds (“Eagle Funds”), the asset management operations of RJ&A (“AMS”), Raymond James Trust, and other fee-based programs. The majority of the revenue for this segment is generated by the investment advisory fees related to asset management services for individual investment portfolios and mutual funds.  Investment advisory fees are also earned on assets held in managed and non-managed programs.  These fees are computed based on balances either at the beginning of the quarter, the end of the quarter, or average assets.  Consistent with industry practice, fees from private client investment portfolios are typically based on asset values at the beginning of the period while institutional fees are typically based on asset values at the end of the period.  Asset balances are impacted by both the performance of the market and new sales and redemptions of client accounts/funds.  Increasing markets generally positively impact revenues from investment advisory fees as existing accounts increase in value, and individuals and institutions may commit incremental funds in rising markets.  No single client accounts for a material percentage of this segment's total business.



Eagle Asset Management, Inc.



Eagle is a registered investment advisor with $16.1 billion under management and $800 million in assets under advisement (non-discretionary advised assets) as of September 30, 2011. Eagle offers a variety of equity and fixed income objectives managed by a number of portfolio management teams and a subsidiary investment advisor, Eagle Boston Investment Management, Inc. Eagle's clients include individuals, corporations, pension and profit sharing plans, foundations, endowments, variable annuities and mutual funds.  Eagle also serves as investment advisor to the Eagle Funds.  Additionally, performance fees may be earned for performing above respective benchmarks.  Eagle also earns fees on non-discretionary assets for providing their account models to professional advisors at other firms.



Eagle Fund Distributors, Inc. (“EFD”), a wholly owned subsidiary of Eagle, is a registered broker-dealer engaged in the distribution of the Eagle Funds.



The Eagle Funds utilize unaffiliated sub-advisors for the Capital Appreciation Fund and International Equity Fund.  The Small Cap Growth Fund, Mid Cap Growth Fund, Growth and Income Fund, Large Cap Core Fund, Mid Cap Stock Fund, Investment Grade Bond Fund, and Small Cap Core Value Fund are managed by Eagle.



Eagle closed its money market funds during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2010.  Eagle class shares of both a taxable and a tax-exempt money market fund are available to clients of Eagle and its affiliates through an unrelated third-party.



AMS



AMS manages several investment advisory programs which maintain an approved list of investment managers, provide asset allocation model portfolios, establish custodial facilities, monitor performance of client accounts, provide clients with accounting and other administrative services, and assist investment managers with certain trading management activities. AMS earns fees generally ranging from 0.35% to 0.85% of asset balances per annum, a portion of which is paid to predominately independent investment managers and Eagle who direct the investments within clients' accounts. In addition, AMS offers additional managed accounts managed within fee based asset allocation platforms under our Freedom accounts and other managed programs. Freedom’s investment committee manages portfolios of mutual funds, exchange traded funds and separately managed account models on a discretionary basis. AMS earns fees generally ranging from 0.10% to 0.55% of asset balances per annum.  For separately managed account models a portion of the fee may be paid to the investment managers who provide the separately managed account models. At September 30, 2011, these managed programs had $19.6 billion in assets under management, including $3.6 billion managed by Eagle.










AMS also provides certain services for their non-managed fee-based programs (Passport, Ambassador and other non-managed programs). They provide performance reporting, research, sales, accounting, trading and other administrative services. Advisory services are provided by PCG financial advisors. Client fees are based on the individual account or relationship size and may also be dependent on the type of securities in the accounts. Total client fees generally range from 0.50% to 3.00% of assets, and are predominantly allocated to the PCG segment, with a lesser share of revenue generated from these activities allocated to this Asset Management segment. As of September 30, 2011, these programs had $38.9 billion in assets. RJFS and RJFSA offer similar fee-based programs called IMPAC (“IMPAC”).  All revenues for IMPAC are allocated to either RJFS or RJFSA. As of September 30, 2011, IMPAC had nearly $10 billion in assets serviced by RJFS financial advisors and RJFSA registered investment advisors (see the Private Client Group segment discussion for additional information).



In addition to the foregoing programs, AMS also administers managed fee-based programs for clients who have contracted for portfolio management services from non-affiliated investment advisors that are not part of the Raymond James consulting services program.



Raymond James Trust, National Association



Raymond James Trust, National Association, (“RJT”) provides personal trust services primarily to existing clients of our broker-dealer subsidiaries. Portfolio management of trust assets can be subcontracted to our asset management operations. This subsidiary had a total of approximately $2 billion in client assets at September 30, 2011, including nearly $120 million in the donor-advised charitable foundation known as the Raymond James Charitable Endowment Fund.





RJ BANK



RJ Bank is a federally chartered savings bank, regulated by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (“OCC”), which provides corporate, residential and consumer loans, as well as Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) insured deposit accounts, to clients of our broker-dealer subsidiaries and to the general public.  RJ Bank is active in corporate loan syndications and bank participations as well as purchases residential whole loan packages to hold for investment.  RJ Bank generates revenue principally through the interest income earned on loans and investments, which is offset by the interest expense it pays on client deposits and on its borrowings. See Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” in this report for financial information regarding RJ Bank’s net interest earnings.





RJ Bank does not have any significant concentrations with any one industry or customer (see table of industry concentration in Item 7A, “Market Risk”).










EMERGING MARKETS



Raymond James International Holdings, Inc. (“RJIH”), through its subsidiaries, currently has interests in operations in Latin American countries including Argentina, Uruguay and Brazil. Through these entities we operate securities brokerage, investment banking, asset management and equity research businesses. In fiscal year 2011, approximately 75% of this segments’ investment banking revenues arose from one client.  No single client accounts for a material percentage of the remainder of the revenue generated by this segment.



SECURITIES LENDING



This segment conducts its business through the borrowing and lending of securities from and to other broker-dealers, financial institutions and other counterparties.  Generally, we conduct these activities as an intermediary (referred to as “Matched Book”).  However, Securities Lending will also loan customer marginable securities held in a margin account containing a debit (referred to as lending from the “Box”) to counterparties.  The borrower of the securities puts up a cash deposit on which interest is earned.  The lender in turn receives cash and pays interest.  These cash deposits are adjusted daily to reflect changes in the current market value of the underlying securities.  Additionally, securities are borrowed from other broker-dealers (referred to as borrowing for the “Box”) to facilitate RJ&A’s clearance and settlement obligations. The net revenues of this securities lending business are the interest spreads generated.  No single client accounts for a material percentage of this segment’s total business.



PROPRIETARY CAPITAL



This segment consists of our principal capital and private equity activities including various direct and third-party private equity and merchant banking investments; Raymond James Employee Investment Funds I and II (the “EIF Funds”); and a private equity fund which we sponsor – Raymond James Capital Partners, L.P.  As of September 30, 2011, certain of our merchant banking investments include an investment in  a manufacturer of crime investigation and forensic supplies, an event photography business, and an indirect investment in an allergy immunotherapy testing and treatment supply company.



We participate in profits or losses through both general and limited partnership interests. Additionally, we incur profits or losses as a result of direct merchant banking investments. The EIF Funds are limited partnerships, for which we are the general partner, that invest in our merchant banking and private equity activities and other unaffiliated venture capital limited partnerships. The EIF Funds were established as compensation and retention vehicles for certain of our qualified key employees.



OTHER



This segment includes various corporate overhead costs, including interest expense on our senior debt and the loss associated with the securities repurchased as a result of settlements with the SEC and other regulatory authorities regarding the offer and sale of auction rate securities (“ARS”). (See further discussion of the ARS matter in Item 3, “Legal Proceedings”).



COMPETITION



We are engaged in intensely competitive businesses. We compete with many larger, better capitalized providers of financial services, including other securities firms, most of which are affiliated with major financial services companies, insurance companies, banking institutions and other organizations. We also compete with a number of firms offering on-line financial services and discount brokerage services, usually with lower levels of service, to individual clients. We compete principally on the basis of the quality of our associates, service, product selection, location and reputation in local markets.



In the financial services industry, there is significant competition for qualified associates. Our ability to compete effectively in these businesses is substantially dependent on our continuing ability to attract, retain and motivate qualified associates, including successful financial advisors, investment bankers, trading professionals, portfolio managers and other revenue-producing or specialized personnel.










REGULATION



The following discussion sets forth some of the material elements of the regulatory framework applicable to the financial services industry and provides some specific information relevant to us. The regulatory framework is intended primarily for the protection of our customers and the securities markets, our depositors and the Federal Deposit Insurance Fund and not for the protection of our creditors or shareholders. Under certain circumstances, these rules may limit our ability to make capital withdrawals from RJ Bank or our broker-dealer subsidiaries.



To the extent that the following information describes statutory and regulatory provisions, it is qualified in its entirety by reference to the particular statutory and regulatory provisions. A change in applicable statutes, regulations or regulatory policy may have a material effect on our business.



The financial services industry in the U.S. is subject to extensive regulation under federal and state laws.  During our fiscal 2010, the U. S. government enacted financial services reform legislation known as the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform & Consumer Protection Act (“Dodd-Frank Act”).  Because of the nature of our business and our business practices, we presently do not expect the Dodd-Frank Act to have a significant direct impact on our operations as a whole.  However, because many of the implementing regulations will result from further studies by various regulatory agencies, the specific impact on each of our businesses is uncertain.



Effective July 21, 2011, and in accordance with the Dodd-Frank Act, RJF, as the holding company of RJ Bank, became subject to the oversight of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the “FRB”).  As a result, RJF is subject to periodic examination by the FRB.  In addition, the Office of Thrift Supervision (“OTS”) merged into the OCC and, therefore, the OCC assumed responsibility from the OTS for the ongoing examination, supervision, and regulation of federal savings associations and rulemaking for all savings associations, state and federal.



The SEC is the federal agency charged with administration of the federal securities laws. Financial services firms are also subject to regulation by state securities commissions in those states in which they conduct business.  RJ&A and RJFS are currently registered as broker-dealers in all 50 states. In addition, financial services firms are subject to regulation by various foreign governments, securities exchanges, central banks and regulatory bodies, particularly in those countries where they have established offices. We have offices in Europe, Canada and Latin America.



Much of the regulation of broker-dealers in the U.S. and Canada, however, has been delegated to self-regulatory organizations ("SROs"), principally FINRA, the IIROC and securities exchanges. These SROs adopt and amend rules (which are subject to approval by government agencies) for regulating the industry and conduct periodic examinations of member broker-dealers.



The SEC, SROs and state securities commissions may conduct administrative proceedings that can result in censure, fine, suspension or expulsion of a broker-dealer, its officers or employees. Such administrative proceedings, whether or not resulting in adverse findings, can require substantial expenditures and can have an adverse impact on the reputation of a broker-dealer.



Our U.S. broker-dealer subsidiaries are required by federal law to belong to SIPC. When the SIPC fund falls below a certain amount, members are required to pay higher annual assessments to replenish the reserves.  During fiscal year 2011, certain of our domestic broker-dealer subsidiaries incurred expenses amounting to 0.25% of net operating revenues as defined by SIPC, or approximately $3.2 million, to SIPC as a special assessment.  The SIPC fund provides protection for securities held in customer accounts up to $500,000 per customer, with a limitation of $250,000 on claims for cash balances. We have purchased excess SIPC coverage through various syndicates of Lloyd’s, a London-based firm that holds an “A+” rating from Standard and Poor’s and Fitch Ratings. Excess SIPC is fully protected by the Lloyd’s trust funds and Lloyd’s Central Fund. The additional protection currently provided has an aggregate firm limit of $750 million, including a sub-limit of $1.9 million per customer for cash above basic SIPC. Account protection applies when a SIPC member fails financially and is unable to meet obligations to clients.  This coverage does not protect against market fluctuations.



RJ Ltd. is currently registered in all provinces and territories in Canada. The financial services industry in Canada is subject to comprehensive regulation under both federal and provincial laws. Securities commissions have been established in all provinces and territorial jurisdictions which are charged with the administration of securities laws. Investment dealers in Canada are also subject to regulation by SROs, which are responsible for the enforcement of, and conformity with, securities legislation for their members and have been granted the powers to prescribe their own rules of conduct and financial requirements of members. RJ Ltd. is regulated by the securities commissions in the jurisdictions of registration as well as by the SROs and the IIROC.










RJ Ltd. is required by the IIROC to belong to the Canadian Investors Protection Fund ("CIPF"), whose primary role is investor protection. The CIPF Board of Directors determines the fund size required to meet its coverage obligations and sets a quarterly assessment rate. Dealer members are assessed the lesser of 1.0% of revenue or a risk-based assessment. The CIPF provides protection for securities and cash held in client accounts up to $1 million Canadian dollars (“CDN”) per client with separate coverage of CDN $1 million for certain types of accounts. This coverage does not protect against market fluctuations.



See Note 22 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on SEC, FINRA and IIROC regulations pertaining to broker-dealer regulatory minimum net capital requirements.



Our investment advisory operations, including the mutual funds that we sponsor, are also subject to extensive regulation. Our U.S. asset managers are registered as investment advisors with the SEC and are also required to make notice filings in certain states. Virtually all aspects of the asset management business are subject to various federal and state laws and regulations. These laws and regulations are primarily intended to benefit the asset management clients.





RJ Bank applied to the OCC in November, 2008 to convert to a national bank.  RJ Bank’s application to convert to a national bank is still pending and approval is anticipated before the end of the calendar year.  This charter conversion also requires, by law, that RJF become a bank holding company.  Accordingly, in December, 2008, RJF applied to the FRB to become a bank holding company.  RJF re-filed its application to become a bank holding company at the request of the FRB in November, 2011.  We anticipate approval before the end of the calendar year. Upon conversion from a thrift to a national bank charter, RJ Bank would no longer be subject to the QTL requirement.  RJF will then become a bank holding company and can elect to become a financial holding company.



RJ Bank is subject to various regulatory capital requirements established by bank regulators. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory - and possibly additional discretionary - actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on RJ Bank's financial statements and consequently ours. Under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, RJ Bank must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of RJ Bank's assets, liabilities and certain off-balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices. RJ Bank's capital amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components, risk weightings and other factors. Quantitative measures established by regulation to ensure capital adequacy require RJ Bank to maintain minimum amounts and ratios of Total and Tier I capital to risk-weighted assets and Tier I capital to adjusted assets (as defined in the regulations). See Note 22 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.








In addition, since RJ Bank provides products covered by FDIC insurance, RJ Bank is subject to the Federal Deposit Insurance Act.



Our federally chartered trust company is subject to regulation by the OCC. This regulation focuses on, among other things, ensuring the safety and soundness of RJT’s fiduciary services.



As a public company whose common stock is listed on the NYSE, we are subject to corporate governance requirements established by the SEC and NYSE, as well as federal and state law. Under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, we are required to meet certain requirements regarding business dealings with members of our Board of Directors, the structure of our Audit Committee, and ethical standards for our senior financial officers. Under SEC and NYSE rules, we are required to comply with other standards of corporate governance, including having a majority of independent directors serve on our Board of Directors, and the establishment of independent audit, compensation and corporate governance committees.  The Dodd-Frank Act included a number of provisions imposing governance standards, including those regarding “Say-on-Pay” votes for shareholders, incentive compensation clawbacks, compensation committee independence and disclosure concerning executive compensation, employee and director hedging and chairman and CEO positions.



Under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, we are required to assess the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting and to obtain an opinion from our independent auditors regarding the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting.
