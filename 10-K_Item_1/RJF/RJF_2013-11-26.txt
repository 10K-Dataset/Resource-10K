Item 1.BUSINESS



Raymond James Financial, Inc. (“RJF”), the parent company of a business established in 1962 and a public company since 1983, is a financial holding company headquartered in St. Petersburg, Florida whose subsidiaries are engaged in various financial services businesses predominantly in the United States of America (“U.S.”) and Canada. At September 30, 2013, its principal subsidiaries include Raymond James & Associates, Inc. (“RJ&A”), Raymond James Financial Services, Inc. (“RJFS”), Raymond James Financial Services Advisors, Inc. (“RJFSA”), Raymond James Ltd. (“RJ Ltd.”), Eagle Asset Management, Inc. (“Eagle”), and Raymond James Bank, N.A. (“RJ Bank”).  All of these subsidiaries are wholly owned by RJF. RJF and its subsidiaries are hereinafter collectively referred to as “our,” “we” or “us.”



As a financial holding company, RJF is subject to the oversight and periodic examination of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the “Fed”).





PRINCIPAL SUBSIDIARIES





RJFS is one of the largest independent contractor brokerage firms in the U.S., is a member of FINRA and SIPC, but is not a member of any exchanges.  Financial advisors affiliated with RJFS may offer their clients all products and services offered through RJ&A including investment advisory products and services which are offered through its affiliated registered investment advisor, RJFSA.  Both RJFS and RJFSA clear all of their business on a fully disclosed basis through RJ&A.



RJ Ltd. is our Canadian broker-dealer subsidiary which engages in both retail and institutional distribution and investment banking. RJ Ltd. is a member of the Toronto Stock Exchange (“TSX”) and the Investment Industry Regulatory Organization of Canada (“IIROC”). Its U.S. broker-dealer subsidiary is a member of FINRA and SIPC.



Eagle is a registered investment advisor serving as the discretionary manager for individual and institutional equity and fixed income portfolios and our internally sponsored mutual funds.



RJ Bank originates and purchases commercial and industrial (“C&I”) loans, commercial and residential real estate loans, as well as consumer loans, all of which are funded primarily by cash balances swept from the investment accounts of our broker-dealer subsidiaries’ clients.





REPORTABLE SEGMENTS



Effective September 30, 2013 we have five reportable segments: “Private Client Group” or “PCG”; “Capital Markets”; “Asset Management”; RJ Bank and the “Other” segment.  We implemented changes in our reportable segments as a result of management’s assessment of the usefulness and materiality of certain of our historic reportable segments. The result of the changes we implemented is the combination of the Private Client Group and the historic securities lending segments, the Capital Markets and the historic emerging markets segments, and the Other and the historic proprietary capital segments. Our financial information for each of the fiscal years ended on September 30, 2013, 2012, 2011 respectively, have been presented as if the change had been in effect throughout each year.See Note 28 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K for additional information.










Index





PRIVATE CLIENT GROUP



We provide securities transaction and financial planning services to approximately 2.5 million client accounts through the branch office systems of RJ&A, RJFS, RJFSA, RJ Ltd. and in the United Kingdom (“UK”) through Raymond James Investment Services Limited (“RJIS”). Our financial advisors offer a broad range of investments and services, including both third party and proprietary products, and a variety of financial planning services. We charge sales commissions or asset-based fees for investment services we provide to our Private Client Group clients based on established schedules. Varying discounts may be given, generally based upon the client’s level of business, the trade size, service level provided, and other relevant factors. In fiscal year 2013, the portion of securities commissions and fee revenues from this segment that we consider recurring include asset-based fees, trailing commissions from mutual funds and variable annuities/insurance products, mutual fund services fees, fees earned on funds in our multi-bank sweep program, and interest income, and represented approximately 68% of the Private Client Group’s total revenues.  Revenues of this segment are correlated with total client assets under administration.  As of September 30, 2013, client assets under administration of our Private Client Group amounted to approximately $403 billion.



RJ&A, RJFS and RJFSA offer investment advisory services under various financial advisor affiliation options.  Fee revenues for such services are computed as either a percentage of the assets in the client account, or a flat periodic fee charged to the client for investment advice.  RJ&A advisors operate under the RJ&A registered investment advisor (“RIA”) license while independent contractors affiliated with RJFS may operate either under their own RIA license, or the RIA license of RJFSA.  The investment advisory fee revenues associated with these activities are recorded within securities commissions and fee revenues on our consolidated financial statements.  Refer to the securities commissions and fees section of our summary of significant accounting policies in Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K for our accounting policies on presenting these revenues in our consolidated financial statements.



The majority of our U.S. financial advisors are also licensed to sell insurance and annuity products through our general insurance agency which was at one time known as Planning Corporation of America (“PCA”), a wholly owned subsidiary of RJF.  In October 2013, PCA merged with another wholly owned subsidiary of RJF, and PCA, as the surviving entity, changed its name to Raymond James Insurance Group, Inc. (“RJIG”). Through the financial advisors of our domestic broker-dealer subsidiaries, RJIG provides product and marketing support for a broad range of insurance products, principally fixed and variable annuities, life insurance, disability insurance and long-term care coverage.



Our U.S. financial advisors offer a number of professionally managed load mutual funds, as well as a selection of no-load mutual funds. RJ&A and RJFS maintain dealer sales agreements with most major distributors of mutual fund shares sold through broker-dealers.



Net interest revenue in the Private Client Group is generated by customer balances, predominantly the earnings on margin loans and assets segregated pursuant to regulations, less interest paid on customer cash balances (“Client Interest Program”). We also utilize a multi-bank sweep program which generates fee revenue from unaffiliated banks in lieu of interest revenue. The cash sweep program, known as the Raymond James Bank Deposit Program (“RJBDP”), is a multi-bank (RJ Bank and several non-affiliated banks) program under which clients’ cash deposits in their brokerage accounts are re-deposited through a third party service into interest-bearing deposit accounts (up to $250,000 per bank for individual accounts and up to $500,000 for joint accounts) at up to 12 banks. This program enables clients to obtain up to $2.5 million in individual Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) deposit insurance coverage ($5 million for joint accounts) while earning competitive rates for their cash balances.  See Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” in this report for information regarding our net interest revenues.



Clients’ transactions in securities are affected on either a cash or margin basis. RJ&A and RJ Ltd. make margin loans to clients that are collateralized by the securities purchased or by other securities owned by the client. Interest is charged to clients on the amount borrowed.  The interest rate charged to a client on a margin loan is based on current interest rates and on the outstanding amount of the loan.










Index



Typically, broker-dealers utilize bank borrowings and equity capital as the primary sources of funds to finance clients’ margin account borrowings. RJ&A’s source of funds to finance clients’ margin account balances has been cash balances in brokerage clients’ accounts, which are funds awaiting investment. In addition, pursuant to written agreements with clients, broker-dealers are permitted by the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) and FINRA rules to lend client securities in margin accounts to other financial institutions. SEC regulations, however, restrict the use of clients’ funds derived from pledging and lending clients’ securities, as well as funds awaiting investment, to the financing of margin account balances; to the extent not so used, such funds are required to be deposited in a special segregated account for the benefit of clients. The regulations also require broker-dealers, within designated periods of time, to obtain possession or control of, and to segregate, clients’ fully paid and excess margin securities.



No single client accounts for a material percentage of this segment’s total business.





Raymond James & Associates



RJ&A is a full service broker-dealer that employs financial advisors throughout the U.S. RJ&A’s financial advisors work in a traditional branch setting supported by local management and administrative staff. The number of financial advisors per office ranges from one to 46. RJ&A financial advisors are employees and their compensation includes commission payments and participation in the firm’s benefit plans.  Experienced financial advisors are hired from a wide variety of competitors.  As a part of their agreement to join us we may make loans to financial advisors and to certain key revenue producers, primarily for recruiting and/or retention purposes. In addition, individuals are trained each year to become financial advisors at the Robert A. James National Training Center in St. Petersburg, Florida.





Raymond James Financial Services



RJFS is a broker-dealer that supports independent contractor financial advisors in providing products and services to their Private Client Group clients throughout the U.S. The number of financial advisors in RJFS offices ranges from one to 42.  Independent contractors are responsible for all of their direct costs and, accordingly, are paid a larger percentage of commissions and fees than employee advisors. They are permitted to conduct, on a limited basis, certain other approved businesses outside of their RJFS activities such as offering insurance products, independent registered investment advisory services and accounting and tax services, among others, with the approval of RJFS management.



The Financial Institutions Division (“FID”) is a subdivision of RJFS. Through FID, RJFS provides services to financial institutions such as banks, thrifts and credit unions, and their clients.  RJFS also provides custodial, trading, research and other back office support and services (including access to clients’ account information and the services of the Asset Management segment) to unaffiliated independent registered investment advisors through its Investment Advisor Division (“IAD”).

Index





Securities Lending



RJ&A conducts its securities lending business through the borrowing and lending of securities from and to other broker-dealers, financial institutions and other counterparties.  Generally, we conduct these activities as an intermediary (referred to as “Matched Book”).  However, RJ&A will also loan customer marginable securities held in a margin account containing a debit (referred to as lending from the “Box”) to counterparties.  The borrower of the securities puts up a cash deposit on which interest is earned.  The lender in turn receives cash and pays interest.  These cash deposits are adjusted daily to reflect changes in the current market value of the underlying securities.  Additionally, securities are borrowed from other broker-dealers (referred to as borrowing for the “Box”) to facilitate RJ&A’s clearance and settlement obligations. The net revenues of this securities lending business are the interest spreads generated.





Operations and Information Technology



RJ&A operations personnel are responsible for the processing of securities transactions, custody of client securities, support of client accounts, receipt, identification and delivery of funds and securities, and compliance with certain regulatory and legal requirements for most of our U.S. securities brokerage operations through locations in Saint Petersburg, Florida, Memphis, Tennessee and Southfield, Michigan. RJ Ltd. operations personnel have similar responsibilities at our Canadian brokerage operations located in Vancouver, British Columbia.



The information technology department develops and supports the integrated solutions that provide a differentiated platform for our business.  This platform is designed to allow our advisors to spend more time with their clients and enhance and grow their business.



In the area of information security, we have developed and implemented a framework of principles, policies and technology to protect both our own information assets as well as those we have pertaining to our clients.  Safeguards are applied to maintain the confidentiality, integrity and availability of information resources.



Our business continuity program has been developed to provide reasonable assurance of business continuity in the event of disruptions at our critical facilities.  Business departments have developed operational plans for such disruptions, and we have a staff which devotes their full time to monitoring and facilitating those plans.  Our business continuity plan continues to be enhanced and tested to allow for continuous business processing in the event of weather-related or other interruptions of operations at our corporate office locations or one of our operations processing or data center sites.



We have also developed a business continuity plan for our PCG retail branches in the event these branches are impacted by severe weather. RJ&A PCG offices utilize an integrated telephone system to route clients to a centralized support center that services clients directly in the event of a branch office closure.





CAPITAL MARKETS



Capital Markets activities consist primarily of equity and fixed income products and services. No single client accounts for a material percentage of this segment’s total business.





Institutional Sales



Institutional sales commissions account for a significant portion of this segment’s revenue, which is fueled by a combination of general market activity and the Capital Markets group’s ability to identify and promote attractive investment opportunities.  Our institutional clients are serviced by institutional equity departments of RJ&A and RJ Ltd.; the RJ&A fixed income department; RJ&A’s European offices; Raymond James Financial International, Ltd., an institutional UK broker-dealer headquartered in London, England; and Raymond James European Securities, Inc., (“RJES”) headquartered in Paris, France. We charge commissions on equity transactions based on trade size and the amount of business conducted annually with each institution.  Fixed income commissions are based on trade size and the characteristics of the specific security involved.



More than 100 domestic and overseas professionals located in offices in the U.S. and Europe comprise RJ&A’s institutional equity sales and sales trading departments and maintain relationships with more than 1,350 institutional clients.  Some European and U.S. offices also provide services to high net worth clients. RJ Ltd. has over 30 institutional equity sales and trading professionals servicing predominantly Canadian, U.S. and European institutional investors from offices in Canada and Europe.








Index



From offices in various locations within the U.S., RJ&A distributes to institutional clients both taxable and tax-exempt fixed income products, primarily municipal, corporate, government agency and mortgage-backed bonds. RJ&A carries inventory positions of taxable and tax-exempt securities to facilitate institutional sales activities.





Trading



Trading equity securities involves the purchase and sale of securities from and to our clients or other dealers. Profits and losses are derived from the spreads between bid and asked prices, as well as market trends for the individual securities during the period we hold them.  Similar to the equity research department, this operation serves to support both our institutional and Private Client Group sales efforts.  RJ&A also offers an options trading platform that is operated primarily on an agency basis.  The RJ Ltd. trading desks not only support client activity, but also take proprietary positions that are closely monitored within well defined limits. RJ Ltd. also provides specialist services in approximately 165 TSX listed common stocks.



RJ&A trades both taxable and tax-exempt fixed income securities. The taxable and tax-exempt fixed income traders purchase and sell corporate, municipal, government, government agency, and mortgage-backed bonds, asset-backed securities, preferred stock, and certificates of deposit from and to our clients or other dealers. RJ&A enters into future commitments such as forward contracts and “to be announced” securities (e.g., securities having a stated coupon and original term to maturity, although the issuer and/or the specific pool of mortgage loans is not known at the time of the transaction). Relatively small amounts of proprietary trading positions are also periodically taken by RJ&A or RJ Ltd. for various purposes and are closely monitored within well defined limits.



In addition, RJ Capital Services, Inc., a subsidiary of RJF, participates in the interest rate swaps market as a principal, either to economically hedge RJ&A fixed income inventory, for transactions with customers, or to a limited extent for its own account.





Equity Research



The more than 50 domestic analysts in RJ&A’s research department support our institutional and retail sales efforts and publish research on more than 1,000 companies. This research primarily focuses on U.S. and Canadian companies in specific industries including consumer, energy, financial services, healthcare, industrial, mining and natural resources, real estate, technology, and communication and transportation. Proprietary industry studies and company-specific research reports are made available to both institutional and individual clients. RJ Ltd. has 13 analysts who publish research on approximately 270 primarily Canadian companies focused in the energy, energy services, mining, forest products, agricultural, technology, clean technology, consumer and industrial products, and real estate sectors. Additionally, we provide coverage of a limited number of European companies through RJES, as well as Latin American companies through a joint venture in which we hold an interest.





Investment Banking



The nearly 150 professionals of RJ&A’s equity capital markets investment banking group reside in various locations within the U.S. and are involved in a variety of activities including public and private equity financing for corporate clients, and merger and acquisition advisory services. RJ Ltd.’s investment banking group consists of approximately 25 professionals who reside in various locations within Canada and provide equity financing and financial advisory services to corporate clients. Our investment banking activities provide a comprehensive range of strategic and financial advisory services tailored to our clients’ business life cycles and backed by our strategic industry focus.



RJ&A’s fixed income investment banking services include public finance and debt underwriting activities. Nearly 100 professionals in the RJ&A public finance group operate out of various offices located throughout the U.S., and serve as a financial advisor, placement agent or underwriter to various issuers who include municipal agencies (including political subdivisions), housing developers and non-profit health care institutions.



RJ&A acts as a consultant, underwriter or selling group member for corporate bonds, mortgage-backed securities (“MBS”), agency bonds, preferred stock and unit investment trusts. When underwriting new issue securities, RJ&A agrees to purchase the issue through a negotiated sale or submits a competitive bid.



Raymond James Financial Products, Inc. or Morgan Keegan Capital Services, LLC, both being non-broker-dealer subsidiaries (collectively referred to as the Raymond James matched book swap subsidiaries or “RJSS”), enter into derivative transactions, including interest rate swaps, options, and combinations of those instruments, primarily with government entities and not-for-profit counterparties.  For every derivative transaction RJSS enters into with a customer, RJSS enters into an offsetting derivative transaction with a credit support provider who is a third party financial institution.  Thus, we refer to RJSS’s operations as our “matched book” derivatives business.








Index



Syndicate



The syndicate department consists of professionals who coordinate the marketing, distribution, pricing and stabilization of lead and co-managed equity underwritings. In addition to lead and co-managed offerings, this department coordinates the firm’s syndicate and selling group activities in transactions managed by other investment banking firms.





Raymond James Tax Credit Funds, Inc.



Raymond James Tax Credit Funds, Inc. (“RJTCF”) is the general partner or managing member in a number of limited partnerships and limited liability companies. These partnerships and limited liability companies invest in real estate project entities that qualify for tax credits under Section 42 of the Internal Revenue Code. RJTCF has been an active participant in the tax credit program since its inception in 1986 and currently focuses on tax credit funds for institutional investors that invest in a portfolio of tax credit-eligible multi-family apartments. The investors’ expected returns on their investments in these funds are primarily derived from tax credits and tax losses that investors can use to reduce their federal tax liability. During fiscal year 2013, RJTCF invested approximately $600 million for large institutional investors in approximately 85 real estate transactions for properties located throughout the U.S. Since inception, RJTCF has sold, inclusive of unfunded commitments, over $5 billion of tax credit fund partnership interests and has sponsored more than 85 tax credit funds, with investments in over 1,700 tax credit apartment properties in nearly all 50 states and one U.S. Territory.





Emerging Markets



Raymond James International Holdings, Inc. (“RJIH”), through its subsidiaries, currently has interests in operations in Latin American countries including Argentina and Uruguay. Through these entities we operate securities brokerage, investment banking, asset management and equity research businesses.  During fiscal year 2013, we closed our operations in Brazil.







ASSET MANAGEMENT



Our Asset Management segment includes the operations of Eagle, the Eagle Family of Funds (“Eagle Funds”), the asset management operations of RJ&A (“AMS”), Raymond James Trust, National Association (“RJT”), a wholly owned subsidiary of RJF, and other fee-based programs. Revenues for this segment are primarily generated by the investment advisory fees related to asset management services provided for individual and institutional investment portfolios, along with mutual funds. Investment advisory fees are earned on assets held in managed or non-managed programs.  These fees are computed based on balances either at the beginning of the quarter, the end of the quarter, or average daily assets.  Consistent with industry practice, fees from private client investment portfolios are typically based on asset values at the beginning of the period while institutional fees are typically based on asset values at the end of the period.  Asset balances are impacted by both the performance of the market and new sales and redemptions of client accounts/funds.  Rising markets have historically had a positive impact on investment advisory fee revenues as existing accounts increase in value, and individuals and institutions may commit incremental funds in rising markets.  No single client accounts for a material percentage of this segment’s total business.





Eagle Asset Management, Inc.



Eagle is a registered investment advisor that offers a variety of equity and fixed income objectives managed by a number of portfolio management teams and subsidiary investment advisors, including Eagle Boston Investment Management, Inc. and ClariVest Asset Management (“ClariVest”).  Eagle has approximately $28 billion in assets under management (which includes the assets managed by ClariVest) and over $2 billion in assets under advisement (non-discretionary advised assets) as of September 30, 2013. Eagle’s clients include institutions, corporations, pension and profit sharing plans, foundations, endowments, issuers of variable annuities, individuals and mutual funds. Eagle also serves as investment advisor to the Eagle Funds. Most clients are charged fees based upon asset levels including fees on non-discretionary assets for providing Eagle account models to professional advisors at other firms, however in some cases performance fees may be earned for outperforming respective benchmarks.



Eagle Fund Distributors, Inc. (“EFD”), a wholly owned subsidiary of Eagle, is a registered broker-dealer engaged in the distribution of the Eagle Funds.



The Small Cap Growth Fund, Mid Cap Growth Fund, Growth and Income Fund, Mid Cap Stock Fund, Investment Grade Bond Fund, and Eagle Smaller Company Fund are managed by Eagle.  The Capital Appreciation Fund and International Stock Fund utilize ClariVest as a sub-advisor.








Index



Eagle acquired a 45% interest in ClariVest in December, 2012.  See Note 3 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K for additional information regarding the ClariVest acquisition.



Eagle class shares of both a taxable and a tax-exempt money market fund are available to clients of Eagle and its affiliates through an unrelated third party.





AMS





AMS also provides certain services for their non-managed fee-based programs (known as Passport, Ambassador or other non-managed programs).AMS provides performance reporting, research, sales, accounting, trading and other administrative services. Advisory services are provided by PCG financial advisors. Client fees are based on the individual account or relationship size and may also be dependent on the type of securities in the accounts. Total client fees generally range from 1.0% to 2.5% of assets, and the revenues are predominantly included in securities commissions and fees revenue in the PCG segment, with a lesser share of revenue generated from these activities included in investment advisory fee revenue in this Asset Management segment. As of September 30, 2013, these programs had approximately $63 billion in assets. RJFS and RJFSA offer a similar fee-based program known as IMPAC (“IMPAC”).  All revenues for IMPAC are reported in the PCG segment. As of September 30, 2013, IMPAC had approximately $13 billion in assets serviced by RJFS financial advisors and RJFSA registered investment advisors (see the Private Client Group segment discussion in this Item 1 for additional information).



In addition to the foregoing programs, AMS also administers managed fee-based programs for clients who have contracted for portfolio management services from non-affiliated investment advisors that are not part of the Raymond James Consulting Services program.





Raymond James Trust, National Association



RJT provides personal trust services primarily to existing clients of our broker-dealer subsidiaries. Under its federal charter, RJT may act as trustee, custodian, personal representative or agent to the trustee.  RJT administers approximately $2.92 billion in trust assets atSeptember 30, 2013, including approximately $205 million in the donor-advised charitable foundation known as the Raymond James Charitable Endowment Fund.





RJ BANK



RJ Bank provides corporate, residential and consumer loans, as well as FDIC insured deposit accounts, to clients of our broker-dealer subsidiaries and to the general public.  RJ Bank is active in corporate loan syndications and participations.  RJ Bank generates revenue principally through the interest income earned on loans and investments, which is offset by the interest expense it pays on client deposits and on its borrowings. See Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” in this report for financial information regarding RJ Bank’s net interest earnings.  RJ Bank is a national bank regulated by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (“OCC”).  During fiscal year 2012, RJ Bank converted from a thrift charter to a national bank charter to facilitate RJ Bank maintaining a loan portfolio with a greater percentage of corporate loans than were otherwise permissible under thrift regulations.








Index



RJ Bank operates from a single branch location adjacent to RJF’s corporate office complex in St. Petersburg, Florida. Access to RJ Bank’s products and services is available nationwide through the offices of our affiliated broker-dealers as well as through electronic banking services.  RJ Bank’s assets include C&I loans, commercial and residential real estate loans, as well as consumer loans, primarily consisting of loans fully collateralized by marketable securities. Corporate loans represent approximately 75% of RJ Bank’s loan portfolio of which 95% are U.S. and Canadian syndicated loans. Residential mortgage loans are originated and held for investment or sold in the secondary market. RJ Bank’s total liabilities primarily consist of deposits that are cash balances swept from the investment accounts maintained at RJ&A.



RJ Bank does not have any significant concentrations with any one industry or customer (see table of industry concentration in Item 7A, “Credit Risk” in this Form 10-K).







OTHER



This segment includes our principal capital and private equity activities as well as various corporate overhead costs of RJF including the interest cost on our public debt, corporate settlements (including a settlement related to auction rate securities that occurred in fiscal year 2011) and the acquisition and integration costs associated with our acquisitions including, most significantly, Morgan Keegan (see further discussion in Note 3 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K).



Our principal capital and private equity activities include various direct and third party private equity and merchant banking investments; employee investment funds (the “Employee Funds”); and various private equity funds which we sponsor including Raymond James Capital Partners, L.P.



We participate in profits or losses from various investments through both general and limited partnership interests. Additionally, we realize profits or incur losses as a result of direct merchant banking investments. The Employee Funds are limited partnerships, some of which we are the general partner, that invest in our merchant banking and private equity activities and other unaffiliated venture capital limited partnerships. The Employee Funds were established as compensation and retention vehicles for certain of our qualified key employees.  As of September 30, 2013, certain of our merchant banking investments include investments in a manufacturer of crime investigation and forensic supplies, an event photography business, and a company pursuing a new concept in the salon services market.





COMPETITION



We are engaged in intensely competitive businesses. We compete with many larger, better capitalized providers of financial services, including other securities firms, most of which are affiliated with major financial services companies, insurance companies, banking institutions and other organizations. We also compete with a number of firms offering on-line financial services and discount brokerage services, usually with lower levels of service, to individual clients. We compete principally on the basis of the quality of our associates, service, product selection, location and reputation in local markets.



In the financial services industry, there is significant competition for qualified associates. Our ability to compete effectively in these businesses is substantially dependent on our continuing ability to attract, retain and motivate qualified associates, including successful financial advisors, investment bankers, trading professionals, portfolio managers and other revenue producing or specialized personnel.







REGULATION



The following discussion sets forth some of the material elements of the regulatory framework applicable to the financial services industry and provides some specific information relevant to us. The regulatory framework is intended primarily for the protection of our customers and the securities markets, our depositors and the Federal Deposit Insurance Fund and not for the protection of our creditors or shareholders. Under certain circumstances, these rules may limit our ability to make capital withdrawals from RJ Bank or our broker-dealer subsidiaries.



To the extent that the following information describes statutory and regulatory provisions, it is qualified in its entirety by reference to the particular statutory and regulatory provisions. A change in applicable statutes, regulations or regulatory policy may have a material effect on our business.








Index



The financial services industry in the U.S. is subject to extensive regulation under federal and state laws.  During our fiscal year 2010, the U. S. government enacted financial services reform legislation known as the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform & Consumer Protection Act (“Dodd-Frank Act”).  Because of the nature of our business and our business practices, we presently do not expect the Dodd-Frank Act to have a significant direct impact on our operations as a whole.  However, because some of the implementing regulations have yet to be adopted by various regulatory agencies, the specific impact on some of our businesses remains uncertain.



The SEC is the federal agency charged with administration of the federal securities laws. Financial services firms are also subject to regulation by state securities commissions in those states in which they conduct business.  RJ&A and RJFS are currently registered as broker-dealers in all 50 states.  The SEC recently adopted amendments, most of which were effective October, 2013, to its financial responsibility rules, including changes to the net capital rule, the customer protection rule, the record-keeping rules and the notification rules applicable to our broker-dealer subsidiaries.  We are currently evaluating the impact of these amendments on our broker-dealer subsidiaries; however, based on our current analyses, we do not believe they will have a material adverse effect on any of our broker-dealer subsidiaries.   In addition, financial services firms are subject to regulation by various foreign governments, securities exchanges, central banks and regulatory bodies, particularly in those countries where they have established offices. We have offices in Europe, Canada and Latin America.



Much of the regulation of broker-dealers in the U.S. and Canada, however, has been delegated to self-regulatory organizations (“SROs”), principally FINRA, the IIROC and securities exchanges. These SROs adopt and amend rules (which are subject to approval by government agencies) for regulating the industry and conduct periodic examinations of member broker-dealers.



The SEC, SROs and state securities commissions may conduct administrative proceedings that can result in censure, fine, suspension or expulsion of a broker-dealer, its officers or employees. Such administrative proceedings, whether or not resulting in adverse findings, can require substantial expenditures and can have an adverse impact on the reputation of a broker-dealer.



Our U.S. broker-dealer subsidiaries are required by federal law to be members of SIPC. The SIPC fund provides protection for securities held in customer accounts up to $500,000 per customer, with a limitation of $250,000 on claims for cash balances.  When the SIPC fund falls below a certain amount, members are required to pay higher annual assessments to replenish the reserves.  During fiscal year 2013, certain of our domestic broker-dealer subsidiaries incurred expenses amounting to 0.25% of net operating revenues as defined by SIPC, or approximately $4.6 million, to SIPC as a special assessment.  We have purchased excess SIPC coverage through various syndicates of Lloyd’s, a London-based firm that holds an “A+” rating from Standard and Poor’s and Fitch Ratings. Excess SIPC is fully protected by the Lloyd’s trust funds and Lloyd’s Central Fund. For RJ&A, the additional protection currently provided has an aggregate firm limit of $750 million, including a sub-limit of $1.9 million per customer for cash above basic SIPC. Account protection applies when a SIPC member fails financially and is unable to meet obligations to clients.  This coverage does not protect against market fluctuations.



RJ Ltd. is currently registered in all provinces and territories in Canada. The financial services industry in Canada is subject to comprehensive regulation under both federal and provincial laws. Securities commissions have been established in all provinces and territorial jurisdictions which are charged with the administration of securities laws. Investment dealers in Canada are also subject to regulation by SROs, which are responsible for the enforcement of, and conformity with, securities legislation for their members and have been granted the powers to prescribe their own rules of conduct and financial requirements of members. RJ Ltd. is regulated by the securities commissions in the jurisdictions of registration as well as by the SROs and the IIROC.



RJ Ltd. is required by the IIROC to belong to the Canadian Investors Protection Fund (“CIPF”), whose primary role is investor protection. The CIPF Board of Directors determines the fund size required to meet its coverage obligations and sets a quarterly assessment rate. Dealer members are assessed the lesser of 1.0% of revenue or a risk-based assessment. The CIPF provides protection for securities and cash held in client accounts up to $1 million Canadian currency (“CDN”) per client with separate coverage of CDN $1 million for certain types of accounts. This coverage does not protect against market fluctuations.



See Note 25 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K for further information on SEC, FINRA and IIROC regulations pertaining to broker-dealer regulatory minimum net capital requirements.



Our investment advisory operations, including the mutual funds that we sponsor, are also subject to extensive regulation. Our U.S. asset managers are registered as investment advisors with the SEC and are also required to make notice filings in certain states. Virtually all aspects of the asset management business are subject to various federal and state laws and regulations. These laws and regulations are primarily intended to benefit the asset management clients.








Index



RJF is under the supervision of, and subject to the rules, regulations, and periodic examination by the Fed.  Additionally, RJ Bank is subject to the rules and regulations of the OCC, the Fed, and the FDIC. Collectively, these rules and regulations cover all aspects of the banking business including lending practices, safeguarding deposits, capital structure, transactions with affiliates and conduct and qualifications of personnel.



RJF as a financial holding company, and RJ Bank, are subject to various regulatory capital requirements established by bank regulators. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory, and possibly additional discretionary, actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on our and RJ Bank’s financial results. Under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, RJF and RJ Bank must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of assets, liabilities and certain off-balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices. RJF’s and RJ Bank’s capital amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components of capital, risk weightings of assets, off-balance sheet transactions, and other factors. Quantitative measures established by regulation to ensure capital adequacy require RJF, as a financial holding company, and RJ Bank, to maintain minimum amounts and ratios of Total and Tier I capital to risk-weighted assets and Tier I capital to adjusted assets (as defined in the regulations). See Note 25 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K for further information.



In July 2013, the OCC, the Federal Reserve Board (“FRB”) and the FDIC released final United States Basel III regulatory capital rules implementing the global regulatory capital reforms of Basel III and certain changes required by the Dodd-Frank Act.  The rule increases the quantity and quality of regulatory capital, establishes a capital conservation buffer, and makes selected changes to the calculation of risk-weighted assets.  The rule becomes effective for us on January 1, 2015, subject to a transition period for several aspects of the rule, including the new minimum capital ratio requirements, the capital conservation buffer, and the regulatory capital adjustments and deductions.  We are currently evaluating the impact of these rules on both RJF and RJ Bank; however, based on our current analyses, we believe that RJF and RJ Bank would meet all capital adequacy requirements under the final rules.  However, the increased capital requirements could restrict our ability to grow during favorable market conditions or require us to raise additional capital.  As a result, our business, results of operations, financial condition or prospects could be adversely affected.  See Item 1A, “Risk Factors,” within this Form 10-K for more information.



Since RJ Bank provides products covered by FDIC insurance, generally up to $250,000 per account ownership type, RJ Bank is subject to the Federal Deposit Insurance Act. In February 2011, under the provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act, the FDIC issued a final rule changing its assessment base in addition to other minor adjustments.  For banks with more than $10 billion in assets, the FDIC’s new rule changed the assessment rate calculation, which relies on a scorecard designed to measure financial performance and ability to withstand stress in addition to measuring the FDIC’s exposure should the bank fail. This new rule will become effective for RJ Bank beginning with the December 2013 assessment period.  RJ Bank is still evaluating the impact of this change on future FDIC insurance premiums.



In July 2011, pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (“CFPB”) began operations and was given rulemaking authority for a wide range of consumer protection laws that would apply to all banks and provide broad powers to supervise and enforce consumer protection laws.  RJ Bank recently exceeded $10 billion in total assets for four consecutive quarters and as a result the CFPB has now assumed regulatory authority over RJ Bank for its compliance with various consumer regulations.  The CFPB has proposed and finalized many rules since its establishment, with the majority of those effective in early fiscal year 2014.  RJ Bank is still evaluating the impact of this additional regulator.



In October 2012, under the provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act, regulators issued final rules requiring banking organizations with total assets of more than $10 billion but less than $50 billion to conduct annual company-prepared stress tests, report the results to their primary regulator and the Fed and publish a summary of the results.  Under the rules, stress tests must be conducted using certain scenarios (baseline, adverse, and severely adverse), which the Fed will provide each year.  These new rules require RJF to conduct its first stress test by March 31, 2014.  In addition, RJF will be required to begin publicly disclosing a summary of certain stress test results in our fiscal year 2015.



RJT, our federally chartered trust company, is subject to regulation by the OCC. This regulation focuses on, among other things, ensuring the safety and soundness of RJT’s fiduciary services.
