ITEMS 1 and 2.    BUSINESS AND PROPERTIES

Cabot Oil & Gas Corporation is an independent oil and gas company engaged in the development, exploitation and exploration of
oil and gas properties. Our primary areas of operation include Appalachia, east and south Texas, and Oklahoma. Our assets are concentrated in areas with known hydrocarbon resources, which are
conducive to multi-well, repeatable drilling programs. We operate in one segment, natural gas and oil development, exploitation and exploration, exclusively in the continental United
States. We have regional offices located in Houston, Texas and Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

OVERVIEW

On an equivalent basis, our production in 2011 increased by 44% from 2010. We produced 187.5 Bcfe, or 513.7 Mmcfe per day, in
2011, as compared to 130.6 Bcfe, or 357.9 Mmcfe per day, in 2010. Natural gas production increased by 53.4 Bcf, or 43%, to 178.8 Bcf in 2011 from 125.5 Bcf in 2010, primarily due to increased
production in the Marcellus shale associated with our increased drilling program and upgrades to the Lathrop compressor station in Susquehanna County, Pennsylvania, which included the commissioning of
new compression during 2011. Partially offsetting the production increase in northeast Pennsylvania were decreases in production primarily in east and south Texas due to normal production declines,
the sale of oil and gas properties in Colorado, Utah and Wyoming and a shift from gas to oil projects. Crude oil/condensate/NGL production increased by 584 Mbbls, or 68%, from 859 Mbbls in 2010 to
1,443 Mbbls in 2011 primarily due to an increase in production resulting from our Eagle Ford oil shale drilling program in south Texas.

Our
average realized natural gas price for 2011 was $4.46 per Mcf, 22% lower than the $5.69 per Mcf price realized in 2010. Our average realized crude oil price for 2011 was $90.49 per
Bbl, 8% lower than the $97.91 per Bbl price realized in 2010. These realized prices include realized gains and losses resulting from commodity derivatives. For information about the impact of these
derivatives on realized prices, refer to "Results of Operations" in Item 7.

Our
proved reserves totaled approximately 3,033 Bcfe at December 31, 2011, of which 96% were natural gas. This reserve level was up by 12% from 2,701 Bcfe at December 31,
2010 on the strength of results from our drilling program. In 2011, we had a net upward revision of 21.6 Bcfe, which was primarily due to an upward performance revision of 214.9 Bcfe, primarily in the
Dimock field in northeast Pennsylvania, partially offset by a downward revision of 189.8 Bcfe of proved undeveloped reserves that are no longer in our five-year development plan and a
downward revision of 3.6 Bcfe associated with decreased reserve commodity pricing. For information about other changes in our proved reserves, refer to the Supplemental Oil and Gas Information to the
Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8.

For
the year ended December 31, 2011, we drilled 161 gross wells (96.0 net) with a success rate of over 99% compared to 113 gross wells (87.1 net) with a success rate of 98% for
the prior year. In 2012, we plan to drill approximately 120 to 130 gross wells, focusing our capital program in the Marcellus shale in northeast Pennsylvania, the Eagle Ford oil shale in south Texas
and the Marmaton oil play in Oklahoma.

Our
2011 total capital and exploration spending was $905.5 million compared to $891.5 million in 2010. This increase in spending was substantially driven by an expanded
Marcellus shale horizontal drilling program and increases in our drilling programs in the Eagle Ford oil shale in south Texas and the Marmaton oil play in Oklahoma. In both 2011 and 2010, we allocated
our planned program for capital
and exploration expenditures among our various operating areas based on return expectations, availability of services and human resources. We plan to continue such method of allocation in 2012.









Funding
of the program is expected to be provided by operating cash flow, existing cash and, if required, borrowings under our credit facility. In 2012, we plan to spend between $750 and
$790 million on capital and exploration activities.

While
we consider acquisitions from time to time, we remain focused on pursuing drilling opportunities that provide more predictable results on our accumulated acreage position.
Additionally, we intend to maintain spending discipline and manage our balance sheet in an effort to ensure sufficient liquidity, including cash resources and available credit. We believe these
strategies are appropriate for our portfolio of projects in the current commodity pricing environment and will continue to add shareholder value over the long-term.

DIVESTITURES

In October 2011, we sold certain proved oil and gas properties located in Colorado, Utah and Wyoming to Breitburn Energy
Partners, L.P. for $285.0 million. We received $283.2 million in cash proceeds, after closing adjustments, and recognized a $4.2 million gain on sale of assets.

In
May 2011, we sold certain of our unproved Haynesville and Bossier Shale oil and gas properties in east Texas to a third party. We received approximately $47.0 million in cash
proceeds and recognized a $34.2 million gain on sale of assets.

In
2011, we sold various other unproved properties and other assets for total proceeds of $73.5 million and recognized an aggregate gain of $25.0 million.

In
December 2010, we sold our existing Pennsylvania gathering infrastructure of approximately 75 miles of pipeline and two compressor stations to Williams Field Services (Williams), a
subsidiary of Williams Partners L.P., for $150 million. Under the terms of the purchase and sale agreement, we were obligated to construct pipelines to connect certain of our 2010
program wells, complete the construction of the
Lathrop compressor station and complete taps into certain pipeline delivery points. These obligations were completed in 2011. As of December 31, 2010, we recognized a $49.3 million gain
on sale of assets, which included the accrual of $17.9 million associated with the obligations described above. We also entered into a 25-year firm gathering contract with Williams
that requires Williams to complete construction of approximately 32 miles of high pressure pipeline, 65 miles of trunklines and two compressor stations in Susquehanna County, Pennsylvania in 2011 and
2012. Additionally, Williams will connect all of our drilling program wells, which will connect our production to five interstate pipeline delivery options.

In
2010, we sold various other proved and unproved properties and other assets for total proceeds of $32.2 million and recognized an aggregate gain of $16.3 million.

In
April 2009, we sold substantially all of our Canadian proved oil and gas properties to Tourmaline Oil Corporation (Tourmaline) in exchange for cash and common shares of Tourmaline. In
November 2010, we sold our investment in Tourmaline for $61.3 million and recognized a $40.7 million gain on sale of assets.
