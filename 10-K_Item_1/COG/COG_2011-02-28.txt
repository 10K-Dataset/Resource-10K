ITEM 1. BUSINESS

OVERVIEW

Cabot Oil & Gas Corporation is an independent oil and gas company engaged in the development, exploitation and exploration of oil
and gas properties located in the United States. In 2009, we restructured our operations by combining our Rocky Mountain and Appalachian areas to form the North region and combining the Anadarko Basin with our Texas and Louisiana areas to form the
South region. Certain prior period amounts and historical descriptions have been reclassified to reflect this reorganization. Operationally, we now have two primary regional offices located in Houston, Texas and Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

In 2010, natural gas prices decreased from the price levels experienced during 2009, while crude oil prices increased. Our 2010 average
realized natural gas price was $5.54 per Mcf, 26% lower than the 2009 average realized price of $7.47 per Mcf. Our 2010 average realized crude oil price was $97.91 per Bbl, 14% higher than the 2009 average realized price of $85.52 per Bbl. These
realized prices include realized gains and losses resulting from commodity derivatives. For information about the impact of these derivatives on realized prices, refer to the “Results of Operations” section in Item 7 of this Annual
Report on Form 10-K.

In 2010, our investment program totaled $891.5 million, including lease acquisition ($130.7 million) and
drilling and facilities ($654.2 million) programs. Our capital spending was funded through cash on hand, operating cash flow, borrowings on our revolving credit facility, proceeds from our new senior notes offering and select asset sales.

We remain focused on our strategies of pursuing lower risk drilling opportunities that provide more predictable results on
our accumulated acreage position. Additionally, we intend to maintain spending discipline and manage our balance sheet in an effort to ensure sufficient liquidity, including cash resources and available credit. We believe these strategies are
appropriate for our portfolio of projects and the current industry environment and will continue to add shareholder value over the long-term.

In December 2010, we sold our existing Pennsylvania gathering infrastructure of approximately 75 miles of pipeline and two compressor stations to Williams Field Services (Williams), a subsidiary of
Williams Partners L.P., for $150 million and recognized a $49.3 million gain on sale of assets. Under the terms of the purchase and sale agreement, we are obligated to construct pipelines to connect certain of our 2010 program wells, complete the
construction of the Lathrop compressor station and complete taps into certain pipeline delivery points. We expect to complete these obligations in the first half of 2011. We also entered into a 25-year firm gathering contract with Williams that
requires Williams to complete construction of approximately 32 miles of high pressure pipeline, 65 miles of trunklines in Susquehanna County, and build two compressor stations in the next two years. Additionally, Williams will connect all of our
drilling program wells, which will connect our production to five interstate pipeline delivery options.

In addition, in
December 2010 we closed a private placement of $175 million principal amount of senior unsecured fixed rate notes with a weighted-average interest rate of 5.58%.

In September 2010, we amended and restated our revolving credit facility to increase the available credit line to $900 million and with an accordion feature allowing us to increase the available credit
line to $1.0 billion, if any one or more of the existing banks or new banks agree to provide such increased commitment amount. The amended facility provides for a $1.5 billion borrowing base and extends the term of the agreement to September 2015.

In April 2009, we sold substantially all of our Canadian properties to Tourmaline Oil
Corporation (Tourmaline) in exchange for cash and common stock shares of Tourmaline. In November 2010, we sold our investment in Tourmaline for $61.3 million and recognized a $40.7 million gain on sale of assets.

In 2010, we sold various other properties for total proceeds of $30.4 million and an aggregate gain of $15.3 million.

In August 2008, we completed the acquisition of producing properties, leasehold acreage and a natural gas gathering infrastructure in
east Texas (the “east Texas acquisition”). We paid total net cash consideration of approximately $604.0 million. In order to finance the east Texas acquisition, we completed a public offering of 5,002,500 shares of our common stock in June
2008, receiving net proceeds of $313.5 million, and we closed a private placement in July 2008 of $425 million principal amount of 6.51% weighted average senior unsecured fixed rate notes.

On an equivalent basis, our production level in 2010 increased by 27% from 2009. We produced 130.6 Bcfe, or 357.9 Mmcfe per day, in 2010,
as compared to 103.0 Bcfe, or 282.1 Mmcfe per day, in 2009. Natural gas production increased to 125.5 Bcf in 2010 from 97.9 Bcf in 2009, primarily due to increased production in the North region associated with the increased drilling program and the
Lathrop compressor station in Susquehanna County, Pennsylvania. The decline in the other areas is related to natural production decline. Oil production decreased by 10 Mbbls from 818 Mbbls in 2009 to 808 Mbbls in 2010 due primarily to a decrease in
production in the North and a decrease in production in Canada due to the sale of our Canadian properties in April 2009, partially offset by increased production in the South region associated with the Eagle Ford shale and Pettet formation
production.

For the year ended December 31, 2010, we drilled 113 gross wells (87.1 net) with a success rate of 98%
compared to 143 gross wells (118.6 net) with a success rate of 95% for the prior year. In 2011, we plan to drill approximately 110 gross wells (83.1 net), focusing our capital program in the Marcellus shale in northeast Pennsylvania and the Eagle
Ford shale in south Texas.

Our 2010 total capital and exploration spending was $891.5 million compared to $640.4 million in
2009. In both 2010 and 2009, we allocated our planned program for capital and exploration expenditures among our various operating regions based on return expectations, availability of services and human resources. We plan to continue such method of
allocation in 2011. Funding of the program is expected to be provided by operating cash flow, existing cash and, if required, borrowings under our credit facility. For 2011, the North region is expected to receive approximately 58% of the
anticipated capital program, with the remaining 42% dedicated to the South region. In 2011, we plan to spend approximately $600 million on capital and exploration activities.

Our proved reserves totaled approximately 2,701 Bcfe at December 31, 2010, of which 98% were natural gas. This reserve level was up by 31% from 2,060 Bcfe at December 31, 2009 on the strength of
results from our drilling program. In 2010, we had a net upward revision of 136.7 Bcfe, which was primarily due to an upward performance revision of 284.4 Bcfe, primarily in the Dimock field in northeast Pennsylvania, and an upward revision of 35.0
Bcfe associated with increased reserve commodity pricing partially offset by a downward revision of 182.7 Bcfe (115.1 Bcfe in the North region and 67.6 Bcfe in the South region) of proved undeveloped reserves that are no longer in our five-year
development plan.

(1)Reserve Life Index is equal to year-end
reserves divided by annual production.

(2)The term “net” as used in “net
acreage” or “net production” throughout this document refers to amounts that include only acreage or production that is owned by us and produced to our interest, less royalties and production due others. “Net wells”
represents our working interest share of each well.

Our interest in both developed and
undeveloped properties is primarily in the form of leasehold interests held under customary mineral leases. These leases provide us the right, in general, to develop oil and/or natural gas on the properties. Their primary terms range in length from
approximately three to ten years. These properties are held for longer periods if production is established. We own leasehold rights on approximately 2.3 million gross acres. In addition, we own fee interest in approximately 0.2 million
gross acres, primarily in West Virginia. Our largest field (Dimock), which is our only field that contains more than 15% of our proved reserves, is located in northeast Pennsylvania. This field makes up approximately 46% of our proved reserves.

The following table presents certain information with respect to our Dimock field:

NORTH REGION

The North
region is comprised of the Appalachian and Rocky Mountains areas. Our activities in the Appalachian area are concentrated primarily in northeast Pennsylvania and in West Virginia. Our activities in the Rocky Mountains area are concentrated in the
Green River and Washakie Basins in Wyoming. This region is managed from our office in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. In this region, our assets include a large acreage position, a high concentration of wells, natural gas gathering and pipeline systems,
and storage capacity. In December 2010, we sold our existing Pennsylvania gathering infrastructure of approximately 75 miles of pipeline and two compressor stations. In July 2010, we sold our properties in the Paradox Basin in Colorado.

Capital and exploration expenditures for 2010 were $603.6 million, or 68% of our total 2010 capital and exploration expenditures,
compared to $380.3 million for 2009, or 60% of our total 2009 capital and exploration



- 6 -




expenditures. This increase in spending was substantially driven by an expanded Marcellus horizontal drilling program in northeast Pennsylvania to hold acreage. For 2011, we have budgeted
approximately $350.0 million for capital and exploration expenditures in the region.

At December 31, 2010, we had 4,185
wells (3,588.5 net), of which 3,724 wells are operated by us. There are multiple producing intervals in the Appalachian area that includes the Big Lime, Weir, Berea and Devonian (including Marcellus) shale formations at depths primarily ranging from
950 to 7,800 feet, with an average depth of approximately 4,050 feet. In the Rocky Mountains area, principal producing intervals are in the Almond, Frontier and Dakota formations at depths ranging from 8,100 to 14,375 feet, with an average
depth of approximately 11,050 feet.

Natural gas production and reserves in the North region are primarily associated with the
Marcellus shale. At December 31, 2010, we had 2,007.2 Bcfe of proved reserves (substantially all natural gas) in the North region, constituting 74% of our total proved reserves. Developed and undeveloped reserves made up 1,251.3 Bcfe and 755.9
Bcfe of the total proved reserves for the North region, respectively.

In 2010, we drilled 63 wells (61.3 net) in the North
region, of which 62 wells (60.3 net) were development and extension wells. In 2011, we plan to drill approximately 54 wells (54.0 net), primarily in the Dimock field in northeast Pennsylvania.

In 2010, we produced and marketed approximately 221.8 Mmcf per day of natural gas and 272.5 barrels of crude oil/condensate/NGL per day
in the North region at market responsive prices. Average daily production in 2010 was 223.4 Mmcfe. Natural gas and crude oil/condensate/NGL production for 2010 was 81.0 Bcf and 100 Mbbls, respectively.

Ancillary to our exploration, development and production operations, we operated a number of gas gathering and transmission pipeline
systems, made up of approximately 3,148 miles of pipeline with interconnects to three interstate transmission systems and seven local distribution companies and numerous end users as of the end of 2010. The majority of our pipeline infrastructure in
West Virginia is regulated by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) for interstate transportation service and the West Virginia Public Service Commission (WVPSC) for intrastate transportation service. As such, the transportation rates and
terms of service of our pipeline subsidiary, Cranberry Pipeline Corporation, are subject to the rules and regulations of the FERC and the WVPSC. Our natural gas gathering and transmission pipeline systems in West Virginia enable us to connect new
wells quickly and to transport natural gas from the wellhead directly to interstate pipelines, local distribution companies and industrial end users. Control of our gathering and transmission pipeline systems also enables us to purchase, transport
and sell natural gas produced by third parties. In addition, we can engage in development drilling without relying upon third parties to transport our natural gas and incur only the incremental costs of pipeline and compressor additions to our
system.

We have two natural gas storage fields located in West Virginia with a combined working capacity of approximately 4
Bcf. We use these storage fields to take advantage of the seasonal variations in the demand for natural gas and the higher prices typically associated with winter natural gas sales, while maintaining production at a nearly constant rate throughout
the year. The storage fields also enable us to increase for shorter intervals of time the volume of natural gas that we can deliver by more than 40% above the volume that we could deliver solely from our production in the North region. The pipeline
systems and storage fields are fully integrated with our operations.

The principal markets for our North region natural gas
are in the northeastern and northwestern United States. We sell natural gas to industrial customers, local distribution companies and gas marketers both on and off our pipeline and gathering system. Approximately 42% of our natural gas sales volume
in the North region is sold at index-based prices under contracts with terms of one year or greater. The remaining 58% of our natural gas sales volume is sold under contracts with terms less than one year. Spot market sales are made at index-based
prices under month-to-month contracts, while industrial and utility sales generally are made under year-to-year contracts.

SOUTH REGION

Our development, exploitation, exploration and production activities in the South region are primarily concentrated in east and south Texas and Oklahoma. A regional office in Houston manages the
operations. Principal producing intervals are in the Cotton Valley, Haynesville, Bossier, and James Lime formations in east Texas, the Eagle Ford, Frio, Vicksburg and Wilcox formations in south Texas and the Chase, Morrow and Chester formations
in the Anadarko Basin in Oklahoma at measured depths ranging from approximately 2,500 to 17,700 feet, with an average depth of approximately 8,950 feet. We sold our Woodford shale prospect located in Oklahoma in June 2010 and certain oil and
gas properties in the Texas panhandle in November 2010.

Capital and exploration expenditures were $280.4 million for 2010, or
32% of our total 2010 capital and exploration expenditures, compared to $237.6 million for 2009, or 37% of our total 2009 capital and exploration expenditures. This increase in capital spending is primarily due to lease acquisitions to establish a
greater position in the oil window of the Eagle Ford shale. For 2011, we have budgeted approximately $250 million for capital and exploration expenditures in the region. Our 2011 South region drilling program will emphasize activity primarily in the
Eagle Ford shale in south Texas.

We had 1,769 wells (1,231.1 net) in the South region as of December 31, 2010, of
which 1,345 wells are operated by us. Average daily production in 2010 was 134.4 Mmcfe. Natural gas and crude oil/condensate/NGL production for 2010 was 44.5 Bcf and 759 Mbbls, respectively.

At December 31, 2010, we had 693.9 Bcfe of proved reserves (93% natural gas) in the South region, which represented 26% of our total
proved reserves. Developed and undeveloped reserves made up 472.9 Bcfe and 221.0 Bcfe of the total proved reserves for the South region, respectively.

In 2010, we drilled 50 wells (25.8 net) in the South region, of which 47 wells (23.3 net) were development and extension wells. In 2011, we plan to drill 56 wells (29.1 net), primarily in the Eagle Ford
shale in south Texas.

Our principal markets for the South region natural gas are in the industrialized Gulf Coast area and
the Midwestern United States. We sell natural gas to intrastate pipelines, natural gas processors and marketing companies. Currently, approximately 83% of our natural gas sales volumes in the South region are sold at index-based prices under
contracts with terms of one year or greater. The remaining 17% of our natural gas sales volumes are sold at index-based prices under short-term agreements. The South region properties are connected to various processing plants in Texas and Louisiana
with multiple interstate and intrastate deliveries, affording us access to multiple markets.

In 2010, we produced and
marketed approximately 122.0 Mmcf per day of natural gas and 2,079.1 barrels of crude oil/condensate/NGL per day in the South region at market responsive prices. Average daily production in 2010 was 134.4 Mmcfe. Natural gas and crude
oil/condensate/NGL production for 2010 was 44.5 Bcf and 759 Mbbls, respectively.

RISK MANAGEMENT

From time to time, when we believe that market conditions are favorable, we use certain derivative financial instruments to manage price
risks associated with our production in all of our regions. While there are many different types of derivatives available, in 2010 we employed natural gas and crude oil swap agreements for portions of our 2010 production to attempt to manage price
risk more effectively. During 2010, we also entered into crude oil swaps to hedge our price exposure on our 2010 production, natural gas swaps to hedge our price exposure on our 2011 production and crude oil price collars to hedge our price exposure
on our 2011 production. In addition, we also have natural gas basis swaps covering a portion of anticipated 2012 production, which do not qualify for hedge accounting. In 2009 and 2008, we employed price collars and swaps to hedge our price exposure
on our production.



- 8 -




The collar arrangements are put and call options used to establish floor and ceiling
commodity prices for a fixed volume of production during a certain time period. They provide for payments to counterparties if the index price exceeds the ceiling and payments from the counterparties if the index price falls below the floor. The
price swaps call for payments to, or receipts from, counterparties based on whether the market price of natural gas or crude oil for the period is greater or less than the fixed price established for that period when the swap is put in place.

For 2010, swaps covered 29% of natural gas production and 90% of crude oil production and had a weighted-average price of
$9.30 per Mcf and $104.25 per Bbl, respectively.

As of December 31, 2010, we had the following outstanding commodity
derivatives:

(1)Liquids include crude oil, condensate and natural gas liquids.

(2)Natural gas equivalents are determined using the ratio of 6 Mcf of natural gas to 1 Bbl of crude oil, condensate or natural gas liquids.

Our reserve estimates were based on decline curve extrapolations, material balance calculations, analogies,
or combinations of these methods for each well.

The proved reserve estimates presented herein were prepared by our petroleum
engineering staff and audited by Miller and Lents, Ltd., independent petroleum engineers. Miller and Lents made independent estimates for 100% of the proved reserves estimated by us and concluded the following: In their judgment we have an effective
system for gathering data and documenting information required to estimate our proved reserves and



- 9 -




project our future revenues. Further, Miller and Lents has concluded (1) the reserves estimation methods employed by us were appropriate, and our classification of such reserves was
appropriate to the relevant SEC reserve definitions, (2) our reserves estimation processes were comprehensive and of sufficient depth, (3) the data upon which we relied were adequate and of sufficient quality, and (4) the results of
our estimates and projections are, in the aggregate, reasonable. For additional information regarding estimates of proved reserves, the audit of such estimates by Miller and Lents, Ltd., and other information about our oil and gas reserves, see the
Supplemental Oil and Gas Information to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. A copy of the audit letter by Miller and Lents, Ltd., dated February 1, 2011, has been filed as an exhibit to this Form 10-K. Our
reserves are sensitive to natural gas and crude oil sales prices and their effect on the economic productive life of producing properties. Our reserves are based on 12-month average oil and gas index prices, calculated as the unweighted arithmetic
average for the first day of the month price for each month during 2010. Increases in commodity prices may result in a longer economic productive life of a property or result in more economically viable proved undeveloped reserves to be recognized.
Decreases in prices may result in negative impacts of this nature.

Internal Control

Our corporate reservoir engineers report to the Director of Engineering, who maintains oversight and compliance responsibility for the
internal reserve estimation process and provides oversight for the annual audit of our year-end reserves by our independent third party engineers, Miller and Lents, Ltd. Our corporate reservoir engineering group consists of two petroleum/chemical
engineers, with petroleum/chemical engineering degrees and between 11 and 28 years of industry experience, between four and 28 years of reservoir engineering/management experience, and between three and 12 years managing our reserves. Both are
members of the Society of Petroleum Engineers.

Qualifications of Third Party Engineers

The technical person primarily responsible for audit of our reserve estimates at Miller and Lents, Ltd. meets the requirements regarding
qualifications, independence, objectivity, and confidentiality set forth in the Standards Pertaining to the Estimating and Auditing of Oil and Gas Reserves Information promulgated by the Society of Petroleum Engineers. Miller and Lents, Ltd. is an
independent firm of petroleum engineers, geologists, geophysicists, and petro physicists; they do not own an interest in our properties and are not employed on a contingent fee basis.

For additional information about the risks inherent in our estimates of proved reserves, see “Risk Factors—Our proved reserves
are estimates. Any material inaccuracies in our reserve estimates or underlying assumptions could cause the quantities and net present value of our reserves to be overstated or understated” in Item 1A.

Proved Undeveloped Reserves

At December 31, 2010, we had 976.9 Bcfe of proved undeveloped reserves, which represents an increase of 241.7 Bcfe compared with December 31, 2009. For 2010, total capital related to the
development of proved undeveloped reserves was $183.4 million, resulting in the conversion of 216.9 Bcfe of reserves to proved developed. During 2010, we had 391.8 Bcfe of proved undeveloped reserve additions and 249.5 Bcfe of positive proved
undeveloped reserve performance revisions, primarily in the Dimock field in northeast Pennsylvania. Lastly, we removed 182.7 Bcfe (115.1 Bcfe in the North region and 67.6 Bcfe in the South region) of proved undeveloped reserves associated with
drilling locations no longer anticipated to be developed within the next five years.

Competition

Competition in our primary producing areas is intense. Price, contract terms and quality of service, including pipeline connection times and distribution efficiencies, affect competition. We believe that
in the North region our extensive acreage position, existing natural gas gathering and pipeline systems in West Virginia, services and equipment that we have secured for the upcoming years and storage fields in West Virginia enhance our competitive
position over other producers who do not have similar systems or services in place. We also actively compete against other companies with substantially larger financial and other resources.

OTHER BUSINESS MATTERS

Major Customer

In 2010, one customer accounted for approximately 11%, of the Company’s total sales. In 2009, two customers accounted for
approximately 13% and 11%, respectively, of the Company’s total sales. In 2008, one customer accounted for approximately 16% of the Company’s total sales.

Seasonality

Demand for natural gas has historically been seasonal,
with peak demand and typically higher prices occurring during the colder winter months.

Regulation of Oil and Natural Gas Exploration
and Production

Natural Gas Marketing, Gathering and Transportation

Federal
legislation and regulatory controls have historically affected the price of the natural gas we produce and the manner in which our production is transported and marketed. Under the Natural Gas Act of 1938 (NGA), the FERC regulates the interstate
sale for resale of natural gas and the transportation of natural gas in interstate commerce, although facilities used in the production or gathering of natural gas in interstate commerce are generally exempted from FERC jurisdiction. Effective
January 1, 1993, the Natural Gas Wellhead Decontrol Act deregulated natural gas prices for all “first sales” of natural gas, which definition covers all sales of our own production. In addition, as part of the broad industry
restructuring initiatives described below, the FERC has granted to all producers such as us a “blanket certificate of public convenience and necessity” authorizing the sale of gas for resale without further FERC approvals. As a result, all
of our produced natural gas may now be sold at market prices, subject to the terms of any private contracts that may be in effect. In addition, under the



- 15 -




provisions of the Energy Policy Act of 2005 (2005 Act), the NGA has been amended to prohibit any forms of market manipulation in connection with the purchase or sale of natural gas. Pursuant to
the 2005 Act, the FERC established new regulations that are intended to increase natural gas pricing transparency through, among other things, requiring market participants to report their gas sales transactions annually to the FERC, and new
regulations that require certain non-interstate pipelines to post daily scheduled volume information and design capacity for certain points on their systems. The 2005 Act also significantly increased the penalties for violations of the NGA and the
FERC’s regulations. In 2010, the FERC issued Penalty Guidelines for the determination of civil penalties in an effort to add greater fairness, consistency and transparency to its enforcement program.

Our natural gas sales prices nevertheless continue to be affected by intrastate and interstate gas transportation regulation, because the
prices we receive for our production are affected by the cost of transporting the gas to the consuming market. Through a series of comprehensive rulemakings, beginning with Order No. 436 in 1985 and continuing through Order No. 636 in 1992
and Order No. 637 in 2000, the FERC has adopted regulatory changes that have significantly altered the transportation and marketing of natural gas. These changes were intended by the FERC to foster competition by, among other things,
transforming the role of interstate pipeline companies from wholesale marketers of gas to the primary role of gas transporters, and by increasing the transparency of pricing for pipeline services. The FERC has also established regulations governing
the relationship of pipelines with their marketing affiliates, which essentially require that designated employees function independently of each other, and that certain information not be shared. The FERC has also implemented standards relating to
the use of electronic data exchange by the pipelines to make transportation information available on a timely basis and to enable transactions to occur on a purely electronic basis.

In light of these statutory and regulatory changes, most pipelines have divested their gas sales functions to marketing affiliates, which
operate separately from the transporter and in direct competition with all other merchants, and most pipelines have also implemented the large-scale divestiture of their gas gathering facilities to affiliated or non-affiliated companies. Interstate
pipelines thus now generally provide unbundled, open and nondiscriminatory transportation and transportation-related services to producers, gas marketing companies, local distribution companies, industrial end users and other customers seeking such
services. Sellers and buyers of gas have gained direct access to the particular pipeline services they need, and are better able to conduct business with a larger number of counterparties. We believe these changes generally have improved our access
to markets while, at the same time, substantially increasing competition in the natural gas marketplace.

On December 3, 2009, the DOT adopted a regulation requiring gas and hazardous liquid
pipelines that use supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems and have at least one controller and control room to develop written control room management procedures by August 1, 2011 and implement the procedures by
February 1, 2013. In a Proposed Rulemaking issued September 17, 2010, the DOT proposed to expedite the program implementation deadline to August 1, 2011 for most of the requirements, except for certain provisions regarding adequate
information and alarm management, which would have a program implementation deadline of August 1, 2012. On November 26, 2010, the DOT updated its reporting requirements for natural gas and hazardous liquid pipelines to be effective
January 1, 2011.

We cannot predict what new or different regulations the FERC and other regulatory agencies may adopt,
or what effect subsequent regulations may have on our activities. Similarly, it is impossible to predict what proposals, if any, that affect the oil and natural gas industry might actually be enacted by Congress or the various state legislatures and
what effect, if any, such proposals might have on us. Similarly, and despite the recent trend toward federal deregulation of the natural gas industry, whether or to what extent that trend will continue, or what the ultimate effect will be on our
sales of gas, cannot be predicted.

Federal Regulation of Petroleum

We are not able to predict with certainty the effect upon us of these periodic reviews by the FERC of the pipeline index, or of the
application of the FERC’s policy on income tax allowances.

Environmental Regulations

General.Our operations are subject to extensive federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the
generation, storage, handling, emission, transportation and discharge of materials into the environment. Permits are required for the operation of our various facilities. These permits can be revoked, modified or renewed by issuing authorities.
Governmental authorities enforce compliance with their regulations through fines, injunctions or both. Government regulations can increase the cost of planning, designing, installing and operating, and can affect the timing of installing and
operating, oil and gas facilities. Although we believe that compliance with environmental regulations will not have a material adverse effect on us, risks of substantial costs and liabilities related to environmental compliance issues are part of
oil and gas production operations. No assurance can be given that significant costs and liabilities will not be incurred. Also, it is possible that other developments, such as stricter environmental laws and regulations, and claims for damages to
property or persons resulting from oil and gas production could result in substantial costs and liabilities to us.

The transition zone and shallow-water areas of the U.S. Gulf Coast are ecologically
sensitive. Environmental issues have led to higher drilling costs and a more difficult and lengthy well permitting process. U.S. laws and regulations applicable to our operations include those controlling the discharge of materials into the
environment, requiring removal and cleanup of materials that may harm the environment, requiring consistency with applicable coastal zone management plans, or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment.

Solid and Hazardous Waste.We currently own or lease, and have in the past owned or leased, numerous properties that
were used for the production of oil and gas for many years. Although operating and disposal practices that were standard in the industry at the time may have been utilized, it is possible that hydrocarbons or other wastes may have been disposed of
or released on or under the properties currently owned or leased by us. State and federal laws applicable to oil and gas wastes and properties have become stricter over time. Under these increasingly stringent requirements, we could be required to
remove or remediate previously disposed wastes (including wastes disposed or released by prior owners and operators) or clean up property contamination (including groundwater contamination by prior owners or operators) or to perform plugging
operations to prevent future contamination.

We generate some hazardous wastes that are already subject to the Federal
Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) and comparable state statutes. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has limited the disposal options for certain hazardous wastes. It is possible that certain wastes currently exempt from treatment
as hazardous wastes may in the future be designated as hazardous wastes under RCRA or other applicable statutes. We could, therefore, be subject to more rigorous and costly disposal requirements in the future than we encounter today.

Superfund.The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA), also known as the
“Superfund” law, imposes liability, without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct, on certain persons with respect to the release of hazardous substances into the environment. These persons include the owner and operator
of a site and any party that treated or disposed of or arranged for the treatment or disposal of hazardous substances found at a site. CERCLA also authorizes the EPA, and in some cases, private parties, to undertake actions to clean up such
hazardous substances, or to recover the costs of such actions from the responsible parties. In the course of business, we have used materials and generated wastes and will continue to use materials and generate wastes that may fall within
CERCLA’s definition of hazardous substances. We may also be an owner or operator of sites on which hazardous substances have been released. As a result, we may be responsible under CERCLA for all or part of the costs to clean up sites where
such substances have been released.

Oil Pollution Act.The Federal Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (OPA) and
resulting regulations impose a variety of obligations on responsible parties related to the prevention of oil spills and liability for damages resulting from such spills in waters of the United States. The term “waters of the United
States” has been broadly defined to include inland water bodies, including wetlands and intermittent streams. The OPA assigns liability to each responsible party for oil removal costs and a variety of public and private damages. We believe that
we substantially comply with the Oil Pollution Act and related federal regulations.

Clean Water Act.The
Federal Water Pollution Control Act (Clean Water Act) and resulting regulations, which are primarily implemented through a system of permits, also govern the discharge of certain contaminants into waters of the United States. Sanctions for failure
to comply strictly with the Clean Water Act are generally resolved by payment of fines and correction of any identified deficiencies. However, regulatory agencies could require us to cease construction or operation of certain facilities or to cease
hauling wastewaters to facilities owned by others that are the source of water discharges. We believe that we substantially comply with the Clean Water Act and related federal and state regulations.

Clean Air Act.Our operations are subject to local, state and federal laws and regulations to control emissions from
sources of air pollution. Payment of fines and correction of any identified deficiencies generally



- 18 -




resolve penalties for failure to comply strictly with air regulations or permits. Regulatory agencies could also require us to cease construction or operation of certain facilities or to install
additional controls on certain facilities that are air emission sources. We believe that we substantially comply with the emission standards under local, state, and federal laws and regulations.

Hydraulic Fracturing.

Greenhouse Gas.In response to recent studies suggesting that emissions of carbon dioxide and certain other gases may be
contributing to warming of the Earth’s atmosphere, the U.S. Congress is actively considering legislation to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases from sources within the United States between 2012 and 2050. For example, the 110th session of
Congress considered various bills that proposed a “cap and trade” scheme of regulation of greenhouse gas emissions that generally would ban emissions above a defined reducing annual cap. Covered parties would be authorized to emit
greenhouse emissions through the acquisition and subsequent surrender of emission allowances that may be traded or acquired on the open market. In addition, at least 17 states have already taken legal measures to reduce emissions of greenhouse
gases, primarily through the planned development of greenhouse gas emission inventories and/or regional greenhouse gas cap and trade programs. Most of these cap and trade programs require either major sources of emissions, such as electric power
plants, or major producers of fuels, such as refineries or gas processing plants, to acquire and surrender emission allowances. The number of allowances available for purchase is reduced each year until the overall greenhouse gas emission reduction
goal is achieved.

Depending on the particular program, we could be required to purchase and surrender allowances, either for
greenhouse gas emissions resulting from our operations or from combustion of oil or natural gas we produce. Although we would not be impacted to a greater degree than other similarly situated producers of oil and gas, a stringent greenhouse gas
control program could have an adverse effect on our cost of doing business and could reduce demand for the oil and gas we produce.

Also, in the wake of the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision in April 2007 inMassachusetts v. Environmental Protection Agency, the EPA has begun to regulate carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas
emissions, even though Congress has yet to adopt new legislation specifically addressing emissions of greenhouse gases. In late 2009, the EPA issued a “Mandatory Reporting of Greenhouse Gases” final rule, which was amended in



- 19 -




December 2010, establishing a new comprehensive regulation and reporting scheme for operators of stationary sources emitting certain levels of greenhouse gases, and a Final Rule finding that
certain current and projected levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere threaten public health and welfare of current and future generations. Most recently, in late 2010, the EPA finalized new greenhouse gas reporting requirements for upstream
petroleum and natural gas systems, which will be added to EPA’s greenhouse gas reporting rule. Please read “Item 1A. Risk Factors—Climate change and climate change legislation and regulatory initiatives could result in increased
operating costs and decreased demand for oil and gas.”
