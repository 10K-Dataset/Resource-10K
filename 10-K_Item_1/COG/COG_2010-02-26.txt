ITEM 1. BUSINESS

OVERVIEW

Cabot Oil & Gas Corporation is an independent oil and gas company engaged in the development, exploitation and exploration of oil
and gas properties located in North America. In 2009, we restructured our operations by combining our Rocky Mountain and Appalachian areas to form the North Region and combining the Anadarko Basin with our Texas and Louisiana areas to form the South
Region. Certain prior period amounts and historical descriptions have been reclassified to reflect this reorganization. Operationally, we now have two primary regional offices located in Houston, Texas and Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

In 2009, energy commodity prices recovered from the price levels experienced during the second half of 2008. Our 2009 average realized
natural gas price was $7.47 per Mcf, 11% lower than the 2008 average realized price of $8.39 per Mcf. Our 2009 average realized crude oil price was $85.52 per Bbl, 4% lower than the 2008 average realized price of $89.11 per Bbl. These realized
prices include realized gains and losses resulting from commodity derivatives (zero-cost collars or swaps). For information about the impact of these derivatives on realized prices, refer to the “Results of Operations” section in
Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

In 2009, our investment program totaled $640.4 million, including lease
acquisition ($145.7 million) and drilling and facilities ($401.1 million) programs. Our capital spending was funded largely through cash flow from operations and, to a lesser extent, borrowings on our revolving credit facility.

We remain focused on our strategies of pursuing lower risk drilling opportunities that provide more predictable results on our accumulated
acreage position. Additionally, we intend to maintain spending discipline and manage our balance sheet in an effort to ensure sufficient liquidity, including cash resources and available credit. We believe these strategies are appropriate for our
portfolio of projects and the current industry environment and will continue to add shareholder value over the long-term.

In
April 2009, we sold substantially all of our Canadian properties to a private Canadian company (see Note 2 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further details). In April 2009, we also entered into a new revolving credit
facility and terminated our prior credit facility (see Note 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further details).

In August 2008, we completed the acquisition of producing properties, leasehold acreage and a natural gas gathering infrastructure in east Texas (the “east Texas acquisition”). We paid total net
cash consideration of approximately $604.0 million (see Note 2 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further details). In order to finance the east Texas acquisition, we completed a public offering of 5,002,500 shares of our
common stock in June 2008, receiving net proceeds of $313.5 million (see Note 9 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further details), and we closed a private placement in July 2008 of $425 million principal amount of senior
unsecured fixed rate notes (see Note 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further details).

On an
equivalent basis, our production level in 2009 increased by 8% from 2008. We produced 103.0 Bcfe, or 282.1 Mmcfe per day, in 2009, as compared to 95.2 Bcfe, or 260.1 Mmcfe per day, in 2008. Natural gas production increased to 97.9 Bcf in 2009 from
90.4 Bcf in 2008, primarily due to increased production in the North region associated with the increased drilling program in Susquehanna County, Pennsylvania as well as increased natural gas production in the South region associated with the
properties we acquired in the east Texas acquisition in August 2008 and drilling in the Angie field in east Texas. Partially offsetting these production gains were decreases in production in Canada due to the sale of our Canadian properties in April
2009, as well as reduced drilling activity in Oklahoma and Wyoming. Oil production increased by 36 Mbbls from 782 Mbbls in







Index to Financial Statements

2008 to 818 Mbbls in 2009 due primarily to increased production in the South region associated with the properties we acquired in the east Texas acquisition in August 2008 and an increase related
to Pettet development in the Angie field, partially offset by a decrease in production in Canada due to the sale of our Canadian properties in April 2009.

For the year ended December 31, 2009, we drilled 143 gross wells (119 net) with a success rate of 95% compared to 432 gross wells (355 net) with a success rate of 97% for the prior year. In 2010, we
plan to drill approximately 136 gross wells (123.9 net), focusing our capital program in the Marcellus Shale in northeast Pennsylvania and, to a lesser extent, in east Texas.

Our 2009 total capital and exploration spending was $640.4 million compared to $1.5 billion of total capital and exploration spending in
2008. In both 2009 and 2008, we allocated our planned program for capital and exploration expenditures among our various operating regions based on return expectations, availability of services and human resources. We plan to continue such method of
allocation in 2010. Funding of the program is expected to be provided by operating cash flow, existing cash and increased borrowings under our credit facility, if required. For 2010, the North region is expected to receive approximately 69% of the
anticipated capital program, with the remaining 31% dedicated to the South region. In 2010, we plan to spend approximately $585 million on capital and exploration activities.

Our proved reserves totaled approximately 2,060 Bcfe at December 31, 2009, of which 98% were natural gas. This reserve level was up by
6% from 1,942 Bcfe at December 31, 2008 on the strength of results from our drilling program. In 2009 we had a net downward revision of 200.1 Bcfe primarily due to (i) downward revisions of 101.6 Bcfe due to lower 2009 oil and natural gas
prices compared to 2008 and (ii) downward revisions of 120.4 Bcfe due to the removal of proved undeveloped reserves scheduled for development beyond five years primarily due to the application of the Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC)
new oil and gas reserve calculation methodology, partially offset by 21.9 Bcfe of positive performance revisions.

The
following table presents certain reserve, production and well information as of December 31, 2009.

(1)Reserve Life Index is equal to year-end reserves divided by annual production.

(2)The term “net” as used in “net acreage” or “net production” throughout this document refers to amounts that include only
acreage or production that is owned by us and produced to our interest, less royalties and production due others. “Net wells” represents our working interest share of each well.

Our interest in both developed and undeveloped properties is primarily in the form of leasehold interests held under customary mineral
leases. These leases provide us the right, in general, to develop oil and/or natural gas on the properties. Their primary terms range in length from approximately three to ten years. These properties are held for longer periods if production is
established. We own leasehold rights on approximately 2.9 million gross acres. In addition, we own fee interest in approximately 0.2 million gross acres, primarily in West Virginia. Our two largest fields, Brachfield Southeast in east
Texas and Dimock in Susquehanna County, Pennsylvania, each contain more than 15% of our proved reserves. In addition, we are focusing significant

NORTH REGION

The North region is comprised of the Appalachian and Rocky
Mountains areas. In April 2009, we sold substantially all of our Canadian properties to a private Canadian company. Our activities in the Appalachian area are concentrated primarily in northeast Pennsylvania and in West Virginia. Our activities in
the Rocky Mountains area are concentrated in the Green River and Washakie Basins in Wyoming and the Paradox Basin in Colorado. This region is managed from our office in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. In this region, our assets include a large acreage
position, a high concentration of wells, natural gas gathering and pipeline systems, and storage capacity.

Capital and
exploration expenditures for 2009 were $380.3 million, or 60% of our total 2009 capital and exploration expenditures, compared to $483.7 million for 2008, or 32% of our total 2008 capital and exploration expenditures. This decrease in spending was
substantially driven by a $69.5 million decrease in drilling and facilities costs year-over-year and the sale of our Canadian properties in April 2009. For 2010, we have budgeted approximately $402 million for capital and exploration expenditures in
the region.

At December 31, 2009, we had 4,141 wells (3,536.9 net), of which 3,681 wells are operated by us. There are
multiple producing intervals in the Appalachian area that include the Big Lime, Weir, Berea and Devonian (including Marcellus) Shale formations at depths primarily ranging from 950 to 9,080 feet, with an average depth of approximately 3,950 feet. In
the Rocky Mountains area, principal producing intervals are in the Almond, Frontier, Dakota and Honaker Trail formations at depths ranging from 4,200 to 14,375 feet, with an average depth of approximately 10,950 feet. Average net daily production in
2009 for the North region was 136.6 Mmcfe. Natural gas and crude oil/condensate/NGL production for 2009 was 49.2 Bcf and 125 Mbbls, respectively.

While natural gas production volumes from North region reservoirs are on balance lower on a per-well basis compared to other areas of the United States, the productive life of North region reserves is
relatively long. At December 31, 2009, we had 1,346.1 Bcfe of proved reserves (substantially all natural gas) in the North region, constituting 65% of our total proved reserves. Developed and undeveloped reserves made up 850.0 Bcfe and 496.1
Bcfe of the total proved reserves for the North region, respectively.

In 2009, we drilled 62 wells (59.4 net) in the North
region, of which 61 wells (59.3 net) were development and extension wells. In 2010, we plan to drill approximately 100 wells (100 net), primarily in the Dimock field in northern Pennsylvania.

In 2009, we produced and marketed approximately 321 barrels of crude oil/condensate/NGL per day in the North region at market responsive
prices.







Index to Financial Statements

Ancillary to our exploration, development and production operations, we operated a number of
gas gathering and transmission pipeline systems, made up of approximately 3,165 miles of pipeline with interconnects to three interstate transmission systems, seven local distribution companies and numerous end users as of the end of 2009. The
majority of our pipeline infrastructure in West Virginia is regulated by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) for interstate transportation service and the West Virginia Public Service Commission (WVPSC) for intrastate transportation
service. As such, the transportation rates and terms of service of our pipeline subsidiary, Cranberry Pipeline Corporation, are subject to the rules and regulations of the FERC and the WVPSC. Our natural gas gathering and transmission pipeline
systems enable us to connect new wells quickly and to transport natural gas from the wellhead directly to interstate pipelines, local distribution companies and industrial end users. Control of our gathering and transmission pipeline systems also
enables us to purchase, transport and sell natural gas produced by third parties. In addition, we can engage in development drilling without relying upon third parties to transport our natural gas and incur only the incremental costs of pipeline and
compressor additions to our system.

We have two natural gas storage fields located in West Virginia with a combined working
capacity of approximately 4 Bcf. We use these storage fields to take advantage of the seasonal variations in the demand for natural gas and the higher prices typically associated with winter natural gas sales, while maintaining production at a
nearly constant rate throughout the year. The storage fields also enable us to increase for shorter intervals of time the volume of natural gas that we can deliver by more than 40% above the volume that we could deliver solely from our production in
the North region. The pipeline systems and storage fields are fully integrated with our operations.

The principal markets for
our North region natural gas are in the northeastern and northwestern United States. We sell natural gas to industrial customers, local distribution companies and gas marketers both on and off our pipeline and gathering system. Approximately 61% of
our natural gas sales volume in the North region is sold at index-based prices under contracts with terms of one to three years. In addition, spot market sales are made at index-based prices under month-to-month contracts, while industrial and
utility sales generally are made under year-to-year contracts. Approximately one percent of North region production is sold on fixed price contracts that typically renew annually.

SOUTH REGION

Our development, exploitation, exploration and production
activities in the South region are primarily concentrated in east and south Texas, Oklahoma and north Louisiana. A regional office in Houston manages the operations. Principal producing intervals are in the Cotton Valley, Haynesville, Pettit and
James Lime formations in north Louisiana and east Texas, the Frio, Vicksburg and Wilcox formations in south Texas and the Chase, Morrow and Chester formations in the Anadarko Basin in Oklahoma at depths ranging from 1,300 to 16,970 feet, with an
average depth of approximately 8,750 feet.

Capital and exploration expenditures were $237.6 million for 2009, or 37% of our
total 2009 capital and exploration expenditures, compared to $1,022.3 million for 2008, or 68% of our total 2008 capital and exploration expenditures. This decrease in capital spending is primarily due to $604.0 million paid in 2008 for the east
Texas acquisition and a decrease of $176.9 million in total drilling. Of the total company year-over-year decrease in capital and exploration expenditures, approximately 93% was attributable to the decrease in the South region spending. For 2010, we
have budgeted approximately $181 million for capital and exploration expenditures in the region. Our 2010 South region drilling program will emphasize activity primarily in east Texas.

We had 1,753 wells (1,230.2 net) in the South region as of December 31, 2009, of which 1,342 wells are operated by us. Average
daily production in 2009 was 145.5 Mmcfe. Natural gas and crude oil/condensate/NGL production for 2009 was 48.8 Bcf and 720 Mbbls, respectively.







Index to Financial Statements

At December 31, 2009, we had 713.8 Bcfe of proved reserves (95% natural gas) in the
South region, which represented 35% of our total proved reserves. Developed and undeveloped reserves made up 474.7 Bcfe and 239.1 Bcfe of the total proved reserves for the South region, respectively.

In 2009, we drilled 81 wells (59.2 net) in the South region, of which 75 wells (55.3 net) were development and extension wells. In 2010, we
plan to drill 36 wells (24 net), primarily in east Texas, including the Minden and Angie fields.

Our principal markets for
the South region natural gas are in the industrialized Gulf Coast area and the Midwestern United States. We sell natural gas to intrastate pipelines, natural gas processors and marketing companies. Currently, approximately 89% of our natural gas
sales volumes in the South region are sold at index-based prices under contracts with terms of one year or greater. The remaining 11% of our sales volumes are sold at index-based prices under short-term agreements. The South region properties are
connected to various processing plants in Texas and Louisiana with multiple interstate and intrastate deliveries, affording us access to multiple markets.

In 2009, we produced and marketed approximately 1,966 barrels of crude oil/condensate/NGL per day in the South region at market responsive prices.

RISK MANAGEMENT

From time to time, when we believe that market conditions are favorable, we use certain derivative financial instruments to manage price risks associated with our production in all of our regions. While there are many different types of
derivatives available, in 2009 we employed natural gas and crude oil price collar and swap agreements for portions of our 2009 through 2010 production to attempt to manage price risk more effectively. In addition, we entered into natural gas basis
swaps covering a portion of anticipated 2012 production, which do not qualify for hedge accounting. In 2008 and 2007, we employed price collars and swaps to hedge our price exposure on our production. The collar arrangements are put and call options
used to establish floor and ceiling commodity prices for a fixed volume of production during a certain time period. They provide for payments to counterparties if the index price exceeds the ceiling and payments from the counterparties if the index
price falls below the floor. The price swaps call for payments to, or receipts from, counterparties based on whether the market price of natural gas or crude oil for the period is greater or less than the fixed price established for that period when
the swap is put in place.

For 2009, collars covered 48% of natural gas production and had a weighted-average floor of $9.40
per Mcf and a weighted-average ceiling of $12.39 per Mcf. For 2009, swaps covered 16% of natural gas production and 45% of crude oil production and had a weighted-average price of $12.18 per Mcf and $125.25 per Bbl, respectively.

As of December 31, 2009, we had the following outstanding commodity derivatives:

Our decision to hedge
2010 and 2012 production fits with our risk management strategy and allows us to lock in the benefit of high commodity prices on a portion of our anticipated production.

Internal Control

Our corporate reservoir engineers report to the Director of Engineering, who maintains oversight and compliance responsibility for the
internal reserve estimate process and provides oversight for the annual review of 100% our year-end reserves by our independent third party engineers, Miller and Lents, Ltd. The management of our corporate reservoir engineering group consists of
three petroleum/chemical engineers, with petroleum/chemical engineering degrees and between 10 and 27 years of industry experience, between 3 and 27 years of reservoir engineering/management experience, and between 0.5 and 11 years managing our
reserves. All are members of the Society of Petroleum Engineers.

Qualifications of Third Party Engineers

The technical person primarily responsible for review of our reserve estimates at Miller and Lents, Ltd. meets the requirements regarding
qualifications, independence, objectivity, and confidentiality set forth in the Standards Pertaining to the Estimating and Auditing of Oil and Gas Reserves Information promulgated by the Society of Petroleum Engineers. Miller and Lents, Ltd. is an
independent firm of petroleum engineers, geologists, geophysicists, and petro physicists; they do not own an interest in our properties and are not employed on a contingent fee basis.

For additional information about the risks inherent in our estimates of proved reserves, see “Risk Factors—Our proved reserves are
estimates. Any material inaccuracies in our reserve estimates or underlying assumptions could cause the quantities and net present value of our reserves to be overstated or understated” in Item 1A.

Proved Undeveloped Reserves

At December 31, 2009, we had 735.2 Bcfe of proved undeveloped reserves. During 2009, we converted 70.7 Bcfe of reserves from proved undeveloped to proved developed. An additional 9.6 Bcfe of reserves associated with seven wells drilled
in 2009 remain proved undeveloped as a result of the additional capital required to complete the wells. During 2009, total capital related to the development of proved undeveloped reserves was $102.6 million. We had a downward revision of total
proved reserves of 200.1 Bcfe primarily due to (i) downward revisions of 101.6 Bcfe due to lower 2009 oil and natural gas prices compared to 2008 and (ii) downward revisions of 120.4 Bcfe due to the removal of proved undeveloped reserves
scheduled for development beyond five years primarily due to the application of the SEC’s new oil and gas reserve calculation methodology, partially offset by 21.9 Bcfe of positive performance revisions. In accordance with the new rules we
priced proved oil and gas reserves using the 12-month average oil and gas index prices, calculated as the unweighted arithmetic average for the first day of the month price for each month within the 12-month period prior to the end of the reporting
period.

As of December 31, 2009 we have 15.9 Bcfe of proved undeveloped reserves, representing less than 1% of our total
proved reserves, that will require more than five years to develop due to coal mining operations or delays associated with an environment impact statement required to drill on federal land in Wyoming. An environmental impact study on federal land
represents 1.9 Bcfe and the following table summarizes the reserves impacted by mining operations in West Virginia.

Competition

Competition in our primary producing areas is intense. Price, contract terms and quality of service, including pipeline connection times
and distribution efficiencies, affect competition. We believe that in the North region our extensive acreage position, existing natural gas gathering and pipeline systems, services and equipment that we have secured for the upcoming year and storage
fields enhance our competitive position over other producers who do not have similar systems or facilities in place. We also actively compete against other companies with substantially larger financial and other resources.

OTHER BUSINESS MATTERS

Major
Customer

In 2009, two customers accounted for approximately 13% and 11%, respectively, of the Company’s total
sales. In 2008, one customer accounted for approximately 16% of the Company’s total sales. In 2007, no customer accounted for more than 10% of the Company’s total sales.

Seasonality

Demand for natural gas has historically been seasonal, with peak demand and typically higher prices occurring during the colder winter months.

Regulation of Oil and Natural Gas Exploration and Production

Natural Gas Marketing, Gathering and Transportation

Our natural gas sales prices nevertheless continue to be affected by intrastate and interstate gas transportation regulation,
because the prices we receive for our production are affected by the cost of transporting the gas to the consuming market. Through a series of comprehensive rulemakings, beginning with Order No. 436 in 1985 and continuing through Order
No. 636 in 1992 and Order No. 637 in 2000, the FERC has adopted regulatory changes that have significantly altered the transportation and marketing of natural gas. These changes were intended by the FERC to foster competition by, among
other things, transforming the role of interstate pipeline companies from wholesale marketers of gas to the primary role of gas transporters, and by increasing the transparency of pricing for pipeline services. The FERC has also established
regulations governing the relationship of pipelines with their marketing affiliates, which essentially require that designated employees







Index to Financial Statements

function independently of each other, and that certain information not be shared. The FERC has also implemented standards relating to the use of electronic data exchange by the pipelines to make
transportation information available on a timely basis and to enable transactions to occur on a purely electronic basis.

In
light of these statutory and regulatory changes, most pipelines have divested their gas sales functions to marketing affiliates, which operate separately from the transporter and in direct competition with all other merchants, and most pipelines
have also implemented the large-scale divestiture of their gas gathering facilities to affiliated or non-affiliated companies. Interstate pipelines thus now generally provide unbundled, open and nondiscriminatory transportation and
transportation-related services to producers, gas marketing companies, local distribution companies, industrial end users and other customers seeking such services. Sellers and buyers of gas have gained direct access to the particular pipeline
services they need, and are better able to conduct business with a larger number of counterparties. We believe these changes generally have improved our access to markets while, at the same time, substantially increasing competition in the natural
gas marketplace.

We cannot predict what new or different
regulations the FERC and other regulatory agencies may adopt, or what effect subsequent regulations may have on our activities. Similarly, it is impossible to predict what proposals, if any, that affect the oil and natural gas industry might
actually be enacted by Congress or the various state legislatures and what effect, if any, such proposals might have on us. Similarly, and despite the recent trend toward federal deregulation of the natural gas industry, whether or to what extent
that trend will continue, or what the ultimate effect will be on our sales of gas, cannot be predicted.

Federal Regulation of Petroleum

Our sales of oil and natural gas liquids are not regulated and are at market prices. The price received from the sale
of these products is affected by the cost of transporting the products to market. Much of that transportation is through interstate common carrier pipelines. Effective January 1, 1995, the FERC implemented regulations generally grandfathering
all previously approved interstate transportation rates and establishing an indexing system for those rates by which adjustments are made annually based on the rate of inflation, subject to certain conditions and limitations. These regulations may
tend to increase the cost of transporting oil and natural gas liquids by interstate pipeline, although the annual adjustments may result in decreased rates in a given year. Every five years, the FERC must examine the relationship between the annual
change in the applicable index and







Index to Financial Statements

the actual cost changes experienced in the oil pipeline industry. In March 2006, to implement this required five-year re-determination, the FERC established an upward adjustment in the index to
track oil pipeline cost changes and determined that the Producer Price Index for Finished Goods plus 1.3 percent should be the oil pricing index for the five-year period beginning July 1, 2006. Another FERC matter that may impact our
transportation costs relates to a recent policy that allows a pipeline structured as a master limited partnership or similar non-corporate entity to include in its rates a tax allowance with respect to income for which there is an “actual or
potential income tax liability,” to be determined on a case by case basis. Generally speaking, where the holder of a partnership unit interest is required to file a tax return that includes partnership income or loss, such unit-holder is
presumed to have an actual or potential income tax liability sufficient to support a tax allowance on that partnership income. We currently do not transport any of our oil or natural gas liquids on a pipeline structured as a master limited
partnership.

We are not able to predict with certainty the effect upon us of these periodic reviews by the FERC of the
pipeline index, or of the application of the FERC’s policy on income tax allowances.

Environmental Regulations

General.Our operations are subject to extensive federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the generation,
storage, handling, emission, transportation and discharge of materials into the environment. Permits are required for the operation of our various facilities. These permits can be revoked, modified or renewed by issuing authorities. Governmental
authorities enforce compliance with their regulations through fines, injunctions or both. Government regulations can increase the cost of planning, designing, installing and operating, and can affect the timing of installing and operating, oil and
gas facilities. Although we believe that compliance with environmental regulations will not have a material adverse effect on us, risks of substantial costs and liabilities related to environmental compliance issues are part of oil and gas
production operations. No assurance can be given that significant costs and liabilities will not be incurred. Also, it is possible that other developments, such as stricter environmental laws and regulations, and claims for damages to property or
persons resulting from oil and gas production could result in substantial costs and liabilities to us.

The transition zone
and shallow-water areas of the U.S. Gulf Coast are ecologically sensitive. Environmental issues have led to higher drilling costs and a more difficult and lengthy well permitting process. U.S. laws and regulations applicable to our operations
include those controlling the discharge of materials into the environment, requiring removal and cleanup of materials that may harm the environment, requiring consistency with applicable coastal zone management plans, or otherwise relating to the
protection of the environment.

Solid and Hazardous Waste.We currently own or lease, and have in the past owned
or leased, numerous properties that were used for the production of oil and gas for many years. Although operating and disposal practices that were standard in the industry at the time may have been utilized, it is possible that hydrocarbons or
other wastes may have been disposed of or released on or under the properties currently owned or leased by us. State and federal laws applicable to oil and gas wastes and properties have become more strict over time. Under these increasingly
stringent requirements, we could be required to remove or remediate previously disposed wastes (including wastes disposed or released by prior owners and operators) or clean up property contamination (including groundwater contamination by prior
owners or operators) or to perform plugging operations to prevent future contamination.

We generate some hazardous wastes
that are already subject to the Federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) and comparable state statutes. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has limited the disposal options for certain hazardous wastes. It is possible that certain
wastes currently exempt from treatment as hazardous wastes may in the future be designated as hazardous wastes under RCRA or other applicable statutes. We could, therefore, be subject to more rigorous and costly disposal requirements in the future
than we encounter today.







Index to Financial Statements

Superfund.The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and
Liability Act (CERCLA), also known as the “Superfund” law, imposes liability, without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct, on certain persons with respect to the release of hazardous substances into the environment.
These persons include the owner and operator of a site and any party that treated or disposed of or arranged for the treatment or disposal of hazardous substances found at a site. CERCLA also authorizes the EPA, and in some cases, private parties,
to undertake actions to clean up such hazardous substances, or to recover the costs of such actions from the responsible parties. In the course of business, we have used materials and generated wastes and will continue to use materials and generate
wastes that may fall within CERCLA’s definition of hazardous substances. We may also be an owner or operator of sites on which hazardous substances have been released. As a result, we may be responsible under CERCLA for all or part of the costs
to clean up sites where such substances have been released.

Oil Pollution Act.The Federal Oil Pollution Act of
1990 (OPA) and resulting regulations impose a variety of obligations on responsible parties related to the prevention of oil spills and liability for damages resulting from such spills in waters of the United States. The term “waters of the
United States” has been broadly defined to include inland water bodies, including wetlands and intermittent streams. The OPA assigns liability to each responsible party for oil removal costs and a variety of public and private damages. We
believe that we substantially comply with the Oil Pollution Act and related federal regulations.

Clean Water
Act.The Federal Water Pollution Control Act (Clean Water Act) and resulting regulations, which are primarily implemented through a system of permits, also govern the discharge of certain contaminants into waters of the United States.
Sanctions for failure to comply strictly with the Clean Water Act are generally resolved by payment of fines and correction of any identified deficiencies. However, regulatory agencies could require us to cease construction or operation of certain
facilities or to cease hauling wastewaters to facilities owned by others that are the source of water discharges. We believe that we substantially comply with the Clean Water Act and related federal and state regulations.

Clean Air Act.Our operations are subject to local, state and federal laws and regulations to control emissions from sources
of air pollution. Payment of fines and correction of any identified deficiencies generally resolve penalties for failure to comply strictly with air regulations or permits. Regulatory agencies could also require us to cease construction or operation
of certain facilities or to install additional controls on certain facilities that are air emission sources. We believe that we substantially comply with the emission standards under local, state, and federal laws and regulations.

Hydraulic Fracturing.







Index to Financial Statements

volume hydraulic fracturing of horizontal wells, baseline testing of nearby water wells, and restrictions on the type of additives that may be used in hydraulic fracturing operations. If these
types of conditions are adopted, we could be subject to increased costs and possibly limits on the productivity of certain wells.

Greenhouse Gas.In response to recent studies suggesting that emissions of carbon dioxide and certain other gases may be contributing to warming of the Earth’s atmosphere, the U.S. Congress is actively considering
legislation to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases from sources within the United States between 2012 and 2050. For example, the 110th session of Congress considered various bills that proposed a “cap and trade” scheme of regulation of
greenhouse gas emissions that generally would ban emissions above a defined reducing annual cap. Covered parties would be authorized to emit greenhouse emissions through the acquisition and subsequent surrender of emission allowances that may be
traded or acquired on the open market. In addition, at least 17 states have already taken legal measures to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases, primarily through the planned development of greenhouse gas emission inventories and/or regional
greenhouse gas cap and trade programs. Most of these cap and trade programs require either major sources of emissions, such as electric power plants, or major producers of fuels, such as refineries or gas processing plants, to acquire and surrender
emission allowances. The number of allowances available for purchase is reduced each year until the overall greenhouse gas emission reduction goal is achieved.

Depending on the particular program, we could be required to purchase and surrender allowances, either for greenhouse gas emissions resulting from our operations or from combustion of oil or natural gas
we produce. Although we would not be impacted to a greater degree than other similarly situated producers of oil and gas, a stringent greenhouse gas control program could have an adverse effect on our cost of doing business and could reduce demand
for the oil and gas we produce.

Also, in the wake of the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision in April 2007 in Massachusetts v.
Environmental Protection Agency, the EPA has begun to regulate carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions, even though Congress has yet to adopt new legislation specifically addressing emissions of greenhouse gases. In late 2009, the EPA
issued a “Mandatory Reporting of Greenhouse Gases” final rule, which establishes a new comprehensive regulation and reporting scheme for operators of stationary sources emitting certain levels of greenhouse gases, and a Final Rule finding
that certain current and projected levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere threaten public health and welfare of current and future generations. Please read “Item 1A. Risk Factors—Climate change and climate change legislation and
regulatory initiatives could result in increased operating costs and decreased demand for oil and gas.”
