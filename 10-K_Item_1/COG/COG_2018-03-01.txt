ITEMS 1 and 2. BUSINESS AND PROPERTIES

Cabot Oil & Gas Corporation is an independent oil and gas company engaged in the development, exploitation and exploration of oil and gas properties. Our assets are concentrated in areas with known hydrocarbon resources, which are conducive to multi-well, repeatable drilling programs. We operate in one segment, natural gas and oil development, exploitation, exploration and production, in the continental United States. We have offices located in Houston, Texas and Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

STRATEGY

Our objective is to enhance shareholder value over the long-term. We believe this is attainable by employing disciplined management of our balance sheet and our operations and remaining focused on our core asset base. Key components of our business strategy include:

•maintaining a conservative financial position and financial flexibility,

•providing returns-focused production and reserve growth within operating cash flows,

•continuing to return capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, and

•continuing to optimize drilling and completion efficiencies while leveraging our technical expertise to achieve cost reductions and improved efficiencies

These strategies will be achieved through further growth and development of our cornerstone assets in the Marcellus Shale in northeast Pennsylvania which represent96%percent of our equivalent proved reserves as of December 31, 2017.  While we remain focused on the growth and development of our Marcellus Shale asset, we also look for other development and exploration opportunities that will contribute to our overall strategy.

2018OUTLOOK

Our2018drilling program includes approximately$890.0 millionin capital expenditures and approximately$60.0 millionin expected contributions to our equity method investments. We expect to fund these expenditures with existing cash, operating cash flow and, if required, borrowings under our revolving credit facility. SeeNote 4of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further details regarding our equity method investments in Constitution Pipeline Company, LLC (Constitution) and Meade Pipeline Co LLC (Meade).

In2018, we plan allocate the majority of our capital to the Marcellus Shale, where we expect to drill85gross wells (85.0net) and complete95gross wells (95.0net). We allocate our planned program for capital expenditures based on market conditions, return expectations and availability of services and human resources. We will continue to assess the natural gas price environment along with our liquidity position and may increase or decrease our capital expenditures accordingly.

As a result of the expected in-service of various infrastructure projects, including the Atlantic Sunrise pipeline, during 2018, we increased our budgeted capital expenditures compared to2017. We plan to operate an average of approximately 3.0 rigs in the Marcellus Shale in2018.
