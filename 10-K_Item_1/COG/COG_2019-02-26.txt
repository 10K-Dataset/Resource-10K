ITEMS 1 and 2. BUSINESS AND PROPERTIES

Cabot Oil & Gas Corporation is an independent oil and gas company engaged in the development, exploitation, exploration and production of oil and gas properties. Our assets are concentrated in areas with known hydrocarbon resources, which are conducive to multi-well, repeatable drilling programs. We operate in one segment, natural gas and oil development, exploitation, exploration and production, in the continental United States. We have offices located in Houston, Texas and Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

STRATEGY

Our objective is to enhance shareholder value over the long-term. We believe this is attainable by employing disciplined, returns-focused management of our balance sheet and our operations. Key components of our business strategy include:

•delivering growth in production and reserves on a debt-adjusted per share basis;

•generating positive free cash flow from our operations and returning at least fifty percent of our free cash flow to shareholders annually through dividends and share repurchases;

•continuing to improve corporate returns on capital employed; and

•maintaining a strong balance sheet with significant financial flexibility.

These strategies will be achieved through further growth and development of our cornerstone asset in the Marcellus Shale in northeast Pennsylvania which represents substantially all of our equivalent proved reserves as of December 31,2018. While we remain focused on the growth and development of our Marcellus Shale asset, we also look for other development and exploration opportunities that will contribute to our overall strategy.

2019OUTLOOK

Our2019capital program is expected to be approximately$800.0 million. We expect to fund these expenditures with our operating cash flow and, if required, borrowings under our revolving credit facility.

In2019, our capital program will focus on the Marcellus Shale, where we expect to drill and complete 85 to 90 net wells and place 80 to 85 net wells on production. We allocate our planned program for capital expenditures based on market conditions, return expectations and availability of services and human resources. We will continue to assess the natural gas price environment and may increase or decrease our capital expenditures accordingly.
