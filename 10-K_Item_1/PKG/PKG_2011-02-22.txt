In 2010, we produced 1.5 million tons of kraft linerboard
    at our mills in Counce, Tennessee and Valdosta, Georgia, and
    0.9 million tons of semi-chemical corrugating medium at our
    mills in Tomahawk, Wisconsin and Filer City, Michigan. We
    currently lease the cutting rights to approximately
    88,000 acres of timberland located near our Counce and
    Valdosta mills. We also have supply agreements with third
    parties on approximately 281,000 acres of timberland.



Our corrugated products manufacturing plants produce a wide
    variety of corrugated packaging products, including conventional
    shipping containers used to protect and transport manufactured
    goods, multi-color boxes and displays with strong visual appeal
    that help to merchandise the packaged product in retail
    locations. In addition, we are a large producer of meat boxes
    and wax-coated boxes for the agricultural industry.



Industry
    Overview



According to the Fibre Box Association, the value of industry
    shipments of corrugated products was $25.0 billion in 2010.



The primary end-use markets for corrugated products are shown
    below (as reported in the most recent 2009 Fibre Box Association
    annual report):

Corrugated products plants tend to be located in close proximity
    to customers to minimize freight costs. The U.S. corrugated
    products industry consists of approximately 585 companies
    and 1,260 plants.



Containerboard, which includes both linerboard and corrugating
    medium, is the principal raw material used to manufacture
    corrugated products. Linerboard is used as the inner and outer
    facings, or liners, of





corrugated products. Corrugating medium is fluted and laminated
    to linerboard in corrugator plants to produce corrugated sheets.
    The sheets are subsequently printed, cut, folded and glued in
    corrugator plants or sheet plants to produce corrugated products.



Containerboard may be manufactured from both softwood and
    hardwood fibers, as well as from recycled fibers from used
    corrugated and waste from converting operations. Kraft
    linerboard is made predominantly from softwoods like pine.
    Semi-chemical corrugating medium is made from hardwoods such as
    oak. The finished paper product is wound into large rolls, which
    are slit to size as required and shipped to converters.



PCA
    Operations and Products



Containerboard
    Mills



Our two linerboard mills can manufacture a broad range of
    linerboard grades ranging from 26 lb. to 96 lb. Our two
    semi-chemical corrugating medium mills can manufacture grades
    ranging in weight from 20 lb. to 47 lb. Mill capacities
    described below are estimated based on expected mix of paper
    basis weights, and production can exceed estimated capacity if ahigher-than-estimatedmix of heavier grade paper is produced. All four of our mills
    have completed an extensive independent review process to become
    ISO 9002 certified. ISO 9002 is an international quality
    certification that verifies a facility maintains and follows
    stringent procedures for manufacturing, sales and customer
    service.



The following four paragraphs describe our containerboard
    mills’ annual practical maximum capacity, 2010 actual
    production and production capabilities.



Counce.Our Counce, Tennessee mill is one of
    the largest kraft linerboard mills in the United States. Its
    estimated production capacity, as reported to the American
    Forest and Paper Association (“AF&PA”), is
    approximately 1,007,000 tons per year. In 2010, we produced
    998,000 tons of kraft linerboard on two paper machines at
    Counce. The mill produces a broad range of basis weights from 26
    lb. to 90 lb. The mill also produces a variety of performance
    and specialty grades of linerboard.



Valdosta.Our Valdosta, Georgia mill is a
    kraft linerboard mill that has an estimated production capacity
    of approximately 495,000 tons per year, as reported to the
    AF&PA. In 2010, our single paper machine at Valdosta
    produced 482,000 tons of kraft linerboard. Valdosta produces a
    range of basis weights from 35 lb. to 96 lb.



Tomahawk.Our Tomahawk, Wisconsin mill is one
    of the largest semi-chemical corrugating medium mills in the
    United States with an estimated production capacity of 523,000
    tons per year, as reported to the AF&PA. In 2010, we
    produced 529,000 tons of semi-chemical corrugating medium on two
    paper machines at Tomahawk. The Tomahawk mill produces a broad
    range of basis weights from 23 lb. to 47 lb. and a variety of
    performance and specialty grades of corrugating medium.



Filer City.Our Filer City, Michigan mill is a
    semi-chemical corrugating medium mill with an estimated
    production capacity of 435,000 tons on three paper machines, as
    reported to the AF&PA. In 2010, we produced 434,000 tons of
    corrugating medium at Filer City. Filer City produces
    corrugating medium grades ranging in basis weight from 20 lb. to
    47 lb.



Corrugated
    Products



We operate 67 corrugated manufacturing operations, a technical
    and development center, six regional graphic design centers, a
    rotogravure printing operation and a complement of packaging
    supplies and distribution centers. Of the 67 manufacturing
    facilities, 39 operate as combining operations, commonly called
    corrugated plants, that manufacture corrugated sheets and
    finished corrugated containers. The remaining 28 manufacturing
    facilities, commonly called sheet plants, purchase combined
    sheets primarily produced at PCA’s combining operations and
    manufacture finished corrugated containers.



We have corrugated manufacturing operations in 26 states in
    the U.S., with no manufacturing facilities outside of the
    continental U.S. Each corrugated plant, for the most part,
    serves a market radius that typically averages 150 miles.
    Our sheet plants are generally located in close proximity to our
    larger corrugated plants, which enables us to offer additional
    services and converting capabilities such as small volume and
    quick turnaround items.





We produce a wide variety of products ranging from basic
    corrugated shipping containers to specialized packaging such as
    wax-coated boxes for the agriculture industry. We also have
    multi-color printing capabilities to make high-impact graphics
    boxes and displays that offer customers more attractive
    packaging.



Timberland



We currently lease the cutting rights to approximately
    88,000 acres of timberland located near our Counce,
    Tennessee and Valdosta, Georgia mills. Virtually all of the
    acres under cutting rights agreements are located within
    100 miles of these two mills, which results in lower wood
    transportation costs and provides a secure source of wood fiber.
    These leased cutting rights agreements have terms with about
    13 years remaining, on average.



During 1999 and 2000, PCA sold approximately 800,000 acres
    of timberland. We currently have in place supply agreements
    covering approximately 281,000 of the 800,000 acres sold.
    The majority of the acreage under supply agreement is located in
    close proximity to our Counce mill.



PCA participates in the Sustainable Forestry Initiative (SFI)
    and is certified under the SFI fiber sourcing standards. These
    standards are aimed at ensuring the long-term health and
    conservation of forestry resources. PCA is committed to sourcing
    wood fiber through environmentally, socially and economically
    sustainable practices and promoting resource and conservation
    stewardship ethics.



Sales and
    Marketing



Our corrugated products are sold through a direct sales and
    marketing organization. We have sales representatives and a
    sales manager at each corrugated manufacturing operation who
    serve local and regional accounts. We also have corporate
    account managers who serve large national accounts at multiple
    customer locations. Additionally, our graphic design centers
    maintain anon-sitededicated graphics sales force. In addition to direct sales and
    marketing personnel, we utilize new product development
    engineers and product graphics and design specialists. These
    individuals are located at both the corrugated plants and the
    graphic design centers. General marketing support is located at
    our corporate headquarters.



Our containerboard sales group is responsible for the sale of
    linerboard and corrugating medium to our corrugated plants, to
    other domestic customers and to the export market. This group
    handles order processing for all shipments of containerboard
    from our mills to our corrugated plants. These personnel also
    coordinate and execute all containerboard trade agreements with
    other containerboard manufacturers.



Distribution



Containerboard produced in our mills is shipped by rail or
    truck. Rail shipments represent about 50% to 55% of the tons
    shipped and the remaining 45% to 50% is comprised of truck
    shipments. Our individual mills do not own or maintain outside
    warehousing facilities.



Our corrugated products are delivered by truck due to our large
    number of customers and their demand for timely service. Our
    converting operations typically service customers within a
    150 miles radius. We use third-party warehouses for
    short-term storage of corrugated products.



Customers



PCA’s corrugated products group sells to over 9,200
    customers in over 16,700 locations. About two-thirds of our
    corrugated products customers are regional and local accounts,
    which are broadly diversified across industries and geographic
    locations. The remaining one-third of our customer base consists
    primarily of national accounts, or those customers with a
    national presence. These customers typically purchase corrugated
    products from several of our box plants throughout the United
    States.





Major Raw
    Materials Used



Fiber supply.Fiber is the single largest cost
    in the manufacture of containerboard. PCA consumes both wood
    fiber and recycled fiber in its containerboard mills. We have no
    100% recycled mills, or those mills whose fiber consumption
    consists solely of recycled fiber. To reduce our fiber costs, we
    have invested in processes and equipment to ensure a high degree
    of fiber flexibility. Our mill system has the capability to
    shift a portion of its fiber consumption between softwood,
    hardwood and recycled sources. All of our mills, other than our
    Valdosta mill, can utilize some recycled fiber in their
    containerboard production. Our ability to use various types of
    virgin and recycled fiber helps mitigate the impact of changes
    in the prices of various fibers. Our corrugated manufacturing
    operations generate recycled fiber as a by-product from the
    manufacturing process, which is sold to our mills directly or
    through trade agreements. During 2010, our containerboard mills
    consumed approximately 638,000 tons of recycled fiber, and our
    corrugated converting operations generated approximately 200,000
    tons of recycled fiber. As a result, PCA was a net recycled
    fiber buyer of 438,000 tons, or 18% of PCA’s total fiber
    requirements.



Energy supply.Energy at the mills is obtained
    through purchased electricity or through various fuels, which
    are converted to steam or electricityon-site.Fuel sources include coal, natural gas, oil, internally produced
    and purchased bark and by-products of the containerboard
    manufacturing and pulping process, including black liquor. These
    fuels are burned in boilers to produce steam. Steam turbine
    generators are used to produce electricity. To reduce our mill
    energy cost, we have invested in processes and equipment to
    ensure a high level of purchased fuel flexibility. In recent
    history, natural gas and fuel oil have exhibited higher costs
    per thermal unit and more price volatility than coal and bark.
    During 2010, 11.3 million MMBTU’s (million
    BTU’s), or approximately 70% of our mills’ purchased
    fuel needs, were from purchased bark and coal, historically our
    two lowest cost purchased fuels. For the same period, our mills
    consumed about 3.6 million MMBTU’s of natural gas (22%
    of the mills’ total purchased fuels) and 0.3 million
    MMBTU’s of oil (2% of the mills’ total purchased
    fuels).



Each of PCA’s corrugated plants has a boiler that produces
    steam which is used by the corrugator. The majority of these
    boilers burn natural gas, although some also have the ability to
    burn fuel oil. During 2010, PCA’s corrugated products
    plants consumed approximately 2.0 million MMBTU’s of
    natural gas.



The following table shows PCA’s purchased fuel consumption
    by fuel type for 2010:

Approximately 42% of the electricity consumed by our four mills
    is generatedon-site.Our
    mills purchase approximately 9,300,000 CkWh (hundred kilowatt
    hours) annually, or the equivalent of 3.2 million
    MMBTU’s. PCA’s corrugated products plants purchase
    about 2,276,000 CkWh annually, or the equivalent of
    0.8 million MMBTU’s.





In October 2009, PCA announced that it will undertake major
    energy optimization projects at the Counce and Valdosta
    linerboard mills, which are expected to significantly reduce
    fuel and electricity purchases at these mills and nearly
    eliminate fossil fuel consumption at these facilities. The
    projects include a new recovery boiler and turbine generator at
    the Valdosta mill and a rebuild and upgrade of two existing
    recovery boilers and a new turbine generator at the Counce mill.
    The total capital expenditures for these projects are expected
    to be about $295 million to be spent over two years, and
    the projects are expected to be completed in the fourth quarter
    of 2011.



Competition



According to industry sources, corrugated products are produced
    by about 585 U.S. companies operating approximately 1,260
    plants. Most corrugated products are manufactured to the
    customer’s specifications. Corrugated producers generally
    sell within a150-mileradius of their plants and compete with other corrugated
    producers in their local market. In fact, the Fibre Box
    Association tracks industry data by 47 distinct market regions.



The larger, multi-plant integrated companies may also solicit
    larger, multi-plant customers who purchase for all of their
    facilities on a consolidated basis. These customers are often
    referred to as national or corporate accounts.



Corrugated products businesses seek to differentiate themselves
    through pricing, quality, service, design and product
    innovation. We compete for both local and national account
    business, and we compete against producers of other types of
    packaging products. On a national level, our primary competitors
    include International Paper Company, Georgia-Pacific (owned by
    Koch Industries, Inc.), Smurfit-Stone Container Corporation and
    Temple-Inland Inc. However, with our strategic focus on local
    and regional accounts, we also compete with the smaller,
    independent converters.



Our principal competitors with respect to sales of our
    containerboard produced but not consumed at our own corrugated
    products plants are a number of large, diversified paper
    companies, including International Paper Company,
    Georgia-Pacific, Smurfit-Stone Container Corporation and
    Temple-Inland Inc., as well as other regional manufacturers.
    Containerboard is generally considered a commodity-type product
    and can be purchased from numerous suppliers.



Employees



As of December 31, 2010, we had approximately
    8,100 employees. Approximately 2,500 of these employees
    were salaried and approximately 5,600 were hourly. Approximately
    75% of our hourly employees are represented by unions. The
    majority of our unionized employees are represented by the
    United Steel Workers (USW), the International Brotherhood of
    Teamsters (IBT) and the International Association of Machinists
    (IAM).



Based on an agreement reached with the USW in August 2008, the
    existing labor agreements at our containerboard mills covering
    USW-represented employees (88% of mill hourly workforce) were
    extended five years. With this extension, the USW contracts at
    our mills are currently set to expire between September 2013 and
    June 2015. Agreements with other union mill employees (12% of
    mill hourly workforce) expire between June 2012 and October
    2014. Based on an agreement reached with the USW in April 2009,
    the labor agreement at 25 corrugated plants covering USW
    represented employees was extended up to five years. Contracts
    for unionized corrugated products plant employees expire between
    March 2011 and October 2015. We are currently in
    negotiations to renew or extend any union contracts that have
    recently expired or are expiring in the near future.



During 2010, we experienced no work stoppages and have
    experienced no instances of significant work stoppages in the
    five years prior to 2010. We believe we have satisfactory
    relations with our employees.





Environmental
    Matters



Compliance with environmental requirements is a significant
    factor in our business operations. We commit substantial
    resources to maintaining environmental compliance and managing
    environmental risk. We are subject to, and must comply with, a
    variety of federal, state and local environmental laws,
    particularly those relating to air and water quality, waste
    disposal and the cleanup of contaminated soil and groundwater.
    The most significant of these laws affecting us are:



1. Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA)



2. Clean Water Act (CWA)



3. Clean Air Act (CAA)



4. The Emergency Planning and CommunityRight-to-Know-Act(EPCRA)



5. Toxic Substance Control Act (TSCA)



6. Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA)



We believe that we are currently in material compliance with
    these and all applicable environmental rules and regulations.
    Because environmental regulations are constantly evolving, we
    have incurred, and will continue to incur, costs to maintain
    compliance with these and other environmental laws. For the
    years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, we spent
    approximately $24.6 million, $26.4 million and
    $23.5 million, respectively to comply with the requirements
    of these and other environmental laws. Additionally, total
    capital costs for environmental matters were $1.1 million,
    $0.4 million and $3.5 million for 2010, 2009 and 2008,
    respectively. We currently estimate 2011 environmental capital
    expenditures will be $3.3 million. We work diligently to
    anticipate and budget for the impact of applicable environmental
    regulations, and do not currently expect that future
    environmental compliance obligations will materially affect our
    business or financial condition.



As is the case with any industrial operation, we have in the
    past incurred costs associated with the remediation of soil or
    groundwater contamination. From 1994 through 2010, remediation
    costs at our mills and converting plants totaled approximately
    $3.2 million. We do not believe that any ongoing remedial
    projects are material in nature. As of December 31, 2010,
    we maintained an environmental reserve of $9.7 million,
    which includes funds relating toon-sitelandfill and surface impoundments as well as ongoing and
    anticipated remedial projects. Of the $9.7 million reserve,
    $4.9 million is reserved for our landfill obligations,
    which are accounted for in accordance with Accounting Standards
    Codification (“ASC”) 410, “Asset Retirement and
    Environmental Obligations.” We believe these reserves are
    adequate.



We could also incur environmental liabilities as a result of
    claims by third parties for civil damages, including liability
    for personal injury or property damage, arising from releases of
    hazardous substances or contamination. We are not aware of any
    material claims of this type currently pending against us.



On April 12, 1999, Pactiv Corporation, formerly known as
    Tenneco Packaging Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Tenneco
    Inc., sold its containerboard and corrugated products business
    to PCA, an entity formed by Madison Dearborn Partners, LLC, a
    private equity investment firm. As a part of the April 12,
    1999 transaction, Pactiv agreed to retain all liability for all
    former facilities and all sites associated with pre-closing
    offsite waste disposal. Pactiv also retained environmental
    liability for a closed landfill located near the Filer City mill.



As of the date of this filing, we believe that it is not
    reasonably possible that future environmental expenditures above
    the $9.7 million accrued as of December 31, 2010 will
    have a material impact on our financial condition and results of
    operations.



While legislation regarding the regulation of greenhouse gas
    emissions has been proposed at the federal level, it is
    uncertain whether such legislation will be passed and, if so,
    what the breadth and scope of such legislation will be. The
    result of the regulation of greenhouse gas emissions could be an
    increase in our future environmental compliance costs, through
    caps, taxes or additional capital expenditures to modify
    facilities,





which may be material. However, climate change legislation and
    the resulting future energy policy could also provide us with
    opportunities if the use of renewable energy is encouraged. We
    currently generate a significant portion of our power
    requirements for our mills using bark, black liquor and biomass
    as fuel, which are derived from renewable resources. Our energy
    optimization projects at the Counce and Valdosta linerboard
    mills are expected to nearly eliminate the use of fossil fuels
    at those facilities by the end of 2011, while providing more
    efficient power generation at those facilities. While we believe
    we are well-positioned to take advantage of any renewable energy
    incentives, it is uncertain what the ultimate costs and
    opportunities of any climate change legislation will be and how
    our business and industry will be affected.
