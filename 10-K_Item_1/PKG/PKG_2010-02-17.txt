General



Packaging Corporation of America (we, us, our, “PCA”
    or the “Company”) is the fifth largest producer of
    containerboard and corrugated products in the United States in
    terms of production capacity. During 2009, we produced
    2,258,000 million tons of containerboard at our mills, of
    which about 80% was consumed in PCA’s corrugated products
    manufacturing plants, 11% was sold to domestic customers and 9%
    was sold in the export market. Our corrugated products
    manufacturing plants sold about 28.9 billion square feet
    (BSF) of corrugated products. Our net sales to third parties
    totaled $2.15 billion in 2009.

In 2009, we produced 1.4 million tons of kraft linerboard
    at our mills in Counce, Tennessee and Valdosta, Georgia, and
    0.9 million tons of semi-chemical corrugating medium at our
    mills in Tomahawk, Wisconsin and Filer City, Michigan. We
    currently lease the cutting rights to approximately
    91,000 acres of timberland located near our Counce and
    Valdosta mills. We also have supply agreements with third
    parties on approximately 352,000 acres of timberland.



Our corrugated products manufacturing plants produce a wide
    variety of corrugated packaging products, including conventional
    shipping containers used to protect and transport manufactured
    goods, multi-color boxes and displays with strong visual appeal
    that help to merchandise the packaged product in retail
    locations. In addition, we are a large producer of meat boxes
    and wax-coated boxes for the agricultural industry.



Industry
    Overview



According to the Fibre Box Association, the value of industry
    shipments of corrugated products was $24 billion in 2009.



The primary end-use markets for corrugated products are shown
    below (as reported in the most recent 2008 Fibre Box Association
    annual report):

Corrugated products plants tend to be located in close proximity
    to customers to minimize freight costs. The U.S. corrugated
    products industry consists of approximately 625 companies
    and 1,340 plants.



Containerboard, which includes both linerboard and corrugating
    medium, is the principal raw material used to manufacture
    corrugated products. Linerboard is used as the inner and outer
    facings, or liners, of corrugated products. Corrugating medium
    is fluted and laminated to linerboard in corrugator plants to
    produce





corrugated sheets. The sheets are subsequently printed, cut,
    folded and glued in corrugator plants or sheet plants to produce
    corrugated products.



Containerboard may be manufactured from both softwood and
    hardwood fibers, as well as from recycled fibers from used
    corrugated and waste from converting operations. Kraft
    linerboard is made predominantly from softwoods like pine.
    Semi-chemical corrugating medium is made from hardwoods such as
    oak. The finished paper product is wound into large rolls, which
    are slit to size as required and shipped to converters.



PCA
    Operations and Products



Our two linerboard mills can manufacture a broad range of
    linerboard grades ranging from 26 lb. to 96 lb. Our two
    semi-chemical corrugating medium mills can manufacture grades
    ranging in weight from 20 lb. to 47 lb. Mill capacities
    described below are estimated based on expected mix of paper
    basis weights, and production can exceed estimated capacity if a
    higher-than-estimated mix of heavier grade paper is produced.
    All four of our mills have completed an extensive independent
    review process to become ISO 9002 certified. ISO 9002 is an
    international quality certification that verifies a facility
    maintains and follows stringent procedures for manufacturing,
    sales and customer service.



The following four paragraphs describe our containerboard
    mills’ annual practical maximum capacity, 2009 actual
    production and production capabilities.



Counce.Our Counce, Tennessee mill is one of
    the largest kraft linerboard mills in the United States. Its
    estimated production capacity, as reported to the American
    Forest and Paper Association (“AF&PA”), is
    approximately 1,007,000 tons per year. In 2009, we produced
    902,000 tons of kraft linerboard on two paper machines at
    Counce. The mill produces a broad range of basis weights from 26
    lb. to 90 lb. The mill also produces a variety of performance
    and specialty grades of linerboard.



Valdosta.Our Valdosta, Georgia mill is a
    kraft linerboard mill that has an estimated production capacity
    of approximately 474,000 tons per year, as reported to the
    AF&PA. In 2009, our single paper machine at Valdosta
    produced 465,000 tons of kraft linerboard. Valdosta produces a
    range of basis weights from 35 lb. to 96 lb.



Tomahawk.Our Tomahawk, Wisconsin mill is one
    of the largest semi-chemical corrugating medium mills in the
    United States with an estimated production capacity of 581,000
    tons per year on three paper machines, as reported to the
    AF&PA. In April 2005, we completed the indefinite closure
    of our number three paper machine at Tomahawk and currently
    operate the remaining two paper machines which have a combined
    production capacity of 516,000 tons. In 2009, we produced
    526,000 tons of semi-chemical corrugating medium on two paper
    machines at Tomahawk. The Tomahawk mill produces a broad range
    of basis weights from 23 lb. to 47 lb. and a variety of
    performance and specialty grades of corrugating medium.



Filer City.Our Filer City, Michigan mill is a
    semi-chemical corrugating medium mill with an estimated
    production capacity of 413,000 tons on three paper machines, as
    reported to the AF&PA. In 2009, we produced 365,000 tons of
    corrugating medium at Filer City. Filer City produces
    corrugating medium grades ranging in basis weight from 20 lb. to
    47 lb.



We operate 68 corrugated manufacturing operations, a technical
    and development center, six regional graphic design centers, a
    rotogravure printing operation and a complement of packaging
    supplies and distribution centers. Of the 68 manufacturing
    facilities, 40 operate as combining operations, commonly called
    corrugated plants, that manufacture corrugated sheets and
    finished corrugated containers. The remaining 28 manufacturing
    facilities, commonly called sheet plants, purchase combined
    sheets primarily produced at PCA’s combining operations and
    manufacture finished corrugated containers.



We have corrugated manufacturing operations in 26 states in
    the U.S., with no manufacturing facilities outside of the
    continental U.S. Each corrugated plant, for the most part,
    serves a market radius that typically averages 150 miles.
    Our sheet plants are generally located in close proximity to our
    larger corrugated plants, which enables us to offer additional
    services and converting capabilities such as small volume and
    quick turnaround items.





We produce a wide variety of products ranging from basic
    corrugated shipping containers to specialized packaging such as
    wax-coated boxes for the agriculture industry. We also have
    multi-color printing capabilities to make high-impact graphics
    boxes and displays that offer customers more attractive
    packaging.



Timberland



We currently lease the cutting rights to approximately
    91,000 acres of timberland located near our Counce and
    Valdosta mills. Virtually all of the acres under cutting rights
    agreements are located within 100 miles of these two mills,
    which results in lower wood transportation costs and provides a
    secure source of wood fiber. These leased cutting rights
    agreements have terms with about 15 years remaining, on
    average.



During 1999 and 2000, PCA sold approximately 800,000 acres
    of timberland. We currently have in place supply agreements
    covering approximately 352,000 of the 800,000 acres sold.
    The majority of the acreage under supply agreement is located in
    close proximity to our Counce mill. We currently hold an
    approximate 29% equity ownership interest in approximately
    51,000 acres owned by Southern Timber Venture, LLC (STV).
    This acreage is located primarily in southern Georgia and
    northern Florida, near our Valdosta, Georgia mill, and includes
    both timberlands and higher beneficial use properties.



Our Forest Management Assistance Program provides professional
    forestry assistance to private timberland owners to improve
    harvest yields and to optimize their harvest schedule. We have
    managed the regeneration of approximately 125,000 acres by
    supplying pine seedlings. In exchange for our expertise, we are
    given the right of first refusal over timber sales from those
    lands. These private lands include about 115,000 acres of
    timberland.



PCA also participates in the Sustainable Forestry Initiative.
    This initiative is aimed at ensuring the long-term health and
    conservation of America’s forestry resources. Activities
    include limiting tree harvest sizes, replanting harvest acreage,
    participating in flora and fauna research and protecting water
    streams.



Sales and
    Marketing



Our corrugated products are sold through a direct sales and
    marketing organization. We have sales representatives and a
    sales manager at each corrugated manufacturing operation who
    serve local and regional accounts. We also have corporate
    account managers who serve large national accounts at multiple
    customer locations. Additionally, our graphic design centers
    maintain anon-sitededicated graphics sales force. In addition to direct sales and
    marketing personnel, we utilize new product development
    engineers and product graphics and design specialists. These
    individuals are located at both the corrugated plants and the
    graphic design centers. General marketing support is located at
    our corporate headquarters.



Our containerboard sales group is responsible for the sale of
    linerboard and corrugating medium to our corrugated plants, to
    other domestic customers and to the export market. This group
    handles order processing for all shipments of containerboard
    from our mills to our corrugated plants. These personnel also
    coordinate and execute all containerboard trade agreements with
    other containerboard manufacturers.



Distribution



Containerboard produced in our mills is shipped by rail or
    truck. Rail shipments represent about 50% of the tons shipped
    and the remaining 50% is comprised of truck shipments. Our
    individual mills do not own or maintain outside warehousing
    facilities.



Our corrugated products are delivered by truck due to our large
    number of customers and their demand for timely service. Our
    converting operations typically service customers within a
    150 miles radius. We use third-party warehouses for
    short-term storage of corrugated products.



Customers



PCA’s corrugated products group sells to over 9,600
    customers in over 17,500 locations. About two-thirds of our
    corrugated products customers are regional and local accounts,
    which are broadly diversified across





industries and geographic locations. The remaining one-third of
    our customer base consists primarily of national accounts, or
    those customers with a national presence. These customers
    typically purchase corrugated products from several of our box
    plants throughout the United States.



Major Raw
    Materials Used



Fiber supply.Fiber is the single largest cost
    in the manufacture of containerboard. PCA consumes both wood
    fiber and recycled fiber in its containerboard mills. We have no
    100% recycled mills, or those mills whose fiber consumption
    consists solely of recycled fiber. To reduce our fiber costs, we
    have invested in processes and equipment to ensure a high degree
    of fiber flexibility. Our mills have the capability to shift a
    portion of their fiber consumption between softwood, hardwood
    and recycled sources. All of our mills, other than our Valdosta
    mill, can utilize some recycled fiber in their containerboard
    production. Our ability to use various types of virgin and
    recycled fiber helps mitigate the impact of changes in the
    prices of various fibers. Our corrugated manufacturing
    operations generate recycled fiber as a by-product from the
    manufacturing process, which is sold to our mills directly or
    through trade agreements. During 2009, with low recycled fiber
    prices, our containerboard mills consumed approximately 636,000
    tons of recycled fiber, and our corrugated converting operations
    generated approximately 189,000 tons of recycled fiber. As a
    result, PCA was a net recycled fiber buyer of 447,000 tons, or
    20% of PCA’s total fiber requirements, up from 17% in 2008.



Energy supply.Energy at the mills is obtained
    through purchased electricity or through various fuels, which
    are converted to steam or electricityon-site.Fuel sources include coal, natural gas, oil, internally produced
    and purchased bark and by-products of the containerboard
    manufacturing and pulping process, including black liquor. These
    fuels are burned in boilers to produce steam. Steam turbine
    generators are used to produce electricity. To reduce our mill
    energy cost, we have invested in processes and equipment to
    ensure a high level of purchased fuel flexibility. In recent
    history, natural gas and fuel oil have exhibited higher costs
    per thermal unit and more price volatility than coal and bark.
    During 2009, 10.7 million MMBTU’s (million
    BTU’s), or approximately 75% of our mills’ purchased
    fuel needs, were from purchased bark and coal, historically our
    two lowest cost purchased fuels. For the same period, our mills
    consumed about 2.2 million MMBTU’s of natural gas (15%
    of the mills’ total purchased fuels) and 0.8 million
    MMBTU’s of oil (6% of the mills’ total purchased
    fuels). Our two kraft linerboard mills at Counce and Valdosta
    generate approximately two-thirds of their fuel requirements
    from their own by-products.



PCA’s corrugated plants each have a boiler that produces
    steam which is used by the corrugator. The majority of these
    boilers burn natural gas, although some also have the ability to
    burn fuel oil. During 2009, PCA’s corrugated products
    plants consumed approximately 2.0 million MMBTU’s of
    natural gas.



The following table shows PCA’s purchased fuel consumption
    by fuel type for 2009:

Approximately 40% of the electricity consumed by our four mills
    is generatedon-site.Our
    mills purchase approximately 8,907,000 CkWh (hundred kilowatt
    hours) annually, or the equivalent of 3.0 million
    MMBTU’s. PCA’s corrugated products plants purchase
    about 2,196,000 CkWh annually, or the equivalent of
    0.7 million MMBTU’s.



In October 2009, PCA announced that it will undertake major
    energy optimization projects at the Counce and Valdosta
    linerboard mills, which are expected to significantly reduce
    fuel and electricity purchases at these mills and nearly
    eliminate fossil fuel consumption at these facilities. The
    projects include a new recovery boiler and turbine generator at
    the Valdosta mill and a rebuild and upgrade of two existing
    recovery boilers and a new turbine generator at the Counce mill.
    The total capital expenditures for these projects are expected
    to be about $295 million to be spent over two years, and
    the projects are expected to be completed in the fourth quarter
    of 2011.



Competition



According to industry sources, corrugated products are produced
    by about 625 U.S. companies operating approximately 1,340
    plants. Most corrugated products are manufactured to the
    customer’s specifications. Corrugated producers generally
    sell within a150-mileradius of their plants and compete with other corrugated
    producers in their local market. In fact, the Fibre Box
    Association tracks industry data by 47 distinct market regions.



The larger, multi-plant integrated companies may also solicit
    larger, multi-plant customers who purchase for all of their
    facilities on a consolidated basis. These customers are often
    referred to as national or corporate accounts.



Corrugated products businesses seek to differentiate themselves
    through pricing, quality, service, design and product
    innovation. We compete for both local and national account
    business, and we compete against producers of other types of
    packaging products. On a national level, our primary competitors
    include International Paper Company, Georgia-Pacific (owned by
    Koch Industries, Inc.), Smurfit-Stone Container Corporation and
    Temple-Inland Inc. However, with our strategic focus on local
    and regional accounts, we also compete with the smaller,
    independent converters.



Our principal competitors with respect to sales of our
    containerboard produced but not consumed at our own corrugated
    products plants are a number of large, diversified paper
    companies, including International Paper Company,
    Georgia-Pacific, Smurfit-Stone Container Corporation and
    Temple-Inland Inc., as well as other regional manufacturers.
    Containerboard is generally considered a commodity-type product
    and can be purchased from numerous suppliers.



Employees



As of December 31, 2009, we had approximately
    8,000 employees. Approximately 2,400 of these employees
    were salaried and approximately 5,600 were hourly. Approximately
    75% of our hourly employees are represented by unions. The
    majority of our unionized employees are represented by the
    United Steel Workers (USW), the International Brotherhood of
    Teamsters (IBT) and the International Association of Machinists
    (IAM).



Based on an agreement reached with the USW in August 2008, the
    existing labor agreements at our containerboard mills covering
    USW-represented employees (89% of mill hourly workforce) were
    extended five years. With this extension, the USW contracts at
    our mills are currently set to expire between September 2013 and
    June 2015. Agreements with other union mill employees (11% of
    mill hourly workforce) expire between June 2012 and October
    2014. Based on an agreement reached with the USW in April 2009,
    the labor agreement at 25 corrugated plants covering USW
    represented employees was extended up to five years. Contracts
    for unionized corrugated products plant employees expire between
    March 2010 and December 2014. We are currently in negotiations
    to renew or extend any union contracts that have recently
    expired or are expiring in the near future.



During 2009, we experienced no work stoppages and have
    experienced no instances of significant work stoppages in the
    five years prior to 2009. We believe we have satisfactory
    relations with our employees.





Environmental
    Matters



Compliance with environmental requirements is a significant
    factor in our business operations. We commit substantial
    resources to maintaining environmental compliance and managing
    environmental risk. We are subject to, and must comply with, a
    variety of federal, state and local environmental laws,
    particularly those relating to air and water quality, waste
    disposal and the cleanup of contaminated soil and groundwater.
    The most significant of these laws affecting us are:



1. Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA)



2. Clean Water Act (CWA)



3. Clean Air Act (CAA)



4. The Emergency Planning and CommunityRight-to-Know-Act(EPCRA)



5. Toxic Substance Control Act (TSCA)



6. Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA)



We believe that we are currently in material compliance with
    these and all applicable environmental rules and regulations.
    Because environmental regulations are constantly evolving, we
    have incurred, and will continue to incur, costs to maintain
    compliance with these and other environmental laws. For the year
    ended December 31, 2009, we spent approximately
    $26.4 million to comply with the requirements of these and
    other environmental laws. For the years ended December 31,
    2008 and 2007, the costs of environmental compliance were
    approximately $23.5 million and $19.4 million,
    respectively. We work diligently to anticipate and budget for
    the impact of applicable environmental regulations, and do not
    currently expect that future environmental compliance
    obligations will materially affect our business or financial
    condition. Total capital costs for environmental matters were
    $0.4 million for 2009. We currently estimate 2010
    environmental capital expenditures will be $1.2 million.



As is the case with any industrial operation, we have in the
    past incurred costs associated with the remediation of soil or
    groundwater contamination. From 1994 through 2009, remediation
    costs at our mills and converting plants totaled approximately
    $3.2 million. We do not believe that any ongoing remedial
    projects are material in nature. As of December 31, 2009,
    we maintained an environmental reserve of $9.1 million,
    which includes funds relating toon-sitelandfill and surface impoundments as well as ongoing and
    anticipated remedial projects. Of the $9.1 million reserve,
    $4.5 million is reserved for our landfill obligations,
    which are accounted for in accordance with Accounting Standards
    Codification (“ASC”) 410, “Asset Retirement and
    Environmental Obligations.” We believe these reserves are
    adequate.



We could also incur environmental liabilities as a result of
    claims by third parties for civil damages, including liability
    for personal injury or property damage, arising from releases of
    hazardous substances or contamination. We are not aware of any
    material claims of this type currently pending against us.



On April 12, 1999, Pactiv Corporation, formerly known as
    Tenneco Packaging Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Tenneco
    Inc., sold its containerboard and corrugated products business
    to PCA, an entity formed by Madison Dearborn Partners, LLC, a
    private equity investment firm. As a part of the April 12,
    1999 transaction, Pactiv agreed to retain all liability for all
    former facilities and all sites associated with pre-closing
    offsite waste disposal. Pactiv also retained environmental
    liability for a closed landfill located near the Filer City mill.



As of this filing, we believe that it is not reasonably possible
    that future environmental expenditures above the
    $9.1 million accrued as of December 31, 2009 will have
    a material impact on our financial condition and results of
    operations.



While legislation regarding the regulation of greenhouse gas
    emissions has been proposed at the federal level, it is
    uncertain whether such legislation will be passed and, if so,
    what the breadth and scope of such legislation will be. The
    result of the regulation of greenhouse gas emissions could be an
    increase in our future environmental compliance costs, through
    caps, taxes or additional capital expenditures to modify
    facilities, which may be material. However, climate change
    legislation and the resulting future energy policy could also





provide us with opportunities if the use of renewable energy is
    encouraged. We currently generate a significant portion of our
    power requirements for our mills using bark, black liquor and
    biomass as fuel, which are derived from renewable resources. Our
    energy optimization projects at the Counce and Valdosta
    linerboard mills are expected to nearly eliminate the use of
    fossil fuels at those facilities by the end of 2011, while
    providing more efficient power generation at those facilities.
    While we believe we are well-positioned to take advantage of any
    renewable energy incentives, it is uncertain what the ultimate
    costs and opportunities of any climate change legislation will
    be and how our business and industry will be affected.
