CBOB

, or “conventional blendstock for
oxygenate blending,” is conventional gasoline blendstock intended for blending
with oxygenates downstream of the refinery where it was produced. CBOB becomes
conventional gasoline after blending with oxygenates.

RBOB

is a base
unfinished reformulated gasoline mixture known as “reformulated gasoline
blendstock for oxygenate blending.” It is a specially produced reformulated
gasoline blendstock intended for blending with oxygenates downstream of the
refinery where it was produced to produce finished gasoline that meets or
exceeds U.S. emissions performance requirements for federal reformulated
gasoline.



SEGMENTS

Our business is organized into three reportable segments: refining, ethanol, and retail. Prior to
the second quarter of 2009, we had two reportable segments: refining and retail. As a result of
our acquisition of several ethanol plants during the second quarter of 2009 (as discussed in Note 2
of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements), we now present ethanol as a third reportable
segment. The financial information about our segments in Note 20 of Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements is incorporated herein by reference.

Corpus Christi East and West Refineries

. Our Corpus Christi East and West Refineries are
located on the Texas Gulf Coast along the Corpus Christi Ship Channel. The West Refinery
specializes in processing primarily sour crude oil and resid into premium products such as RBOB.
The East Refinery processes heavy, high-sulfur crude oil into conventional gasoline, diesel, jet
fuel, asphalt, aromatics, and other light products. The East and West Refineries are substantially
integrated allowing for the transfer of various feedstocks and blending components between the two
refineries and the sharing of resources. The refineries typically receive and deliver feedstocks
and products by tanker and barge via deepwater docking facilities along the Corpus Christi Ship
Channel. Three truck racks with a total of 16 bays



service local markets for gasoline, diesel, jet fuels, liquefied petroleum gases, and asphalt.
Finished products are distributed across the refinery docks into ships or barges, and are
transported via third-party pipelines to the Colonial, Explorer, Valley, and other major pipelines.

Port Arthur Refinery

. Our Port Arthur Refinery is located on the Texas Gulf Coast approximately 90
miles east of Houston. The refinery processes primarily heavy sour crude oils and other feedstocks
into conventional and premium gasoline and RBOB, as well as diesel, jet fuel, petrochemicals,
petroleum coke, and sulfur. The refinery receives crude oil over marine docks and through crude
oil pipelines, and has access to the Sunoco and Oiltanking terminals at Nederland, Texas. Finished
products are distributed into the Colonial, Explorer, and TEPPCO pipelines, across the refinery
docks into ships or barges, and through a local truck rack.

St. Charles Refinery

. Our St. Charles Refinery is located approximately 15 miles from New Orleans
along the Mississippi River. The refinery processes sour crude oils and other feedstocks into
gasoline, distillates, and other light products. The refinery receives crude oil over five marine
docks and has access to the Louisiana Offshore Oil Port where it can receive crude oil through a
24-inch pipeline. Finished products can be shipped over these docks or through the Colonial
pipeline network for distribution to the eastern United States.

Texas City Refinery

. Our Texas City Refinery is located southeast of Houston on the Texas City
Ship Channel. The refinery processes primarily heavy sour crude oils into a wide slate of
products. The refinery receives and delivers its feedstocks and products by tanker and barge via
deepwater docking facilities along the Texas City Ship Channel and uses the Colonial, Explorer, and
TEPPCO pipelines for distribution of its products.

Houston Refinery

. Our Houston Refinery is located on the Houston Ship Channel. It processes a mix
of crude oils and low-sulfur resid into reformulated gasoline and distillates. The refinery
receives its feedstocks via tanker at deepwater docking facilities along the Houston Ship Channel
and interconnecting pipelines with the Texas City Refinery. It delivers its products through major
refined-product pipelines, including the Colonial, Explorer, Orion, and TEPPCO pipelines.

Three Rivers Refinery

. Our Three Rivers Refinery is located in South Texas between Corpus Christi
and San Antonio. It processes primarily heavy sweet and medium sour crude oils into gasoline,
distillates, and aromatics. The refinery has access to crude oil from foreign sources delivered to
the Texas Gulf Coast at Corpus Christi as well as crude oil from domestic sources through
third-party pipelines. A 70-mile pipeline with capacity of 120,000 BPD transports crude oil via
connections to the Three Rivers Refinery from Corpus Christi. The refinery distributes its refined
products primarily through pipelines owned by NuStar Energy L.P.

Aruba Refinery

. Our Aruba Refinery is located on the island of Aruba in the Caribbean Sea. The
refinery has been idle since July 2009. When in operation, it processes primarily heavy sour crude
oil and produces primarily intermediate feedstocks and finished distillate products. Significant
amounts of the refinery’s intermediate feedstock production are transported and further processed
in our other refineries in the Gulf Coast, West Coast, and Northeast regions. The refinery
receives crude oil by ship at its two deepwater marine docks, which can berth ultra-large crude
carriers. The refinery’s products are delivered by ship primarily into markets in the United
States, the Caribbean, Europe, and South America.



West Coast

The following table presents the percentages of principal charges and yields (on a combined basis)
for the two refineries in this region for the year ended December 31, 2009. Total throughput

. Our Benicia Refinery is located northeast of San Francisco on the Carquinez
Straits of San Francisco Bay. It processes sour crude oils into premium products, primarily CARBOB
gasoline. (CARBOB is a reformulated gasoline mixture that meets the specifications of the
California Air Resources Board when blended with ethanol.) The refinery receives crude oil
supplies via a deepwater dock that can berth large crude oil carriers and a 20-inch crude oil
pipeline connected to a southern California crude oil delivery system. Most of the refinery’s
products are distributed via the Kinder Morgan pipeline system in California.

Wilmington Refinery

. Our Wilmington Refinery is located near Los Angeles, California. The
refinery processes a blend of lower-cost heavy and high-sulfur crude oils. The refinery can
produce all of its gasoline as CARBOB gasoline and produces both ultra-low-sulfur diesel and CARB
diesel. The refinery is connected by pipeline to marine terminals and associated dock facilities
that can move and store crude oil and other feedstocks. Refined products are distributed via the
Kinder Morgan pipeline system and various third-party terminals in southern California, Nevada, and
Arizona.

light products, including regular and premium gasoline, diesel, jet fuels, and petrochemicals.
Crude oil is supplied to the refinery via the Capline pipeline and can also be received, along with
other feedstocks, via barge. The refinery’s products are distributed via truck racks at our three
product terminals, barges, and a pipeline network, including one pipeline directly to the Memphis
airport.

McKee Refinery

. Our McKee Refinery is located in the Texas Panhandle. It processes primarily
sweet crude oils and produces conventional gasoline, RBOB, low-sulfur diesel, jet fuels, and
asphalt. The refinery has access to crude oil from Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas, and Colorado through
third-party pipelines. The refinery also has access at Wichita Falls, Texas to third-party
pipelines that transport crude oil from the Texas Gulf Coast and West Texas to the Mid-Continent
region. The refinery distributes its products primarily via NuStar Energy L.P.’s pipelines to
markets in Texas, New Mexico, Arizona, Colorado, and Oklahoma.

Quebec City Refinery

. Our Quebec City Refinery is located in Lévis, Canada (near Quebec
City). It processes sweet crude oils and lower-quality, sweet acidic crude oils into conventional
gasoline, low-sulfur diesel, jet fuels, heating oil, and propane. The refinery receives crude oil
by ship at its deepwater dock on the St. Lawrence River. We charter large ice-strengthened,
double-hulled crude oil tankers that can navigate the St. Lawrence River year-round. The refinery
transports its products to its primary terminals in Quebec and Ontario primarily by train, and also
uses ships and trucks extensively throughout eastern Canada.

Paulsboro Refinery

. Our Paulsboro Refinery is located in Paulsboro, New Jersey, approximately 15
miles south of Philadelphia on the Delaware River. The refinery processes primarily sour crude
oils into a wide slate of products including gasoline, distillates, lube oil basestocks, asphalt,
lube extracts, petroleum coke, sulfur, fuel oil, propane, and butane. Feedstocks and refined
products are typically transported by tanker and barge via refinery-owned dock facilities along the
Delaware River, Buckeye’s product distribution system (into western Pennsylvania and Ohio), a
local truck rack owned by NuStar Energy L.P., railcars, and the Colonial pipeline, which allows
products to be sold into the New York Harbor market.



Feedstock Supply

Approximately 55 percent of our current crude oil feedstock requirements are purchased through term
contracts while the remaining requirements are generally purchased on the spot market. Our term
supply agreements include arrangements to purchase feedstocks at market-related prices directly or
indirectly from various foreign national oil companies (including feedstocks originating in the
Middle East, Africa, Asia, Mexico, and South America) as well as international and domestic oil
companies. The term contracts generally permit the parties to amend the contracts (or terminate
them), effective as of the next scheduled renewal date, by giving the other party proper notice
within a prescribed period of time (

e.g

., 60 days, 6 months) before expiration of the current term.
The majority of the crude oil purchased under Valero’s term contracts is purchased at the
producer’s official stated price (

i.e

., the “market” price established by the seller for all
purchasers) and not at a negotiated price specific to Valero. About 75 percent of our crude oil
feedstocks under term supply agreements are imported from foreign sources and about 25 percent are
domestic. In the event we become unable to purchase crude oil from any one of these sources, we
believe that adequate alternative supplies of crude oil would be available.

The U.S. network of crude oil pipelines and terminals allows us to acquire crude oil from producing
leases, domestic crude oil trading centers, and ships delivering cargoes of foreign and domestic
crude oil. Our Quebec City and Aruba Refineries rely on foreign crude oil that is delivered to the
refineries’ dock facilities by ship. We use the futures market to manage a portion of the price
risk inherent in purchasing crude oil in advance of the delivery date and holding inventories of
crude oils and refined products.

Refining Segment Sales

Our refining segment includes sales of refined products in both the wholesale rack and bulk
markets. These sales include refined products that are manufactured in our refining operations as
well as refined products purchased or received on exchange from third parties. Most of our
refineries have access to deepwater transportation facilities and interconnect with common-carrier
pipeline systems, allowing us to sell products in most major geographic regions of the United
States and eastern Canada. No customer accounted for more than 10 percent of our total operating
revenues in 2009.

Wholesale Marketing

We market branded and unbranded transportation fuels on a wholesale basis in 44 states through an
extensive rack marketing network. The principal purchasers of our transportation fuels from
terminal truck racks are wholesalers, distributors, retailers, and truck-delivered end users
throughout the United States.

The majority of our rack volume is sold through unbranded channels. The remainder is sold to
distributors and dealers that are members of the Valero-brand family that operate approximately
4,000 branded sites. These sites are independently owned and are supplied by us under multi-year
contracts. For wholesale branded sites, we promote our Valero

®

brand throughout the
United States. In addition, we offer the Beacon

®

brand in California and the
Shamrock

®

brand elsewhere in the United States.

Bulk Sales and Trading

We sell a significant portion of our gasoline and distillate production through bulk sales channels
in domestic and international markets. Our bulk sales are made to various oil companies and
traders as well as certain bulk end-users such as railroads, airlines, and utilities. Our bulk
sales are transported primarily by pipeline, barges, and tankers to major tank farms and trading
hubs.



We also enter into refined product exchange and purchase agreements. These agreements help to
minimize transportation costs, optimize refinery utilization, balance refined product availability,
broaden geographic distribution, and provide access to markets not connected to our refined product
pipeline systems. Exchange agreements provide for the delivery of refined products by us to
unaffiliated companies at our and third parties’ terminals in exchange for delivery of a similar
amount of refined products to us by these unaffiliated companies at specified locations. Purchase
agreements involve our purchase of refined products from third parties with delivery occurring at
specified locations.

Specialty Products

We also sell a variety of other products produced at our refineries, which we refer to collectively
as “Specialty Products.” Our Specialty Products include asphalt, lube oils, natural gas liquids
(NGLs), petroleum coke, petrochemicals, and sulfur.



ETHANOL

We own ten ethanol plants in the Midwest with a combined ethanol production capacity of about 1.1
billion gallons per year. Our ethanol plants are dry mill facilities


that process corn
to produce ethanol and distillers grains.


We source our corn supply from local farmers
and commercial elevators. Our facilities receive corn by rail and by truck. We publish a corn bid
on our website that local farmers and cooperative dealers can use to facilitate corn supply
transactions.

After processing, the ethanol is held in storage tanks at our plant sites pending loading to truck
and rail car transportation. We sell our ethanol (i) to large customers – primarily refiners and
gasoline blenders – under term and spot contracts, and (ii) in bulk markets such as New York,
Chicago, Dallas, and the West Coast. We also use our ethanol for our own needs in blending
gasoline. We ship our dry distillers grains (DDG) by truck or rail primarily to animal feed
customers in the U.S. and Mexico, with some sales into the Far East. We also sell modified
distillers grains locally at our plant sites.

The following table presents the locations of our ethanol plants, their approximate ethanol and dry
distillers grains production capacities, and their approximate corn processing capacities.

We acquired our Iowa, Minnesota, Nebraska, and South Dakota ethanol plants in the second
quarter of 2009. Ethanol production from these seven plants in the fourth quarter of 2009 averaged
2.2 million gallons per day. We acquired our Indiana and Ohio plants in January 2010. The Indiana
and Ohio plants were idle when acquired; however, we expect production at these plants to begin by
the end of the first quarter of 2010. We acquired our Wisconsin plant in early February 2010.
This plant was producing ethanol at the time of our acquisition, and ethanol production has
continued under our ownership.

For additional information regarding these acquisitions, see Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements.


Ethanol is commercially produced using
either the wet mill or dry mill process. Wet milling involves separating the
grain kernel into its component parts (germ, fiber, protein, and starch) prior
to fermentation. Our ethanol plants utilize the dry mill process, in which the
entire grain kernel is ground into flour. The starch in the flour is converted
to ethanol during the fermentation process, creating carbon dioxide and
distillers grains.


In the fermentation process, nearly all of
the starch in the grain is converted into ethanol and carbon dioxide, while the
remaining nutrients (proteins, fats, minerals, and vitamins) undergo a
concentration to yield modified distillers grains, or, after further drying,
dried distillers grains. Distillers grains generally are an economical partial
replacement for corn, soybean, and dicalcium phosphate in livestock, swine, and
poultry feeds.



RETAIL

Our retail segment operations include the following:

•

sales of transportation fuels at retail stores and unattended self-service
cardlocks,

•

sales of convenience store merchandise and services in retail stores, and

•

sales of home heating oil to residential customers.

We are one of the largest independent retailers of refined products in the central and southwest
United States and eastern Canada. Our retail operations are segregated geographically into two
groups: Retail – U.S. and Retail – Canada.

Retail – U.S.

Sales in Retail – U.S. represent sales of transportation fuels and convenience store merchandise
and services through our company-operated retail sites. For the year ended December 31, 2009,
total sales of refined products through Retail – U.S.’s retail sites averaged approximately
118,600 BPD. In addition to transportation fuels, our company-operated convenience stores sell
snacks, candy, beer, fast foods, cigarettes, and fountain drinks. Our stores also offer services
such as ATM access, car wash facilities, money orders, lottery tickets, and video rentals. On
December 31, 2009, we had 991 company-operated sites in Retail – U.S. (of which 79% were owned and
21% were leased). Our company-operated stores are operated primarily under the brand name Corner
Store

®

. Transportation fuels sold in our Retail – U.S. stores are sold primarily under
the Valero

®

brand.

Retail – Canada

Sales in Retail – Canada include the following:

•

sales of refined products and convenience store merchandise through our
company-operated retail sites and cardlocks,

•

sales of refined products through sites owned by independent dealers and jobbers,
and

•

sales of home heating oil to residential customers.

Retail – Canada includes retail operations in eastern Canada where we are a major supplier of
refined products serving Quebec, Ontario, and the Atlantic Provinces of Newfoundland, Nova Scotia,
New Brunswick, and Prince Edward Island. For the year ended December 31, 2009, total retail sales
of refined products through Retail – Canada averaged approximately 75,200 BPD. Transportation
fuels are sold under the Ultramar

®

brand through a network of 824 outlets throughout
eastern Canada. On December 31, 2009, we owned or leased 396 retail stores in Retail – Canada and
distributed gasoline to 428 dealers and independent jobbers. In addition, Retail – Canada
operates 83 cardlocks, which are card- or key-activated, self-service, unattended stations that
allow commercial, trucking, and governmental fleets to buy transportation fuel 24 hours a day.
Retail – Canada operations also include a large home heating oil business that provides home
heating oil to approximately 142,000 households in eastern Canada. Our home heating oil business
tends to be seasonal to the extent of increased demand for home heating oil during the winter.



RISK FACTORS

Our financial results are affected by volatile refining margins and global economic activity.

Our financial results are primarily affected by the relationship, or margin, between refined
product prices and the prices for crude oil and other feedstocks. Our cost to acquire feedstocks
and the price at which we can ultimately sell refined products depend upon several factors beyond
our control, including regional and global supply of and demand for crude oil, gasoline, diesel,
and other feedstocks and refined products. These in turn depend on, among other things, the
availability and quantity of imports, the production levels of domestic and foreign suppliers,
levels of refined product inventories, productivity and growth (or the lack thereof) of U.S. and
global economies, U.S. relationships with foreign governments, political affairs, and the extent of
governmental regulation. Historically, refining margins have been volatile, and we believe they
will continue to be volatile in the future.

Continued economic turmoil and hostilities, including the threat of future terrorist attacks, could
affect the economies of the United States and other countries. Lower levels of economic activity
during periods of recession could result in declines in energy consumption, including declines in
the demand for and consumption of our refined products, which could cause our revenues and margins
to decline and limit our future growth prospects.

Refining margins are also significantly impacted by additional refinery conversion capacity through
the expansion of existing refineries or the construction of new refineries. Worldwide refining
capacity expansions may result in refining production capability far exceeding refined product
demand, which would have a significant adverse effect on refining margins.

A significant portion of our profitability is derived from the ability to purchase and process
crude oil feedstocks that historically have been cheaper than benchmark crude oils, such as West
Texas Intermediate crude oil. These crude oil feedstock differentials vary significantly depending
on overall economic conditions and trends and conditions within the markets for crude oil and
refined products, and they could decline in the future, which would have a negative impact on our
earnings.

Uncertainty and illiquidity in credit and capital markets can impair our ability to obtain credit
and financing on acceptable terms, and can adversely affect the financial strength of our business
partners.

Our ability to obtain credit and capital depends in large measure on capital markets and liquidity
factors over which we exert no control. Our ability to access credit and capital markets may be
restricted at a time when we would like, or need, to access those markets, which could have an
impact on our flexibility to react to changing economic and business conditions. In addition, the
cost and availability of debt and equity financing may be adversely impacted by unstable or
illiquid market conditions. Protracted uncertainty and illiquidity in these markets also could
have an adverse impact on our lenders, commodity hedging counterparties, or our customers, causing
them to fail to meet their obligations to us. In addition, decreased returns on pension fund
assets may also materially increase our pension funding requirements.

We currently maintain investment-grade ratings by Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services (S&P), Moody’s
Investors Service (Moody’s), and Fitch Ratings (Fitch) on our senior unsecured debt. (Ratings from
credit agencies are not recommendations to buy, sell, or hold our securities. Each rating should
be evaluated independently of any other rating.) We cannot provide assurance that any of our
current ratings will remain in effect for any given period of time or that a rating will not be
lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency if, in its judgment, circumstances so warrant.
Specifically, if S&P, Moody’s, or Fitch were to downgrade our long-term rating, particularly below
investment grade, our borrowing costs would increase, which could adversely affect our ability to
attract potential investors and our



funding sources could decrease. In addition, we may not be able to obtain favorable credit terms
from our suppliers or they may require us to provide collateral, letters of credit, or other forms
of security which would increase our operating costs. As a result, a downgrade in our credit
ratings could have a material adverse impact on our future operations and financial position.

From time to time, our cash needs may exceed our internally generated cash flow, and our business
could be materially and adversely affected if we were unable to obtain necessary funds from
financing activities. From time to time, we may need to supplement our cash generation with
proceeds from financing activities. We have existing revolving credit facilities, committed letter
of credit facilities, and an accounts receivable sales facility to provide us with available
financing to meet our ongoing cash needs. Uncertainty and illiquidity continues to exist in the
financial markets that may materially impact the ability of the participating financial
institutions to fund their commitments to us under our various financing facilities. In light of
these uncertainties and the volatile current market environment, we can make no assurances that we
will be able to obtain the full amount of the funds available under our financing facilities to
satisfy our cash requirements. Our failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our
operations and financial position.

Compliance with and changes in environmental laws, including proposed climate change laws and
regulations, could adversely affect our performance.

The principal environmental risks associated with our operations are emissions into the air and
releases into the soil, surface water, or groundwater. Our operations are subject to extensive
federal, state, and local environmental laws and regulations, including those relating to the
discharge of materials into the environment, waste management, pollution prevention measures,
greenhouse gas emissions, and characteristics and composition of gasoline and diesel fuels. If we
violate or fail to comply with these laws and regulations, we could be fined or otherwise
sanctioned. Because environmental laws and regulations are becoming more stringent and new
environmental laws and regulations are continuously being enacted or proposed, such as those
relating to greenhouse gas emissions and climate change (

e.g.

, California’s AB-32 “Global Warming
Solutions Act,” the U.S. House of Representatives’ “American Clean Energy and Security Act of
2009,” the U.S. Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works’ “Clean Energy Jobs and American
Power Act of 2009,” initiatives and rulemaking following the EPA’s 2009 “Endangerment and Cause or
Contribute Findings for Greenhouse Gases Under Section 202(a) of the Clean Air Act”), the level of
expenditures required for environmental matters could increase in the future. Future legislative
action and regulatory initiatives could result in changes to operating permits, additional remedial
actions, material changes in operations, increased capital expenditures and operating costs,
increased costs of the goods we sell, and decreased demand for our products that cannot be assessed
with certainty at this time.

Some of the proposed federal “cap-and-trade” legislation would require businesses that emit greenhouse
gases to buy emission credits from the government, other businesses, or through an auction process.
In addition, refiners would be obligated to purchase emission credits associated with the
transportation fuels (gasoline, diesel, and jet fuel) sold and consumed in the United States. As a
result of such a program, we would be required to purchase emission credits for greenhouse gas
emissions resulting from our own operations as well as from the fuels we sell. Although it is not
possible at this time to predict the final form of a cap-and-trade bill (or whether such a bill
will be passed by Congress), any new federal restrictions on greenhouse gas emissions – including
a cap-and-trade program – could result in material increased compliance costs, additional
operating restrictions for our business, and an increase in the cost of the products we produce,
which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, and
liquidity.



Disruption of our ability to obtain crude oil could adversely affect our operations

.

A significant portion of our feedstock requirements is satisfied through supplies originating in
the Middle East, Africa, Asia, North America, and South America. We are, therefore, subject to the
political, geographic, and economic risks attendant to doing business with suppliers located in,
and supplies originating from, those areas. If one or more of our supply contracts were
terminated, or if political events disrupt our traditional crude oil supply, we believe that
adequate alternative supplies of crude oil would be available, but it is possible that we would be
unable to find alternative sources of supply. If we are unable to obtain adequate crude oil
volumes or are able to obtain such volumes only at unfavorable prices, our results of operations
could be materially adversely affected, including reduced sales volumes of refined products or
reduced margins as a result of higher crude oil costs.

In addition, the U.S. government can prevent or restrict us from doing business in or with foreign
countries. These restrictions, and those of foreign governments, could limit our ability to gain
access to business opportunities in various countries. Actions by both the United States and
foreign countries have affected our operations in the past and will continue to do so in the
future.

Competitors that produce their own supply of feedstocks, have more extensive retail outlets, or
have greater financial resources may have a competitive advantage

.

The refining and marketing industry is highly competitive with respect to both feedstock supply and
refined product markets. We compete with many companies for available supplies of crude oil and
other feedstocks and for outlets for our refined products. We do not produce any of our crude oil
feedstocks. Many of our competitors, however, obtain a significant portion of their feedstocks
from company-owned production and some have more extensive retail outlets than we have.
Competitors that have their own production or extensive retail outlets (and greater brand-name
recognition) are at times able to offset losses from refining operations with profits from
producing or retailing operations, and may be better positioned to withstand periods of depressed
refining margins or feedstock shortages.

Some of our competitors also have materially greater financial and other resources than we have.
Such competitors have a greater ability to bear the economic risks inherent in all phases of our
industry. In addition, we compete with other industries that provide alternative means to satisfy
the energy and fuel requirements of our industrial, commercial, and individual consumers.

A significant interruption in one or more of our refineries could adversely affect our business.

Our refineries are our principal operating assets. As a result, our operations could be subject to
significant interruption if one or more of our refineries were to experience a major accident or
mechanical failure, encounter work stoppages relating to organized labor issues, be damaged by
severe weather or other natural or man-made disaster, such as an act of terrorism, or otherwise be
forced to shut down. If any refinery were to experience an interruption in operations, earnings
from the refinery could be materially adversely affected (to the extent not recoverable through
insurance) because of lost production and repair costs. A significant interruption in one or more
of our refineries could also lead to increased volatility in prices for crude oil feedstocks and
refined products, and could increase instability in the financial and insurance markets, making it
more difficult for us to access capital and to obtain insurance coverage that we consider adequate.

We maintain insurance against many, but not all, potential losses arising from operating hazards.
Failure by one or more insurers to honor its coverage commitments for an insured event could
materially and adversely affect our future cash flows, operating results, and financial condition

.

Our refining and marketing operations are subject to various hazards common to the industry,
including explosions, fires, toxic emissions, maritime hazards, and natural catastrophes. As
protection against these



hazards, we maintain insurance coverage against some, but not all, such potential losses and
liabilities. We may not be able to maintain or obtain insurance of the type and amount we desire
at reasonable rates. As a result of market conditions, premiums and deductibles for certain of our
insurance policies have increased substantially, and could escalate further. In some instances,
certain insurance could become unavailable or available only for reduced amounts of coverage. For
example, coverage for hurricane damage is very limited, and coverage for terrorism risks includes
very broad exclusions. If we were to incur a significant liability for which we were not fully
insured, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial position.

Our insurance program includes a number of insurance carriers. Disruptions in the U.S. financial
markets have resulted in the deterioration in the financial condition of many financial
institutions, including insurance companies. We are not currently aware of any information that
would indicate that any of our insurers is unlikely to perform in the event of a covered incident.
However, in light of this uncertainty and the volatile current market environment, we can make no
assurances that we will be able to obtain the full amount of our insurance coverage for insured
events.

Compliance with and changes in tax laws could adversely affect our performance.

We are subject to extensive tax liabilities, including United States, state, and foreign income
taxes and transactional taxes such as excise, sales/use, payroll, franchise, withholding, and ad
valorem taxes. New tax laws and regulations and changes in existing tax laws and regulations are
continuously being enacted or proposed that could result in increased expenditures for tax
liabilities in the future. Many of these liabilities are subject to periodic audits by the
respective taxing authority. Subsequent changes to our tax liabilities as a result of these audits
may subject us to interest and penalties.

Capital Expenditures Attributable to Compliance with Environmental Regulations

. In 2009, our
capital expenditures attributable to compliance with environmental regulations were approximately
$390 million, and are currently estimated to be approximately $795 million for 2010 and
approximately $225 million for 2011. The estimates for 2010 and 2011 do not include amounts
related to capital investments at our facilities that management has deemed to be strategic
investments rather than expenditures relating to environmental regulatory compliance.
