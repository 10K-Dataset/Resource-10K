ITEMS 1. BUSINESS





OVERVIEW



We are a Fortune 500 company based in San Antonio, Texas. Our corporate offices are at One Valero Way, San Antonio, Texas, 78249, and our telephone number is (210) 345-2000. We were incorporated in Delaware in 1981 under the name Valero Refining and Marketing Company. We changed our name to Valero Energy Corporation on August 1, 1997. Our common stock trades on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) under the trading symbol “VLO.” OnJanuary 31, 2019, we had 10,261 employees.



We own15petroleum refineries located in the United States (U.S.), Canada, and the United Kingdom (U.K.) with a combined throughput capacity of approximately3.1 millionbarrels per day (BPD). Our refineries produce conventional gasolines, premium gasolines, gasoline meeting the specifications of the California Air Resources Board (CARB), diesel, low-sulfur diesel, ultra-low-sulfur diesel, CARB diesel, other distillates, jet fuel, asphalt, petrochemicals, lubricants, and other refined petroleum products. We sell our refined petroleum products in both the wholesale rack and bulk markets, and approximately7,000outlets carry our brand names in the U.S., Canada, the U.K., and Ireland. We also own14ethanol plants in the Mid-Continent region of the U.S. with a combined production capacity of approximately1.73 billiongallons per year. We sell our ethanol in the wholesale bulk market.



On January 10, 2019, we completed our acquisition of all of the outstanding publicly held common units of Valero Energy Partners LP (VLP) as described inNote 2of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which is incorporated herein by reference.

VALERO’S OPERATIONS



As of December 31, 2018, we hadthreereportable segments as follows:



•Refining segmentincludes our refining operations, the associated marketing activities, and certain logistics assets, which are not owned by VLP, that support our refining operations;



•Ethanol segmentincludes our ethanol operations, the associated marketing activities, and logistics assets that support our ethanol operations; and



•VLP segmentincludes the operations of VLP, which is a limited partnership that owns logistics assets that provide transportation and terminaling services to our refining segment.



Financial information about these segments is presented inNote 17of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which is incorporated herein by reference.



Effective January 1, 2019, we revised our reportable segments to align with certain changes in how our chief operating decision maker manages and allocates resources to our business. Accordingly, we created a new reportable segment — renewable diesel — because of the growing importance of renewable fuels in the market and the growth of our investments in renewable fuels production. The renewable diesel segment includes the operations of Diamond Green Diesel Holdings LLC (DGD), our consolidated joint venture as discussed inNote 12of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The operations of DGD have been included in the refining segment throughDecember 31, 2018, but were transferred from that segment on January 1, 2019. Also effective January 1, 2019, we no longer have a VLP segment, and we include the operations of VLP in our refining segment. This change was made because of the Merger Transaction with VLP, as defined and discussed inNote 2of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, and the resulting change in how we manage VLP’s operations. We no longer manage VLP as a business but as logistics assets that support the operations of our refining segment.

Feedstock Supply

Our crude oil feedstocks are purchased through a combination of term and spot contracts. Our term supply agreements are at market-related prices and are purchased directly or indirectly from various national oil companies as well as international and U.S. oil companies. The contracts generally permit the parties to amend the contracts (or terminate them), effective as of the next scheduled renewal date, by giving the other party proper notice within a prescribed period of time (e.g., 60 days, 6 months) before expiration of the









current term. The majority of the crude oil purchased under our term contracts is purchased at the producer’s official stated price (i.e., the “market” price established by the seller for all purchasers) and not at a negotiated price specific to us.



Marketing

Overview

We sell refined petroleum products in both the wholesale rack and bulk markets. These sales include refined petroleum products that are manufactured in our refining operations, as well as refined petroleum products purchased or received on exchange from third parties. Most of our refineries have access to marine transportation facilities and interconnect with common-carrier pipeline systems, allowing us to sell products in the U.S., Canada, the U.K., and other countries.



Wholesale Rack Sales

We sell our gasoline and distillate products, as well as other products, such as asphalt, lube oils, and natural gas liquids (NGLs), on a wholesale basis through an extensive rack marketing network. The principal purchasers of our refined petroleum products from terminal truck racks are wholesalers, distributors, retailers, and truck-delivered end users throughout the U.S., Canada, the U.K., Ireland, and Latin America through our operations in Peru and Mexico.



The majority of our rack volume is sold through unbranded channels. The remainder is sold to distributors and dealers that are members of the Valero-brand family that operate5,335branded sites in the U.S.,907branded sites in the U.K. and Ireland, and792branded sites in Canada as ofDecember 31, 2018. These sites are independently owned and are supplied by us under multi-year contracts. For branded sites, products are sold under the Valero®, Beacon®, Diamond Shamrock®,and Shamrock®brands in the U.S., the Texaco®brand in the U.K. and Ireland, and the Ultramar®brand in Canada.



Bulk Sales

We also sell our gasoline and distillate products, as well as other products, such as asphalt, petrochemicals, and NGLs, through bulk sales channels in the U.S. and international markets. Our bulk sales are made to various oil companies, traders, and bulk end-users, such as railroads, airlines, and utilities. Our bulk sales are transported primarily by pipeline, barges, and tankers to major tank farms and trading hubs.



We also enter into refined petroleum product exchange and purchase agreements. These agreements help minimize transportation costs, optimize refinery utilization, balance refined petroleum product availability, broaden geographic distribution, and provide access to markets not connected to our refined product pipeline systems. Exchange agreements provide for the delivery of refined petroleum products by us to unaffiliated companies at our and third-parties’ terminals in exchange for delivery of a similar amount of refined petroleum products to us by these unaffiliated companies at specified locations. Purchase agreements involve our purchase of refined petroleum products from third parties with delivery occurring at specified locations.

Logistics

We own logistics assets (crude oil pipelines, refined petroleum product pipelines, terminals, tanks, marine docks, truck rack bays, and other assets) that support our refining operations, and these assets are not owned by VLP. See discussion of the VLP segment on page10.











ETHANOL

We own14ethanol plants with a combined ethanol production capacity of1.73 billiongallons per year. Our ethanol plants are dry mill facilities(a)that process corn to produce ethanol, distillers grains, and corn oil(b).We source our corn supply from local farmers and commercial elevators. Our facilities receive corn primarily by rail and truck. We publish on our website a corn bid for local farmers and cooperative dealers to facilitate corn supply transactions.



We sell our ethanol primarily to refiners and gasoline blenders under term and spot contracts in bulk markets such as New York, Chicago, the U.S. Gulf Coast, Florida, and the U.S. West Coast. We also export our ethanol into the global markets. We ship our dry distillers grains (DDGs) by truck or rail primarily to animal feed customers in the U.S. and Mexico. We also sell modified distillers grains locally at our plant sites, and corn oil by truck and rail. We distribute our ethanol through logistics assets, which include railcars owned by us.



The following table presents the locations of our ethanol plants, their approximate annual production capacities for ethanol (in millions of gallons) and DDGs (in tons), and their approximate annual corn processing capacities (in millions of bushels).

The combined production of ethanol from our plants averaged4.1 milliongallons per day for2018.

________________________

(a)Ethanol is commercially produced using either the wet mill or dry mill process. Wet milling involves separating the grain kernel into its component parts (germ, fiber, protein, and starch) prior to fermentation. In the dry mill process, the entire grain kernel is ground into flour. The starch in the flour is converted to ethanol during the fermentation process, creating carbon dioxide and distillers grains.

(b)During fermentation, nearly all of the starch in the grain is converted into ethanol and carbon dioxide, while the remaining nutrients (proteins, fats, minerals, and vitamins) are concentrated to yield corn oil, modified distillers grains, or, after further drying, dried distillers grains. Distillers grains generally are an economical partial replacement for corn and soybeans in feeds for cattle, swine, and poultry. Corn oil is produced as fuel grade and feed grade (not for human consumption), and is sold primarily as a feedstock for biodiesel or renewable diesel production with a smaller percentage sold into animal feed markets.

(c)The Bluffton, Lakota, and Riga plants were acquired from two subsidiaries of Green Plains Inc. in November 2018. The annual ethanol, DDG production, and corn processing capacities for these ethanol plants were only applicable for November and December of 2018.









VLP

VLP is a limited partnership that owns and operates crude oil and refined petroleum products pipeline and terminal systems in the U.S. Gulf Coast and U.S. Mid-Continent regions that provide transportation and terminaling services to our refining segment and are integral to the operations of our Ardmore, Corpus Christi East and West, Houston, McKee, Memphis, Meraux, Port Arthur, St. Charles, and Three Rivers Refineries.
