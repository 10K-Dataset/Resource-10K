ITEM 1. BUSINESS

GENERAL

CMS ENERGY

CMS Energy was formed as a corporation in Michigan in 1987 and is an energy company operating primarily in Michigan. It is the parent holding company of several
subsidiaries, including Consumers, an electric and gas utility, and CMS Enterprises, primarily a domestic independent power producer. Consumers serves individuals and businesses operating in the
alternative energy, automotive, chemical, metal, and food products industries, as well as a diversified group of other industries. CMS Enterprises, through its subsidiaries and equity investments, is
engaged primarily in independent power production and owns power generation facilities fueled mostly by natural gas and biomass.

CMS
Energy manages its businesses by the nature of services each provides and operates, principally in three business segments: electric utility, gas utility, and enterprises, its
non-utility operations and investments. Consumers' consolidated operations account for substantially all of CMS Energy's total assets, income, and operating revenue. CMS Energy's
consolidated operating revenue was $6.3 billion in 2012, $6.5 billion in 2011, and $6.4 billion in 2010.

For
further information about operating revenue, net operating income, and identifiable assets and liabilities attributable to all of CMS Energy's business segments and operations, see Item 8.
Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, CMS Energy's Selected Financial Information, Consolidated Financial Statements, and Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

CONSUMERS

Consumers has served Michigan customers since 1886. Consumers was incorporated in Maine in 1910 and became a Michigan corporation in 1968. Consumers owns and
operates electric distribution and generation facilities and gas transmission, storage, and distribution facilities. It provides electricity and/or natural gas to 6.6 million of Michigan's
10 million residents. Consumers' rates and certain other aspects of its business are subject to the jurisdiction of the MPSC and FERC, as described in "CMS Energy and Consumers Regulation" in
this Item 1.

Consumers'
consolidated operating revenue was $6.0 billion in 2012, $6.3 billion in 2011, and $6.2 billion in 2010. For further information about operating revenue, net operating
income, and identifiable assets and liabilities attributable to Consumers' electric and gas utility operations, see Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Consumers' Selected
Financial Information, Consolidated Financial Statements, and Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Consumers
owns its principal properties in fee, except that most electric lines and gas mains are located below public roads or on land owned by others and are accessed by Consumers through easements
and other rights. Almost all of Consumers' properties are subject to the lien of its First Mortgage Bond Indenture. For additional information on Consumers' properties, see Consumers Electric
Utility – Electric Utility Properties and Consumers Gas Utility – Gas Utility Properties in the "Business Segments" section of this Item 1.









In
2012, Consumers served 1.8 million electric customers and 1.7 million gas customers in Michigan's Lower Peninsula. Presented in the following map is Consumers' service territory:











BUSINESS SEGMENTS

CONSUMERSELECTRICUTILITY

Electric Utility Operations:Consumers' electric utility operations, which include the generation, purchase, distribution, and sale of electricity, generated
operating revenue of $4.0 billion in 2012, $3.9 billion in 2011, and $3.8 billion in 2010. Consumers' electric utility customer base consists of a mix of residential, commercial,
and diversified industrial customers in Michigan's Lower Peninsula.

Presented
in the following illustration is Consumers' 2012 electric utility operating revenue of $4.0 billion by customer class:



Consumers'
electric utility operations are not dependent on a single customer, or even a few customers, and the loss of any one or even a few of Consumers' largest customers is not reasonably likely
to have a material adverse effect on Consumers' financial condition.

In
each of 2012 and 2011, Consumers' electric deliveries were 38 billion kWh, which included ROA deliveries of four billion kWh, resulting in net bundled sales of 34 billion kWh.

Consumers'
electric utility operations are seasonal. The consumption of electric energy typically increases in the summer months, due primarily to the use of air conditioners and other cooling
equipment.









Presented
in the following illustration are Consumers' monthly weather-adjusted electric deliveries (deliveries adjusted to reflect normal weather conditions) to its customers, including ROA
deliveries, during 2012 and 2011:



Consumers'
2012 summer peak demand was 9,006 MW, which included ROA demand of 619 MW. For the 2011-2012 winter period, Consumers' peak demand was 5,864 MW, which
included ROA demand of 500 MW. As required by MISO reserve margin requirements, Consumers owns or controls, through long-term contracts, capacity required to supply most of its
projected firm peak load and necessary reserve margin for summer 2013. Consumers expects to acquire the balance of its 2013 requirements through MISO's forward capacity auction scheduled to be
conducted in April 2013.

Electric Utility Properties:Consumers' distribution system includes:

•421 miles of high-voltage distribution radial lines operating at 120 kilovolts or above;•4,259 miles of high-voltage distribution
overhead lines operating at 23 kilovolts, 46 kilovolts, and 69
kilovolts;•17 miles of high-voltage distribution underground lines operating at 23 kilovolts and 46 kilovolts;•55,965
miles of electric distribution overhead lines;•10,162 miles of underground distribution lines; and•substations with an
aggregate transformer capacity of 24 million kVA.









Consumers
is interconnected to the interstate high-voltage electric transmission system owned by Michigan Electric Transmission Company, LLC, a non-affiliated company,
and operated by MISO, to neighboring utilities, and to other transmission systems.

At
December 31, 2012, Consumers' electric generating system consisted of the following:

1Weighted-average
fuel costs

In 2012, Consumers' four coal-fueled generating sites burned 8 million tons of coal and produced a combined total of 14,027 GWh of
electricity, which represented 39 percent of the energy provided by Consumers to meet customer demand.

In
order to obtain its coal requirements, Consumers enters into physical coal supply contracts. At December 31, 2012, Consumers had contracts to purchase coal through 2015; payment obligations
under these contracts totaled $214 million. All of Consumers' coal supply contracts have fixed prices. At December 31, 2012, Consumers had 78 percent of its 2013 expected coal
requirements under contract, as well as a 45-day supply of coal on hand.









In
conjunction with its coal supply contracts, Consumers leases a fleet of rail cars and has long-term transportation contracts with various companies to provide rail and vessel services
for delivery of purchased coal to Consumers' generating facilities. Consumers' coal transportation contracts expire from 2013 through 2014; payment obligations under these contracts totaled
$238 million.

During
2012, Consumers purchased 52 percent of the electricity it provided to customers through long-term PPAs, seasonal purchases, and the Midwest Energy Market. Consumers offers
its generation into the Midwest Energy Market on a day-ahead and real-time basis and bids for power in the market to serve the demand of its customers. Consumers is a net
purchaser of power and supplements its generation capability with purchases from the Midwest Energy Market to meet its customers' needs during peak demand periods.

At
December 31, 2012, Consumers had unrecognized future commitments (amounts for which liabilities, in accordance with GAAP, have not been recorded on its balance sheet) to purchase capacity
and energy under long-term PPAs with various generating plants. These contracts require monthly capacity payments based on the plants' availability or deliverability. The payments for 2013
through 2040 total $12.5 billion and range from $911 million to $964 million annually for each of the next five years. These amounts may vary depending on plant availability and
fuel costs. For further information about Consumers' future capacity and energy purchase obligations, see Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, MD&A — Capital
Resources and Liquidity and Note 4, Contingencies and Commitments — Contractual Commitments.

Electric Utility Competition:Consumers' electric utility business is subject to actual and potential competition from many sources, in both the wholesale and
retail markets, as well as in electric generation, electric delivery, and retail services.

The
Customer Choice Act allows all of Consumers' electric customers to buy electric generation service from Consumers or from an alternative electric supplier. The 2008 Energy Law revised the Customer
Choice Act by limiting alternative electric supply to ten percent of weather-adjusted retail sales for the preceding calendar year. At December 31, 2012, electric deliveries under the ROA
program were at the ten percent limit. Alternative electric suppliers were providing 777 MW of generation service to ROA customers.

Consumers
also has competition or potential competition from:

•industrial customers relocating all or a portion of their production capacity outside Consumers' service territory for
economic reasons;•municipalities owning or operating competing electric delivery systems; and•customer self-generation.

Consumers
addresses this competition by monitoring activity in adjacent areas and monitoring compliance with the MPSC's and FERC's rules, providing non-energy services,
providing value to customers through Consumers' rates and service, and offering tariff-based incentives that support economic development.

CONSUMERSGASUTILITY

Gas Utility Operations:Consumers' gas utility operations, which include the purchase, transmission, storage, distribution, and sale of natural gas, generated
operating revenue of









$2.0 billion
in 2012, $2.3 billion in 2011, and $2.4 billion in 2010. Consumers' gas utility customer base consists of a mix of residential, commercial, and diversified industrial
customers in Michigan's Lower Peninsula.

Presented
in the following illustration is Consumers' 2012 gas utility operating revenue of $2.0 billion by customer class:



Consumers'
gas utility operations are not dependent on a single customer, or even a few customers, and the loss of any one or even a few of Consumers' largest customers is not reasonably likely to
have a material adverse effect on Consumers' financial condition.

In
2012, deliveries of natural gas, including off-system transportation deliveries, through Consumers' pipeline and distribution network, totaled 329 bcf, which included GCC deliveries of
49 bcf. In 2011, deliveries of natural gas, including off-system transportation deliveries, through Consumers' pipeline and distribution network, totaled 337 bcf, which
included GCC deliveries of 48 bcf. Consumers' gas utility operations are seasonal. Consumers injects natural gas into storage during the summer months for use during the winter months when the
demand for natural gas is higher. Peak demand occurs in the winter due to colder temperatures and the resulting use of natural gas as a heating fuel. During 2012, 42 percent of the natural gas
supplied to all customers during the winter months was supplied from storage.









Presented
in the following illustration are Consumers' monthly weather-adjusted gas deliveries to its customers, including GCC deliveries, during 2012 and 2011:



Gas Utility Properties:Consumers' gas distribution and transmission system located in Michigan's Lower Peninsula consists
of:

•26,720 miles of distribution mains;•1,657 miles of transmission lines;•seven compressor stations with a total of 151,172 installed and available horsepower; and•15 gas storage fields with an aggregate storage capacity of 309 bcf and a working storage
capacity of 143 bcf.









Gas Utility Supply:In 2012, Consumers purchased 62 percent of the gas it delivered from U.S. producers and 9 percent from Canadian producers. The
remaining 29 percent was purchased from authorized GCC suppliers and delivered by Consumers to customers in the GCC program. Presented in the following illustration are the supply arrangements
for the gas Consumers delivered to GCC and GCR customers during 2012:



Firm
transportation or firm city-gate contracts are those that define a fixed amount, price, and delivery time frame. Consumers' firm gas transportation contracts are with ANR Pipeline
Company, Great Lakes Gas Transmission, L.P., Panhandle, and Trunkline. Under these contracts, Consumers purchases and transports gas to Michigan for ultimate delivery to its customers.
Consumers' firm gas transportation contracts expire through 2017 and provide for the delivery of 75 percent of Consumers' total gas supply requirements. Consumers purchases the balance of its
required gas supply under firm city-gate contracts and through authorized suppliers under the GCC program.

Gas Utility Competition:Competition exists in various aspects of Consumers' gas utility business. Competition comes from other gas suppliers taking advantage of
direct access to Consumers' customers (GCC) and from alternative fuels and energy sources, such as propane, oil, and electricity.

ENTERPRISESSEGMENT– NON-UTILITYOPERATIONSANDINVESTMENTS

CMS Energy's enterprises segment, through various subsidiaries and certain equity investments, is engaged primarily in domestic independent power production and
the marketing of independent power production. The enterprises segment's operating revenue included in income from continuing operations in CMS Energy's consolidated financial statements was
$183 million in 2012, $204 million in 2011, and $238 million in 2010. The enterprises segment's operating revenue included in income (loss) from discontinued operations in CMS
Energy's consolidated financial statements was less than $1 million in 2011 and was $10 million in 2010.







Independent Power Production:At December 31, 2012, CMS Energy had ownership interests in independent power plants totaling 1,135 gross MW or 1,034 net MW.
(Net MW reflects that portion of the gross capacity relating to CMS Energy's ownership interests.) Presented in the following table are CMS Energy's interests in independent power plants at

The operating revenue from independent power production included in income from continuing operations in CMS Energy's consolidated financial statements was
$16 million in 2012, $17 million in 2011, and $18 million in 2010. The operating revenue from independent power production included in income (loss) from discontinued operations
in CMS Energy's consolidated financial statements was less than $1 million in 2011 and was $10 million in 2010. CMS Energy's independent power production business faces competition from
generators, marketers and brokers, and utilities marketing power in the wholesale market.

Energy Resource Management:CMS ERM purchases and sells energy commodities in support of CMS Energy's generating facilities and continues to focus on optimizing
CMS Energy's independent power production portfolio. In 2012, CMS ERM marketed 13 bcf of natural gas and 4,591 GWh of electricity. Electricity marketed by CMS ERM was generated by
independent power production of the enterprises segment and unrelated third parties. CMS ERM's operating revenue included in income from continuing operations in CMS Energy's consolidated financial
statements was $167 million in 2012, $187 million in 2011, and $220 million in 2010.

OTHERBUSINESSES

EnerBank:EnerBank, a wholly owned subsidiary of CMS Energy, is a Utah state-chartered, FDIC-insured industrial bank providing unsecured consumer
installment loans for financing home improvements. EnerBank's operating revenue included in income from continuing operations in CMS Energy's consolidated financial statements was $57 million
in 2012, $46 million in 2011, and $38 million in 2010.

CMS ENERGY AND CONSUMERS REGULATION

CMS Energy, Consumers, and their subsidiaries are subject to regulation by various federal, state, local, and foreign governmental
agencies, including those described in the following sections.









FERC

FERC has exercised limited jurisdiction over several independent power plants and exempt wholesale generators in which CMS
Enterprises has ownership interests, as well as over CMS ERM, CMS Gas Transmission, and DIG. Among other things, FERC has jurisdiction over acquisitions, operations, and disposals of certain assets
and facilities, services provided and rates charged, conduct among affiliates, and limited jurisdiction over holding company matters with respect to CMS Energy. FERC, in connection with NERC and with
regional reliability organizations, also regulates generation owners and operators, load
serving entities, purchase and sale entities, and others with regard to reliability of the bulk power system. FERC regulates limited aspects of Consumers' gas business, principally compliance with
FERC capacity release rules, shipping rules, the prohibition against certain buy/sell transactions, and the price-reporting rule.

FERC
also regulates certain aspects of Consumers' electric operations, including compliance with FERC accounting rules, wholesale rates, operation of licensed hydroelectric generating plants,
transfers of certain facilities, corporate mergers, and issuances of securities.

MPSC

Consumers is subject to the jurisdiction of the MPSC, which regulates public utilities in Michigan with respect to retail utility
rates, accounting, utility services, certain facilities, corporate mergers, and other matters.

The
Michigan Attorney General, ABATE, the MPSC Staff, and certain other parties typically participate in MPSC proceedings concerning Consumers. The Michigan Attorney General, ABATE, and others often
appeal significant MPSC orders.

Rate Proceedings:For information regarding open rate proceedings, see Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Notes to the Consolidated
Financial Statements, Note 3, Regulatory Matters.

OTHERREGULATION

The U.S. Secretary of Energy regulates imports and exports of natural gas and has delegated various aspects of this jurisdiction to FERC and the DOE's Office of
Fossil Fuels.

The
U.S. Department of Transportation Office of Pipeline Safety regulates the safety and security of gas pipelines through the Natural Gas Pipeline Safety Act of 1968 and subsequent laws.

EnerBank
is regulated by the State of Utah and the FDIC.

ENERGYLEGISLATION

CMS Energy, Consumers, and their subsidiaries are subject to various legislative-driven matters, including Michigan's 2008 Energy Law. This law requires that at
least ten percent of Consumers' electric sales volume come from renewable energy sources by 2015, and includes requirements for specific capacity additions. The 2008 Energy Law also requires Consumers
to prepare an energy optimization plan and achieve annual sales reduction targets through at least 2015. The targets are incremental with the goal of achieving a six percent reduction in customers'









electricity
use and a four percent reduction in customers' natural gas use by December 31, 2015. The 2008 Energy Law also reformed the Customer Choice Act to limit alternative energy suppliers
to supplying no more than ten percent of Consumers' weather-adjusted sales. For additional information regarding Consumers' renewable energy and energy optimization plans and the Customer Choice Act,
see Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, MD&A, Outlook, "Consumers Electric Utility Business Outlook and Uncertainties."

CMS ENERGY AND CONSUMERS ENVIRONMENTAL COMPLIANCE

CMS Energy, Consumers, and their subsidiaries are subject to various federal, state, and local regulations for environmental quality,
including air and water quality, solid waste management, and other matters. For additional information concerning environmental matters, see Item 1A. Risk Factors and Item 8. Financial
Statements and Supplementary Data, Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 4, Contingencies and Commitments.

CMS
Energy has recorded a significant liability for its affiliates' obligations associated with Bay Harbor and Consumers has recorded a significant liability for its obligations at a number of MGP
sites. For additional information, see Item 1A. Risk Factors and Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 4,
Contingencies and Commitments.

Air:Consumers continues to install state-of-the-art emissions control equipment at its electric generating plants and to
convert electric generating units to burn cleaner fuels. Consumers estimates that it will incur expenditures of $835 million from 2013 through 2018 to comply with present and future federal and
state regulations that will require extensive reductions in nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxides, particulate matter, and mercury emissions. Consumers' estimate may increase if additional or more
stringent laws or regulations are adopted or implemented regarding greenhouse gases, including carbon dioxide.

Solid Waste Disposal:Costs related to the construction, operation, and closure of solid waste disposal facilities for coal ash are significant. Historically,
Consumers has worked with others to reuse 30 to 50 percent of ash produced by its coal-fueled plants, and sells ash for use as a Portland cement replacement in concrete products, as
feedstock for the manufacture of Portland cement, and for other environmentally sustainable uses. Consumers' solid waste disposal areas are regulated under Michigan's solid waste rules. Consumers has
converted all of its fly ash handling systems to dry systems. All of Consumers' ash facilities have programs designed to protect the environment and are subject to quarterly MDEQ inspections. The EPA
has proposed new federal regulations for ash disposal areas. Consumers preliminarily estimates that it will incur expenditures of $125 million from 2013 through 2018 to comply with future
regulations relating to ash disposal, assuming ash is regulated as a non-hazardous solid waste.

Water:Consumers uses significant amounts of water to operate and cool its electric generating plants. Water discharge quality is regulated and administered by the
MDEQ under the federal NPDES program. To comply with such regulation, Consumers' facilities have discharge monitoring programs. The EPA is developing new regulations related to cooling water intake
systems, but these new regulations are not expected to take effect until after 2018. Accordingly, Consumers does not presently expect to incur any significant expenditures to comply with future
regulations relating to cooling water intake systems through 2018. Significant expenditures could be required beyond 2018, but until a rule is final, any potential expenditures are difficult to
predict. Consumers also expects the EPA to propose new federal regulations for wastewater discharges from electric generating plants in 2013, with a final rule in 2014. Consumers'









preliminary
estimate of expenditures to comply with these expected regulations is $180 million from 2013 through 2018.

For
further information concerning estimated capital expenditures related to air, solid waste disposal, and water see Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, MD&A, Outlook,
"Consumers Electric Utility Business Outlook and Uncertainties – Electric Environmental Estimates."

INSURANCE

CMS Energy and its subsidiaries, including Consumers, maintain insurance coverage generally similar to comparable companies in the
same lines of business. The insurance policies are subject to terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions that might not fully compensate CMS Energy or Consumers for all losses. A portion of each
loss is generally assumed by CMS Energy or Consumers in the form of deductibles and self-insured retentions that, in some cases, are substantial. As CMS Energy or Consumers renews its
policies, it is possible that some of the present insurance coverage may not be renewed or obtainable on commercially reasonable terms due to restrictive insurance markets.

CMS
Energy's and Consumers' present insurance program does not cover the risks of certain environmental cleanup costs and environmental damages, such as claims for air pollution, damage to sites owned
by CMS Energy or Consumers, and some long-term storage or disposal of wastes.
