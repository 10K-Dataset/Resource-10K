ITEM 1. BUSINESS

GENERAL

CMS ENERGY

CMS Energy was formed as a corporation in Michigan in 1987 and is an energy company operating primarily in Michigan. It is the parent
holding company of several subsidiaries, including Consumers, an electric and gas utility, and CMS Enterprises, primarily a domestic independent power producer. Consumers serves individuals and businesses operating in the alternative energy,
automotive, chemical, metal, and food products industries, as well as a diversified group of other industries. CMS Enterprises, through its subsidiaries and equity investments, is engaged primarily in independent power production and owns power
generation facilities fueled mostly by natural gas and biomass.

CMS Energy manages its businesses by the nature of
services each provides and operates, principally in three business segments: electric utility, gas utility, and enterprises, its non-utility operations and investments. Consumers’ consolidated operations account for substantially all of
CMS Energy’s total assets, income, and operating revenue. CMS Energy’s consolidated operating revenue was $6.5 billion in 2011, $6.4 billion in 2010, and $6.2 billion in 2009.

For further information about operating revenue, net operating income, and identifiable assets and liabilities attributable to all of
CMS Energy’s business segments and operations, see Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, CMS Energy’s Selected Financial Information, Consolidated Financial Statements, and Notes to the Consolidated Financial
Statements.

CONSUMERS

Consumers has served Michigan customers since 1886. Consumers was incorporated in Maine in 1910 and became a Michigan corporation in 1968. Consumers owns and operates electric distribution and generation
facilities and gas transmission, storage, and distribution facilities. It provides electricity and/or natural gas to 6.7 million of Michigan’s 10 million residents. Consumers’ rates and certain other aspects of its business are
subject to the jurisdiction of the MPSC and FERC, as described in “CMS Energy and Consumers Regulation” in this Item 1.

Consumers’ consolidated operating revenue was $6.3 billion in 2011, $6.2 billion in 2010, and $6.0 billion in 2009. For further information about operating revenue, net operating
income, and identifiable assets and liabilities attributable to Consumers’ electric and gas utility operations, see Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Consumers’ Selected Financial Information, Consolidated Financial
Statements, and Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Consumers owns its principal properties in fee, except that
most electric lines and gas mains are located below public roads or on land owned by others and are accessed by Consumers through easements and other rights. Almost all of Consumers’ properties are subject to the lien of its First Mortgage Bond
Indenture. For additional information on Consumers’ properties, see Consumers Electric Utility — Electric Utility Properties and Consumers Gas Utility — Gas Utility Properties in the “Business Segments” section of this
Item 1.







In 2011, Consumers served 1.8million electric customers and
1.7 million gas customers in Michigan’s Lower Peninsula. Presented in the following map is Consumers’ service territory:











BUSINESS SEGMENTS

CONSUMERSELECTRICUTILITY

Electric
Utility Operations:Consumers’ electric utility operations, which include the generation, purchase, distribution, and sale of electricity, generated operating revenue of $3.9 billion in 2011, $3.8 billion in 2010, and
$3.4 billion in 2009. Consumers’ electric utility customer base consists of a mix of residential, commercial, and diversified industrial customers in Michigan’s Lower Peninsula. Presented in the following illustration is
Consumers’ 2011 electric utility operating revenue of $3.9 billion by customer class:





Consumers’ electric utility operations are not dependent on a single customer, or even a few
customers, and the loss of any one or even a few of Consumers’ largest customers is not reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on Consumers’ financial condition.

In each of 2011 and 2010, Consumers’ electric deliveries were 38 billion kWh, which included ROA deliveries of
four billion kWh. Net bundled sales were 34 billion kWh in each of 2011 and 2010.

Consumers’ electric
utility operations are seasonal. The consumption of electric energy typically increases in the summer months, due primarily to the use of air conditioners and other cooling equipment.







Presented in the following illustration are Consumers’ monthly weather-adjusted
electric deliveries (deliveries adjusted to reflect normal weather conditions) to its customers, including ROA deliveries, during 2011 and 2010:





Consumers’ 2011 summer peak demand was 8,930 MW, which included ROA demand of 624 MW.
For the 2010-2011 winter period, Consumers’ peak demand was 6,201 MW, which included ROA demand of 489 MW. As required by MISO reserve margin requirements, Consumers owns or controls, through long-term contracts, capacity required to
supply its projected firm peak load and necessary reserve margin for summer 2012.

Electric Utility Properties:Consumers’ distribution system includes:



•413 miles of high-voltage distribution radial lines operating at 120 kilovolts or above;



•4,244 miles of high-voltage distribution overhead lines operating at 23 kilovolts and 46 kilovolts;



•17 miles of high-voltage distribution underground lines operating at 23 kilovolts and 46 kilovolts;



•55,953 miles of electric distribution overhead lines;



•10,112 miles of underground distribution lines; and



•substations with an aggregate transformer capacity of 24 million kVA.

Consumers is interconnected to the interstate high-voltage electric transmission system owned by METC and operated by MISO, to neighboring
utilities, and to other transmission systems.







At December 31, 2011, Consumers’ electric generating system consisted of the

1Weighted-average fuel costs

In 2011, Consumers’ four coal-fueled generating sites burned 9 million tons of coal and produced a combined total of 15,468 GWh of electricity, which represented 42 percent of the
energy provided by Consumers to meet customer demand.

In order to obtain its coal requirements, Consumers enters into physical
coal supply contracts. At December 31, 2011, Consumers had contracts to purchase coal through 2014; these contracts total $261 million. All of Consumers’ coal supply contracts have fixed prices. At December 31, 2011,
Consumers had 86 percent of its 2012 expected coal requirements under contract, as well as a 41-day supply of coal on hand.

In conjunction with its coal supply contracts, Consumers leases a fleet of rail cars and has long-term transportation contracts with
various companies to provide rail and vessel services for delivery of purchased coal to Consumers’ generating facilities. Consumers’ coal transportation contracts expire from 2012 through 2014; these contracts total $427 million.







During 2011, Consumers purchased 53 percent of the electricity it provided to customers
through long-term PPAs, seasonal purchases, and the Midwest Energy Market. Consumers offers its generation into the Midwest Energy Market on a day-ahead and real-time basis and bids for power in the market to serve the demand of its customers.
Consumers is a net purchaser of power and supplements its generation capability with purchases from the Midwest Energy Market to meet its customers’ needs during peak demand periods.

At December 31, 2011, Consumers had unrecognized future commitments (amounts for which liabilities, in accordance with GAAP,
have not been recorded on its balance sheet) to purchase capacity and energy under long-term PPAs with various generating plants. These contracts require monthly capacity payments based on the plants’ availability or deliverability. The
payments for 2012 through 2040 total $15.3 billion and range from $901 million to $1.1 billion annually for each of the next five years. These amounts may vary depending on plant availability and fuel costs. For further information
about Consumers’ future capacity and energy purchase obligations, see Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, MD&A, Capital Resources and Liquidity.

ElectricUtility Competition: Consumers’ electric utility business is subject to actual and potential competition from many sources, in both the wholesale and retail markets, as well as
in electric generation, electric delivery, and retail services.

The Customer Choice Act allows all of Consumers’ electric
customers to buy electric generation service from Consumers or from an alternative electric supplier. The 2008 Energy Law revised the Customer Choice Act by limiting alternative electric supply to ten percent of weather-adjusted retail
sales for the preceding calendar year. At December 31, 2011, electric deliveries under the ROA program were at the ten percent limit. Alternative electric suppliers were providing 785 MW of generation service to ROA customers.

Consumers also has competition or potential competition from:



•industrial customers relocating all or a portion of their production capacity outside Consumers’ service territory for economic reasons;



•municipalities owning or operating competing electric delivery systems; and



•customer self-generation.

Consumers addresses this competition by monitoring activity in adjacent areas and monitoring compliance with the MPSC’s and FERC’s rules, providing non-energy services, adding value to customers
through Consumers’ rates and service, and providing tariff-based incentives that support economic development.

CONSUMERSGASUTILITY

Gas Utility Operations:Consumers’ gas utility operations, which
include the purchase, transmission, storage, distribution, and sale of natural gas, generated operating revenue of $2.3 billion in 2011, $2.4 billion in 2010, and $2.6 billion in 2009. Consumers’ gas utility customer base
consists of a mix of residential, commercial, and diversified industrial customers in Michigan’s Lower Peninsula.







Presented in the following illustration is Consumers’ 2011 gas utility operating
revenue of $2.3 billion by customer class:





Consumers’ gas utility operations are not dependent on a single customer, or even a few customers,
and the loss of any one or even a few of Consumers’ largest customers is not reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on Consumers’ financial condition.







In 2011, deliveries of natural gas, including off-system transportation deliveries, through
Consumers’ pipeline and distribution network, totaled 337 bcf, which included GCC deliveries of 48 bcf. In 2010, deliveries of natural gas, including off-system transportation deliveries, through Consumers’ pipeline and
distribution network, totaled 317 bcf, which included GCC deliveries of 36 bcf. Consumers’ gas utility operations are seasonal. Consumers injects natural gas into storage during the summer months for use during the winter months when
the demand for natural gas is higher. Peak demand occurs in the winter due to colder temperatures and the resulting use of natural gas as a heating fuel. During 2011, 46 percent of the natural gas supplied to all customers during the winter
months was supplied from storage. Presented in the following illustration are Consumers’ monthly weather-adjusted gas deliveries to its customers, including GCC deliveries, during 2011 and 2010:





Gas Utility Properties:Consumers’ gas distribution and transmission system located in
Michigan’s Lower Peninsula consists of:



•26,623 miles of distribution mains;



•1,666 miles of transmission lines;



•seven compressor stations with a total of 150,635 installed and available horsepower; and



•15 gas storage fields with an aggregate storage capacity of 307 bcf and a working storage capacity of 142 bcf.







Gas Utility Supply:In 2011, Consumers purchased 70 percent of the gas it
delivered from U.S. producers and 10 percent from Canadian producers. The remaining 20 percent was purchased from authorized GCC suppliers and delivered by Consumers to customers in the GCC program. Presented in the following illustration
are the supply arrangements for the gas Consumers delivered to GCC and GCR customers during 2011:





Firm transportation or firm city-gate contracts are those that define a fixed amount, price, and
delivery time frame. Consumers’ firm gas transportation contracts are with ANR Pipeline Company, Great Lakes Gas Transmission, L.P., Panhandle, Trunkline Gas Company, LLC, and Vector Pipeline L.P. Under these contracts, Consumers
purchases and transports gas to Michigan for ultimate delivery to its customers. Consumers’ firm gas transportation contracts expire through 2017 and provide for the delivery of 65 percent of Consumers’ total gas supply requirements.
Consumers purchases the balance of its required gas supply under firm city-gate contracts and through authorized suppliers under the GCC program.

Gas Utility Competition:Competition exists in various aspects of Consumers’ gas utility business. Competition comes from other gas suppliers taking advantage of direct access to
Consumers’ customers (GCC) and from alternative fuels and energy sources, such as propane, oil, and electricity.

ENTERPRISESSEGMENT— NON-UTILITYOPERATIONSANDINVESTMENTS

CMS Energy’s enterprises segment, through various subsidiaries and certain equity investments, is engaged primarily in domestic independent power production and the marketing of independent
power production. The enterprises segment’s operating revenue included in income from continuing operations in CMS Energy’s consolidated financial statements was $204 million in 2011, $238 million in 2010, and
$216 million in 2009. The enterprises segment’s operating revenue included in income (loss) from discontinued operations in CMS Energy’s consolidated financial statements was less than $1 million in 2011, $10 million in
2010, and $7 million in 2009.







Independent Power Production: At December 31, 2011, CMS Energy had
ownership interests in independent power plants totaling 1,135 gross MW or 1,034 net MW. (Net MW reflects that portion of the gross capacity relating to CMS Energy’s ownership interests.)Presented in the following table
are CMS Energy’s interests in independent power plants at December 31, 2011:

The operating revenue from independent power production included in income from continuing operations in
CMS Energy’s consolidated financial statements was $17 million in 2011 and $18 million in each of 2010 and 2009. The operating revenue from independent power production included in income (loss) from discontinued operations in
CMS Energy’s consolidated financial statements was less than $1 million in 2011, $10 million in 2010, and $7 million in 2009. CMS Energy’s independent power production business faces competition from generators,
marketers and brokers, and utilities marketing power in the wholesale market.

Energy Resource Management:CMS ERM purchases and sells energy commodities in support of CMS Energy’s generating facilities and continues to focus on optimizing CMS Energy’s independent power production portfolio. In 2011, CMS ERM marketed
17 bcf of natural gas and 2,417 GWh of electricity. All marketed electricity was generated by independent power production of the enterprises segment. CMS ERM’s operating revenue included in income from continuing operations in
CMS Energy’s consolidated financial statements was $187 million in 2011, $220 million in 2010, and $198 million in 2009.

OTHERBUSINESSES

EnerBank:EnerBank, a wholly owned subsidiary of CMS Energy, is a Utah state-chartered, FDIC-insured industrial bank providing unsecured consumer installment loans for financing home
improvements. EnerBank’s operating revenue included in income from continuing operations in CMS Energy’s consolidated financial statements was $46 million in 2011, $38 million in 2010, and $26 million in 2009.

CMS ENERGY AND CONSUMERS REGULATION

CMS Energy, Consumers, and their subsidiaries are subject to regulation by various federal, state, local, and foreign governmental agencies, including those described in the following sections.

FERC

FERC has
exercised limited jurisdiction over several independent power plants and exempt wholesale generators in which CMS Enterprises has ownership interests, as well as over CMS ERM, CMS Gas Transmission, and DIG. Among other things, FERC
has jurisdiction over acquisitions, operations, and disposals of certain assets and facilities, services provided and rates charged, conduct among affiliates, and limited jurisdiction over holding company matters with respect to CMS Energy.
FERC, in connection with NERC and with regional reliability organizations, also regulates generation owners and operators, load serving entities, purchase and sale entities, and others with regard to reliability of the bulk power system. Certain
aspects of Consumers’ gas business are also subject to regulation by FERC.







FERC also regulates certain aspects of Consumers’ electric operations, including
compliance with FERC accounting rules, wholesale rates, operation of licensed hydroelectric generating plants, transfers of certain facilities, corporate mergers, and issuances of securities.

MPSC

Consumers is subject to the jurisdiction of the MPSC, which regulates public
utilities in Michigan with respect to retail utility rates, accounting, utility services, certain facilities, corporate mergers, and other matters.

The Michigan Attorney General, ABATE, the MPSC Staff, and certain other parties typically participate in MPSC proceedings concerning Consumers. The Michigan Attorney General, ABATE, and others often
appeal significant MPSC orders.

Rate Proceedings:For information regarding open rate proceedings, see Item 8.
Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 6, Regulatory Matters.

OTHERREGULATION

The U.S. Secretary of Energy regulates imports and exports of natural gas and has delegated
various aspects of this jurisdiction to FERC and the DOE’s Office of Fossil Fuels.

The U.S. Department of
Transportation Office of Pipeline Safety regulates the safety and security of gas pipelines through the Natural Gas Pipeline Safety Act of 1968 and subsequent laws.

EnerBank is regulated by the State of Utah and the FDIC.

ENERGYLEGISLATION

CMS Energy, Consumers, and their subsidiaries are subject to various legislative-driven
matters, including Michigan’s 2008 Energy Law. This law requires that at least ten percent of Consumers’ electric sales volume come from renewable energy sources by 2015, and includes requirements for specific capacity additions.
The 2008 Energy Law also requires Consumers to prepare an energy optimization plan and achieve annual sales reduction targets through at least 2015. The targets are incremental with the goal of achieving a six percent reduction in
customers’ electricity use and a four percent reduction in customers’ natural gas use by December 31, 2015. The 2008 Energy Law also reformed the Customer Choice Act to limit alternative energy suppliers to supplying no
more than ten percent of Consumers’ weather-adjusted sales. For additional information regarding Consumers’ renewable energy and energy optimization plans and the Customer Choice Act, see Item 8. Financial Statements and
Supplementary Data, MD&A, Outlook, “Consumers’ Electric Utility Business Outlook and Uncertainties.”

CMS ENERGY AND
CONSUMERS ENVIRONMENTAL COMPLIANCE

CMS Energy, Consumers, and their subsidiaries are subject to various federal,
state, and local regulations for environmental quality, including air and water quality, solid waste management, and other matters. For additional information concerning environmental matters, see Item 1A. Risk Factors and Item 8.
Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 5, Contingencies and Commitments.

CMS Energy has recorded a significant liability for its affiliates’ obligations associated with Bay Harbor and Consumers has recorded a significant liability for its obligations at a number of
MGP sites. For additional information, see Item 1A. Risk Factors and Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 5, Contingencies and Commitments.

Air:Consumers continues to install state-of-the-art emissions control equipment at its electric generating plants and to convert
electric generating units to burn cleaner fuels. Consumers estimates that it will incur expenditures of $1.2 billion from 2012 through 2018 to comply with present and future federal and state regulations that will require extensive reductions
in nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxides, particulate matter, and mercury emissions. Consumers’ estimate may increase if additional laws or regulations are adopted or implemented regarding greenhouse gases, including carbon dioxide.







Solid Waste Disposal:Costs related to the construction, operation, and closure of
solid waste disposal facilities for coal ash are significant. Historically, Consumers has worked with others to reuse 30 to 40 percent of ash produced by its coal-fueled plants, and sells ash for use as a Portland cement replacement in
concrete products, as feedstock for the manufacture of Portland cement, and for other environmentally-compatible uses. Consumers’ solid waste disposal areas are regulated under Michigan’s solid waste rules. Consumers has converted all of
its fly ash handling systems to dry systems, which reduce landfill venting substantially. All of Consumers’ ash facilities have programs designed to protect the environment and are subject to quarterly MDEQ inspections. The EPA has proposed new
federal regulations for ash disposal areas. Consumers estimates that it will incur expenditures of $150 million from 2012 through 2018 to comply with future regulations relating to ash disposal, assuming ash is regulated as a non-hazardous
solid waste.

Water:Consumers uses significant amounts of water to operate and cool its electric generating plants.
Water discharge quality is regulated and administered by the MDEQ under the federal NPDES program. To comply with such regulation, Consumers’ facilities have discharge monitoring programs. The EPA is developing new regulations related to
cooling water intake systems, but these new regulations are not expected to take effect until after 2018. Accordingly, Consumers does not presently expect to incur any significant expenditures to comply with future regulations relating to cooling
water intake systems through 2018. Significant expenditures could be required beyond 2018, but until a rule is final any potential expenditures are difficult to predict. Consumers also expects the EPA to propose new federal regulations for
wastewater discharges from electric generating plants in July 2012, with a final rule in 2014. Consumers’ preliminary estimate of expenditures to comply with these expected regulations is $150 million from 2012 through 2018.

For further information concerning estimated capital expenditures related to air, solid waste disposal, and water see
Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, MD&A, Outlook, “Consumers’ Electric Utility Business Outlook and Uncertainties – Electric Environmental Estimates.”

INSURANCE

CMS Energy and its
subsidiaries, including Consumers, maintain insurance coverage generally similar to comparable companies in the same lines of business. The insurance policies are subject to terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions that might not fully
compensate CMS Energy or Consumers for all losses. A portion of each loss is generally assumed by CMS Energy or Consumers in the form of deductibles and self-insured retentions that, in some cases, are substantial. As CMS Energy or
Consumers renews its policies, it is possible that some of the present insurance coverage may not be renewed or obtainable on commercially reasonable terms due to restrictive insurance markets.

CMS Energy’s and Consumers’ present insurance program does not cover the risks of certain environmental cleanup costs and
environmental damages, such as claims for air pollution, damage to sites owned by CMS Energy or Consumers, and some long-term storage or disposal of wastes.
