GENERAL



CMS Energy



CMS Energy was formed as a corporation in Michigan in 1987 and is an energy company operating primarily in Michigan. It is the parent holding company of several subsidiaries, including Consumers, an electric and gas utility, and CMS Enterprises, primarily a domestic independent power producer. Consumers serves individuals and businesses operating in the alternative energy, automotive, chemical, metal, and food products industries, as well as a diversified group of other industries. CMS Enterprises, through its subsidiaries and equity investments, is engaged primarily in independent power production and owns power generation facilities fueled mostly by natural gas and biomass.



CMS Energy manages its businesses by the nature of services each provides, and operates principally in three business segments: electric utility, gas utility, and enterprises, its non-utility operations and investments. Consumers’ consolidated operations account for the substantial majority of CMS Energy’s total assets, income, and operating revenue. CMS Energy’s consolidated operating revenue was $6.5 billion in 2015, $7.2 billion in 2014, and $6.6 billion in 2013.



For further information about operating revenue, income, and assets and liabilities attributable to all of CMS Energy’s business segments and operations, see Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—CMS Energy’s Selected Financial Information, Consolidated Financial Statements, and Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.



Consumers



Consumers has served Michigan customers since 1886. Consumers was incorporated in Maine in 1910 and became a Michigan corporation in 1968. Consumers owns and operates electric generation, transmission, and distribution facilities and gas transmission, storage, and distribution facilities. It provides electricity and/or natural gas to 6.7 million of Michigan’s 10 million residents. Consumers’ rates and certain other aspects of its business are subject to the jurisdiction of the MPSC and FERC, as well as to NERC reliability standards, as described in “CMS Energy and Consumers Regulation” in this Item 1.



Consumers’ consolidated operating revenue was $6.2 billion in 2015, $6.8 billion in 2014, and $6.3 billion in 2013. For further information about operating revenue, income, and assets and liabilities attributable to Consumers’ electric and gas utility operations, see Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Consumers’ Selected Financial Information, Consolidated Financial Statements, and Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.



Consumers owns its principal properties in fee, except that most electric lines and gas mains are located below or adjacent to public roads or on land owned by others and are accessed by Consumers through easements and other rights. Almost all of Consumers’ properties are subject to the lien of its First Mortgage Bond Indenture. For additional information on Consumers’ properties, see Item 1. Business—Business Segments—Consumers Electric Utility—Electric Utility Properties and Consumers Gas Utility—Gas Utility Properties.








Table of ContentsIn 2015, Consumers served 1.8 million electric customers and 1.7 million gas customers in Michigan’s Lower Peninsula. Presented in the following map are Consumers’ service territories:BUSINESS SEGMENTSConsumers Electric UtilityElectric Utility Operations:Consumers’ electric utility operations, which include the generation, purchase, transmission, distribution, and sale of electricity, generated operating revenue of $4.2 billion in 2015, $4.4 billion in 2014, and $4.2 billion in 2013. Consumers’ electric utility customer base consists of a mix of primarily residential, commercial, and diversified industrial customers in Michigan’s Lower Peninsula.15



Table of ContentsPresented in the following illustration is Consumers’ 2015 electric utility operating revenue of $4.2 billion by customer class:Consumers’ electric utility operations are not dependent on a single customer, or even a few customers, and the loss of any one or even a few of Consumers’ largest customers is not reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on Consumers’ financial condition.In 2015, Consumers’ electric deliveries were 37 billion kWh, which included ROA deliveries of four billion kWh, resulting in net bundled sales of 33 billion kWh. In 2014, Consumers’ electric deliveries were 38 billion kWh, which included ROA deliveries of four billion kWh, resulting in net bundled sales of 34 billion kWh.Consumers’ electric utility operations are seasonal. The consumption of electric energy typically increases in the summer months, due primarily to the use of air conditioners and other cooling equipment.16



Table of ContentsPresented in the following illustration are Consumers’ monthly weather-adjusted electric deliveries (deliveries adjusted to reflect normal weather conditions) to its customers, including ROA deliveries, during 2015 and 2014:Consumers’ 2015 summer peak demand was 7,812 MW, which included ROA demand of 581 MW. For the 2014-2015 winter period, Consumers’ peak demand was 6,067 MW, which included ROA demand of 492 MW. As required by MISO reserve margin requirements, Consumers owns or controls, through long-term PPAs and short-term capacity purchases, essentially all of the capacity required to supply its projected firm peak load and necessary reserve margin for summer 2016.Electric Utility Properties:Consumers’ distribution system consists of:·434 miles of high-voltage distribution radial lines operating at 120 kilovolts or above·4,251 miles of high-voltage distribution overhead lines operating at 46 kilovolts and 69 kilovolts·18 miles of high-voltage distribution underground lines operating at 46 kilovolts·56,023 miles of electric distribution overhead lines·10,383 miles of underground distribution lines·substations with an aggregate transformer capacity of 24 million kVAConsumers is interconnected to the interstate high-voltage electric transmission system owned by METC and operated by MISO.

2Includes purchases from long-term PPAs.



3Includes purchases from the MISO energy market.



During 2015, 45 percent of the energy Consumers provided to customers was generated by its coal-fueled generating units, which burned nine million tons of coal and produced a combined total of 15,833 GWh of electricity.



In order to obtain the coal it needs, Consumers enters into physical coal supply contracts. At December 31, 2015, Consumers had contracts to purchase coal through 2018; payment obligations under these contracts totaled $118 million. Most of Consumers’ rail-supplied coal contracts have fixed prices, although some contain market-based pricing. Consumers’ vessel-supplied coal contracts have fixed base prices that are adjusted monthly to reflect changes to the fuel cost of vessel transportation. At December 31, 2015, Consumers had 79 percent of its 2016 expected coal requirements under contract, as well as a 34-day supply of coal on hand.



In conjunction with its coal supply contracts, Consumers leases a fleet of rail cars and has transportation contracts with various companies to provide rail and vessel services for delivery of purchased coal to Consumers’ generating facilities. Consumers’ coal transportation contracts expire through 2019; payment obligations under these contracts totaled $321 million at December 31, 2015.



During 2015, Consumers acquired 43 percent of the electricity it provided to customers through long-term PPAs and the MISO energy market. Consumers offers its generation into the MISO energy market on a day-ahead and real-time basis and bids for power in the market to serve the demand of its customers. Consumers is a net purchaser of power and supplements its generation capability with purchases from the MISO energy market to meet its customers’ needs during peak demand periods.



At December 31, 2015, Consumers had unrecognized future commitments (amounts for which, in accordance with GAAP, liabilities have not been recorded on its balance sheet) to purchase capacity and energy under long-term PPAs with various generating plants. These contracts require monthly capacity payments based on the plants’ availability or deliverability. The payments for 2016 through 2036 are











estimated to total $10 billion and, for each of the next five years, $1.0 billion annually. These amounts may vary depending on plant availability and fuel costs. For further information about Consumers’ future capacity and energy purchase obligations, see Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—MD&A—Capital Resources and Liquidity and Note 4, Contingencies and Commitments—Contractual Commitments.



During 2015, ten percent of the energy Consumers provided to customers was generated by natural gas-fueled generating units, which burned 25 bcf of natural gas and produced a combined total of 3,601 GWh of electricity.



In order to obtain the gas it needs for electric generation fuel, Consumers’ electric utility purchases gas from the market near the time of consumption, at prices that allow it to compete in the electric wholesale market. For units 3 and 4 of D.E. Karn and for the Jackson and Zeeland plants, Consumers utilizes an agent that owns firm transportation rights to each plant to purchase gas from the market and transport the gas to the facilities. For its smaller combustion turbines, Consumers’ electric utility purchases and transports gas to its facilities as a bundled-rate tariff customer of either the gas utility or DTE Gas.



Presented in the following table is the cost per million Btu of all fuels consumed, which fluctuates with the mix of fuel used.

Electric Utility Competition:Consumers’ electric utility business is subject to actual and potential competition from many sources, in both the wholesale and retail markets, as well as in electric generation, electric delivery, and retail services.



The 2008 Energy Law allows electric customers in Consumers’ service territory to buy electric generation service from alternative electric suppliers in an aggregate amount up to ten percent of Consumers’ weather-adjusted retail sales for the preceding calendar year. At December 31, 2015, electric deliveries under the ROA program were at the ten-percent limit and alternative electric suppliers were providing 751 MW of generation service to ROA customers. Of Consumers’ 1.8 million electric customers, 304 customers, or 0.02 percent, purchased generation service under the ROA program.



In early 2015, members of the Michigan Senate and House of Representatives introduced various bills related to energy policy. Among other things, the bills propose a range of changes to ROA, including eliminating ROA, maintaining the existing ROA program but imposing conditions on a customer’s return to utility service, and raising the ROA limit. If the ROA limit were increased or if electric generation service in Michigan were deregulated, it could have a material adverse effect on Consumers’ financial results and operations. Presently, the Michigan Senate and House of Representatives are considering two separate but similar pieces of legislation to address energy policy, including ROA. Consumers is unable to predict the form and timing of any final legislation.



Consumers also faces competition or potential competition associated with:



·industrial customers relocating all or a portion of their production capacity outside of Consumers’ service territory for economic reasons

·municipalities owning or operating competing electric delivery systems

·customer self-generation











Consumers addresses this competition by monitoring activity in adjacent geographical areas, by providing non-energy services and value to customers through Consumers’ rates and service, and by offering tariff-based incentives that support economic development.



Consumers Gas Utility



Gas Utility Operations:Consumers’ gas utility operations, which include the purchase, transmission, storage, distribution, and sale of natural gas, generated operating revenue of $1.9 billion in 2015, $2.4 billion in 2014, and $2.1 billion in 2013. Consumers’ gas utility customer base consists of a mix of primarily residential, commercial, and diversified industrial customers in Michigan’s Lower Peninsula.



Presented in the following illustration is Consumers’ 2015 gas utility operating revenue of $1.9 billion by customer class:







Consumers’ gas utility operations are not dependent on a single customer, or even a few customers, and the loss of any one or even a few of Consumers’ largest customers is not reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on Consumers’ financial condition.



In 2015, deliveries of natural gas, including off-system transportation deliveries, through Consumers’ pipeline and distribution network, totaled 356 bcf, which included GCC deliveries of 57 bcf. In 2014, deliveries of natural gas, including off-system transportation deliveries, through Consumers’ pipeline and distribution network, totaled 373 bcf, which included GCC deliveries of 65 bcf. Consumers’ gas utility operations are seasonal. Consumers injects natural gas into storage during the summer months for use during the winter months when the demand for natural gas is higher. Peak demand occurs in the winter due to colder temperatures and the resulting use of natural gas as a heating fuel. During 2015, 42 percent of the natural gas supplied to all customers during the winter months was supplied from storage.








Table of ContentsPresented in the following illustration are Consumers’ monthly weather-adjusted gas deliveries (deliveries adjusted to reflect normal weather conditions) to its customers, including GCC deliveries, during 2015 and 2014:Gas Utility Properties:Consumers’ gas transmission, storage, and distribution system consists of:·1,686 miles of transmission lines·15 gas storage fields with a total storage capacity of 309 bcf and a working gas volume of 151 bcf·27,537 miles of distribution mains·seven compressor stations with a total of 157,939 installed and available horsepower23






Gas Utility Supply:In 2015, Consumers purchased 69 percent of the gas it delivered from U.S. producers and five percent from Canadian producers. The remaining 26 percent was purchased from authorized GCC suppliers and delivered by Consumers to customers in the GCC program. Presented in the following illustration are the supply arrangements for the gas Consumers delivered to GCC and GCR customers during 2015:







Firm gas transportation or firm city-gate contracts are those that define a fixed amount, price, and delivery time frame. Consumers’ firm gas transportation contracts are with ANR Pipeline Company, Great Lakes Gas Transmission Limited Partnership, Panhandle Eastern Pipe Line Company, and Trunkline Gas Company, LLC, each a non-affiliated company. Under these contracts, Consumers purchases and transports gas to Michigan for ultimate delivery to its customers. Consumers’ firm gas transportation contracts expire through 2023 and provide for the delivery of 47 percent of Consumers’ total gas supply requirements in 2016. Consumers purchases the balance of its required gas supply under firm city-gate contracts and through authorized suppliers under the GCC program.



Gas Utility Competition:Competition exists in various aspects of Consumers’ gas utility business. Competition comes from GCC and from alternative fuels and energy sources, such as propane, oil, and electricity.



Enterprises Segment—Non-Utility Operations and Investments



CMS Energy’s enterprises segment, through various subsidiaries and certain equity investments, is engaged primarily in domestic independent power production and the marketing of independent power production. The enterprises segment’s operating revenue was $190 million in 2015, $299 million in 2014, and $181 million in 2013.











Independent Power Production:At December 31, 2015, CMS Energy had ownership interests in independent power plants totaling 1,177 MW or 1,077 net MW. (Net MW reflects that portion of the capacity relating to CMS Energy’s ownership interests.) Presented in the following table are CMS Energy’s interests in independent power plants at December 31, 2015:

2In December 2015, capital upgrades and modifications to the plant’s turbines increased gross capacity from 710 MW to 752 MW.



The operating revenue from independent power production was $17 million in 2015, $18 million in 2014, and $17 million in 2013. CMS Energy’s independent power production business faces competition from generators, marketers and brokers, and utilities marketing power in the wholesale market.



Energy Resource Management:CMS ERM purchases and sells energy commodities in support of CMS Energy’s generating facilities with a focus on optimizing CMS Energy’s independent power production portfolio. In 2015, CMS ERM marketed eight bcf of natural gas and 4,579 GWh of electricity. Electricity marketed by CMS ERM was generated by independent power production of the enterprises segment and by unrelated third parties. CMS ERM’s operating revenue was $173 million in 2015, $281 million in 2014, and $164 million in 2013.



Other Businesses



EnerBank:EnerBank is a Utah state-chartered, FDIC-insured industrial bank providing unsecured consumer installment loans for financing home improvements. EnerBank’s operating revenue was $101 million in 2015, $80 million in 2014, and $64 million in 2013.



CMS ENERGY AND CONSUMERS REGULATION



CMS Energy, Consumers, and their subsidiaries are subject to regulation by various federal, state, and local governmental agencies, including those described in the following sections.



FERC and NERC



FERC has exercised limited jurisdiction over several independent power plants and exempt wholesale generators in which CMS Enterprises has ownership interests, as well as over CMS ERM, CMS Gas Transmission, and DIG. FERC’s jurisdiction includes, among other things, acquisitions, operations, disposals of certain assets and facilities, services provided and rates charged, and conduct among affiliates. FERC also has limited jurisdiction over holding company matters with respect to CMS Energy. FERC, in connection with NERC and with regional reliability organizations, also regulates generation and











transmission owners and operators, load serving entities, purchase and sale entities, and others with regard to reliability of the bulk power system.



FERC regulates limited aspects of Consumers’ gas business, principally compliance with FERC capacity release rules, shipping rules, the prohibition against certain buy/sell transactions, and the price-reporting rule.



FERC also regulates certain aspects of Consumers’ electric operations, including compliance with FERC accounting rules, wholesale and transmission rates, operation of licensed hydroelectric generating plants, transfers of certain facilities, corporate mergers, and issuances of securities.



MPSC



Consumers is subject to the jurisdiction of the MPSC, which regulates public utilities in Michigan with respect to retail utility rates, accounting, utility services, certain facilities, certain asset transfers, corporate mergers, and other matters.



The Michigan Attorney General, ABATE, the MPSC Staff, and certain other parties typically participate in MPSC proceedings concerning Consumers. These parties often challenge various aspects of those proceedings, including the prudence of Consumers’ policies and practices, and seek cost disallowances and other relief. The parties also have appealed significant MPSC orders.



Rate Proceedings:For information regarding open rate proceedings, see Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—MD&A—Outlook and Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements—Note 3, Regulatory Matters.



Other Regulation



The U.S. Secretary of Energy regulates imports and exports of natural gas and has delegated various aspects of this jurisdiction to FERC and the DOE’s Office of Fossil Fuels.



The U.S. Department of Transportation Office of Pipeline Safety regulates the safety and security of gas pipelines through the Natural Gas Pipeline Safety Act of 1968 and subsequent laws.



EnerBank is regulated by the Utah Department of Financial Institutions and the FDIC.



Energy Legislation



CMS Energy, Consumers, and their subsidiaries are subject to various legislative-driven matters, including Michigan’s 2008 Energy Law. This law requires that at least ten percent of Consumers’ electric sales volume come from renewable energy sources. It also allows electric customers in Consumers’ service territory to buy electric generation service from alternative electric suppliers in an aggregate amount up to ten percent of Consumers’ weather-adjusted retail sales of the preceding calendar year. For additional information regarding Consumers’ renewable energy plan and electric ROA, see Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—MD&A—Outlook.



CMS ENERGY AND CONSUMERS ENVIRONMENTAL COMPLIANCE



CMS Energy, Consumers, and their subsidiaries are subject to various federal, state, and local regulations for environmental quality, including air and water quality, solid waste management, and other matters. Consumers expects to recover costs to comply with environmental regulations in customer rates, but cannot guarantee this result. For additional information concerning environmental matters, see Item 1A. Risk Factors and Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Notes to the Consolidated











Financial Statements—Note 4, Contingencies and Commitments and Note 11, Asset Retirement Obligations.



CMS Energy has recorded a $58 million liability for its subsidiaries’ obligations associated with Bay Harbor and Consumers has recorded a $114 million liability for its obligations at a number of MGP sites. For additional information, see Item 1A. Risk Factors and Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements—Note 4, Contingencies and Commitments.



Air:Consumers continues to install state-of-the-art emissions control equipment at its electric generating plants. Consumers estimates that it will incur capital expenditures of $84 million from 2016 through 2020 to comply with present and future federal and state environmental regulations that will require extensive reductions in nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxides, particulate matter, and mercury emissions. Consumers’ estimate may increase if additional or more stringent laws or regulations are adopted, including regulations regarding greenhouse gases.



Solid Waste Disposal:Costs related to the construction, operation, and closure of solid waste disposal facilities for coal ash are significant. Consumers’ solid waste disposal areas are regulated under Michigan’s solid waste rules. In April 2015, the EPA published a final rule regulating CCRs, such as coal ash, under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act. The final rule adopts minimum standards for beneficially reusing and disposing of non-hazardous CCRs. The rule establishes new minimum requirements for site location, groundwater monitoring, flood protection, storm water design, fugitive dust control, and public disclosure of information. The rule also sets out conditions under which CCR units would be forced to cease receiving CCR and non-CCR waste and initiate closure based on the inability to achieve minimum safety standards, meet a location standard, or meet minimum groundwater standards. Consumers has converted all of its fly ash handling systems to dry systems to minimize applicable requirements. In addition, all of Consumers’ ash facilities have programs designed to protect the environment and are subject to quarterly MDEQ inspections. Consumers’ preliminary estimate of capital and cost of removal expenditures to comply with regulations relating to ash disposal is $243 million from 2016 through 2020.



Water:Consumers uses substantial amounts of water to operate and cool its electric generating plants. Water discharge quality is regulated and administered by the MDEQ under the federal NPDES program. To comply with such regulation, Consumers’ facilities have discharge monitoring programs. The EPA issued final regulations for wastewater discharges from electric generating plants in 2015. Consumers’ preliminary estimate of capital expenditures to comply with these regulations is $69 million from 2016 through 2020.



In 2014, the EPA finalized its cooling water intake rule, which requires Consumers to evaluate the biological impact of its cooling water intake systems and ensure that it is using the best technology available to minimize adverse environmental impacts. Consumers’ preliminary estimate of capital expenditures to comply with these regulations is $58 million from 2016 through 2020.



For further information concerning estimated capital expenditures related to air, solid waste disposal, and water see Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—MD&A—Outlook—Consumers Electric Utility Outlook and Uncertainties—Electric Environmental Outlook.



INSURANCE



CMS Energy and its subsidiaries, including Consumers, maintain insurance coverage generally similar to comparable companies in the same lines of business. The insurance policies are subject to terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions that might not fully compensate CMS Energy or Consumers for all losses. A portion of each loss is generally assumed by CMS Energy or Consumers in the form of deductibles and self-insured retentions that, in some cases, are substantial. As CMS Energy or Consumers








Table of Contentsrenews its policies, it is possible that some of the present insurance coverage may not be renewed or obtainable on commercially reasonable terms due to restrictive insurance markets.CMS Energy’s and Consumers’ present insurance program does not cover the risks of certain environmental costs, such as the cleanup of sites owned by CMS Energy or Consumers, or claims for the long-term storage or disposal of pollutants or for air pollution.EMPLOYEESPresented in the following table are the number of employees of CMS Energy and Consumers:December 31201520142013CMS Energy,   including ConsumersFull-time   employees7,7117,6717,415Seasonal   employees13933321Part-time   employees544345Total employees7,8047,7477,781ConsumersFull-time   employees7,3397,3367,089Seasonal   employees13933321Part-time   employees161925Total employees7,3947,3887,4351Consumers’ seasonal workforce peaked at 477 employees during 2015, 394 employees during 2014, and 321 employees during 2013.
