Consumers



Consumers has served Michigan customers since 1886. Consumers
    was incorporated in Maine in 1910 and became a Michigan
    corporation in 1968. Consumers owns and operates electric
    distribution and generation facilities and gas transmission,
    storage, and distribution facilities. It provides electricityand/ornatural gas to 6.8 million of Michigan’s
    10 million residents. Consumers’ rates and certain
    other aspects of its business are subject to the jurisdiction of
    the MPSC and FERC, as described in “CMS Energy and
    Consumers Regulation” in this Item 1.



Consumers’ consolidated operating revenue was
    $6.2 billion in 2010, $6.0 billion in 2009, and
    $6.4 billion in 2008. For further information about
    operating revenue, net operating income, and identifiable assets
    and liabilities attributable to Consumers’ electric and gas
    utility operations, see Item 8. Financial Statements and
    Supplementary Data, Consumers’ Selected Financial
    Information, Consolidated Financial Statements, and Notes to
    Consolidated Financial Statements.



Consumers owns its principal properties in fee, except that most
    electric lines and gas mains are located below public roads or
    on land owned by others and are accessed by Consumers through
    easements and other rights. Almost all of Consumers’
    properties are subject to the lien of its First Mortgage Bond
    Indenture. For additional information on Consumers’
    properties, see Consumers Electric Utility — Electric
    Utility Properties and Consumers Gas Utility — Gas
    Utility Properties in the “Business Segments” section
    of this Item 1.





In 2010, Consumers served 1.8 million electric customers
    and 1.7 million gas customers in Michigan’s Lower
    Peninsula. Presented in the following map is Consumers’
    service territory:15




BUSINESS
    SEGMENTS



Consumers
    Electric Utility



Electric Utility Operations:Consumers’
    electric utility operations, which include the generation,
    purchase, distribution, and sale of electricity, generated
    operating revenue of $3.8 billion in 2010,
    $3.4 billion in 2009, and $3.6 billion in 2008.
    Consumers’ electric utility customer base consists of a mix
    of residential, commercial, and diversified industrial customers
    in Michigan’s Lower Peninsula. The automotive industry
    represented six percent of Consumers’ 2010 electric utility
    operating revenue. Presented in the following illustration is
    Consumers’ 2010 electric utility operating revenue of
    $3.8 billion by customer class:







Consumers’ electric utility operations are not dependent on
    a single customer, or even a few customers, and the loss of any
    one or even a few of its largest customers is not reasonably
    likely to have a material adverse effect on Consumers’
    financial condition.



In 2010, Consumers’ electric deliveries, excluding
    intersystem deliveries, were 38 million MWh, which included
    ROA deliveries of four million MWh, consistent with the
    ten-percent cap. Net bundled sales were 34 million MWh in
    2010. In 2009, Consumers’ electric deliveries, excluding
    intersystem deliveries, were 36 million MWh, which included
    ROA deliveries of two million MWh, resulting in net bundled
    sales of 34 million MWh.



Consumers’ electric utility operations are seasonal. The
    consumption of electric energy typically increases in the summer
    months, due primarily to the use of air conditioners and other
    cooling equipment.





Presented in the following illustration are Consumers’
    monthly weather-adjusted electric deliveries (deliveries
    adjusted to reflect normal weather conditions) to its customers,
    including ROA deliveries, during 2010 and 2009:Consumers’ 2010 summer peak demand was 8,190 MW, which
    includes ROA demand of 555 MW. For the2009-2010winter period, Consumers’ peak demand was 6,093 MW,
    which includes ROA demand of 425 MW. As required by MISO
    reserve margin requirements, Consumers owns or controls, through
    long-term contracts, capacity necessary to supply its projected
    firm peak load and necessary reserve margin for summer 2011.17




Electric Utility Properties:At
    December 31, 2010, Consumers’ electric generating

(a)Weighted-average fuel costs



In 2010, Consumers’ four coal-fueled generating sites
    burned 10 million tons of coal and produced a combined
    total of 17,879 GWh of electricity, which represented
    48 percent of the energy provided by Consumers to meet
    customer demand.



In order to obtain its coal requirements, Consumers enters into
    physical coal supply contracts. At December 31, 2010,
    Consumers had contracts to purchase coal through 2013; these
    contracts total $315 million. All of Consumers’ coal
    supply contracts have fixed prices. At December 31, 2010,
    Consumers had 85 percent of its 2011 expected coal
    requirements under contract, as well as a41-daysupply of coal on hand.



In conjunction with its coal supply contracts, Consumers leases
    a fleet of rail cars and has long-term transportation contracts
    with various companies to provide rail and vessel services for
    delivery of purchased coal to Consumers’ generating
    facilities. Consumers’ coal transportation contracts expire
    from 2011 through 2014; these contracts total $445 million.





Consumers participates in the Midwest Energy Market. Consumers
    offers its generation into the market on a day-ahead and
    real-time basis and bids for power in the market to serve the
    demand of its customers. Consumers is a net purchaser of power
    and supplements its generation capability with purchases from
    the market to meet its customers’ needs during peak demand
    periods.



At December 31, 2010, Consumers had unrecognized future
    commitments (amounts for which liabilities, in accordance with
    GAAP, have not been recorded on its balance sheet) to purchase
    capacity and energy under long-term PPAs with various generating
    plants. These contracts require monthly capacity payments based
    on the plants’ availability or deliverability. These
    payments for 2011 through 2030 total $15.3 billion and
    range from $822 million to $1 billion annually for
    each of the next five years. These amounts may vary depending on
    plant availability and fuel costs. For further information about
    Consumers’ future capacity and energy purchase obligations,
    see Item 7. MD&A, “Capital Resources and
    Liquidity.”



Consumers
    Gas Utility



Gas
    Utility Operations:



Consumers’ gas utility operations, which include the
    purchase, transmission, storage, distribution, and sale of
    natural gas, generated operating revenue of $2.4 billion in
    2010, $2.6 billion in 2009, and $2.8 billion in 2008.
    Consumers’ gas utility customer base consists of a mix of
    residential, commercial, and diversified industrial customers in
    Michigan’s Lower Peninsula. Presented in the following
    illustration is Consumers’ 2010 gas utility operating
    revenue by customer class:







Consumers’ gas utility operations are not dependent on a
    single customer, or even a few customers, and the loss of any
    one or even a few of its largest customers is not reasonably
    likely to have a material adverse effect on Consumers’
    financial condition.



In 2010, deliveries of natural gas, including off-system
    transportation deliveries, through Consumers’ pipeline and
    distribution network totaled 317 bcf, which included GCC
    deliveries of 36 bcf. In 2009, deliveries of natural gas,
    including off-system transportation deliveries, through
    Consumers’ pipeline and distribution network totaled 319
    bcf, which included GCC deliveries of 27 bcf. Consumers’
    gas utility operations are seasonal. Consumers injects natural
    gas into storage during the summer months for use during the
    winter months when the demand for natural gas is higher. Peak
    demand occurs in the winter due to colder temperatures and the
    resulting use of natural gas as a heating fuel. During 2010,
    46 percent of the natural gas supplied to all customers
    during the winter months





was supplied from storage. Presented in the following
    illustration are Consumers’ monthly weather-adjusted gas
    deliveries to its customers, including GCC deliveries, during
    2010 and 2009:Gas Utility Properties:Consumers’ gas
    distribution and transmission system located in Michigan’s
    Lower Peninsula consists of:•26,585 miles of distribution mains;•1,664 miles of transmission lines;•seven compressor stations with a total of 150,475 installed and
    available horsepower; and•15 gas storage fields with an aggregate storage capacity of 307
    bcf and a working storage capacity of 142 bcf.Gas Supply:In 2010, Consumers purchased
    61 percent of the gas it delivered from U.S. producers
    and 21 percent from Canadian producers. The remaining
    18 percent was purchased from authorized GCC suppliers and22




delivered by Consumers to customers in the GCC program.
    Presented in the following illustration are the supply
    arrangements for the gas Consumers delivered to GCC and GCR
    customers during 2010:







Firm transportation or firm city-gate contracts are those that
    define a fixed amount, price, and delivery time frame.
    Consumers’ firm gas transportation contracts are with ANR
    Pipeline Company, Great Lakes Gas Transmission, L.P., Panhandle,
    Trunkline, and Vector Pipeline L.P. Under these contracts,
    Consumers purchases and transports gas to Michigan for ultimate
    delivery to its customers. Consumers’ firm gas
    transportation contracts expire through 2017 and provide for the
    delivery of 71 percent of Consumers’ total gas supply
    requirements.



Consumers purchases the balance of its required gas supply under
    firm city-gate contracts and through authorized suppliers under
    the GCC program. Consumers may also utilize incremental firm
    transportation contracts and interruptible transportation
    contracts to purchase its gas supply. Under interruptible
    transportation contracts, the transportation provider is
    permitted to interrupt service. Consumers’ use of
    incremental firm transportation contracts and interruptible
    transportation contracts is generally during off-peak summer
    months and after Consumers has fully utilized the services under
    the firm transportation contracts. The amount of interruptible
    transportation service and its use vary primarily with the price
    for this service and the availability and price of purchased and
    transported spot supplies.



Enterprises
    Segment — Non-Utility Operations and
    Investments



CMS Energy’s enterprises segment, through various
    subsidiaries and certain equity investments, is engaged
    primarily in domestic IPP and the marketing of IPP. In 2007, the
    enterprises segment made a significant change in business
    strategy by exiting the international marketplace and refocusing
    on its independent power business in the U.S.



The enterprises segment’s operating revenue included in
    Income From Continuing Operations in CMS Energy’s
    Consolidated Financial Statements was $238 million in 2010,
    $216 million in 2009, and $365 million in 2008. The
    enterprises segment’s operating revenue included in Income
    (Loss) From Discontinued Operations in CMS Energy’s
    Consolidated Financial Statements was $10 million in 2010,
    $7 million in 2009, and $14 million in 2008.



IPP:While owned by CMS Enterprises, CMS Generation
    invested in and operated non-utility power generation plants in
    the U.S. and abroad. In 2007, CMS Enterprises sold CMS
    Generation and all of CMS





Enterprises’ international assets to third parties and
    transferred its domestic independent power plant operations to
    its subsidiary, HYDRA-CO.



The operating revenue from IPP included in Income From
    Continuing Operations in CMS Energy’s Consolidated
    Financial Statements was $18 million in 2010,
    $18 million in 2009, and $22 million in 2008. The
    operating revenue from IPP included in Income (Loss) From
    Discontinued Operations in CMS Energy’s Consolidated
    Financial Statements was $10 million in 2010,
    $7 million in 2009, and $14 million in 2008.



IPP Properties:At December 31, 2010, CMS
    Energy had ownership interests in independent power plants
    totaling 1,166 gross MW or 1,066 net MW. (Net MW
    reflects that portion of the gross capacity relating to CMS
    Energy’s ownership interests.)

    generating facilities. In 2010, CMS ERM marketed 15 bcf of
    natural gas and 2,308 GWh of electricity. All marketed
    electricity was generated by IPPs of the enterprises segment.
    CMS ERM’s operating revenue included in Income From
    Continuing Operations in CMS Energy’s Consolidated
    Financial Statements was $220 million in 2010,
    $198 million in 2009, and $343 million in 2008.



Natural Gas Transmission:CMS Gas Transmission
    owned, developed, and managed domestic and international natural
    gas facilities. In 2007, CMS Gas Transmission sold a portfolio
    of its businesses in Argentina and its northern Michigan
    non-utility natural gas assets to Lucid Energy, and its
    investment in GasAtacama to Endesa S.A. In 2008, CMS Gas
    Transmission completed the sale of its investment in TGN. CMS
    Gas Transmission’s operating revenue included in Income
    From Continuing Operations in CMS Energy’s Consolidated
    Financial Statements was less than $1 million in each of
    2010, 2009, and 2008.



International Energy Distribution:In 2007, CMS
    Energy exited this line of business when it sold its ownership
    interests in SENECA and CMS Energy Brasil S.A.

    Competition



Consumers’ electric utility business is subject to actual
    and potential competition from many sources, in both the
    wholesale and retail markets, as well as in electric generation,
    electric delivery, and retail services.



The Customer Choice Act allows all of Consumers’ electric
    customers to buy electric generation service from Consumers or
    from an alternative electric supplier. The 2008 Energy
    Legislation revised the Customer Choice Act by limiting
    alternative electric supply to ten percent of weather-adjusted
    retail sales for the preceding calendar year. At
    December 31, 2010, electric deliveries under the ROA
    program were at the ten percent limit. Alternative electric
    suppliers were providing 807 MW of generation service to
    ROA customers.



Consumers also has competition or potential competition from:



•industrial customers relocating all or a portion of their
    production capacity outside Consumers’ service territory
    for economic reasons;







•municipalities owning or operating competing electric delivery
    systems;•customer self-generation; and•adjacent utilities that extend lines to customers in contiguous
    service territories.



Consumers addresses this competition by monitoring activity in
    adjacent areas and monitoring compliance with the MPSC’s
    and FERC’s rules, providing non-energy services, and
    providing tariff-based incentives that support economic
    development.



CMS ERM continues to focus on optimizing CMS Energy’s IPP
    portfolio. CMS Energy’s IPP business faces competition from
    generators, marketers and brokers, and utilities marketing power
    in the wholesale market.



Gas
    Competition



Competition exists in various aspects of Consumers’ gas
    utility business. Competition comes from other gas suppliers
    taking advantage of direct access to Consumers’ customers
    and from alternative fuels and energy sources, such as propane,
    oil, and electricity.



INSURANCE



CMS Energy and its subsidiaries, including Consumers, maintain
    insurance coverage generally similar to comparable companies in
    the same lines of business. The insurance policies are subject
    to terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions that might not
    fully compensate CMS Energy or Consumers for all losses. A
    portion of each loss is generally assumed by CMS Energy or
    Consumers in the form of deductibles and self-insured retentions
    that, in some cases, are substantial. As CMS Energy or Consumers
    renews its policies, it is possible that some of the present
    insurance coverage may not be renewed or obtainable on
    commercially reasonable terms due to restrictive insurance
    markets.



CMS Energy’s and Consumers’ present insurance program
    does not cover the risks of certain environmental cleanup costs
    and environmental damages, such as claims for air pollution,
    damage to sites owned by CMS Energy or Consumers, and some
    long-term storage or disposal of wastes.
