Consumers owns and operates electric distribution and generation facilities and gas transmission, storage, and distribution facilities.  It provides electricity and/or natural gas to 6.5 million of Michigan’s 10 million residents.  Consumers’ rates and certain other aspects of its business are subject to the jurisdiction of the MPSC and FERC, as described in “CMS Energy and Consumers Regulation” in this Item 1.



Consumers’ consolidated operating revenue was $6.3 billion in 2013, $6.0 billion in 2012, and $6.3 billion in 2011.  For further information about operating revenue, operating income, and identifiable assets and liabilities attributable to Consumers’ electric and gas utility operations, see Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Consumers’ Selected Financial Information, Consolidated Financial Statements, and Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.



Consumers owns its principal properties in fee, except that most electric lines and gas mains are located below public roads or on land owned by others and are accessed by Consumers through easements and other rights.  Almost all of Consumers’ properties are subject to the lien of its First Mortgage Bond Indenture.  For additional information on Consumers’ properties, see Consumers Electric Utility — Electric Utility Properties and Consumers Gas Utility — Gas Utility Properties in the “Business Segments” section of this Item 1.








Table of ContentsIn 2013, Consumers served 1.8million electric customers and 1.7 million gas customers in Michigan’s Lower Peninsula.  Presented in the following map is Consumers’ service territory:14



Table of ContentsBUSINESS SEGMENTSCONSUMERSELECTRICUTILITYElectric Utility Operations:Consumers’ electric utility operations, which include the generation, purchase, distribution, and sale of electricity, generated operating revenue of $4.2 billion in 2013, $4.0 billion in 2012, and $3.9 billion in 2011.  Consumers’ electric utility customer base consists of a mix of residential, commercial, and diversified industrial customers in Michigan’s Lower Peninsula.Presented in the following illustration is Consumers’ 2013 electric utility operating revenue of $4.2 billion by customer class:Consumers’ electric utility operations are not dependent on a single customer, or even a few customers, and the loss of any one or even a few of Consumers’ largest customers is not reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on Consumers’ financial condition.In 2013, Consumers’ electric deliveries were 37 billion kWh, which included ROA deliveries of four billion kWh, resulting in net bundled sales of 33 billion kWh.  In 2012, Consumers’ electric deliveries were 38 billion kWh, which included ROA deliveries of four billion kWh, resulting in net bundled sales of 34 billion kWh.Consumers’ electric utility operations are seasonal.  The consumption of electric energy typically increases in the summer months, due primarily to the use of air conditioners and other cooling equipment.15






Presented in the following illustration are Consumers’ monthly weather-adjusted electric deliveries (deliveries adjusted to reflect normal weather conditions) to its customers, including ROA deliveries, during 2013 and 2012:







Consumers’ 2013 summer peak demand was 8,509 MW, which included ROA demand of 556 MW.  For the 2012-2013 winter period, Consumers’ peak demand was 5,845 MW, which included ROA demand of 461 MW.  As required by MISO reserve margin requirements, Consumers owns or controls, through long-term contracts, capacity required to supply most of its projected firm peak load and necessary reserve margin for summer 2014.  Consumers expects to acquire the balance of its 2014 requirements through MISO’s forward capacity auction scheduled to be conducted in April 2014.



Electric Utility Properties:Consumers’ distribution system consists of:



·422 miles of high-voltage distribution radial lines operating at 120 kilovolts or above;

·4,259 miles of high-voltage distribution overhead lines operating at 23 kilovolts, 46 kilovolts, and 69 kilovolts;

·18 miles of high-voltage distribution underground lines operating at 23 kilovolts and 46 kilovolts;

·55,996 miles of electric distribution overhead lines;

·10,210 miles of underground distribution lines; and

·substations with an aggregate transformer capacity of 24 million kVA.



Consumers is interconnected to the interstate high-voltage electric transmission system owned by Michigan Electric Transmission Company, LLC, a non-affiliated company, and operated by MISO.  Consumers is also interconnected to neighboring utilities and to other transmission systems.











At December 31, 2013, Consumers’ electric generating system consisted of the following:

Table of Contents6Represents Consumers’ share of net pumped-storage generation.  The pumped-storage facility consumes electricity to pump water during off-peak hours for storage in order to generate electricity later during peak-demand hours.7Includes purchases from the MISO energy market, long-term purchase contracts, and seasonal purchases.8Includes 1,240 MW of purchased contract capacity from the MCV Facility and 778 MW of purchased contract capacity from Palisades.9Includes 2,381 GWh of purchased energy from the MCV Facility and 6,915 GWh of purchased energy from Palisades.Consumers’ generation capacity is a measure of the maximum electric output that Consumers has available to meet peak load requirements.  As shown in the following illustration, Consumers’ 2013 generation capacity of 8,603 MW, including purchased capacity of 2,619 MW, relied on a variety of fuel sources:18






Electric Utility Supply:Over the last five years, Consumers’ electric supply came from the following sources:

1Represents Consumers’ share of net pumped-storage generation.  The pumped-storage facility consumes electricity to pump water during off-peak hours for storage in order to generate electricity later during peak-demand hours.



2Includes purchases from long-term purchase contracts.



3Includes purchases from the MISO energy market and seasonal purchases.



During 2013, Consumers purchased 49 percent of the electricity it provided to customers through long-term PPAs, seasonal purchases, and the MISO energy market.  Consumers offers its generation into the MISO energy market on a day-ahead and real-time basis and bids for power in the market to serve the demand of its customers.  Consumers is a net purchaser of power and supplements its generation capability with purchases from the MISO energy market to meet its customers’ needs during peak demand periods.



At December 31, 2013, Consumers had unrecognized future commitments (amounts for which liabilities, in accordance with GAAP, have not been recorded on its balance sheet) to purchase capacity and energy under long-term PPAs with various generating plants.  These contracts require monthly capacity payments based on the plants’ availability or deliverability.  The payments for 2014 through 2032 are estimated to total $12.1 billion and to range from $917 million to $1.1 billion annually for each of the next five years.  These amounts may vary depending on plant availability and fuel costs.  For further information about Consumers’ future capacity and energy purchase obligations, see Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, MD&A – Capital Resources and Liquidity and Note 3, Contingencies and Commitments – Contractual Commitments.



During 2013, 46 percent of the energy Consumers provided to customers was generated by its four coal-fueled generating sites, which burned nine million tons of coal and produced a combined total of 15,951 GWh of electricity.



In order to obtain the coal it needs, Consumers enters into physical coal supply contracts.  At December 31, 2013, Consumers had contracts to purchase coal through 2015; payment obligations under these contracts totaled $163 million.  Consumers’ rail-supplied coal contracts have fixed prices with the exception of one contract, which is for the purchase of coal through 2014 and contains market-based pricing.  Consumers’ vessel-supplied coal contracts have fixed base prices that are adjusted monthly to reflect changes to the fuel cost of vessel transportation.  At December 31, 2013, Consumers had











79 percent of its 2014 expected coal requirements under contract, as well as a 24-day supply of coal on hand.



In conjunction with its coal supply contracts, Consumers leases a fleet of rail cars and has transportation contracts with various companies to provide rail and vessel services for delivery of purchased coal to Consumers’ generating facilities.  Consumers’ coal transportation contracts expire through 2014; payment obligations under these contracts totaled $227 million.



During 2013, four percent of the energy Consumers provided to customers was generated by gas-fueled generating sites, which burned 12 bcf of natural gas and produced a combined total of 1,415 GWh of electricity.



In order to obtain the gas it needs, Consumers’ electric utility purchases gas from the market near the time of consumption, at prices that allow it to compete in the electric generation market.  For D.E. Karn, units 3 and 4, and the Zeeland plant, Consumers purchases gas from the market and transports the gas to the facilities on a firm basis.  For its smaller combustion turbines, Consumers’ electric utility purchases and transports gas to its facilities as a bundled-rate tariff customer of either the gas utility or DTE Gas.



The cost of all fuels consumed, shown in the following table, fluctuates with the mix of fuel used.

Electric Utility Competition:Consumers’ electric utility business is subject to actual and potential competition from many sources, in both the wholesale and retail markets, as well as in electric generation, electric delivery, and retail services.



A Michigan statute enacted in 2000 allows Consumers’ electric customers to buy electric generation service from Consumers or from alternative electric suppliers.  The 2008 Energy Law revised the statute by limiting alternative electric supply to ten percent of Consumers’ weather-adjusted retail sales for the preceding calendar year.  At December 31, 2013, Consumers’ electric deliveries under the ROA program were at the ten-percent limit and alternative electric suppliers were providing 787 MW of electric generation service to 310 ROA customers.



In December 2013, a bill was introduced to the Michigan House of Representatives that, if enacted, would revise the 2008 Energy Law by removing the ten-percent limit and allowing all of Consumers’ electric customers to take service from alternative electric suppliers.  Presently, the proportion of Consumers’ electric deliveries under the ROA program and on the ROA waiting list is 25 percent.  The bill also proposes to deregulate electric generation service in Michigan within two years.  No definitive action has been taken on this bill or on a similar bill introduced to the Michigan Senate in February 2013.  The Senate bill, if enacted, would revise the 2008 Energy Law and allow customers on the ROA program waiting list to take service from alternative electric suppliers.  The Senate bill also proposes an increase in the cap of six percentage points per year from 2014 through 2016.



Consumers is unable to predict the outcome of these legislative proposals.  In addition, the Michigan legislature has conducted hearings on the subject of energy competition.  If the ROA limit were increased or if electric generation service in Michigan were deregulated, it could have a material adverse effect on Consumers’ financial results and operations.











Consumers also has competition or potential competition from:



·industrial customers relocating all or a portion of their production capacity outside of Consumers’ service territory for economic reasons;

·municipalities owning or operating competing electric delivery systems; and

·customer self-generation.



Consumers addresses this competition by monitoring activity in adjacent areas and compliance with the MPSC’s and FERC’s rules, by providing non-energy services and value to customers through Consumers’ rates and service, and by offering tariff-based incentives that support economic development.



CONSUMERS GAS UTILITY



Gas Utility Operations:Consumers’ gas utility operations, which include the purchase, transmission, storage, distribution, and sale of natural gas, generated operating revenue of $2.1 billion in 2013, $2.0 billion in 2012, and $2.3 billion in 2011.  Consumers’ gas utility customer base consists of a mix of residential, commercial, and diversified industrial customers in Michigan’s Lower Peninsula.



Presented in the following illustration is Consumers’ 2013 gas utility operating revenue of $2.1 billion by customer class:







Consumers’ gas utility operations are not dependent on a single customer, or even a few customers, and the loss of any one or even a few of Consumers’ largest customers is not reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on Consumers’ financial condition.



In 2013, deliveries of natural gas, including off-system transportation deliveries, through Consumers’ pipeline and distribution network, totaled 352 bcf, which included GCC deliveries of 63 bcf.  In 2012, deliveries of natural gas, including off-system transportation deliveries, through Consumers’ pipeline and distribution network, totaled 329 bcf, which included GCC deliveries of 49 bcf.  Consumers’ gas utility operations are seasonal.  Consumers injects natural gas into storage during the summer months for use








Table of Contentsduring the winter months when the demand for natural gas is higher.  Peak demand occurs in the winter due to colder temperatures and the resulting use of natural gas as a heating fuel.  During 2013, 53 percent of the natural gas supplied to all customers during the winter months was supplied from storage.Presented in the following illustration are Consumers’ monthly weather-adjusted gas deliveries (deliveries adjusted to reflect normal weather conditions) to its customers, including GCC deliveries, during 2013 and 2012:Gas Utility Properties:Consumers’ gas distribution and transmission system consists of:·26,819 miles of distribution mains;·1,661 miles of transmission lines;·seven compressor stations with a total of 150,027 installed and available horsepower; and·15 gas storage fields with an aggregate storage capacity of 309 bcf and a working storage capacity of 143 bcf.22






Gas Utility Supply:In 2013, Consumers purchased 66 percent of the gas it delivered from U.S. producers and 10 percent from Canadian producers.  The remaining 24 percent was purchased from authorized GCC suppliers and delivered by Consumers to customers in the GCC program.  Presented in the following illustration are the supply arrangements for the gas Consumers delivered to GCC and GCR customers during 2013:







Firm transportation or firm city-gate contracts are those that define a fixed amount, price, and delivery time frame.  Consumers’ firm gas transportation contracts are with ANR Pipeline Company, Great Lakes Gas Transmission, L.P., Panhandle, and Trunkline.  Under these contracts, Consumers purchases and transports gas to Michigan for ultimate delivery to its customers.  Consumers’ firm gas transportation contracts expire through 2017 and provide for the delivery of 47 percent of Consumers’ total gas supply requirements.  Consumers purchases the balance of its required gas supply under firm city-gate contracts and through authorized suppliers under the GCC program.



Gas Utility Competition:Competition exists in various aspects of Consumers’ gas utility business.  Competition comes from GCC and from alternative fuels and energy sources, such as propane, oil, and electricity.



ENTERPRISESSEGMENT– NON-UTILITYOPERATIONSAND INVESTMENTS



CMS Energy’s enterprises segment, through various subsidiaries and certain equity investments, is engaged primarily in domestic independent power production and the marketing of independent power production.  The enterprises segment’s operating revenue was $181 million in 2013, $183 million in 2012, and $204 million in 2011.











Independent Power Production:At December 31, 2013, CMS Energy had ownership interests in independent power plants totaling 1,135 gross MW or 1,034 net MW.  (Net MW reflects that portion of the gross capacity relating to CMS Energy’s ownership interests.)  Presented in the following table are CMS Energy’s interests in independent power plants at December 31, 2013:

The operating revenue from independent power production was $17 million in 2013, $16 million in 2012, and $17 million in 2011.  CMS Energy’s independent power production business faces competition from generators, marketers and brokers, and utilities marketing power in the wholesale market.



Energy Resource Management:CMS ERM purchases and sells energy commodities in support of CMS Energy’s generating facilities and continues to focus on optimizing CMS Energy’s independent power production portfolio.  In 2013, CMS ERM marketed 11 bcf of natural gas and 3,596 GWh of electricity.  Electricity marketed by CMS ERM was generated by independent power production of the enterprises segment and unrelated third parties.  CMS ERM’s operating revenue included in income from continuing operations in CMS Energy’s consolidated financial statements was $164 million in 2013, $167 million in 2012, and $187 million in 2011.



OTHERBUSINESSES



EnerBank:EnerBank is a Utah state-chartered, FDIC-insured industrial bank providing unsecured consumer installment loans for financing home improvements.  EnerBank’s operating revenue included in income from continuing operations in CMS Energy’s consolidated financial statements was $64 million in 2013, $57 million in 2012, and $46 million in 2011.



CMS ENERGY AND CONSUMERS REGULATION



CMS Energy, Consumers, and their subsidiaries are subject to regulation by various federal, state, local, and foreign governmental agencies, including those described in the following sections.



FERC



FERC has exercised limited jurisdiction over several independent power plants and exempt wholesale generators in which CMS Enterprises has ownership interests, as well as over CMS ERM, CMS Gas Transmission, and DIG.  Among other things, FERC has jurisdiction over acquisitions, operations, and disposals of certain assets and facilities, services provided and rates charged, conduct among affiliates, and limited jurisdiction over holding company matters with respect to CMS Energy.  FERC, in connection with NERC and with regional reliability organizations, also regulates generation owners and operators, load serving entities, purchase and sale entities, and others with regard to reliability of the bulk power system.  FERC regulates limited aspects of Consumers’ gas business, principally compliance with FERC capacity release rules, shipping rules, the prohibition against certain buy/sell transactions, and the price-reporting rule.











FERC also regulates certain aspects of Consumers’ electric operations, including compliance with FERC accounting rules, wholesale rates, operation of licensed hydroelectric generating plants, transfers of certain facilities, corporate mergers, and issuances of securities.



MPSC



Consumers is subject to the jurisdiction of the MPSC, which regulates public utilities in Michigan with respect to retail utility rates, accounting, utility services, certain facilities, certain asset transfers, corporate mergers, and other matters.



The Michigan Attorney General, ABATE, the MPSC Staff, and certain other parties typically participate in MPSC proceedings concerning Consumers.  The Michigan Attorney General, ABATE, and others often appeal significant MPSC orders.



Rate Proceedings:For information regarding open rate proceedings, see Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, MD&A — Outlook and Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements — Note 2, Regulatory Matters.



OTHERREGULATION



The U.S. Secretary of Energy regulates imports and exports of natural gas and has delegated various aspects of this jurisdiction to FERC and the DOE’s Office of Fossil Fuels.



The U.S. Department of Transportation Office of Pipeline Safety regulates the safety and security of gas pipelines through the Natural Gas Pipeline Safety Act of 1968 and subsequent laws.



EnerBank is regulated by the State of Utah and the FDIC.



ENERGYLEGISLATION



CMS Energy, Consumers, and their subsidiaries are subject to various legislative-driven matters, including Michigan’s 2008 Energy Law.  This law requires that at least ten percent of Consumers’ electric sales volume come from renewable energy sources by 2015, and includes requirements for specific capacity additions.  The 2008 Energy Law also requires Consumers to prepare an energy optimization plan and achieve annual sales reduction targets through at least 2015.  The targets increase annually, with the goal of achieving a six percent reduction in customers’ electricity use and a four percent reduction in customers’ natural gas use by December 31, 2015.  The 2008 Energy Law also revised a Michigan statute by limiting alternative energy supply to ten percent of Consumers’ weather-adjusted retail sales of the preceding calendar year.  For additional information regarding Consumers’ renewable energy and energy optimization plans and electric ROA, see Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, MD&A — Outlook, “Consumers Electric Utility Business Outlook and Uncertainties.”



CMS ENERGY AND CONSUMERS ENVIRONMENTAL COMPLIANCE



CMS Energy, Consumers, and their subsidiaries are subject to various federal, state, and local regulations for environmental quality, including air and water quality, solid waste management, and other matters.  For additional information concerning environmental matters, see Item 1A. Risk Factors and Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements — Note 3, Contingencies and Commitments.



Consumers has recorded a significant liability for its obligations at a number of MGP sites.  For additional information, see Item 1A. Risk Factors and Item 8.  Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements — Note 3, Contingencies and Commitments.











Air:Consumers continues to install state-of-the-art emissions control equipment at its electric generating plants.  Consumers estimates that it will incur expenditures of $507 million from 2014 through 2018 to comply with present and future federal and state environmental regulations that will require extensive reductions in nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxides, particulate matter, and mercury emissions.  Consumers’ estimate may increase if additional or more stringent laws or regulations are adopted or implemented regarding greenhouse gases, including carbon dioxide.



Solid Waste Disposal:Costs related to the construction, operation, and closure of solid waste disposal facilities for coal ash are significant.  Consumers’ solid waste disposal areas are regulated under Michigan’s solid waste rules.  Consumers has converted all of its fly ash handling systems to dry systems.  All of Consumers’ ash facilities have programs designed to protect the environment and are subject to quarterly MDEQ inspections.  The EPA has proposed new federal regulations for ash disposal areas.  Consumers preliminarily estimates that it will incur expenditures of $204 million from 2014 through 2018 to comply with future regulations relating to ash disposal, assuming ash is regulated as a non-hazardous solid waste.



Water:Consumers uses significant amounts of water to operate and cool its electric generating plants.  Water discharge quality is regulated and administered by the MDEQ under the federal NPDES program.  To comply with such regulation, Consumers’ facilities have discharge monitoring programs.  The EPA is developing new regulations related to cooling water intake systems that likely will be finalized in early 2014.  Consumers does not presently expect to incur any major expenditures to comply with future regulations relating to cooling water intake systems through 2018.  Significant expenditures could be required beyond 2018, but until a rule is final, any potential expenditures are difficult to predict.  Consumers also expects the EPA to issue final federal regulations for wastewater discharges from electric generating plants in 2014.  Consumers’ preliminary estimate of expenditures to comply with these expected regulations is $131 million from 2014 through 2018.



For further information concerning estimated capital expenditures related to air, solid waste disposal, and water see Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, MD&A — Outlook, “Consumers Electric Utility Business Outlook and Uncertainties — Electric Environmental Estimates.”











INSURANCE



CMS Energy and its subsidiaries, including Consumers, maintain insurance coverage generally similar to comparable companies in the same lines of business.  The insurance policies are subject to terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions that might not fully compensate CMS Energy or Consumers for all losses.  A portion of each loss is generally assumed by CMS Energy or Consumers in the form of deductibles and self-insured retentions that, in some cases, are substantial.  As CMS Energy or Consumers renews its policies, it is possible that some of the present insurance coverage may not be renewed or obtainable on commercially reasonable terms due to restrictive insurance markets.



CMS Energy’s and Consumers’ present insurance program does not cover the risks of certain environmental cleanup costs and environmental damages, such as claims for air pollution, damage to sites owned by CMS Energy or Consumers, and some long-term storage or disposal of wastes.
