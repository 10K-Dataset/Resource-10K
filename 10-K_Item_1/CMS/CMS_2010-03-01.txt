ITEM 1. BUSINESS



GENERAL



CMS
    Energy



CMS Energy was formed in Michigan in 1987 and is an energy
    company operating primarily in Michigan. It is the parent
    holding company of several subsidiaries, including Consumers, an
    electric and gas utility, and CMS Enterprises, primarily a
    domestic IPP. Consumers serves individuals and businesses
    operating in the alternative energy, automotive, chemical,
    metal, and food products industries as well as a diversified
    group of other industries. CMS Enterprises, through its
    subsidiaries and equity investments, is engaged primarily in IPP
    and owns power generation facilities fueled mostly by natural
    gas and biomass.



CMS Energy manages its businesses by the nature of services each
    provides and operates, principally in three business segments:
    electric utility, gas utility, and enterprises, its non-utility
    operations and investments. Consumers’ consolidated
    operations account for substantially all of CMS Energy’s
    total assets, income, and operating revenue. CMS Energy’s
    consolidated operating revenue was $6.2 billion in 2009,
    $6.8 billion in 2008, and $6.5 billion in 2007.



For further information about operating revenue, net operating
    income, and identifiable assets and liabilities attributable to
    all of CMS Energy’s business segments and operations, see

    Energy Corporation’s Selected Financial Information,
    Consolidated Financial Statements, and Notes to Consolidated
    Financial Statements.



Consumers



Consumers was formed in Michigan in 1968 and is the successor to
    a corporation organized in Maine in 1910 that conducted business
    in Michigan from 1915 to 1968. Consumers owns and operates
    electric distribution and generation facilities and gas
    transmission, storage, and distribution facilities. It provides
    electricityand/ornatural gas to 6.5 million of Michigan’s
    10 million residents. Consumers’ rates and certain
    other aspects of its business are subject to the jurisdiction of
    the MPSC and the FERC, as described in “CMS Energy and
    Consumers Regulation” in this Item 1.



Consumers’ consolidated operating revenue was
    $6.0 billion in 2009, $6.4 billion in 2008, and
    $6.1 billion in 2007. For further information about
    operating revenue, net operating income, and identifiable assets
    and liabilities attributable to Consumers’ electric and gas
    utility operations, see Item 8. Financial Statements and
    Supplementary Data, Consumers Energy Company’s Selected
    Financial Information, Consolidated Financial Statements, and
    Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.



Consumers owns its principal properties in fee, except that most
    electric lines and gas mains are located below public roads or
    on land owned by others and are accessed by Consumers through
    easements and other rights. Almost all of Consumers’
    properties are subject to the lien of its First Mortgage Bond
    Indenture. For additional information on Consumers’
    properties, see the “Business Segments” section of
    Consumers Electric Utility, Electric Utility Properties, and
    “Business Segments” section of Consumers Gas Utility,
    Gas Utility Properties described later in this Item 1.





In 2009, Consumers served 1.8 million electric customers
    and 1.7 million gas customers in Michigan’s Lower
    Peninsula. The following is a map of Consumers’ service
    territory:15




BUSINESS
    SEGMENTS



Consumers
    Electric Utility



Electric Utility Operations:Consumers’
    electric utility operations, which include the generation,
    purchase, distribution, and sale of electricity, generated
    operating revenue of $3.4 billion in 2009,
    $3.6 billion in 2008, and $3.4 billion in 2007.
    Consumers’ electric utility customer base consists of a mix
    of residential, commercial, and diversified industrial customers
    in Michigan’s Lower Peninsula. The automotive industry
    represented five percent of Consumers’ 2009 electric
    utility operating revenue. The following is an illustration of
    Consumers’ 2009 electric utility operating revenue by
    customer class:







Consumers’ electric utility operations are not dependent on
    a single customer, or even a few customers, and the loss of any
    one or even a few of its largest customers is not reasonably
    likely to have a material adverse effect on its financial
    condition.



In 2009, Consumers’ electric deliveries, excluding
    intersystem deliveries, were 36 million MWh, which included
    ROA deliveries of 2 million MWh. In 2008, Consumers’
    electric deliveries, excluding intersystem deliveries, were
    37 million MWh, which included ROA deliveries of
    2 million MWh. Consumers’ electric utility operations
    are seasonal. The consumption of electric energy typically
    increases in the summer months, due primarily to the use of air
    conditioners and other cooling equipment.





The following is an illustration of Consumers’ monthly
    weather-adjusted electric deliveries to its customers, including
    ROA deliveries, during 2009 and 2008:Consumers’ 2009 summer peak demand was 7,756 MW, which
    includes ROA loads of 335 MW. For the2008-09winter period, Consumers’ peak demand was 5,857 MW,
    which includes ROA loads of 244 MW. As required by MISO
    reserve margin requirements, Consumers owns or controls, through
    long-term contracts, capacity necessary to supply its projected
    firm peak load and necessary reserve margin for summer 2010.17




Electric Utility Properties:At
    December 31, 2009, Consumers’ electric generating
    system consisted of the following:

Consumers’ distribution system includes:•409 miles of high-voltage distribution radial lines
    operating at 120 kilovolts or above;•4,244 miles of high-voltage distribution overhead lines
    operating at 23 kilovolts and 46 kilovolts;•17 subsurface miles of high-voltage distribution underground
    lines operating at 23 kilovolts and 46 kilovolts;•55,816 miles of electric distribution overhead lines;•9,976 miles of underground distribution lines; and•substations having an aggregate transformer capacity of
    24 million kVA.Consumers is interconnected to METC. METC owns an interstate
    high-voltage electric transmission system in Michigan and is
    interconnected with neighboring utilities as well as other
    transmission systems.Fuel Supply:As shown in the following
    illustration, Consumers’ 2009 generation capacity of
    8,954 MW, including capacity of 2,600 MW purchased
    under PPAs, came from a variety of sources:19




Consumers’ generation came from the following sources:

(a)Weighted average fuel costs



Consumers’ electric generating system is heavily dependent
    upon the availability of coal. In 2009, Consumers’ four
    coal-fueled generating sites burned 9 million tons of coal
    and produced a combined total of 17,255 GWh of electricity,
    which represented 96 percent of the energy generated by
    Consumers.



In order to obtain its coal requirements, Consumers enters into
    long-term and short-term physical coal supply contracts. At
    December 31, 2009, Consumers had six long-term and three
    spot-price contracts to purchase low-sulfur western coal through
    2012; these contracts total $233 million. Consumers also
    had four long-term and three spot-price contracts to purchase
    Appalachian coal through 2012; these contracts totaled
    $215 million. All of Consumers’ long-term contracts
    have fixed prices. Over the last ten years, Consumers has
    purchased 60 to 90 percent of its annual coal requirements
    through long-term contracts. At December 31, 2009,
    Consumers had 93 percent of its 2010 expected coal
    requirements under contract, as well as a47-daysupply of coal on-hand.



In conjunction with its coal supply contracts, Consumers leases
    a fleet of rail cars and has long-term transportation contracts
    with various companies to provide rail and vessel services for
    delivery of purchased coal to Consumers’ generating
    facilities. Consumers’ coal transportation contracts expire
    from 2010 through 2014.



Consumers participates in the Midwest Energy Market. Consumers
    offers its generation into the market on a day-ahead and
    real-time basis and bids for power in the market to serve its
    load. Consumers is a net purchaser of power and supplements its
    generation capability with purchases from the market to meet its
    customers needs during peak demand periods.



At December 31, 2009, Consumers had unrecognized future
    commitments to purchase capacity and energy under long-term PPAs
    with various generating plants. These contracts require monthly
    capacity payments based on the plants’ availability,
    whether or not power is delivered to Consumers, or
    deliverability. These payments for 2010 through 2030 total
    $13.2 billion and range from $780 million to
    $870 million annually for each of the next five





years. These amounts may vary depending on plant availability
    and fuel costs. For further information about Consumers’
    future capacity and energy purchase obligations, see
    Item 7. MD&A, “Capital Resources and
    Liquidity — Obligations and Commitments —
    Contractual Obligations.”



Consumers
    Gas Utility



Gas
    Utility Operations:



Consumers’ gas utility operations, which include the
    purchase, transmission, storage, distribution, and sale of
    natural gas, generated operating revenue of $2.6 billion in
    2009, $2.8 billion in 2008, and $2.6 billion in 2007.
    Consumers’ gas utility customer base consists of a mix of
    residential, commercial, and diversified industrial customers in
    Michigan’s Lower Peninsula. The following is an
    illustration of Consumers’ 2009 gas utility operating
    revenue by customer class:







Consumers’ gas utility operations are not dependent on a
    single customer, or even a few customers, and the loss of any
    one or even a few of its largest customers is not reasonably
    likely to have a material adverse effect on its financial
    condition.



In 2009, deliveries of natural gas sold through Consumers’
    pipeline and distribution network totaled 326 bcf, which
    included GCC deliveries of 27 bcf. In 2008, Consumers’
    deliveries of natural gas sold through its pipeline and
    distribution network totaled 344 bcf, which included GCC
    deliveries of 25 bcf. Consumers’ gas utility operations are
    seasonal. Consumers injects natural gas into storage during the
    summer months for use during the winter months when the demand
    for natural gas is higher. During 2009, 43 percent of the
    natural gas supplied to all customers during the winter months
    was supplied from storage. Peak demand occurs in the winter due
    to colder temperatures





and the resulting use of heating fuels. The following is an
    illustration of Consumers’ monthly weather-adjusted gas
    deliveries to its customers, including GCC deliveries, during
    2009 and 2008:Gas Utility Properties:Consumers’ gas
    distribution and transmission system located in Michigan’s
    Lower Peninsula consists of:•26,526 miles of distribution mains;•1,652 miles of transmission lines;•7 compressor stations with a total of 136,180 installed and
    available horsepower; and•15 gas storage fields with an aggregate storage capacity of 307
    bcf and a working storage capacity of 142 bcf.Gas Supply:In 2009, Consumers purchased
    69 percent of the gas it delivered from United States
    producers and 18 percent from Canadian producers.
    Authorized suppliers in the GCC program supplied the remaining
    13 percent of the gas that Consumers delivered.22




The following illustration shows the sources of Consumers’
    gas supply during 2009:







Consumers’ firm gas transportation contracts are with ANR
    Pipeline Company, Great Lakes Gas Transmission, L.P., Panhandle,
    Trunkline, and Vector Pipeline L.P. Consumers uses these
    contracts to deliver gas to Michigan for ultimate delivery to
    its customers. Consumers’ firm gas transportation contracts
    expire through 2017 and are capable of delivering
    80 percent of its total gas supply requirements.



Consumers purchases the balance of its required gas supply
    transportation under firm city-gate arrangements, incremental
    firm transportation contracts, and interruptible transportation
    contracts. The amount of interruptible transportation service
    and its use vary primarily with the price for this service and
    the availability and price of purchased and transported spot
    supplies. Consumers’ use of interruptible transportation is
    generally in off-peak summer months and after Consumers has
    fully utilized the services under the firm transportation
    agreements.



Enterprises —
    Non-Utility Operations and Investments



CMS Energy’s enterprises segment, through various
    subsidiaries and certain equity investments, is engaged
    primarily in domestic IPP and the marketing of IPP. In 2007,
    enterprises made a significant change in business strategy by
    exiting the international marketplace and refocusing to
    concentrate on its independent power business in the United
    States.



The enterprises segment’s operating revenue included in
    Income (Loss) From Continuing Operations in CMS Energy’s
    consolidated financial statements was $216 million in 2009,
    $365 million in 2008, and $370 million in 2007. The
    enterprises segment’s operating revenue included in Income
    (Loss) From Discontinued Operations in CMS Energy’s

    reclassified as held for sale in 2009.



Energy Resource Management:CMS ERM purchases and
    sells energy commodities in support of CMS Energy’s
    generating facilities. In 2004, CMS ERM discontinued its natural
    gas retail program as customer contracts expired, and changed
    its name from CMS MST to CMS ERM.



In 2009, CMS ERM marketed 23 bcf of natural gas and 1,726 GWh of
    electricity. CMS ERM’s operating revenue included in Income
    (Loss) From Continuing Operations in CMS Energy’s
    consolidated financial statements was $198 million in 2009,
    $343 million in 2008, and $342 million in 2007.



Natural Gas Transmission:CMS Gas Transmission
    owned, developed, and managed domestic and international natural
    gas facilities. In March 2007, CMS Gas Transmission sold a
    portfolio of its businesses in Argentina and its northern
    Michigan non-utility natural gas assets to Lucid Energy. In
    August 2007, CMS Gas Transmission sold its investment in
    GasAtacama to Endesa S.A. In June 2008, CMS Gas Transmission
    completed the sale of its investment in TGN. For more
    information on these asset sales, see Item 8. Financial

CMS ENERGY AND
    CONSUMERS REGULATION



CMS Energy, Consumers, and their subsidiaries are subject to
    regulation by various federal, state, local, and foreign
    governmental agencies, including those described in the
    following sections.



MPSC



Consumers is subject to the jurisdiction of the MPSC, which
    regulates public utilities in Michigan with respect to retail
    utility rates, accounting, utility services, certain facilities,
    corporate mergers, and other matters.



The Michigan Attorney General, ABATE, the MPSC staff, and
    certain other parties typically participate in MPSC proceedings
    concerning Consumers. The Michigan Attorney General, ABATE, and
    others often appeal significant MPSC orders.



Rate Proceedings:For information regarding open
    rate proceedings, see Item 8. Financial Statements and
    Supplementary Data, Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements,
    Note 7, Utility Rate Matters.



Michigan Energy
    Legislation



The 2008 Energy Legislation requires that at least ten percent
    of Consumers’ electric sales volume come from renewable
    energy sources by 2015, and includes requirements for specific
    capacity additions. The 2008 Energy Legislation also requires
    Consumers to prepare an energy optimization plan and achieve
    annual sales reduction targets beginning in 2009 through at
    least 2015. The targets are incremental with the goal of
    achieving a six percent reduction in customers’ electricity
    use and a four percent reduction in customers’ natural gas
    use by December 31, 2015. In 2009, Consumers filed, and the
    MPSC approved, its renewable energy and energy optimization
    plans. For additional information regarding Consumers’
    renewable energy and energy optimization plans, see Item 7.
    MD&A, Outlook, “Consumers’ Electric Utility
    Business Outlook and Uncertainties.”



The 2008 Energy Legislation also reformed the Customer Choice
    Act to limit alternative energy suppliers to supplying no more
    than ten percent of Consumers’ weather-adjusted sales. In
    September 2009, the MPSC approved procedures for the
    administration and allocation of electric load allowed to be
    served by alternative electric suppliers under the 2008 Energy
    Legislation. The MPSC further clarified that electric choice
    customers that are served presently by an alternative electric
    supplier will not be returned automatically to utility service
    in the event that the ten percent of weather-adjusted sales cap
    is exceeded due to a reduction in utility sales during the year.
    The MPSC also required utilities to make available on their
    websites an electric choice cap tracking system that allows
    customers to check on the status of the program.



FERC



The FERC has exercised limited jurisdiction over several
    independent power plants and exempt wholesale generators in
    which CMS Enterprises has ownership interests, as well as over
    CMS ERM, CMS Gas Transmission, and DIG. Among other things, the
    FERC has jurisdiction over acquisitions, operations, and
    disposals of certain assets and facilities, services provided
    and rates charged, conduct among affiliates, and limited
    jurisdiction over holding company matters with respect to CMS
    Energy. The FERC, in connection with the NERC and with regional
    reliability organizations, also regulates generation owners and
    operators, load serving entities, purchase and sale entities,
    and others with regard to reliability of the bulk power system.
    Certain aspects of Consumers’ gas business are also subject
    to regulation by the FERC, including a blanket transportation
    tariff under which Consumers may transport gas in interstate
    commerce.





The FERC also regulates certain aspects of Consumers’
    electric operations, including compliance with the FERC
    accounting rules, wholesale rates, operation of licensed hydro
    electric generating plants, transfers of certain facilities,
    corporate mergers, and issuances of securities.



Other
    Regulation



The Secretary of Energy regulates imports and exports of natural
    gas and has delegated various aspects of this jurisdiction to
    the FERC and the DOE’s Office of Fossil Fuels.



Consumers’ pipelines are subject to the Natural Gas
    Pipeline Safety Act of 1968 and the Pipeline Safety Improvement
    Act of 2002, which regulate the safety of gas pipelines.



EnerBank is regulated by the FDIC.



CMS ENERGY AND
    CONSUMERS ENVIRONMENTAL COMPLIANCE



CMS Energy, Consumers, and their subsidiaries are subject to
    various federal, state, and local regulations for environmental
    quality, including air and water quality, solid waste
    management, and other matters. For additional information
    concerning environmental matters, see Item 1A. Risk Factors
    and Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,
    Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 6,
    Contingencies and Commitments.



CMS Energy has recorded a significant liability for its
    affiliates’ obligations associated with Bay Harbor. For
    additional information, see Item 1A. Risk Factors and
    Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Notes
    to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 6, Contingencies
    and Commitments.



Air:Consumers continues to installstate-of-the-artemissions control equipment at its electric generating plants
    and to convert electric generating units to burn cleaner fuels.
    Consumers estimates that it will incur expenditures of
    $1.4 billion from 2010 through 2017 to comply with current
    and future federal and state regulations that will require
    extensive reductions in nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxides,
    particulate matter, and mercury emissions. Consumers’
    estimate may increase if additional laws or regulations are
    adopted or implemented regarding greenhouse gases, including
    carbon dioxide. For additional information concerning estimated
    capital expenditures related to environmental compliance, see
    Item 7. MD&A, Outlook, “Consumers’ Electric
    Utility Business Outlook and Uncertainties — Electric
    Environmental Estimates.”



Solid Waste Disposal:Costs related to the
    construction, operation, and closure of a modern solid waste
    disposal facility for ash are significant. To achieve
    significant reductions in ash field closure costs, Consumers has
    worked with others to reuse 30 percent of ash produced.
    Consumers sells coal ash for use as a Portland cement
    replacement in concrete products, as feedstock for the
    manufacture of Portland cement, and for other environmentally
    compatible uses. Consumers’ solid waste disposal areas are
    regulated under Michigan’s solid waste rules. Consumers has
    converted all of its fly ash handling systems to dry systems,
    which substantially reduce landfill venting. All of
    Consumers’ ash facilities have programs designed to protect
    the environment and are subject to quarterly MDNRE inspections.
    Dike integrity and stability have been assessed by an
    independent consultant. The EPA has been considering the
    development of new federal regulations for ash disposal areas
    for several years.



Water:Consumers uses significant amounts of water
    to operate and cool its electric generating plants. Water
    discharge quality is regulated and administered by the MDNRE
    under the federal NPDES program. To comply with such regulation,
    Consumers’ facilities have discharge monitoring programs.
    The EPA is developing new regulations related to cooling water
    intake systems. Consumers estimates expenditures of
    $150 million from 2010 through 2017 to comply with current
    and future regulations relating to cooling water intake systems.



CMS ENERGY AND
    CONSUMERS COMPETITION



Electric
    Competition



Consumers’ electric utility business is subject to actual
    and potential competition from many sources, in both the
    wholesale and retail markets, as well as in electric generation,
    electric delivery, and retail services.



The Customer Choice Act allows all Consumers’ electric
    customers to buy electric generation service from Consumers or
    from an alternative electric supplier. The 2008 Energy
    Legislation revised the Customer Choice Act





and generally limits alternative electric supply to ten percent
    of Consumers’ weather-adjusted retail sales for the
    preceding calendar year. In August 2009, customer enrollment in
    the ROA program reached the ten-percent limit. Electric
    deliveries from alternative suppliers reached the ten-percent
    limit in early January 2010.



Consumers also has competition or potential competition from:



•industrial customers relocating all or a portion of their
    production capacity outside Consumers’ service territory
    for economic reasons;•municipalities owning or operating competing electric delivery
    systems;•customer self-generation; and•adjacent utilities that extend lines to customers in contiguous
    service territories.



Consumers addresses this competition by monitoring activity in
    adjacent areas and monitoring compliance with the MPSC’s
    and the FERC’s rules, providing non-energy services, and
    providing tariff-based incentives that support economic
    development.



Consumers offers non-energy revenue-producing services to
    electric customers, municipalities, and other utilities in an
    effort to offset costs. These services include engineering and
    consulting, construction of customer-owned distribution
    facilities, sales of equipment (such as transformers), power
    quality analysis, energy management services, meter reading, and
    joint construction for phone and cable. In these activities,
    Consumers faces competition from many sources, including energy
    management services companies, other utilities, contractors, and
    retail merchandisers.



CMS ERM continues to focus on optimizing CMS Energy’s IPP
    portfolio. CMS Energy’s IPP business faces competition from
    generators, marketers and brokers, and other utilities marketing
    power in the wholesale market.



Gas
    Competition



Competition exists in various aspects of Consumers’ gas
    utility business. Competition comes from other gas suppliers
    taking advantage of direct access to Consumers’ customers
    and from alternative fuels and energy sources, such as propane,
    oil, and electricity.



INSURANCE



CMS Energy and its subsidiaries, including Consumers, maintain
    insurance coverage generally similar to comparable companies in
    the same lines of business. The insurance policies are subject
    to terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions that might not
    fully compensate CMS Energy or Consumers for all losses. A
    portion of each loss is generally assumed by CMS Energy or
    Consumers in the form of deductibles and self-insured retentions
    that, in some cases, are substantial. As CMS Energy or Consumers
    renews its policies, it is possible that some of the current
    insurance coverage may not be renewed or obtainable on
    commercially reasonable terms due to restrictive insurance
    markets.



CMS Energy’s and Consumers’ current insurance program
    does not cover the risks of certain environmental cleanup costs
    and environmental damages, such as claims for air pollution,
    damage to sites owned by CMS Energy or Consumers, and some
    long-term storage or disposal of wastes.
