Table of ContentsIn 2014, Consumers served 1.8 million electric customers and 1.7 million gas customers in Michigan’s Lower Peninsula.  Presented in the following map is Consumers’ service territory:14



Table of ContentsBUSINESS SEGMENTSCONSUMERSELECTRICUTILITYElectric Utility Operations:Consumers’ electric utility operations, which include the generation, purchase, distribution, and sale of electricity, generated operating revenue of $4.4 billion in 2014, $4.2 billion in 2013, and $4.0 billion in 2012.  Consumers’ electric utility customer base consists of a mix of primarily residential, commercial, and diversified industrial customers in Michigan’s Lower Peninsula.Presented in the following illustration is Consumers’ 2014 electric utility operating revenue of $4.4 billion by customer class:Consumers’ electric utility operations are not dependent on a single customer, or even a few customers, and the loss of any one or even a few of Consumers’ largest customers is not reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on Consumers’ financial condition.In 2014, Consumers’ electric deliveries were 38 billion kWh, which included ROA deliveries of four billion kWh, resulting in net bundled sales of 34 billion kWh.  In 2013, Consumers’ electric deliveries were 37 billion kWh, which included ROA deliveries of four billion kWh, resulting in net bundled sales of 33 billion kWh.Consumers’ electric utility operations are seasonal.  The consumption of electric energy typically increases in the summer months, due primarily to the use of air conditioners and other cooling equipment.15






Presented in the following illustration are Consumers’ monthly weather-adjusted electric deliveries (deliveries adjusted to reflect normal weather conditions) to its customers, including ROA deliveries, during 2014 and 2013:







Consumers’ 2014 summer peak demand was 7,498 MW, which included ROA demand of 591 MW.  For the 2013-2014 winter period, Consumers’ peak demand was 5,960 MW, which included ROA demand of 452 MW.  As required by MISO reserve margin requirements, Consumers owns or controls, through long-term PPAs and short-term capacity purchases, capacity required to supply its projected firm peak load and necessary reserve margin for summer 2015.



Electric Utility Properties:Consumers’ distribution system consists of:



·434 miles of high-voltage distribution radial lines operating at 120 kilovolts or above;

·4,261 miles of high-voltage distribution overhead lines operating at 23 kilovolts, 46 kilovolts, and 69 kilovolts;

·18 miles of high-voltage distribution underground lines operating at 23 kilovolts and 46 kilovolts;

·56,022 miles of electric distribution overhead lines;

·10,304 miles of underground distribution lines; and

·substations with an aggregate transformer capacity of 24 million kVA.

2Includes purchases from long-term PPAs.



3Includes purchases from the MISO energy market and seasonal purchases.



During 2014, Consumers acquired 49 percent of the electricity it provided to customers through long-term PPAs and the MISO energy market.  Consumers offers its generation into the MISO energy market on a day-ahead and real-time basis and bids for power in the market to serve the demand of its customers.  Consumers is a net purchaser of power and supplements its generation capability with purchases from the MISO energy market to meet its customers’ needs during peak demand periods.



At December 31, 2014, Consumers had unrecognized future commitments (amounts for which, in accordance with GAAP, liabilities have not been recorded on its balance sheet) to purchase capacity and energy under long-term PPAs with various generating plants.  These contracts require monthly capacity payments based on the plants’ availability or deliverability.  The payments for 2015 through 2036 are estimated to total $11.1 billion and, for each of the next five years, range from $1.0 billion to $1.1 billion annually.  These amounts may vary depending on plant availability and fuel costs.  For further information about Consumers’ future capacity and energy purchase obligations, see Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, MD&A – Capital Resources and Liquidity and Note 4, Contingencies and Commitments – Contractual Commitments.



During 2014, 44 percent of the energy Consumers provided to customers was generated by its coal-fueled generating units, which burned nine million tons of coal and produced a combined total of 15,684 GWh of electricity.



In order to obtain the coal it needs, Consumers enters into physical coal supply contracts.  At December 31, 2014, Consumers had contracts to purchase coal through 2017; payment obligations under these contracts totaled $178 million.  Most of Consumers’ rail-supplied coal contracts have fixed prices, although some contain market-based pricing.  Consumers’ vessel-supplied coal contracts have fixed base prices that are adjusted monthly to reflect changes to the fuel cost of vessel transportation.  At December 31, 2014, Consumers had 88 percent of its 2015 expected coal requirements under contract, as well as a 36-day supply of coal on hand.











In conjunction with its coal supply contracts, Consumers leases a fleet of rail cars and has transportation contracts with various companies to provide rail and vessel services for delivery of purchased coal to Consumers’ generating facilities.  Consumers’ coal transportation contracts expire through 2019; payment obligations under these contracts totaled $430 million at December 31, 2014.



During 2014, six percent of the energy Consumers provided to customers was generated by natural gas-fueled generating units, which burned 15 bcf of natural gas and produced a combined total of 2,012 GWh of electricity.



In order to obtain the gas it needs for electric generation fuel, Consumers’ electric utility purchases gas from the market near the time of consumption, at prices that allow it to compete in the electric wholesale market.  For D.E. Karn, units 3 and 4, and the Zeeland plant, Consumers purchases gas from the market and transports the gas to the facilities on a firm basis.  For its smaller combustion turbines, Consumers’ electric utility purchases and transports gas to its facilities as a bundled-rate tariff customer of either the gas utility or DTE Gas.



Presented in the following table is the cost per million Btu of all fuels consumed, which fluctuates with the mix of fuel used.

Electric Utility Competition:Consumers’ electric utility business is subject to actual and potential competition from many sources, in both the wholesale and retail markets, as well as in electric generation, electric delivery, and retail services.



A Michigan statute enacted in 2000 allowed electric customers in Consumers’ service territory to buy electric generation service from alternative electric suppliers.  The 2008 Energy Law revised the statute by limiting alternative electric supply to ten percent of Consumers’ weather-adjusted retail sales for the preceding calendar year.  At December 31, 2014, Consumers’ electric deliveries under the ROA program were at the ten-percent limit and alternative electric suppliers were providing 771 MW of electric generation service to 308 ROA customers.



In December 2013, a bill was introduced to the Michigan House of Representatives that, if enacted, would have revised the 2008 Energy Law by removing the ten-percent limit and allowing all of Consumers’ electric customers to take service from an alternative electric supplier.  The bill also proposed to deregulate electric generation service in Michigan within two years.  No action was taken prior to the end of the legislative session on this bill or on a similar bill introduced to the Michigan Senate.  Consumers is unable to predict whether similar bills might be introduced during 2015.



In recent years, the Michigan legislature has conducted hearings on the subject of energy competition.  If the ROA limit were increased or if electric generation service in Michigan were deregulated, it could have a material adverse effect on Consumers’ financial results and operations.



Consumers also has competition or potential competition from:



·industrial customers relocating all or a portion of their production capacity outside of Consumers’ service territory for economic reasons;

·municipalities owning or operating competing electric delivery systems; and

·customer self-generation.











Consumers addresses this competition by monitoring activity in adjacent geographical areas, by providing non-energy services and value to customers through Consumers’ rates and service, and by offering tariff-based incentives that support economic development.



CONSUMERSGASUTILITY



Gas Utility Operations:Consumers’ gas utility operations, which include the purchase, transmission, storage, distribution, and sale of natural gas, generated operating revenue of $2.4 billion in 2014, $2.1 billion in 2013, and $2.0 billion in 2012.  Consumers’ gas utility customer base consists of a mix of primarily residential, commercial, and diversified industrial customers in Michigan’s Lower Peninsula.



Presented in the following illustration is Consumers’ 2014 gas utility operating revenue of $2.4 billion by customer class:







Consumers’ gas utility operations are not dependent on a single customer, or even a few customers, and the loss of any one or even a few of Consumers’ largest customers is not reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on Consumers’ financial condition.



In 2014, deliveries of natural gas, including off-system transportation deliveries, through Consumers’ pipeline and distribution network, totaled 373 bcf, which included GCC deliveries of 65 bcf.  In 2013, deliveries of natural gas, including off-system transportation deliveries, through Consumers’ pipeline and distribution network, totaled 352 bcf, which included GCC deliveries of 63 bcf.  Consumers’ gas utility operations are seasonal.  Consumers injects natural gas into storage during the summer months for use during the winter months when the demand for natural gas is higher.  Peak demand occurs in the winter due to colder temperatures and the resulting use of natural gas as a heating fuel.  During 2014, 43 percent of the natural gas supplied to all customers during the winter months was supplied from storage.








Table of ContentsPresented in the following illustration are Consumers’ monthly weather-adjusted gas deliveries (deliveries adjusted to reflect normal weather conditions) to its customers, including GCC deliveries, during 2014 and 2013:Gas Utility Properties:Consumers’ gas distribution and transmission system consists of:·27,169 miles of distribution mains;·1,685 miles of transmission lines;·seven compressor stations with a total of 168,721 installed and available horsepower; and·15 gas storage fields with a total storage capacity of 309 bcf and a working gas volume of 151 bcf.22






Gas Utility Supply:In 2014, Consumers purchased 68 percent of the gas it delivered from U.S. producers and six percent from Canadian producers.  The remaining 26 percent was purchased from authorized GCC suppliers and delivered by Consumers to customers in the GCC program.  Presented in the following illustration are the supply arrangements for the gas Consumers delivered to GCC and GCR customers during 2014:







Firm gas transportation or firm city-gate contracts are those that define a fixed amount, price, and delivery time frame.  Consumers’ firm gas transportation contracts are with ANR, Great Lakes Gas Transmission, Panhandle, and Trunkline.  Under these contracts, Consumers purchases and transports gas to Michigan for ultimate delivery to its customers.  Consumers’ firm gas transportation contracts expire through 2023 and provide for the delivery of 61 percent of Consumers’ total gas supply requirements.  Consumers purchases the balance of its required gas supply under firm city-gate contracts and through authorized suppliers under the GCC program.



Gas Utility Competition:Competition exists in various aspects of Consumers’ gas utility business.  Competition comes from GCC and from alternative fuels and energy sources, such as propane, oil, and electricity.



ENTERPRISESSEGMENT –NON-UTILITYOPERATIONS ANDINVESTMENTS



CMS Energy’s enterprises segment, through various subsidiaries and certain equity investments, is engaged primarily in domestic independent power production and the marketing of independent power production.  The enterprises segment’s operating revenue was $299 million in 2014, $181 million in 2013, and $183 million in 2012.











Independent Power Production:At December 31, 2014, CMS Energy had ownership interests in independent power plants totaling 1,135 MW or 1,035 net MW.  (Net MW reflects that portion of the capacity relating to CMS Energy’s ownership interests.)  Presented in the following table are CMS Energy’s interests in independent power plants at December 31, 2014:

The operating revenue from independent power production was $18 million in 2014, $17 million in 2013, and $16 million in 2012.  CMS Energy’s independent power production business faces competition from generators, marketers and brokers, and utilities marketing power in the wholesale market.



Energy Resource Management:CMS ERM purchases and sells energy commodities in support of CMS Energy’s generating facilities with a focus on optimizing CMS Energy’s independent power production portfolio.  In 2014, CMS ERM marketed 19 bcf of natural gas and 4,681 GWh of electricity.  Electricity marketed by CMS ERM was generated by independent power production of the enterprises segment and unrelated third parties.  CMS ERM’s operating revenue was $281 million in 2014, $164 million in 2013, and $167 million in 2012.



OTHERBUSINESSES



EnerBank:EnerBank is a Utah state-chartered, FDIC-insured industrial bank providing unsecured consumer installment loans for financing home improvements.  EnerBank’s operating revenue was $80 million in 2014, $64 million in 2013, and $57 million in 2012.

The Michigan Attorney General, ABATE, the MPSC Staff, and certain other parties typically participate in MPSC proceedings concerning Consumers.  The Michigan Attorney General, ABATE, and others often appeal significant MPSC orders.



Rate Proceedings:For information regarding open rate proceedings, see Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, MD&A — Outlook and Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements — Note 3, Regulatory Matters.



OTHERREGULATION



The U.S. Secretary of Energy regulates imports and exports of natural gas and has delegated various aspects of this jurisdiction to FERC and the DOE’s Office of Fossil Fuels.



The U.S. Department of Transportation Office of Pipeline Safety regulates the safety and security of gas pipelines through the Natural Gas Pipeline Safety Act of 1968 and subsequent laws.



EnerBank is regulated by the Utah Department of Financial Institutions and the FDIC.



ENERGYLEGISLATION



CMS Energy, Consumers, and their subsidiaries are subject to various legislative-driven matters, including Michigan’s 2008 Energy Law.  This law requires that at least ten percent of Consumers’ electric sales volume come from renewable energy sources by the end of 2015, and includes requirements for specific capacity additions.  The 2008 Energy Law also requires Consumers to prepare an energy optimization plan and achieve annual sales reduction targets through at least 2015.  The targets increase annually, with the goal of achieving a 5.6 percent reduction in customers’ electricity use and a 3.9 percent reduction in customers’ natural gas use by December 31, 2015.  The 2008 Energy Law allows electric customers in Consumers’ service territory to buy electric generation service from alternative electric suppliers in an aggregate amount up to ten percent of Consumers’ weather-adjusted retail sales of the preceding calendar year.  For additional information regarding Consumers’ renewable energy and energy optimization plans and electric ROA, see Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, MD&A — Outlook.



CMS ENERGY AND CONSUMERS ENVIRONMENTAL COMPLIANCE



CMS Energy, Consumers, and their subsidiaries are subject to various federal, state, and local regulations for environmental quality, including air and water quality, solid waste management, and other matters.  Consumers expects to recover costs to comply with environmental regulations in customer rates, but cannot guarantee this result.  For additional information concerning environmental matters, see Item 1A. Risk Factors and Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements — Note 4, Contingencies and Commitments.



CMS Energy has recorded a significant liability for its subsidiaries’ obligations associated with Bay Harbor and Consumers has recorded a significant liability for its obligations at a number of MGP sites.











For additional information, see Item 1A. Risk Factors and Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements — Note 4, Contingencies and Commitments.



Air:Consumers continues to install state-of-the-art emissions control equipment at its electric generating plants.  Consumers estimates that it will incur expenditures of $258 million from 2015 through 2019 to comply with present and future federal and state environmental regulations that will require extensive reductions in nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxides, particulate matter, and mercury emissions.  Consumers’ estimate may increase if additional or more stringent laws or regulations are adopted or implemented regarding greenhouse gases, including carbon dioxide.



Solid Waste Disposal:Costs related to the construction, operation, and closure of solid waste disposal facilities for coal ash are significant.  Consumers’ solid waste disposal areas are regulated under Michigan’s solid waste rules.  Consumers has converted all of its fly ash handling systems to dry systems.  All of Consumers’ ash facilities have programs designed to protect the environment and are subject to quarterly MDEQ inspections.  In December 2014, the EPA issued new federal regulations for ash disposal areas.  Consumers’ preliminary estimate of capital expenditures to comply with future regulations relating to ash disposal is $252 million from 2015 through 2019, but this estimate could change significantly.



Water:Consumers uses substantial amounts of water to operate and cool its electric generating plants.  Water discharge quality is regulated and administered by the MDEQ under the federal NPDES program.  To comply with such regulation, Consumers’ facilities have discharge monitoring programs.  Consumers expects the EPA to issue final federal regulations for wastewater discharges from electric generating plants in 2015.  Consumers’ preliminary estimate of expenditures to comply with these expected regulations is $152 million from 2015 through 2019.



In 2014, the EPA finalized its cooling water intake rule, which requires Consumers to evaluate the biological impact of its cooling water intake systems and ensure that it is using the best technology available to minimize adverse environmental impacts.  Consumers’ preliminary estimate of expenditures to comply with these regulations is $100 million from 2015 through 2019.



CMS Energy retained environmental remediation obligations for the collection and treatment of leachate at Bay Harbor after selling its interests in the development in 2002.  CMS Energy’s estimate of expenditures on long-term liquid disposal and operating and maintenance costs at Bay Harbor is $29 million from 2015 through 2019.



For further information concerning estimated capital expenditures related to air, solid waste disposal, and water see Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, MD&A — Outlook, “Consumers Electric Utility Business Outlook and Uncertainties — Electric Environmental Outlook.”











INSURANCE



CMS Energy and its subsidiaries, including Consumers, maintain insurance coverage generally similar to comparable companies in the same lines of business.  The insurance policies are subject to terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions that might not fully compensate CMS Energy or Consumers for all losses.  A portion of each loss is generally assumed by CMS Energy or Consumers in the form of deductibles and self-insured retentions that, in some cases, are substantial.  As CMS Energy or Consumers renews its policies, it is possible that some of the present insurance coverage may not be renewed or obtainable on commercially reasonable terms due to restrictive insurance markets.



CMS Energy’s and Consumers’ present insurance program does not cover the risks of certain environmental costs, such as the cleanup of sites owned by CMS Energy or Consumers, or claims for the long-term storage or disposal of pollutants or for air pollution.
