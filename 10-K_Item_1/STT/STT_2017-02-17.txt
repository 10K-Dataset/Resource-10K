LINES OFBUSINESS

We have two lines of business: Investment Servicing and Investment Management.

Investment Servicing

Our Investment Servicing line of business performs core custody and related value-added functions, such as providing institutional investors with clearing, settlement and payment services.  Our financial services and products allow our large institutional investor clients to execute financial transactions on a daily basis in markets across the globe.  As most institutional investors cannot economically or efficiently build their own technology and operational processes necessary to facilitate their global securities settlement needs, our role as a global trust and custody bank is generally to aid our clients to efficiently perform services associated with the clearing, settlement and execution of securities transactions and related payments.

Our investment servicing products and services include:custody; product- and participant-level accounting; daily pricing and administration; master trust and master custody; record-keeping; cash management; foreign exchange, brokerage and other trading services; securities finance; our enhanced custody product, which integrates principal securities lending and custody; deposit and short-term investment facilities; loans and lease financing; investment manager and alternative investment manager operations outsourcing; and performance, risk and compliance analytics to support institutional investors.

We provide mutual fund custody and accounting services in the U.S.  We offer clients a broad range of integrated products and services, including accounting, daily pricing and fund administration.  We service U.S. tax-exempt assets for corporate and public pension funds, and we provide trust and valuation services for daily-priced portfolios.

We are a service provider outside of the U.S. as well.  In Germany, Italy, France and Luxembourg, we provide depotbank services (a fund oversight role created by regulation) for retail and institutional fund assets, as well as custody and other services to pension plans and other institutional clients.  In the U.K., we provide custody services for pension fund assets and administration services for mutual fund assets.  As ofDecember 31, 2016, we serviced approximately $1.75 trillion of offshore assets in funds located primarily in Luxembourg, Ireland and the Cayman Islands.  As ofDecember 31, 2016, we serviced$1.49 trillionof assets under custody and administration in the Asia/Pacific region, and in Japan, we serviced approximately 93% of the trust assets serviced by non-domestic trust banks.



We are an alternative asset servicing provider worldwide, servicing hedge, private equity and real estate funds.  As ofDecember 31, 2016, we serviced approximately $1.33 trillion ofAUCAin such funds.

Investment Management

Our Investment Management line of business,through SSGA, provides a broad array of investment management, investment research and investment advisory services to corporations, public funds and other sophisticated investors.  SSGA offers passive and active asset management strategies across equity, fixed-income, alternative, multi-asset solutions (including OCIO) and cash asset classes.  Products are distributed directly and through intermediaries using a variety of investment vehicles, including ETFs, such as the SPDR®ETF brand.

Additional information about our lines of business is provided under “Line of Business Information” included under Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis, and in Note24to the consolidated financial statements included under Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Form 10-K.  Additional information about our non-U.S. activities is provided in Note25to the consolidated financial statements included under Item 8 of this Form 10-K.



COMPETITION

We operate in a highly competitive environment and face global competition in all areas of our business.  Our competitors include a broad range of financial institutions and servicing companies, including other custodial banks, deposit-taking institutions, investment management firms, insurance companies, mutual funds, broker/dealers, investment banks, benefits consultants, business service and software companies and information services firms.  As our businesses grow and markets evolve, we may encounter increasing and new forms of competition around the world.

We believe that many key factors drive competition in the markets for our business.  For Investment Servicing, quality of service, economies of scale, technological expertise, quality and scope of sales and marketing, required levels of capital and price drive competition, and are critical to our servicing business.  For Investment Management, key competitive factors include expertise, experience, availability of related service offerings, quality of service and performance and price.

Our competitive success may depend on our ability to develop and market new and innovative services, to adopt or develop new technologies, to bring new services to market in a timely fashion at competitive prices, to continue and expand our relationships with existing clients, and to attract new clients.

SUPERVISIONAND REGULATION

State Street is registered with theFederal Reserveas a bank holding company pursuant to the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956.  The Bank Holding Company Act generally limits the activities in which we and our non-banking subsidiaries may engage to managing or controlling banks and to a range of activities that are considered to be closely related to banking. Bank holding companies that have elected to be treated as financial holding companies may engage in a broader range of activities considered to be "financial in nature."  These limits also apply to non-banking entities that we are deemed to “control” for purposes of the Bank Holding Company Act, which may include companies of which we own or control more than 5% of a class of voting shares.  The Federal Reserve may order a bank holding company to terminate any activity, or its ownership or control of a non-banking subsidiary, if the Federal Reserve finds that the activity, ownership or control constitutes a serious risk to the financial safety, soundness or stability of a banking subsidiary or is inconsistent with sound banking principles or statutory purposes.  The Bank Holding Company Act also requires a bank holding company to obtain prior approval of the Federal Reserve before it acquires substantially all the assets of any bank, or ownership or control of more than 5% of the voting shares of any bank.



able to engage in new activities or acquire shares or control of other businesses.

The Dodd-Frank Act, which became law in July 2010, has had, and continues to have, a significant effect on the regulatory structure of the financial markets and supervision of bank holding companies, banks and other financial institutions.  The Dodd-Frank Act, among other things: established theFSOCto monitor systemic risk posed by financial institutions; enacted new restrictions on proprietary trading and private-fund investment activities by banks and their affiliates, commonly known as the “Volcker rule” (refer to our discussion of the Volcker rule provided below under “Regulatory Capital Adequacy and Liquidity Standards” in this “Supervision and Regulation” section); created a new framework for the regulation of derivatives and the entities that engage in derivatives trading; altered the regulatory capital treatment of trust preferred and other hybrid capital securities; revised the assessment base that is used by theFDICto calculate deposit insurance premiums; adopted capital planning and stress test requirements for large bank holding companies, including us; and required large financial institutions to develop plans for their resolution under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code (or other specifically applicable insolvency regime) in the event of material financial distress or failure.

In addition, regulatory change is being implemented internationally with respect to financial institutions, including, but not limited to, the implementation of the Basel III final rule (refer to “Regulatory Capital Adequacy and Liquidity Standards” below in this “Supervision and Regulation” section and under "Capital" in “Financial Condition” included under Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis, of this Form 10-K for a discussion of Basel III) and the Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive (AIFMD), the Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive (BRRD), the European Market Infrastructure Resolution (EMIR), the Undertakings for Collective Investments in Transferable Securities (UCITS) directives, the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive II (MiFIDII) and the Markets in Financial Instruments Regulation (MiFIR) (the majority of the provisions of MiFID II and MiFIR will apply from January 3, 2018) and the E.U. data protection regulation.

Many aspects of our business are subject to regulation by other U.S. federal and state governmental and regulatory agencies and self-regulatory organizations (including securities exchanges), and by non-U.S. governmental and regulatory agencies and self-regulatory organizations.  Some aspects of our public disclosure, corporate governance principles and internal control systems are subject toSOX, the Dodd-Frank Act and regulations and rules of the SEC and theNYSE.

Regulatory Capital Adequacy and Liquidity Standards

Basel III Final Rule

In 2013, U.S. banking regulators jointly issued a final rule implementing the Basel III framework in the U.S.  Provisions of the Basel III final rule become effective under a transition timetable which began on January 1, 2014, with full implementation required beginning on January 1, 2019. In 2012, U.S. banking regulators jointly issued a final market risk capital rule to implement the changes to the market risk capital framework in the U.S.  The final market risk capital rule became effective and was applicable to State Street on January 1, 2013, and replaced the market risk capital framework associated with Basel I and Basel II.

The Basel III final rule provides for two frameworks: the “standardized” approach, intended to replace Basel I, and the “advanced” approaches, applicable to advanced approaches banking organizations, like State Street, as originally defined under Basel II.  The standardized approach modifies the provisions of Basel I related to the calculation of RWA and prescribes new standardized risk weights for certain on- and off-balance sheet exposures.

Among other things, the Basel III final rule does the following:

•Adds new requirements for a minimum common equity tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 4.5% and a minimum supplementary leverage ratio of 3% for advanced banking organizations;

•Raises the minimum tier 1 risk-based capital ratio from 4% under Basel I and Basel II to 6%;

•Leaves the existing, minimum total capital ratio at 8%;

•Implements the capital conservation and countercyclical capital buffers, referenced below, as well as a G-SIB surchargeincluded under "Capital" in "Financial Condition" included under Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis, of this Form 10-K;

•Implements the previously described standardized approach to replace the calculation of RWA under Basel I; and

•Implements the advanced approaches for the calculation of RWA.

Additionally, beginning January 1, 2018, the SLR rule introduces a higher minimum SLR requirement for the eight U.S. G-SIBs of at least 6% for the insured banking entity (State Street Bank) in order to be well capitalized under the U.S. banking regulators’ PCA framework, as well as a requirement of a minimum SLR of 5% for the holding company (State



Street) in order to avoid any limitations on distributions and discretionary bonus payments.

Under the Basel III final rule, a banking organization would be able to make capital distributions, subject to other regulatory constraints, such as regulator review of its capital plans, and discretionary bonus payments without specified limitations, as long as it maintains the required capital conservation buffer of 2.5% plus applicable G-SIB surcharge over the minimum required common equity tier 1 risk-based capital ratio and each of the minimum required tier 1 and total risk-based capital ratios (plus any potentially applicable countercyclical capital buffer).  Banking regulators would establish the minimum countercyclical capital buffer, which is initially set by banking regulators at zero, up to a maximum of 2.5% of total risk-weighted assets under certain economic conditions.

Under the Basel III final rule, our total regulatory capital is divided into three tiers, composed of common equity tier 1 capital, tier 1 capital (which includes common equity tier 1 capital), and tier 2 capital.  The total of tier 1 and tier 2 capital, adjusted as applicable, is referred to as total regulatory capital.

Common equity tier 1 capital is composed of core capital elements, such as qualifying common shareholders' equity and related surplus; retained earnings; the cumulative effect of foreign currency translation; and net unrealized gains (losses) on debt and equity securities classified as AFS; reduced by treasury stock.  Subject to certain phase-in or phase-out provisions, tier 1 capital is composed of common equity tier 1 capital plus additional tier 1 capital composed of qualifying perpetual preferred stock and minority interests.  Goodwill and other intangible assets, net of related deferred tax liabilities, are deducted from tier 1 capital.  Subject to certain phase-in or phase-out provisions, tier 2 capital is composed primarily of qualifying subordinated long-term debt.

Certain other items, if applicable, must be deducted from tier 1 and tier 2 capital.  These items primarily include deductible investments in unconsolidated banking, financial and insurance entities where we hold more than 50% of the entities' capital; and the amount of expected credit losses that exceeds recorded allowances for loan and other credit losses.  Expected credit losses are calculated for wholesale credit exposures by formula in conformity with the Basel III final rule.

As required by the Dodd-Frank Act,we and State Street Bank, as advanced approaches banking organizations, are subject to a permanent "capital floor", also referred to as the Collins Amendment, in the assessment of our regulatory capital adequacy, including a capital conservation buffer and a countercyclical capital buffer (both buffers are more

fully describedabove in this "Supervision and Regulation" section).From January 1, 2015 going forward, our risk-based capital ratios for regulatory assessment purposes are the lower of each ratio calculated under the standardized approach and the advanced approaches.

Global Systemically Important Bank

In addition to the Basel III final rule, the Dodd-Frank Act requires the Federal Reserve to establish more stringent capital requirements for large bank holding companies, including State Street.  On August 14, 2015, the Federal Reserve published a final rule on the implementation of capital requirements that impose a capital surcharge on U.S. G-SIBs.  The surcharge requirements within the final rule began to phase in on January 1, 2016 and will be fully effective on January 1, 2019.  The eight U.S. banks deemed to be G-SIBs, including State Street, are required to calculate the G-SIB surcharge according to two methods, and be bound by the higher of the two:

•Method 1:  Assesses systemic importance based upon five equally-weighted components:  size, interconnectedness, complexity, cross-jurisdictional activity and substitutability;

•Method 2:  Alters the calculation from Method 1 by factoring in a wholesale funding score in place of substitutability and applying a 2x multiplier to the sum of the five components

As part of the Basel III final rule, the Federal Reserve published estimated G-SIB surcharges for the eight U.S. G-SIBs based on relevant data from 2012 to 2014.  Method 2 is identified as the binding methodology for State Street and the applicable surcharge on January 1, 2016 was calculated to be 1.5%.  Assuming completion of the phase-in period for the capital conservation buffer, and a countercyclical buffer of 0%, the minimum capital ratios as of January 1, 2019, including a capital conservation buffer of 2.5% and G-SIB surcharge of 1.5% in 2019, would be 10.0% for tier 1 risk-based capital, 12.0% for total risk-based capital, and 8.5% for common equity tier 1 capital, in order for State Street to make capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments without limitation.  Further, if State Street fails to exceed the 2% leverage buffer applicable to all U.S. G-SIBs under the Basel III final rule, it will be subject to increased restrictions (depending upon the extent of the shortfall) regarding capital distributions and discretionary executive bonus payments. Not all of our competitors have similarly been designated as systemically important, and therefore some of our competitors may not be subject to the same additional capital requirements.



Total Loss-Absorbing Capacity (TLAC)

On December 15, 2016, the Federal Reserve released its final rule on TLAC, LTD and clean holding company requirements for U.S. domiciled G-SIBs, such as State Street, that are intended to improve the resiliency and resolvability of certain U.S. banking organizations through new enhanced prudential standards. The TLAC final rule imposes: (1) TLAC requirements (i.e., combined eligible tier 1 regulatory capital and eligible LTD); (2) separate eligible LTD requirements; and (3) clean holding company requirements designed to make short-term unsecured debt (including deposits) and most other ineligible liabilities structurally senior to eligible LTD.

Among other things, the TLAC final rule requires State Street to comply with minimum requirements for external TLAC and external LTD, plus an external TLAC buffer. Specifically, State Street must hold (1) combined eligible tier 1 regulatory capital and eligible LTD in the amount equal to at least 21.5% of total risk-weighted assets (using an estimated G-SIB method 1 surcharge of 1%) and 9.5% of total leverage exposure, as defined by the SLR final rule, and (2) qualifying external LTD equal to the greater of 7.5% of risk-weighted assets (using an estimated G-SIB method 2 surcharge of 1.5%) and 4.5% of total leverage exposure, as defined by the SLR final rule.

State Street must comply with the TLAC final rule starting on January 1, 2019.

Liquidity Coverage Ratio and Net Stable Funding Ratio

In addition to capital standards, the Basel III final rule introduced two quantitative liquidity standards: the LCR and the NSFR.

In 2014, U.S. banking regulators issued a final rule to implement the BCBS' LCR in the United States.  The LCR is intended to promote the short-term resilience of internationally active banking organizations, like State Street, to improve the banking industry's ability to absorb shocks arising from market stress over a 30 calendar day period and improve the measurement and management of liquidity risk.

The LCR measures an institution’s HQLA against its net cash outflows.  The LCR began being phased in on January 1, 2015, at 80%, with full implementation beginning on January 1, 2017.

We report LCR to the Federal Reserve daily.  As ofDecember 31, 2016, our LCR was in excess of 100%. In addition, in December 2016, the Federal Reserve issued a final rule requiring large banking organizations, including us, to publicly disclose certain qualitative and quantitative information about their LCR. We must comply with the disclosure requirements beginning on April 1, 2017.





State Street Corporation |7






Compliance with the LCR has required that we maintain an investment portfolio that contains an adequate amount of HQLA.  In general, HQLA investments generate a lower investment return than other types of investments, resulting in a negative impact on our net interest revenue and our net interest margin.  In addition, the level of HQLA we are required to maintain under the LCR is dependent upon our client relationships and the nature of services we provide, which may change over time.  For example, if the percentage of our operational deposits relative to deposits that are not maintained for operational purposes increases, we would expect to require less HQLA in order to maintain our LCR.  Conversely, if the percentage of our operational deposits relative to deposits that are not maintained for operational purposes decreases, we would expect to require additional HQLA in order to maintain our LCR.

In October 2014, the BCBS issued final guidance with respect to the NSFR.  In the second quarter of 2016, the OCC, Federal Reserve and FDIC issued a proposal to implement the NSFR in the U.S. that is largely consistent with the BCBS guidance. The proposal would require banking organizations to maintain an amount of available stable funding, which is calculated by applying standardized weightings to its equity and liabilities based on their expected stability, that is no less than the amount of its required stable funding, which is calculated by applying standardized weightings to its assets, derivatives exposures, and certain other off-balance sheet exposures based on their liquidity characteristics. If adopted as proposed, the requirements would apply to us and our depository institution subsidiaries beginning January 1, 2018.

Failure to meet current and future regulatory capital requirements could subject us to a variety of enforcement actions, including the termination of State Street Bank's deposit insurance by the FDIC, and to certain restrictions on our business, including those that are described above in this “Supervision and Regulation” section.

For additional information about our regulatory capital position and our regulatory capital adequacy, as well as current and future regulatory capital requirements, refer to "Capital" in “Financial Condition" included under Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis, and Note16to the consolidated financial statements included under Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Form 10-K.

Capital Planning, Stress Tests and Dividends

Pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, the Federal Reserve has adopted capital planning and stress test requirements for large bank holding companies, including us, which form part of the Federal Reserve’s



annualCCARframework.  CCAR is used by the Federal Reserve to evaluate our management of capital, the adequacy of our regulatory capital and the potential requirement for us to maintain capital levels above regulatory minimums.  Under the Federal Reserve’s capital plan final rule, we must conduct periodic stress testing of our business operations and submit an annual capital plan to the Federal Reserve, taking into account the results of separate stress tests designed by us and by the Federal Reserve.

For additional information regarding capital planning and stress test requirements and restrictions on dividends, refer to "Capital Planning, Stress Tests and Dividends” in this “Supervision and Regulation” section and Item 5, Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchase of Equity Securities, in Part II of this Form 10-K.

In addition to its capital planning requirements, the Federal Reserve has the authority to prohibit or to limit the payment of dividends by the banking organizations it supervises, including us and State Street Bank, if, in the Federal Reserve’s opinion, the payment of a dividend would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice in light of the financial condition of the banking organization.  All of these policies and other requirements could affect our ability to pay





State Street Corporation |8






dividends and purchase our stock, or require us to provide capital assistance to State Street Bank and any other banking subsidiary.

In June2016, we received the results of the Federal Reserve’s review of our 2016 capital plan in connection with its2016annual CCAR process.  The Federal Reserve did not object to the capital actions we proposed in our2016capital plan and, in July 2016, our Board approved a new common stock purchase program authorizing the purchase of up to$1.4 billionof our common stock through June 30, 2017.  As ofDecember 31, 2016, we purchased approximately9.0 millionshares of our common stock at an average per-share cost of $72.66and an aggregate cost of approximately $650 millionunder this program.  Our2016capital plan included an increase, subject to approval by our Board, to our quarterly stock dividend to $0.38 per share from $0.34 per share, beginning in the third quarter of 2016.

The Federal Reserve, under the Dodd-Frank Act, requires us to conduct semi-annual State Street-run stress tests.  Under this rule, we are required to publicly disclose the summary results of our State Street-run stress tests under the severely adverse economic scenario.  In October 2016, we provided summary results of our 2016 mid-cycle State Street-run stress tests on the “Investor Relations” section of our corporate website.  The rule also subjects us to an annual supervisory stress test conducted by the Federal Reserve.

The Dodd-Frank Act also requires State Street Bank to conduct an annual stress test.  State Street Bank must submit its 2017 annual State Street Bank-run stress test to the Federal Reserve by April 5, 2017.

In September 2016, the Federal Reserve proposed revisions to the capital plan and stress test requirements that would, among other things, reduce thede minimisthreshold for additional capital distributions that a firm may make during a capital plan cycle without seeking the Federal Reserve’s prior approval. The proposal would also establish a one-quarter “blackout period” while the Federal Reserve is conducting CCAR during which firms would not be permitted to submitde minimisexception notices or prior approval requests for additional capital distributions.

The Volcker Rule

In December 2013, U.S. regulators issued final regulations to implement the Volcker rule.  The Volcker rule prohibits banking entities, including us and our affiliates, from engaging in certain prohibited proprietary trading activities, as defined in the final Volcker rule regulations, subject to exemptions for market-making related activities, risk-mitigating hedging, underwriting and certain other activities.



The Volcker rule also requires banking entities to either restructure or divest certain ownership interests in, and relationships with, covered funds (as such terms are defined in the final Volcker rule regulations).

The Volcker rule became effective in July 2012, and the final implementing regulations became effective in April 2014.  We were required to bring our activities and investments into conformance with the Volcker rule and its final regulations by July 21, 2015, with the exception of certain activities and investments. Under a 2016 conformance period extension issued by the Federal Reserve, all investments in and relationships with investments in a covered fund made or entered into after December 31, 2013 by a banking entity and its affiliates, and all proprietary trading activities of those entities, were required to be in conformance with the Volcker rule and its final implementing regulations by July 21, 2016.  On July 7, 2016, the Federal Reserve  announced a final one-year extension of the general conformance period for banking entities to conform ownership interests in, and relationships with, legacy covered funds to July 21, 2017. On December 12, 2016, the Federal Reserve issued a policy statement with information about how banking entities may seek a statutory extension of the conformance period of five years for certain legacy covered funds that are also illiquid funds.

Whether certain types of investment securities or structures such asCLOs constitute covered funds, as defined in the final Volcker rule regulations, and do not benefit from the exemptions provided in the Volcker rule, and whether a banking organization's investments therein constitute ownership interests remain subject to (1) market, and ultimately regulatory, interpretation and (2) the specific terms and other characteristics relevant to such investment securities and structures.

As ofDecember 31, 2016, we held approximately$972 millionof investments in CLOs.  As of the same date, these investments had an aggregate pre-tax net unrealized gain of approximately$11 million, composed primarily of gross unrealized gains. Comparatively, as of December 31, 2015, we held approximately$2.10 billionof investments in CLOs, which had an aggregate pre-tax net unrealized gain of approximately$43 millioncomposed of gross unrealized gains of$46 millionand gross unrealized losses of$3 million.  In the event that we or our banking regulators conclude that such investments in CLOs, or other investments, are covered funds under the Volcker rule, we may be required to divest such investments.  If other banking entities reach similar conclusions with respect to similar investments held by them, the prices of such investments could decline significantly, and we may be required to divest such





State Street Corporation |9






investments at a significant discount compared to the investments' book value.  This could result in a material adverse effect on our consolidated statement of income or on our consolidated statement of condition in the period in which such a divestiture occurs.

The final Volcker rule regulations also require banking entities to establish extensive programs designed to ensure compliance with the restrictions of the Volcker rule.  We have established a compliance program which we believe complies with the final Volcker rule regulations as currently in effect.  Such compliance program restricts our ability in the future to service certain types of funds, in particular covered funds for which SSGA acts as an advisor and certain types of trustee relationships.  Consequently, Volcker rule compliance entails both the cost of a compliance program and loss of certain revenue and future opportunities.

Enhanced Prudential Standards

The Dodd-Frank Act established a new regulatory framework to regulate banking organizations designated asSIFIs, and has subjected them to heightened prudential standards, including heightened capital, leverage, liquidity and risk management requirements, single-counterparty credit limits and early remediation requirements.  Bank holding companies with $50 billion or more in consolidated assets, which includes us, became automatically subject to the systemic-risk regime in 2010.

The FSOC can recommend prudential standards, reporting and disclosure requirements to the Federal Reserve for SIFIs, and must approve any finding by the Federal Reserve that a financial institution poses a grave threat to financial stability and must undertake mitigating actions.  The FSOC is also empowered to designate systemically important payment, clearing and settlement activities of financial institutions, subjecting them to prudential supervision and regulation, and, assisted by the new Office of Financial Research within the U.S. Department of the Treasury, also established by the Dodd-Frank Act, can gather data and reports from financial institutions, including us.

In February 2014, the Federal Reserve approved a final rule implementing certain of the Dodd-Frank Act’s enhanced prudential standards for large bank holding companies such as State Street.  Under the final rule, we are required to comply with various liquidity-related risk management standards and maintain a liquidity buffer of unencumbered highly liquid assets based on the results of internal liquidity stress testing.  This liquidity buffer is in addition to other liquidity requirements, such as the LCR and, when implemented, the NSFR.  The final rule also establishes requirements and



responsibilities for our risk committee and mandates risk management standards.  We became subject to these new standards on January 1, 2015.

In March 2016, the Federal Reserve re-proposed rules that would establish single-counterparty credit limits for large banking organizations, with more stringent limits for the largest banking organizations. U.S. G-SIBs, including us, would be subject to a limit of 15% of tier 1 capital for credit exposures to any “major counterparty” (defined as other U.S. G-SIBs, foreign G-SIBs and non-bank SIFIs supervised by the Federal Reserve) and to a limit of 25% of tier 1 capital for credit exposures to any other unaffiliated counterparty.

In May 2016, the Federal Reserve proposed a rule that would impose contractual requirements on certain “qualified financial contracts” to which U.S. G-SIBs, including us, and their subsidiaries are parties. Under the proposal, certain qualified financial contracts must expressly provide that transfer restrictions and default rights against a U.S. G-SIB, or subsidiary of a U.S. G-SIB, are limited to the same extent as provided under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act and Title II of the Dodd-Frank Act and their implementing regulations. In addition, certain qualified financial contracts may not permit the exercise of cross-default rights against a U.S. G-SIB or subsidiary of a U.S. G-SIB based on an affiliate’s entry into insolvency, resolution or similar proceedings. If adopted as proposed, the requirements would take effect at the start of the first calendar quarter that begins at least one year after the final rule is issued.

Refer to the risk factor titled“We assume significant credit risk to counterparties, many of which are major financial institutions. These financial institutions and other counterparties may also have substantial financial dependencies with other financial institutions and sovereign entities.  This credit exposure and concentration could expose us to financial loss”included under "Risk Factors" under Item 1A of this Form 10-K.  In addition, the final rules create a new early-remediation regime to address financial distress or material management weaknesses determined with reference to four levels of early remediation, including heightened supervisory review, initial remediation, recovery, and resolution assessment, with specific limitations and requirements tied to each level.

The systemic-risk regime also provides that, for institutions deemed to pose a grave threat to U.S. financial stability, the Federal Reserve, upon an FSOC vote, must limit that institution’s ability to merge, restrict its ability to offer financial products, require it to terminate activities, impose conditions on activities or, as a last resort, require it to dispose of assets.  Upon a grave-threat determination by the





State Street Corporation |10






FSOC, the Federal Reserve must issue rules that require financial institutions subject to the systemic-risk regime to maintain a debt-to-equity ratio of no more than 15 to 1 if the FSOC considers it necessary to mitigate the risk of the grave threat.  The Federal Reserve also has the ability to establish further standards, including those regarding contingent capital, enhanced public disclosures, and limits on short-term debt, including off-balance sheet exposures.

Resolution Planning

The parent company and the newly formed direct subsidiary would obligate themselves, under a contract we refer to as a support agreement and using up to substantially all of their resources, to recapitalize and/or provide liquidity to State Street Bank and our other material entities in the event of material financial distress. The parent company and the newly formed direct subsidiary would secure their obligations under the support agreement by entering into a contract known as a security agreement and by pledging their rights in the assets that the parent company and the newly formed direct subsidiary would use to fulfill their obligations under the support



agreement to State Street Bank and other material entities. The parent company intends to pre-fund the newly formed direct subsidiary upon the execution of the support agreement by transferring assets to it that will be available for the subsequent provision of capital and liquidity to State Street Bank and our other material entities. These contractual, funding and related arrangements are expected to be in place prior to July 1, 2017 to aid State Street in meeting its regulatory obligations.

We are required to submit our next annual resolution plan to the Federal Reserve and the FDIC on July 1, 2017. The Federal Reserve and the FDIC may determine that our 2017 resolution plan is not credible or would not facilitate an orderly resolution due to a number of factors, including, but not limited to: (1) challenges we may experience in interpreting and addressing regulatory expectations; (2) any failure to implement remediation actions in a timely manner; (3) the complexities in developing and implementing a comprehensive plan to resolve a global custodial bank; and (4) related costs and





State Street Corporation |11






dependencies. If our resolution plan submission filed on July 1, 2017, or any future submission, fails to meet regulatory expectations to the satisfaction of the Federal Reserve and the FDIC, we could be subject to more stringent capital, leverage or liquidity requirements, restrictions on our growth, activities or operations, or we could be required to divest certain of our assets or operations.

State Street Bank is also required to submit annually to the FDIC a plan for resolution in the event of its failure, referred to as an IDI plan. State Street Bank’s next IDI plan is due in October 2017.

Orderly Liquidation Authority

Under the Dodd-Frank Act, certain financial companies, including bank holding companies such as State Street, and certain covered subsidiaries, can be subjected to a new orderly liquidation authority.  The U.S. Treasury Secretary, in consultation with the President, must first make certain extraordinary financial distress and systemic risk determinations, and action must be recommended by two-thirds of the FDIC Board and two-thirds of the Federal Reserve Board.  Absent such actions, we, as a bank holding company, would remain subject to the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.

The orderly liquidation authority went into effect in July 2010, and rulemaking is proceeding in stages, with some regulations now finalized and others planned but not yet proposed.  If we were subject to the orderly liquidation authority, the FDIC would be appointed as our receiver, which would give the FDIC considerable powers to resolve us, including: (1) the power to remove officers and directors responsible for our failure and to appoint new directors and officers; (2) the power to assign assets and liabilities to a third party or bridge financial company without the need for creditor consent or prior court review; (3) the ability to differentiate among creditors, including by treating junior creditors better than senior creditors, subject to a minimum recovery right to receive at least what they would have received in bankruptcy liquidation; and (4) broad powers to administer the claims process to determine distributions from the assets of the receivership to creditors not transferred to a third party or bridge financial institution.

In December 2013, the FDIC released its proposed single-point-of-entry strategy for resolution of a SIFI under the orderly liquidation authority. The FDIC’s release outlines how it would use its powers under the orderly liquidation authority to resolve a SIFI by placing its top-tier U.S. holding company in receivership and keeping its operating subsidiaries open and out of insolvency proceedings by transferring the operating subsidiaries to a new bridge holding company, recapitalizing the operating subsidiaries and imposing losses on the shareholders



and creditors of the holding company in receivership according to their statutory order of priority.

Derivatives

Title VII of the Dodd-Frank Act imposes a new regulatory structure on the over-the-counter derivatives market, including requirements for clearing, exchange trading, capital, margin, reporting and record-keeping. Title VII also requires certain persons to register as a major swap participant, a swap dealer or a securities-based swap dealer.  TheCFTC, the SEC, and other U.S. regulators have adopted and are still in the process of adopting regulations to implement Title VII.  Through this rulemaking process, these regulators collectively have adopted or proposed, among other things, regulations relating to reporting and record-keeping obligations, margin and capital requirements, the scope of registration and the central clearing and exchange trading requirements for certain over-the-counter derivatives.  The CFTC has also issued rules to enhance the oversight of clearing and trading entities.  The CFTC, along with other regulators, including the Federal Reserve, have also issued final rules with respect to margin requirements for uncleared derivatives transactions.

State Street Bank has registered provisionally with the CFTC as a swap dealer.  As a provisionally registered swap dealer, State Street Bank is subject to significant regulatory obligations regarding its swap activity and the supervision, examination and enforcement powers of the CFTC and other regulators.  In December 2013, the CFTC granted State Street Bank a limited-purpose swap dealer designation.  Under this limited-purpose designation, interest-rate swap activity engaged in by State Street Bank’s Global Treasury group is not subject to certain of the swap regulatory requirements otherwise applicable to swaps entered into by a registered swap dealer, subject to a number of conditions.  For all other swap transactions, our swap activities remain subject to all applicable swap dealer regulations.

Money Market Funds

In July 2014, the SEC adopted amendments to the regulations governing money market funds to address potential systemic risks and improve transparency for money market fund investors.  Among other things, the amendments require a floating net asset value for institutional prime money market funds (i.e., money market funds that are either not restricted to natural person investors or not restricted to investing primarily in U.S. government securities) and permit (and in some cases require) all money market funds to impose redemption fees and gates under certain circumstances.  As a result of these reforms, money market funds may be required to take certain steps that will affect their structure and/or operations, which could in turn affect the





State Street Corporation |12






liquidity, marketability and return potential of such funds.  Full conformance with these amendments was required by October 14, 2016.

Money market reforms are also being considered in Europe.  The timing and content of those regulations remains uncertain.  The SEC's July 2014 amended regulations, and the potential reforms in Europe, could alter the business models of money market fund sponsors and asset managers, including many of our servicing clients and SSGA, and may result in reduced levels of investment in money market funds.  As a result, these requirements may have an adverse impact on our business, our operations or our consolidated results of operations.

Subsidiaries

The Federal Reserve is the primary federal banking agency responsible for regulating us and our subsidiaries, including State Street Bank, with respect to both our U.S. and non-U.S. operations.

Our banking subsidiaries are subject to supervision and examination by various regulatory authorities.  State Street Bank is a member of the Federal Reserve System, its deposits are insured by the FDIC and it is subject to applicable federal and state banking laws and to supervision and examination by the Federal Reserve, as well as by the Massachusetts Commissioner of Banks, the FDIC, and the regulatory authorities of those states and countries in which State Street Bank operates a branch.  Our other subsidiary trust companies are subject to supervision and examination by the OCC, the Federal Reserve or by the appropriate state banking regulatory authorities of the states in which they are organized and operate.  Our non-U.S. banking subsidiaries are subject to regulation by the regulatory authorities of the countries in which they operate.  As ofDecember 31, 2016, the capital of each of these banking subsidiaries exceeded the minimum legal capital requirements set by those regulatory authorities.

We and our subsidiaries that are not subsidiaries of State Street Bank are affiliates of State Street Bank under federal banking laws, which impose restrictions on various types of transactions, including loans, extensions of credit, investments or asset purchases by or from State Street Bank, on the one hand, to us and those of our subsidiaries, on the other.  Transactions of this kind between State Street Bank and its affiliates are limited with respect to each affiliate to 10% of State Street Bank’s capital and surplus, as defined by the aforementioned banking laws, and to 20% in the aggregate for all affiliates, and in some cases are also subject to strict collateral requirements.  Under the Dodd-Frank Act, effective in July 2012, derivatives, securities borrowing and securities lending transactions between State Street Bank and its affiliates became subject to these



restrictions.  The Dodd-Frank Act also expanded the scope of transactions required to be collateralized.  In addition, the Volcker rule generally prohibits similar transactions between the parent company or any of its affiliates and covered funds for which we or any of our affiliates serve as the investment manager, investment adviser, commodity trading advisor or sponsor and other covered funds organized and offered pursuant to specific exemptions in the final Volcker rule regulations.

Federal law also requires that certain transactions with affiliates be on terms and under circumstances, including credit standards, that are substantially the same, or at least as favorable to the institution, as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions involving other non-affiliated companies.  Alternatively, in the absence of comparable transactions, the transactions must be on terms and under circumstances, including credit standards, that in good faith would be offered to, or would apply to, non-affiliated companies.

State Street Bank is also prohibited from engaging in certain tie-in arrangements in connection with any extension of credit or lease or sale of property or furnishing of services.  Federal law provides as well for a depositor preference on amounts realized from the liquidation or other resolution of any depository institution insured by the FDIC.

Our subsidiaries,SSGA FMandSSGA Ltd., act as investment advisers to investment companies registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940.  SSGA FM, incorporated in Massachusetts in 2001 and headquartered in Boston, Massachusetts, is registered with the SEC as an investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and is registered with theCFTCas a commodity trading adviser and pool operator.  SSGA Ltd., incorporated in 1990 as a U.K. limited company and domiciled in the U.K., is also registered with the SEC as an investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.  SSGA Ltd. is also authorized and regulated by the FCA and is an investment firm under the MiFID.  SSGA FM and SSGA Ltd. each offer a variety of investment management solutions, including active, enhanced and passive equity, active and passive fixed-income, cash management, multi-asset class solutions and real estate.  In addition, a major portion of our investment management activities are conducted by State Street Bank, which is subject to supervision primarily by the Federal Reserve with respect to these activities.

Our U.S. broker/dealer subsidiary is registered as a broker/dealer with the SEC, is subject to regulation by the SEC (including the SEC’s net capital rule) and is a member of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, a self-regulatory organization.





State Street Corporation |13






The U.K. broker/dealer business operates through our subsidiary, State Street Global Markets International Limited, which is registered in the U.K. as a regulated securities broker, is authorized and regulated by the FCA and is an investment firm under the MiFID.  It is also a member of the London Stock Exchange.  In accordance with the rules of the FCA, the U.K. broker/dealer publishes information on its risk management objectives and on policies associated with its regulatory capital requirements and resources.  Many aspects of our investment management activities are subject to federal and state laws and regulations primarily intended to benefit the investment holder, rather than our shareholders.

Our activities as a futures commission merchant are subject to regulation by the CFTC in the U.S. and various regulatory authorities internationally, as well as the membership requirements of the applicable clearinghouses.  In addition, we have a subsidiary registered with the CFTC as a swap execution facility, and our U.S. broker/dealer subsidiary also offers a U.S. equities alternative trading system registered with the SEC.

These laws and regulations generally grant supervisory agencies and bodies broad administrative powers, including the power to limit or restrict us from conducting our investment management activities in the event that we fail to comply with such laws and regulations, and examination authority.  Our business related to investment management and trusteeship of collective trust funds and separate accounts offered to employee benefit plans is subject to ERISA, and is regulated by the U.S. Department of Labor.

Our businesses, including our investment management and securities and futures businesses, are also regulated extensively by non-U.S. governments, securities exchanges, self-regulatory organizations, central banks and regulatory bodies, especially in those jurisdictions in which we maintain an office.  For instance, among others, the FCA, the U.K. PRA and the Bank of England regulate our activities in the U.K.; the Central Bank of Ireland regulates our activities in Ireland; the German Federal Financial Supervisory Authority regulates our activities in Germany; the Commission de Surveillance du Secteur Financier regulates our activities in Luxembourg; our German banking group and the Luxembourg banks are also subject to direct supervision by the European Central Bank under the ECB Single Supervisory Mechanism; the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority and the Australian Securities and Investments Commission regulate our activities in Australia; and the Financial Services Agency and the Bank of Japan regulate our activities in Japan.  We have established policies, procedures, and systems designed to comply with the requirements of these organizations.  However, as a



global financial services institution, we face complexity and costs related to regulation.

The majority of our non-U.S. asset servicing operations are conducted pursuant to the Federal Reserve's Regulation K through State Street Bank’s Edge Act subsidiary or through international branches of State Street Bank.  An Edge Act corporation is a corporation organized under federal law that conducts foreign business activities.  In general, banks may not make investments in their Edge Act corporations (and similar state law corporations) that exceed 20% of their capital and surplus, as defined, and the investment of any amount in excess of 10% of capital and surplus requires the prior approval of the Federal Reserve.

In addition to our non-U.S. operations conducted pursuant to Regulation K, we also make new investments abroad directly (through us or through our non-banking subsidiaries) pursuant to the Federal Reserve's Regulation Y, or through international bank branch expansion, neither of which is subject to the investment limitations applicable to Edge Act subsidiaries.

Additionally, Massachusetts has its own bank holding company statute, under which State Street, among other things, may be required to obtain prior approval by the Massachusetts Board of Bank Incorporation for an acquisition of more than 5% of any additional bank's voting shares, or for other forms of bank acquisitions.

Anti-Money Laundering and Financial Transparency

We and certain of our subsidiaries are subject to the Bank Secrecy Act of 1970, as amended by the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001, and related regulations, which containAMLand financial transparency provisions and which require implementation of  an AML compliance program, including processes for verifying client identification and monitoring client transactions and detecting and reporting suspicious activities.  AML laws outside the U.S. contain similar requirements.  We have implemented policies, procedures and internal controls that are designed to promote compliance with all applicable AML laws and regulations.  Compliance with applicable AML and related requirements is a common area of review for financial regulators, and any failure by us to comply with these requirements could result in fines, penalties, lawsuits, regulatory sanctions, difficulties in obtaining governmental approvals, restrictions on our business activities or harm to our reputation.

On June 1, 2015, we entered into a written agreement with the Federal Reserve and the Massachusetts Division of Banks relating to deficiencies identified in our compliance programs with the requirements of the Bank Secrecy Act, AML regulations and U.S. economic sanctions regulations





State Street Corporation |14






promulgated by OFAC.  As part of this enforcement action, we are required to, among other things, implement improvements to our compliance programs and to retain an independent firm to conduct a review of account and transaction activity covering a prior three-month period to evaluate whether any suspicious activity not previously reported should have been identified and reported in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements.  To the extent deficiencies in our historical reporting are identified as a result of the transaction review or if we fail to comply with the terms of the written agreement, we may become subject to fines and other regulatory sanctions, which may have a material adverse effect on us.

Deposit Insurance

FDIC-insured depository institutions are required to pay deposit insurance assessments to the FDIC.  The Dodd-Frank Act made permanent the general $250,000 deposit insurance limit for insured deposits.

The FDIC’sDIFis funded by assessments on insured depository institutions.  The FDIC assesses DIF premiums based on an insured depository institution's average consolidated total assets, less the average tangible equity of the insured depository institution during the assessment period.  For larger institutions, such as State Street Bank, assessments are determined based on regulatory ratings and forward-looking financial measures to calculate the assessment rate, which is subject to adjustments by the FDIC, and the assessment base.

The Dodd-Frank Act also directed the FDIC to determine whether and to what extent adjustments to the assessment base are appropriate for “custody banks".  The FDIC has concluded that certain liquid assets could be excluded from the deposit insurance assessment base of custody banks that satisfy specified institutional eligibility criteria.  This has the effect of reducing the amount of DIF insurance premiums due from custody banks.  State Street Bank is a custody bank for this purpose.  The custody bank assessment adjustment may not exceed total transaction account deposits identified by the institution as being directly linked to a fiduciary or custody and safekeeping asset.

On March 15, 2016, the FDIC issued a final rule that imposes on insured depository institutions with at least $10 billion in assets, which includes State Street, a surcharge of 4.5 cents per $100 per annum of their assessment base for deposit insurance,  as defined by the FDIC,  until the DIF reaches the required ratio of 1.35, which the FDIC estimates would take approximately two years. The surcharge took effect for the assessment period beginning on July 1, 2016.



Prompt Corrective Action

The FDIC Improvement Act of 1991 requires the appropriate federal banking regulator to take “prompt corrective action” with respect to a depository institution if that institution does not meet certain capital adequacy standards, including minimum capital ratios.  While these regulations apply only to banks, such as State Street Bank, the Federal Reserve is authorized to take appropriate action against a parent bank holding company, such as our parent company, based on the under-capitalized status of any banking subsidiary.  In certain instances, we would be required to guarantee the performance of the capital restoration plan if one of our banking subsidiaries were undercapitalized.

Support of Subsidiary Banks

Under Federal Reserve regulations, a bank holding company such as our parent company is required to act as a source of financial and managerial strength to its banking subsidiaries.  This requirement was added to the Federal Deposit Insurance Act by the Dodd-Frank Act and means that we are expected to commit resources to State Street Bank and any other banking subsidiary in circumstances in which we otherwise might not do so absent such a requirement.  In the event of bankruptcy, any commitment by us to a federal bank regulatory agency to maintain the capital of a banking subsidiary will be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee and will be entitled to a priority payment.

Insolvency of an Insured U.S. Subsidiary Depository Institution

If the FDIC is appointed the conservator or receiver of an FDIC-insured U.S. subsidiary depository institution, such as State Street Bank, upon its insolvency or certain other events, the FDIC has the ability to transfer any of the depository institution’s assets and liabilities to a new obligor without the approval of the depository institution’s creditors, enforce the terms of the depository institution’s contracts pursuant to their terms or repudiate or disaffirm contracts or leases to which the depository institution is a party.  Additionally, the claims of holders of deposit liabilities and certain claims for administrative expenses against an insured depository institution would be afforded priority overother general unsecured claims against such an institution, including claims of debt holders of the institution and, under current interpretation, depositors in non-U.S. offices, in the liquidation or other resolution of such an institution by any receiver.  As a result, such persons would be treated differently from and could receive, if anything, substantially less than the depositors in U.S. offices of the depository institution.

ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND GOVERNMENT POLICIES

Economic policies of the U.S. government and its agencies influence our operating environment.  Monetary policy conducted by the Federal Reserve directly affects the level of interest rates, which may affect overall credit conditions of the economy.  Monetary policy is applied by the Federal Reserve through open market operations in U.S. government securities, changes in reserve requirements for depository institutions, and changes in the discount rate and availability of borrowing from the Federal Reserve.  Government regulation of banks and bank holding companies is intended primarily for the protection of depositors of the banks, rather than for the shareholders of the institutions and therefore may, in some cases, be adverse to the interests of those shareholders.  We are similarly affected by the economic policies of non-U.S. government agencies, such as theECB.



CYBER RISK MANAGEMENT

In October 2016, the Federal Reserve, FDIC and OCC issued an advance notice of proposed rulemaking regarding enhanced cyber risk management standards, which would apply to a wide range of large financial institutions and their third-party service providers, including State Street and its banking subsidiaries. The proposed standards would expand existing cybersecurity regulations and guidance to focus on cyber risk governance and management; management of internal and external dependencies; and incident response, cyber resilience and situational awareness. In addition, the proposal contemplates more stringent standards for institutions with systems that are critical to the financial sector.
