Item 1.Business

Overview

MasterCard is a technology company in the global payments industry that connects consumers, financial institutions, merchants, governments and businesses worldwide, enabling them to use electronic forms of payment instead of cash and checks.  We make payments more convenient, secure and efficient by creating solutions that meet the needs of all of our stakeholders, and thereby drive preference for electronic payments.  We offer a wide range of payment solutions that enable the development and implementation of credit, debit, prepaid, commercial and related payment programs and solutions for consumers and merchants.  Our customers encompass a vast array of entities, including financial institutions and other entities that act as “issuers” and “acquirers”, merchants, governments, telecommunications companies and other businesses.  We manage a family of well-known, widely-accepted payment brands, including MasterCard®, Maestro® and Cirrus®, which our customers use in their payment programs and solutions.  We process payment transactions over the MasterCard Worldwide Network and provide support services to our customers and others.  We establish and enforce a common set of standards for adherence by our customers for the efficient and secure use of our payments network.

We generate revenue by charging fees to our customers for providing transaction processing and other payment-related services and by assessing our customers based primarily on the dollar volume of activity, or gross dollar volume (“GDV”), on the cards and other devices that carry our brands.

Our business has a global reach and has continued to experience growth.  In2012, we processed34.2 billiontransactions, a25%increase over the number of transactions processed in2011.  GDV on cards carrying the MasterCard logo as reported by our customers was$3.6 trillionin2012, a15%increase in local currency terms and a12%increase in U.S. dollar terms over the GDV reported in 2011.

Our ability to grow is based on three drivers:

•personal consumption expenditure growth;

•the trend within the global payments industry away from paper-based forms of payment, such as cash and checks, toward electronic forms of payment (such as those made via payment cards and other devices); and

•our share in electronic payments through innovative solutions and new technology.

We support our focus on these drivers by continuing to:

•grow our core businesses globally, including credit, debit, prepaid and commercial programs and solutions, as well as the processing of payment transactions over the MasterCard Worldwide Network,









•diversify our business by seeking new areas of growth in markets around the world, expanding points of acceptance globally, seeking to maintain unsurpassed acceptance, and deepening existing relationships or entering into new relationships with payments industry participants, such as merchants, governments and telecommunications companies, and

•build new businesses through technology and continued strategic efforts and alliances focused on innovative payment methods like e-commerce and mobile.

We operate in a dynamic and rapidly evolving legal and regulatory environment.  In recent years, we have faced heightened regulatory and legislative scrutiny and other legal challenges, particularly with respect to interchange fees.  Interchange fees balance payments system costs among acquirers and issuers (and in turn, among merchants and cardholders).  These fees, however, have been the subject of regulatory review and challenges and legislative action, as well as litigation, as electronic forms of payment have become relatively more important to local economies.  Although we establish certain interchange rates and collect and remit interchange fees on behalf of our customers, we do not earn revenues from interchange fees.    See “Risk Factors-Legal and Regulatory Risks” in Part I, Item 1A of this Report.

The Global Payments Industry

We operate in the global payments industry, which consists of all forms of payment including:

•Paper-based payments - cash, personal checks, money orders, official checks, travelers cheques and other paper-based means of transferring value;

•Card-based payments - credit cards, charge cards, debit and deferred debit cards (including cash access or Automated Teller Machine (“ATM”) cards), prepaid cards and other types of cards;

•Contactless, mobile and web-based payments - contactless payments, electronic payments through mobile phones and other handheld devices using a variety of applications, and e-commerce transactions on the Internet and through web browsers; and

•Other electronic payments - wire transfers, electronic benefits transfers, bill payments and automated clearing house payments, among others.

The most common card-based forms of payment are general purpose cards, which are payment cards carrying logos that permit widespread use of the cards within countries, regions or around the world.  General purpose cards have different attributes depending on the type of accounts to which they are linked:

•credit or charge cards typically access a credit account that either requires payment of the full balance within a specified period (a charge card) or that permits the cardholder to carry a balance in a revolving credit account (a credit card);

•debit cards typically access a deposit account or other account with accessible funds maintained by the cardholder; and

•prepaid cards typically access previously-funded monetary value.

The primary general purpose card brands include MasterCard, Visa®, American Express®, JCB®, Diners Club®, UnionPay® and Discover®.  These brands, including MasterCard, have come to be associated with a variety of forms of payment in the United States and other markets around the world, including (depending on the brand) credit, charge, debit and prepaid cards.  Regional and domestic/local debit brands that require a personal identification number (“PIN”) for verification represent alternative, and sometimes primary, brands within many countries.  In these markets, issuers have historically relied on the Maestro and Cirrus brands (and other brands) to enable cross-border transactions, which typically constitute a small portion of the overall number of transactions.

In addition to general purpose cards, private label cards comprise a portion of all card-based forms of payment. Typically, private label cards are credit cards issued by, or on behalf of, a merchant (such as a department store or gasoline retailer) and can be used only at that merchant's locations.

Payment Services and Solutions

We provide transaction processing and other payment-related services as well as a wide range of payment solutions to enable our customers to design, package and implement products and programs targeted to the specific needs of their customers.  We work with customers to provide customized solutions, as well as more general solutions.  Our payment solutions are built upon









our expertise in payment programs, product development, payment processing technology, loyalty and rewards solutions, payment security, consulting and information services and marketing.We also manage and promote our brands for the benefit of all customers through advertising, promotional and interactive programs and sponsorship initiatives.

Transaction Processing on the MasterCard Worldwide Network

Introduction.We operate the MasterCard Worldwide Network, our proprietary, global payments network that links issuers and acquirers around the globe to facilitate the processing of transactions and, through them, permits MasterCard cardholders to use their cards and other payment devices at millions of merchants worldwide.  We process transactions through our network for financial institutions and other entities that are our customers, in more than 150 currencies in more than 210 countries and territories.

Typical Transaction.  A typical transaction processed over the MasterCard Worldwide Network involves four participants in addition to us: cardholder, merchant, issuer (the cardholder's financial institution) and acquirer (the merchant's financial institution).  The following diagram depicts a typical point-of-interaction card transaction:



In a typical transaction, a cardholder purchases goods or services from a merchant using a card or other payment device.  After the transaction is authorized by the issuer using our network, the issuer pays the acquirer an amount equal to the value of the transaction, minus the interchange fee (described below), and then posts the transaction to the cardholder's account.  The acquirer pays the amount of the purchase, net of a discount (referred to as the “merchant discount” rate, as further described below), to the merchant.  The merchant discount rate, among other things, takes into consideration the amount of the interchange fee.

Interchange Fees.

Merchant Discount Rate.The merchant discount rate is established by the acquirer to cover its costs of participating in the four-party system and generally to provide for a profit margin with respect to services rendered to the merchant.  The rate takes into consideration the amount of the interchange fee which the acquirer generally pays to the issuer.









Additional Fees and Economic Considerations.Among the parties in a four-party system, various types of fees may be charged to different constituents for various services.  For example, acquirers may charge merchants processing and related fees in addition to the merchant discount rate.  Issuers may also charge cardholders fees for the transaction, including, for example, fees for extending revolving credit.  As described below, we charge issuers and acquirers transaction-based and related fees for the transaction processing and related services we provide them.

In a four-party payments system, the economics of a payment transaction relative to MasterCard vary widely depending on such factors as whether the transaction is domestic (and, if it is domestic, the country in which it takes place) or cross-border, whether it is a point-of-sale purchase transaction or cash withdrawal, and whether the transaction is processed over our network or a third-party network or is handled solely by a financial institution that is both the acquirer for the merchant and the issuer to the cardholder (an “on-us” transaction).

Authentication.  Generally, transactions processed over our network can be authenticated at the point of interaction and across the processing value chain.  A typical transaction processed over our network can be authenticated in several ways (depending on the type of card or device being used):

•“signature-based” transactions that typically require a cardholder to sign a sales receipt as the primary means of validation at the point of interaction (other than circumstances, such as purchases over the internet and low-value purchases, where a signature is not necessary);

•“PIN-based” transactions that require the cardholder to input a PIN for verification which can be validated by the issuer at their processing site; and

•transactions using chip-enabled cards and point-of-interaction devices which allow for automatic authentication between the card and device (as well as, depending on the card or device, signature or PIN authentication).

In addition, some payment cards and devices are equipped with an RFID (radio frequency identification) microchip, which provides an advanced authentication technique, and technology that allows contactless payments requiring neither signature nor PIN under established maximum transaction amounts.

MasterCard Worldwide Network Architecture and Operations.  We believe the architecture of the MasterCard Worldwide Network is unique, featuring a globally integrated structure that provides scalability for our customers and enables them to expand into regional and global markets.  Our network also features an intelligent architecture that enables it to adapt to the needs of each transaction by blending two distinct processing structures-distributed (peer-to-peer) and centralized (hub-and-spoke).  Transactions that require fast, reliable processing, such as those submitted using a contactless card or device at a toll booth, can use the network's distributed processing structure, ensuring they are processed close to where the transaction occurred.  Transactions that require value-added processing, such as real-time access to transaction data for fraud scoring or rewards at the point-of-sale, or customization of transaction data for unique consumer-spending controls, use the network's centralized processing structure, ensuring advanced processing services are applied to the transaction.  Through the unique architecture of our network, we are able to connect all parties with respect to payments transactions regardless of whether the transaction is occurring at a traditional physical location, at an ATM, on the internet or through a mobile device.

The network typically operates at under 80% capacity and has the capacity to handle more than 160 million transactions per hour with an average network response time of 130 milliseconds.  The network can also substantially scale capacity to meet demand.  Our transaction processing services are available 24 hours per day, every day of the year.  Our global payments network provides multiple levels of back-up protection and related continuity procedures should the issuer, acquirer or payments network experience a service interruption.  Moreover, the network features multiple layers of protection against hacking or other cyber-attacks.  See our risk factor in "Risk Factors - Business Risks" in Part I, Item 1A of this Report related to a failure or breach of our security systems or infrastructure as a result of cyber-attacks.  We supplement this protection with mitigation efforts to strengthen our protection against such threats, both in terms of operability of the network and protection of the information transmitted through the network.  To date, we have consistently maintained availability of our global processing systems more than 99.9% of the time.

Processing Capabilities.

•Transaction Switching - Authorization, Clearing and Settlement.We provide transaction switching (authorization, clearing and settlement) through the MasterCard Worldwide Network.

◦Authorization.  Authorization refers to the process by which a transaction is routed to the issuer for approval and then a decision whether or not to approve the transaction is made by the issuer or, in certain circumstances such as when the issuer's systems are unavailable or cannot be contacted, by MasterCard or others on behalf









of the issuer in accordance with either the issuer's instructions or applicable rules (also known as “stand-in”).  Our standards, which may vary across regions, establish the circumstances under which merchants and acquirers must seek authorization of transactions.

◦Clearing.  Clearing refers to the exchange of financial transaction information between issuers and acquirers after a transaction has been successfully conducted at the point of interaction.  We clear transactions among customers through our processing systems.

◦Settlement.  Once transactions have been authorized and cleared, we help to settle the transactions by facilitating the exchange of funds between parties.  Once clearing is completed, a daily reconciliation is provided to each customer involved in settlement, detailing the net amounts by clearing cycle and a final settlement position.  The actual exchange of funds takes place between a settlement bank, designated by the customer and approved by us, and a settlement bank chosen by us.  Customer settlement occurs generally in U.S. dollars or in a limited number of other currencies in accordance with our established rules.



•

Cross-Border and Domestic Processing.

•Extended Processing Capabilities.In addition to transaction switching, we continually evaluate and invest in ways to strategically extend our processing capabilities in the payments value chain by seeking to provide our customers with an expanded suite of payment processing solutions that meet the unique processing needs of their markets.  Examples include:

◦MasterCard Integrated Processing Solutions®.MasterCard Integrated Processing Solutions (“IPS”) is a debit and prepaid issuer processing platform designed to provide medium to large global issuing customers with a complete processing solution to help create differentiated products and services and allow quick deployment of payments portfolios across banking channels.  Through a single processing platform, IPS can, among other things, authorize debit and prepaid transactions, assist issuers in managing risk using fraud detection tools, manage an issuer's card base, and manage and monitor an issuer's ATMs.  The proprietary MasterCard Total Portfolio View™ tool provides a user-friendly customer interface to IPS, delivering aggregate cardholder intelligence across accounts and product lines to provide our customers with a view of information that can help them customize their products and programs.  We continue to develop opportunities to further enhance our IPS offerings and global presence.

◦Internet Payment Gateways.  We provide e-commerce processing solutions through internet payment gateways, which are interfaces between merchants and acquirers that help move a transaction through the payments network.  Our gateways include DataCash® and MasterCard Internet Gateway Service (MiGS), which offer payment service provider solutions across the globe.  These gateways offer a single interface to provide e-commerce merchants with the ability to process secure payments and offer value-added solutions, including outsourced electronic payments, fraud prevention and alternative payment options.

◦Strategic Investments.  We have invested strategically in various regions around the globe to pursue opportunities in issuer, prepaid, acquirer and third-party processing.  These investments support and/or provide, among other









things, prepaid processing, acquirer processing, third-party processing services and software (as well as switching solutions) and complete processing solutions for mobile payments.

Acceptance

As of December 31, 2012, cards carrying the MasterCard logo were accepted at 35.9 million acceptance locations worldwide, including 2.1 million ATMs and 0.6 million other locations where cash may be obtained.  Information on ATM and manual cash access locations is reported by our customers and is partly based on publicly available reports of payments industry associations, government agencies and independent market analysts.  Cards bearing the Maestro or Cirrus logos are accepted at many of these same locations.

We seek to maintain unsurpassed acceptance of MasterCard-branded programs by :

•Increasing the categories of merchants that accept products carrying our brands- In addition to expanding acceptance in e-commerce and mobile commerce environments, we leverage the functionality of the MasterCard Worldwide Network to expand acceptance in quick service businesses (such as fast food restaurants) and transportation (such as commuter train systems, buses and taxis) using our contactless technology, as well as public sector payments (such as those involving taxes, fees, fines and tolls), among other categories.

•Increasing the number of payment channels in which MasterCard programs are accepted- We continue to introduce MasterCard acceptance in connection with bill payment. We are working with customers to encourage consumers to make bill payments in a variety of categories including rent, utilities and insurance with their MasterCard products.

•Increasing the number of small merchants and merchants in established accepting categories who have not historically accepted MasterCard products- We enable parties like Square, iZettle, Intuit and others to provide acceptance to smaller merchants through connected devices (such as card readers), displacing cash.  Our Payment Facilitator Program was specifically designed to enable such parties.

•Increasing usage of our programs at selected merchants- We sponsor a wide range of promotional programs on a global basis.  We also enter into arrangements with selected merchants under which these merchants receive performance incentives for the increased use of MasterCard programs or indicating a preference for MasterCard-branded programs when accepting payments from consumers.

MasterCard Programs and Solutions

Our principal payment programs and solutions, which are facilitated through our brands, include consumer credit and charge, debit, prepaid and commercial programs and solutions and emerging payments solutions (including digital and mobile money platforms).  Our issuer customers determine the competitive features for the cards and other products issued under our programs, including interest rates and fees.  We determine other aspects of our programs, such as required services and the marketing strategy, in order to help ensure consistency.

Consumer Credit and Charge.We offer a number of consumer credit and charge programs that are designed to meet the needs of our customers.  For the year ended December 31, 2012, our consumer credit and charge programs generated $1.8 trillion in GDV globally, representing 50% of our total GDV for this period.  As of December 31, 2012, the MasterCard logo appeared on 686 million consumer credit and charge cards worldwide, representing a 5% increase from December 31, 2011.

We offer customized programs around the world to address specific consumer segments.  Our consumer credit programs include:

•Standard- general purpose products targeted to entry level consumers with basic credit card needs.  Standard products provide payment solutions featuring revolving credit, security and everyday convenience.

•Premium- products designed for emerging affluent consumers and featuring higher credit lines and spending limits and a varying level of enhanced services, including insurance coverage and access benefits.

•Affluent- product offerings which feature our highest purchasing capacity, as well as a comprehensive range of premium access benefits and top-tier services, and travel, concierge and cardholder protection insurances in some regions.  These products are specifically designed to target the needs of the most affluent segments worldwide.









Debit.We support a range of payment solutions that allow our customers to provide consumers with convenient access to funds in deposit accounts and other accounts. Our debit and deposit access programs may have the MasterCard, Maestro and/or Cirrus logos, and can be used to obtain cash in bank branches or at ATMs.  In addition, MasterCard and Maestro-branded debit products may be used to make purchases and, in some cases, to obtain cash back at the point of sale.

•MasterCard-branded Debit Card.MasterCard-branded debit programs provide functionality for both signature-based and PIN-based authenticated transactions.  For the year ended December 31, 2012, our MasterCard-branded debit programs generated $1.5 trillion in GDV globally, representing 42% of our total GDV for this period.  As of December 31, 2012, the MasterCard logo appeared on 436 million debit cards worldwide, representing 21% growth from December 31, 2011.

•Maestro-branded Debit Card.Maestro is our global PIN-based debit program, and is the only PIN-based solution that operates globally.  As of December 31, 2012, the Maestro logo appeared on 743 million cards worldwide, representing 4% growth from December 31, 2011.  Maestro has a leading position among PIN-based debit brands in many markets throughout the world, particularly in Europe.  The strong presence of Maestro in Europe positions us well as the SEPA initiative creates a more open and competitive payments market in many European countries that had been previously mandated to process domestic debit transactions with domestic processors.  The global acceptance of Maestro contributes to the growth of our debit business and adds value to the services that we provide to our customers.

•MasterCard Global ATM Solutions.Cirrus is our primary global cash access brand.  MasterCard Global ATM Solutions provides domestic (in-country) and cross-border access for varied types of transactions, including cash withdrawal (deposit accounts), cash advance (credit accounts), cash drawdown (prepaid accounts), balance inquiries, account transfers and deposits at ATMs that participate in the MasterCard Worldwide Network.

Prepaid.Prepaid programs involve a balance that is funded with monetary value prior to use. Cardholders access funds via a traditional magnetic stripe or chip-enabled payment card or other device (such as mobile) that may leverage our contactless functionality.  MasterCard customers may implement prepaid payment programs using any of our brands.  We provide processing services (including transaction switching) in support of either magnetic stripe or chip-enabled prepaid programs.  We provide and customize programs to meet unique commercial and consumer needs in all prepaid segments, including programs such as general purpose reloadable, employee benefit, payroll, travel, incentive, government disbursement programs and gift cards.  In particular, we focus on three categories:

•government, which includes programs targeted to achieve cost savings and efficiencies by moving traditional paper disbursement methods to electronic solutions in government programs such as Social Security payments, unemployment benefits and others;

•commercial, which includes programs targeted to achieve cost savings and efficiencies by moving traditional paper disbursement methods to electronic solutions in business applications such as payroll, health savings accounts and others; and

•consumer reloadable, which includes programs to address the payment needs of individuals without formal banking relationships, individuals who are not traditional users of credit or debit cards or devices or individuals who want to segment funds for security or convenience purposes, such as travel.

We also provide prepaid card program management services through Access Prepaid Worldwide (“Access”).  Through Access, we manage and deliver consumer and commercial prepaid travel cards to business partners around the world, including financial institutions, retailers, travel agents and foreign exchange bureaus.  Combined with MasterCard's processing assets (such as IPS) and other strategic alliances, these services augment and support issuers of prepaid cards around the world, with a focus outside of the United States.  Access enables us to offer end-to-end prepaid solutions encompassing branded switching, issuer processing and program management services, primarily focused on the travel sector.

Commercial.We offer commercial payment solutions that help large corporations, mid-sized companies, small businesses and government entities to streamline their procurement and payment processes, manage information and expenses and reduce administrative costs.  For the year ended December 31, 2012, our commercial credit and charge programs generated $287 billion in GDV globally, representing 8% of our total GDV for this period.  As of December 31, 2012, the MasterCard brand mark appeared on 36 million commercial credit and charge cards worldwide, representing an 8% increase from December 31, 2011.  We offer various commercial payment programs and value-added services, including corporate cards, corporate premium cards, corporate purchasing cards and fleet cards (as well as the MasterCard Corporate Multi Card®, which combines the functionality of one or more of these cards) that allow corporations to, among other things, manage travel and entertainment expenses, streamline the procurement process and provide corporations with additional transactional detail.  Among the platforms we provide is SmartData,









a MasterCard-powered tool which provides information reporting and expense management capabilities.  We also offer government entities a variety of payment programs that are similar to the procurement, travel, purchasing, fleet and Multi Card programs offered to corporations.  Credit and debit programs targeted at the small-business segment offer business owners the ability to gain access to working capital, to extend payments and to separate business expenses from personal expenses.

Emerging Payments and Innovation.We focus on innovation to enhance our current programs and extend our products and services to customers (including merchants, telecommunications companies and government entities) and into new geographies.  We have a global innovation group, MasterCard Labs, which is dedicated to developing new and innovative products and solutions for our customers and our cardholders.  This group incubates new product concepts, builds prototypes, runs pilots and is designed for a rapid evaluation process.

We offer innovative platforms, services and technologies aligned around the following strategic areas:

•Digital Infrastructure.The continued adoption of connected devices (such as mobile smartphones, PCs, and tablet devices) has resulted in the ongoing convergence of the physical and digital worlds, where consumers are increasingly transacting across a range of connected devices in a variety of contexts - in-store, online and on tablets and mobile devices.To support this convergence, we have developed a digital platform that is designed to allow customers, merchants and others to provide a consistent, fast and secure shopping experience for consumers, whether at a register, or on a PC, tablet or mobile device.  The platform is also focused on generating more value and increased sales for merchants (including building preference and loyalty), and delivering new revenue streams and competitive advantages for MasterCard and our customers.  We also work with strategic partners to enable consumers to securely use their smartphones to make contactless payments and obtain other related services.  We have worked with multiple customers globally to launch digital wallet solutions powered by our mobile contactless technology.  In addition, we are supporting the pilot launch of ISIS (a joint venture formed in the United States by AT&T, Verizon and T-Mobile).  Also, in December 2012, we made a minority investment in C-SAM, a global mobile wallet software provider.

•Mobile Money Infrastructure.We provide a platform and various services to customers and other parties to enable consumers to pay from any type of mobile phone (and in particular, feature phones).  These services include linking mobile accounts to virtual MasterCard account numbers, allowing subscribers (many of whom do not have traditional payment cards) to shop online, enabling person-to-person transfers (including our money transfer solution, MasterCard MoneySend®) on behalf of our customers for consumers using mobile devices, and enabling mobile subscribers to send payments to handsets of merchants who otherwise do not accept electronic payments.  Mobile Money services are provided through the MasterCard Mobile Payments Gateway, operated through our Mobile Payments Solutions joint venture with Smart Hub.  The gateway is a turnkey mobile payment processing platform that facilitates transaction routing and prepaid processing for mobile-initiated transactions for our customers.In addition, we continue to commercialize our two joint ventures with Telefonica to provide consumers with mobile payments services in multiple countries across Latin America.

•Chip and Contactless Solutions.  We continue to work with our customers around the world to help them replace their traditional magnetic-stripe based cards and terminals with new chip-enabled products that offer increased security and fraud protection as well as opportunities for new functions and value-added services.

◦EMV Chip Development and Solutions.Our chip solutions are developed in accordance with the EMV standard (the international standard for chip technology); we play a leading role in the evolution of the standard via our role as part owner of, and a key contributor to, EMVCo (the industry governing body of the EMV specifications).   As we broaden our chip technology deployments into new markets, we remain focused on maintaining global interoperability (a key feature of the MasterCard brand), reducing potential fraud and increasing security.   Customers in all regions are actively progressing chip programs with significant numbers of new cards and terminals being deployed.   In January 2012, we endorsed EMV as the payments platform technology for the U.S. market and are now engaged at all levels in the industry to bring the benefits of this technology to our U.S. customers and consumers.

◦Contactless Payment Solutions.We leverage the chip platform to drive new, scalable consumer experiences and business opportunities for our customers.  In particular, our chip technology facilitates both contactless and mobile payments, which both enable consumers and merchants to transact in new ways leveraging our chip-enabled acceptance and network infrastructure.   MasterCard PayPass®, our contactless payment solution, utilizes radio frequency, or near-field communication (NFC) technology, to securely transmit payment details wirelessly from payment devices to PayPass-branded contactless-enabled payment terminals for processing through the MasterCard Worldwide Network. This technology enables consumers simply to tap their payment card or other payment device, such as a key fob, wristband or tag that adheres









to the back of a mobile device, on a PayPass-enabled terminal to complete a transaction. Our mobile contactless payment solution, MasterCard Mobile PayPass, has been designed to enable consumers to use their mobile devices in a similar way by integrating the necessary hardware and software into the mobile device itself. Our PayPass program primarily targets everyday purchases that rely on speed and convenience (such as supermarkets, fast food restaurants, parking and transit). As of December 31, 2012, PayPass programs had rolled out in nearly 50 countries worldwide.

Value-Added Services and Solutions

We offer a variety of services and solutions across our business, designed to support and enhance our programs and solutions:

MasterCard Advisors.  MasterCard Advisors is our global professional services group which provides proprietary analysis, data-driven consulting and marketing services solutions to help clients optimize, streamline and grow their businesses.

Our suite of services for merchants include a targeted offers and rewards campaign management service for publishing offers, as well as opportunities for holders of a co-brand or merchants loyalty card or a member of a third-party-managed rewards program to obtain reward points faster.

Marketing

We manage and promote our brands through advertising, promotions, sponsorships and digital, mobile and social media initiatives.  These efforts support our strategic vision of an environment where electronic payment is the predominant form of payment.  Our marketing activities combine advertising, sponsorships, promotions, digital, mobile and social media, public relations and issuer and merchant engagement as part of an integrated program designed to increase consumer preference for our brands and usage of our products.  We also seek to tailor our global marketing messages by customizing them in individual countries.  Our initiatives are designed to build the value of the MasterCard brand and enhance stockholder value.

Our advertising plays an important role in building brand visibility, usage and overall preference among cardholders globally.  Our award-winning “Priceless®” advertising campaign has run in 53 languages in 112 countries worldwide.  The “Priceless” campaign promotes MasterCard usage benefits and acceptance that permit cardholders to pay for what they need, when they need it as well as marketing MasterCard credit, debit, prepaid and commercial products and solutions.  It also provides MasterCard









with a consistent, recognizable message that supports our brand around the globe.  We continue to refine our consumer marketing approach, including by placing greater strategic focus on consumers' spending preferences.  For example, Priceless Cities® is a global program intended to increase preference for the MasterCard brand by connecting consumers to their interests by offering them access to special experiences and offers when they are at home or traveling. MasterCard launched Priceless Cities in 2011 in three cities - New York, London and Toronto - and in 2012 the program was extended to include more than 20 cities across all of our regions.

We continue to support our brand by using digital, mobile and social channels to allow us to engage more directly with our stakeholders and allow consumers and customers to engage directly in programs, promotions and merchant offers, as well as provide relevant information on MasterCard products, services and tools.  MasterCard has also introduced both global and region-specific smart phone applications, including MasterCard's ATM Hunter®, MasterCard Easy Savings®, PayPass Locator, MCompass, and Budget Pilot that provide consumers with on-the-go utility. MasterCard continues to use digital and mobile channels and social media to develop preference and usage with consumers and more effectively partner with customers and merchants to help them drive their respective businesses.  For example, we have used Facebook to run our Priceless music programs which offer music benefits and music mobile applications to MasterCard cardholders in Australia and Mexico.

We also seek to deliver value to customers and consumers through the sponsorship of a variety of sporting, entertainment and charity-related marketing properties.  We have partnerships with Major League Baseball, the PGA Tour, the Union of European Football Association Champions League, the Walt Disney Company in Europe, The Grammy Awards and The Brit Awards.  In 2012, we continued and expanded our partnership with Stand Up to Cancer, which ties MasterCard cardholder use of MasterCard cards and other payment devices in restaurants and online to our donations to cancer research.  We also entered into a sponsorship partnership in 2012 with the Brazilian Football Confederation, Brazil's national football team.  Also in 2012, we entered into a sponsorship partnership with Sonoma State University in Northern California to sponsor its new performing arts center.  Our approach to sponsorship assets aligns with consumer segments important to us and our customers.

Customer and Stakeholder Relationship Management

We are committed to providing issuers and acquirers, merchants, governments, telecommunications companies and other parties that play a role in the payments industry with coordinated services that leverage our expertise in payment programs, product development, technology, processing, consulting and information services and marketing.  We manage our relationships with our customers and other parties (including processors and other third parties) on a global and regional basis, to ensure that their priorities are consistently identified and incorporated into our product, brand, processing, technology and related strategies, and to ensure we provide value to them.

Issuers and Acquirers.  In addition to the many ways described above that we provide value to issuers and acquirers, we enter into business agreements which provide customers with financial incentives and other support benefits to issue, accept, route, prioritize and promote our branded products and other payment programs.  These financial incentives may be based on GDV or other performance-based criteria, such as issuance of new payment products, increased acceptance of our products, launch of new programs or execution of marketing initiatives.  We believe that our business agreements with these customers have contributed to our volume and revenue growth in recent years.

Merchants.

Despite these opportunities, we also face challenges in our relationships with merchants.  We believe that consolidation in the retail industry is producing a set of larger merchants with increasingly global scope.  These merchants are having a significant impact on all participants in the global payments industry, including MasterCard.  In particular, large merchants have supported









many of the litigation, legislative and regulatory challenges related to interchange fees that MasterCard and others in the industry have been defending against.  This includes the U.S. merchant litigations as to which the Company recently entered into a settlement agreement (subject to final court approval).  See our risk factor in "Risk Factors - Legal and Regulatory Risks" in Part I, Item 1A of this Report related to merchants' continued focus on the costs of accepting electronic forms of payment.

Governments

MasterCard Revenue Sources

We generate revenues by charging fees to our customers for providing transaction processing and other payment-related services and assessing our customers based on GDV on the cards and other devices that carry our brands.  Accordingly, our revenues are impacted both by the number of transactions that we process and by the use of cards and other devices carrying our brands.  Our net revenues are classified into the following five categories:

•Domestic assessments:Domestic assessments are fees charged to issuers and acquirers based primarily on the volume of activity on cards and other devices that carry our brands where the merchant country and the issuer country are the same.

•Cross-border volume fees:Cross-border volume fees are charged to issuers and acquirers based on the volume of activity on cards and other devices that carry our brands where the merchant country and issuer country are different.

•Transaction processing fees:Transaction processing fees are charged for both domestic and cross-border transactions and are primarily based on the number of transactions.

•Other revenues:Other revenues for other payment-related services include fees associated with fraud products and services, cardholder service fees, consulting and research fees, program management service fees and a variety of other payment-related services.

•Rebates and incentives (contra-revenue):Rebates and incentives are provided to certain MasterCard customers and are recorded as contra-revenue in the same period that performance occurs.

Our pricing is complex and is dependent on the nature of the volumes, types of transactions and other products and services we offer to our customers.  The following factors impact the pricing:

•Domestic or cross-border

•Signature-based or PIN-based

•Tiered rates that fluctuate based on volume/transaction hurdles

•Geographic region or country

•Retail purchase or cash withdrawal

•Processed or not processed on the MasterCard Worldwide Network

In general, a cross-border transaction generates higher revenue than a domestic transaction since cross-border fees are higher than domestic fees, and in most cases also include fees for currency conversion.  We review our pricing and implement pricing changes on an ongoing basis.  In addition, standard pricing varies among our regions, and such standard pricing can be modified









for our customers through customer-specific incentive and rebate agreements.  Revenues from processing cross-border transactions fluctuate with cross-border activities.  See our risk factor in "Risk Factors - Business Risks" in Part I, Item 1A of this Report related to cross-border travel.

In 2012, net revenues from our five largest customers accounted for approximately$1.8 billion, or24%of our total revenue.  No single customer generated greater than 10% of total revenue.

See “Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Revenues” in Part II, Item 7 for more detail.

GDV and Processed Transactions

The tables below provide information regarding two key drivers of our revenue:  (1) GDV, which forms the basis of volume-based revenues, and (2) processed transactions.

GDV.The GDV table below provides information regarding the GDV for all MasterCard-branded cards (excluding Cirrus and Maestro) and for both MasterCard credit and charge programs and MasterCard debit and prepaid programs in all of our  regions for the years endedDecember 31, 2012and2011.  Growth rates are provided on both a U.S. dollar and local currency basis for the periods indicated.  GDV represents the aggregate dollar amount of purchases made and cash disbursements obtained with MasterCard-branded cards and includes the impact of balance transfers and convenience checks.

Participation Standards

We establish and enforce our standards surrounding participation in MasterCard and the use and acceptance of cards carrying our brands.

Rulemaking and Application of Standards

Participation in the MasterCard payments network is generally open to financial institutions and other entities that are our customers.  Applicants for participation must meet specified requirements.  In general, we grant licenses by territory to applicants that meet those specified criteria.  Licenses provide customers with certain rights, including access to the network and usage of our brands. Anti-money laundering due diligence reviews and customer risk management reviews are conducted on all new customers prior to issuing a license and existing customers are evaluated applying a risk-based approach.  All customers must meet the requirements of our anti-money laundering program, and we can suspend and ultimately terminate participation for non-compliance with the program.  As a condition of our licenses, customers agree to comply with our standards, which include requirements in our certificate of incorporation, bylaws, policies, rules and operating regulations and procedures.  MasterCard and certain of our affiliates are the governing bodies that establish and apply our standards, which relate to topics such as participation eligibility and financial soundness criteria; the standards, design and features of cards and card programs; the use of our trademarks; merchant acquiring activities (including acceptance standards applicable to merchants); and guaranteed settlement and customer failures.

Customer Risk Management

We guarantee the settlement of many of the transactions between our issuers and acquirers to ensure the integrity of our network ("settlement exposure").  We do not, however, guarantee payments to merchants by their acquirer, or the availability of unspent prepaid cardholder balances held by the issuer.  As a guarantor of certain obligations of principal customers, we are exposed to customer credit risk arising from the potential financial failure of any principal customers of MasterCard, Maestro and Cirrus, and affiliate debit licensees.  Our gross settlement exposure for MasterCard, Maestro and Cirrus-branded transactions, which is primarily estimated using the average daily card volume during the quarter multiplied by the estimated number of days to settle, was approximately$38 billionas ofDecember 31, 2012.  Principal customers participate directly in MasterCard programs and are responsible for the settlement and other activities of their sponsored affiliate customers.

To minimize the contingent risk to MasterCard of a failure of a customer to meet its settlement obligations, we monitor the financial health of, economic and political operating environments of, and compliance with our standards by, our principal customers, affiliate debit licensees and other entities to which we grant licenses.  If the financial condition of a customer or the state of the economy or political environment in which it operates indicates that it may not be able to satisfy its obligations to us or to our customers, or its payment obligations to MasterCard merchants, or its obligations to safeguard funds for prepaid cardholders, we may require the customer to make operational changes and/or post collateral.  This collateral is typically in the form of a standby letter of credit, a bank guarantee or a secured cash account and is required to mitigate our exposure.  As of

December 31, 2012

, we had customers who had posted approximately

$3.8 billion

in collateral held for settlement exposure.  If a customer becomes unable or unwilling to meet its obligations to us or other customers, we are able to draw upon such customer's collateral, if provided, in order to minimize any potential loss to ourselves or our customers. In addition to obtaining collateral from customers, in situations where a customer is potentially unable to meet its obligations to us or other customers, we can suspend and ultimately terminate participation in our network.  Additionally, and to further preserve payment system integrity, we reserve the right to terminate a customer's right to participate in our network if, for example, the customer fails or refuses to make payments in the ordinary course of business, or if a liquidating agent, conservator or receiver is appointed for the customer or the customer is insolvent.  In addition to these measures, we have also established a

$3 billion

committed credit facility to provide liquidity for general corporate purposes, including to provide liquidity in the event of customer settlement failure.  See our risk









factor in "Risk Factors - Business Risks" in Part I, Item 1A of this Report related to our role as guarantor of certain third-party obligations.  See also our risk factor related to the impact of unprecedented global economic events in financial markets around the world.

Payment System Integrity

The integrity of our payment system can be affected by fraudulent activity and illegal uses of our products and our system.  Fraud is most often committed in connection with lost, stolen or counterfeit cards or stolen account information, often resulting from security breaches of third-party systems that insufficiently protect cardholder data that they store, process or transmit.  See our risk factor in "Risk Factors - Business Risks" in Part I, Item 1A of this Report related to account data breaches.  Fraud is also more likely to occur in transactions where the card is not present, such as e-commerce, mobile commerce, mail order and telephone order transactions. Security and cardholder authentication for these remote channels are particularly critical issues facing our customers and merchants who engage in these forms of commerce, where a signed cardholder sales receipt, verification through use of a PIN or the presence of the card or payment device (along with the embedded security features) or merchant agent is unavailable.

We monitor areas of risk exposure and enforce our standards to combat fraudulent activity.  We also operate several compliance programs to help ensure that the integrity of our payment system is maintained by our customers and their agents.  Key compliance programs include merchant audits (for high fraud, excessive chargebacks and processing of illegal transactions) and security compliance (including our MasterCard Site Data Protection Service®, which assists customers, merchants and third-party service providers in protecting commercial sites from hacker intrusions and subsequent account data compromises) by requiring proper adherence to the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards (PCI DSS) and other PCI standards designed to secure payment application and terminals.  Our customers are also required to report instances of fraud to us in a timely manner so we can monitor trends and initiate action where appropriate.

Our customers generally are responsible for fraud losses associated with the products they issue and the merchants from which they acquire transactions.  However, we have implemented a series of programs and systems to aid them in detecting and preventing the fraudulent use of MasterCard products.  We provide education programs and various risk management tools to help prevent fraud and ensure safety, including:

•MasterCard SecureCode®, a global internet authentication solution that permits cardholders to authenticate themselves to their issuer using a unique, personal code;

•Our Site Data Protection program to advance adherence to the PCI DSS and other PCI standards;

•Our Global Vendor Certification Program (GVCP) to ensure card manufacturers comply with MasterCard-defined physical and logistical security requirements;

•Our Compliance Assessment and Security Testing (CAST) Program to ensure integrated circuit card and secure elements used in smart cards and mobile payment devices are evaluated against known and state of the art attack scenarios; and

•Fraud detection and prevention solutions, including our suite of fraud management products and services, Expert Monitoring Solutions, and DataCash fraud prevention tools for e-commerce merchants.

Enterprise Risk Management

We face a number of risks in operating our business (for a description of material risks, see “Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A of this Report).  Managing risk is an integral component of our business activities and the degree to which we manage risk is vital to our financial condition and profitability.  We have an Enterprise Risk Management (“ERM”) program which is integrated with the business and designed to ensure appropriate and comprehensive oversight and management of end-to-end risk.  The ERM program leverages our business processes to, among other things, ensure: allocation of resources to appropriately address risk; establishment of clear accountability for risk management; and provision of transparency of risks to senior management (including our Risk Management Committee), the Board of Directors and appropriate Board committees.  Our ERM program seeks to accomplish these goals by:  identifying, prioritizing and monitoring key risks; providing an independent view of our risks; and strengthening business operations by integrating ERM principles and continuing to create a risk aware culture within MasterCard.  Our integrated risk management structure balances risk and return by having business units and central functions (such as finance and law) identify, own and manage risks, our executive officers set policy and accountability and our Board of Directors and its committees provide oversight of the process.









Intellectual Property

We own a number of valuable trademarks that are essential to our business, including MasterCard®, Maestro® and Cirrus®, through one or more affiliates.  We also own numerous other trademarks covering various brands, programs and services offered by MasterCard to support our payment programs.  Trademark and service mark registrations are generally valid indefinitely as long as they are used and/or properly maintained.  Through license agreements with our customers, we authorize the use of our trademarks in connection with our customers' card issuing and merchant acquiring businesses.  In addition, we own a number of patents and patent applications relating to payments solutions, transaction processing, smart cards, contactless, mobile, electronic commerce, security systems and other matters, some of which may be important to our business operations.  Patents are of varying duration depending on the jurisdiction and filing date, and will typically expire at the end of their natural term.

Competition

General.Our programs compete against all forms of payment, including paper-based transactions (principally cash and checks); card-based and other electronic payments systems and solutions, including credit, charge, debit, prepaid, private-label and other types of general purpose and limited use programs; contactless, mobile and web-based payment platforms; and other electronic transactions such as wire transfers and Automated Clearing House payments.  As a result of a global trend, electronic forms of payment such as payment cards are increasingly displacing paper forms of payment, and card brands such as MasterCard, Visa, American Express and Discover are benefiting from this displacement.  However, cash and checks still capture the largest overall percentage of worldwide payment volume.

Cash and Check.

•Cash and check continue to represent the most widely used forms of payment.  Approximately 85% of all payment transactions are represented by paper-based transactions with cash or check.

Payment Card, Processing and Alternative Competitors.

•General Purpose Payment Card Industry.Within the general purpose payment card industry, we face substantial and increasingly intense competition worldwide from systems such as Visa (including Plus®, Electron® and Interlink®), American Express and Discover, among others. Within the global general purpose payment card industry, Visa has significantly greater volume than we do.  Outside of the United States, some of our competitors such as JCB in Japan and UnionPay in China have leading positions in their domestic markets.  Regulation can also play a role in determining competitive market advantages for competitors.  For example, UnionPay is the sole domestic processor designated by the Chinese government and operates the sole national cross-bank bankcard information switch network in China as a result of local regulation (although the World Trade Organization's ruling that China's domestic processing industry is a monopoly could open the domestic payments marketplace).  Some governments, such as India and Russia, are promoting local networks for domestic processing and there are similar developments in other countries.  See our risk factor in "Risk Factors - Legal and Regulatory Risks" in Part I, Item 1A related to government actions that may prevent us from competing effectively against providers of domestic payments services in certain countries.

•Particular Segments.We face competition with respect to particular segments of the payments industry, including:

◦Debit.We encounter substantial and increasingly intense competition from ATM and point-of-sale debit networks in various countries, such as Interlink, Plus and Visa Electron (owned by Visa Inc.), Star® (owned by First Data Corporation), NYCE® (owned by FIS), and Pulse® (owned by Discover), in the United States; Interac in Canada; EFTPOS in Australia; and Bankserv in South Africa.  In addition, in many countries outside of the United States, local debit brands serve as the main brands while our brands are used mostly to enable cross-border transactions, which typically represent a small portion of overall transaction volume.

◦PIN-Based Debit Transactions.Our business and revenues could be adversely impacted in the United States by a tendency among U.S. merchants to migrate from signature-based debit transactions to PIN-based debit transactions because we generally earn less revenue from PIN-based debit transactions.  In addition, Visa's competitive response to the limitations presented in the United States by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (the "Dodd-Frank Act") could potentially reduce our PIN debit volumes.

◦Private-Label.Private-label cards, which can generally be used to make purchases solely at the sponsoring retail store, gasoline retailer or other types of merchants, also serve as another form of competition.

•End-to-End Payments Networks.Our competitors include operators of proprietary end-to-end payments networks, such as American Express and Discover, that have direct acquiring relationships with merchants and direct issuing relationships









with cardholders.  These competitors have certain competitive advantages over four-party payments systems such as ours.  Among other things, because these competitors provide an end-to-end service, they do not require formal interchange fees to balance payment system costs between the issuing and acquiring sides of their business, even though they have the ability to internally transfer costs in a manner similar to interchange fees.  As a result, to date, operators of end-to-end payments networks have generally avoided the same regulatory and legislative scrutiny and litigation challenges we face.



•

Competition for Customer Business

.  We compete intensely with other payments networks for customer business.  Globally, financial institutions typically issue both MasterCard and Visa-branded payment cards, and we compete with Visa for business on the basis of individual card portfolios or programs.  In addition, a number of our customers issue American Express and/or Discover-branded payment cards in a manner consistent with a four-party system.



We also compete for new business partners with whom we seek to work, such as merchants, government agencies and telecommunication companies.  See our risk factor in "Risk Factors - Business Risks" in Part I, Item 1A of this Report related to the  substantial and increasingly intense competition worldwide in the global payments industry.  Our ability to compete in the global payments industry for customer business can be affected by the outcome of litigation, regulatory proceedings and legislative activity.  For example, in October 2011, the Federal Reserve implemented regulations, pursuant to the enactment into law of the Dodd-Frank Act, prohibiting arrangements under which a debit card or prepaid card can be processed only by one network (or only by a group of affiliated networks).  The Dodd-Frank Act also prohibits any restrictions on a merchant's ability to route a transaction over any one of the networks that is enabled on a debit card or prepaid card.



These events have resulted in challenges, as well as potential opportunities to compete for business in this area.

•Transaction Processors.  We face competition from transaction processors throughout the world, such as First Data Corporation and Total System Services, Inc., some of which are seeking to enhance their networks that link issuers directly with point-of-sale devices for payment transaction authorization and processing services.  Certain of these transaction processors could potentially displace us as the provider of these payment processing services.



•

New Entrants and Alternative Payments Systems

Financial Institution Customers.

•Pricing.We face increasingly intense competitive pressure on the prices we charge our customers.  We seek to enter into business agreements with customers through which we offer incentives and other support to issue and promote our cards.  In order to stay competitive, we may have to increase the amount of rebates and incentives we provide to our customers and merchants, as we have in the last several years.  See our risk factor in "Risk Factors - Business Risks" in Part I, Item 1A related to the increasingly intense competitive pressure we face on the prices we charge our customers.

•Banking Industry Consolidation.The banking industry has undergone substantial accelerated consolidation over the last several years, and we expect some consolidation to continue in the future.  Consolidations have included customers with a substantial MasterCard portfolio being acquired by institutions with a strong relationship with a competitor.  Significant ongoing consolidation in the banking industry may result in a substantial loss of business for us.  The continued consolidation in the banking industry, whether as a result of an acquisition of a substantial MasterCard portfolio by an institution with a strong relationship with a competitor or the combination of two institutions with which we have a strong relationship, would also produce a smaller number of large customers, which generally have a greater ability to negotiate pricing discounts with us. Consolidations could prompt our customers to renegotiate our business agreements to obtain more favorable terms.  This pressure on the prices we charge our customers could materially and adversely affect our revenue and profitability.  See our risk factor in "Risk Factors - Business Risks" in Part I, Item 1A of this Report related to additional consolidation or other changes in or affecting the banking industry.









Competitive Position.We believe that the principal factors influencing our competitive position in the global payments industry are:

•the ability to develop and implement competitive new electronic payment programs, systems and technologies in both physical and digital environments;

•the ability to participate in new payment forms;

•customer relationships;

•the impact of existing and future litigation, legislation and government regulation;

•the impact of globalization and consolidation of financial institutions and merchants;

•the acceptance base, reputation and brand recognition of payment cards;

•pricing;

•the success and scope of marketing and promotional campaigns;

•the quality, security and integrity of transaction processing;

•the relative value of services and products offered; and

•the impact of new market entrants.

Government Regulation

General.Government regulation impacts key aspects of our business.  We are subject to regulations that affect the payments industry in the many countries in which our cards are used.  Regulation of the payments industry has increased significantly in the last several years, including in the United States.  Regulators in several countries outside of the United States have also become increasingly interested in payment issues, a number of which have launched official proceedings related to payments industry issues.  See “Risk Factors-Legal and Regulatory Risks” in Part I, Item 1A of this Report.

Interchange Fees.Interchange fees associated with four-party payments systems like ours are being reviewed or challenged in various jurisdictions around the world.  Examples include:

•legislation, including resulting regulations (such as regulations implemented in October 2011 by the Federal Reserve in accordance with the Dodd-Frank Act, which set limits on debit and prepaid “interchange transaction fees”);

•competition-related regulatory proceedings (such as the European Commission's December 2007 decision restricting our cross-border interchange fees, which is pending appeal, as well as proceedings in several jurisdictions, including Canada and European Union member states);

•central bank regulation (such as in Australia); and

•litigation (such as the merchant litigations in the United States and private lawsuits in Canada and the United Kingdom).

For more detail, see our risk factors in "Risk Factors - Legal and Regulatory Risks" in Part I, Item 1A  of this Report related to interchange fees and related practices receiving significant and increasingly intense legal, regulatory and legislative scrutiny worldwide, and the Dodd-Frank Act.  Also see Note 18 (Legal and Regulatory Proceedings) to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8.

No-Surcharge Rules.We have historically implemented policies in certain regions that prohibit merchants from charging higher prices to consumers who pay using MasterCard products instead of other means.  Several jurisdictions have indicated interest in either ending or limiting the application of these no-surcharge rules.  In particular, the Reserve Bank of Australia (the “RBA”) had enacted regulations prohibiting the networks from enforcing no-surcharge rules.  In December 2011, the RBA indicated that it would consider allowing certain limitations to a merchant's ability to surcharge.  Our no-surcharge rules in Canada have also been challenged by the Canadian Competition Bureau.  In addition to other action being taken in this area, pursuant to the terms of settlement of the U.S. merchant class litigation we entered into in October 2012 (and subject to final court approval), in January 2013 we modified our no-surcharge rules to permit U.S. merchants to surcharge credit cards, subject to certain limitations.









Data Protection and Information Security.Aspects of our operations or business are subject to privacy and data protection regulation in the United States, the European Union and elsewhere.  For example, in the United States, we and our customers are respectively subject to Federal Trade Commission and federal banking agency information safeguarding requirements under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act.  The Federal Trade Commission's information safeguarding rules require us to develop, implement and maintain a written, comprehensive information security program containing safeguards that are appropriate for our size and complexity, the nature and scope of our activities, and the sensitivity of any customer information at issue.  Certain of our customers in the United States are subject to similar requirements under the guidelines issued by the federal banking agencies.  As part of their compliance with the requirements, each of our U.S. customers is expected to have a program in place for responding to unauthorized access to, or use of, customer information that could result in substantial harm or inconvenience to customers.

Anti-Money Laundering and Anti-Terrorism.MasterCard and other participants in the payments industry are also subject to the regulatory requirements of Section 352 of the USA PATRIOT Act, which  requires us to maintain a comprehensive anti-money laundering (“AML”) program and imposes similar requirements on our financial institution customers in the United States.  We are subject to the AML laws and regulations of India and the activities of our internet payments gateway and prepaid card program management services are also subject to U.S. and other countries' AML laws and regulations.  We have an AML compliance program to address these legal and regulatory requirements and assist in managing money laundering and terrorist financing risks.  The program is comprised of policies, procedures and internal controls, including the designation of a compliance officer and providing for the training of appropriate personnel regarding AML responsibilities.

We are subject to regulations imposed by the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control (“OFAC”) restricting financial transactions and other dealings with Cuba, Iran, Syria and Sudan and with persons and entities included in OFAC's list of Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons (the “SDN List”).  Cuba, Iran, Syria and Sudan have been identified by the U.S. State Department as terrorist-sponsoring states.  We have no offices, subsidiaries or affiliated entities located in these countries and do not license financial institutions domiciled in these countries.  We have established a risk-based compliance program that includes policies, procedures and controls that are designed to protect us against having business dealings with prohibited countries, individuals or entities.  We take measures to prevent transactions that do not comply with OFAC sanctions, including obligating our customers to screen cardholders and merchants against the SDN List; however, it is possible that such transactions may be processed through our payments system and that our reputation may suffer due to our customer financial institutions' association with these countries or the existence of any such transactions.

Financial Industry Regulation.  We are or may be subject to regulations related to our role in the financial industry and our relationship with our financial institution customers.  Certain of our operations are periodically reviewed by the U.S. Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (“FFIEC”) under its authority to examine financial institutions' technology service providers.  Examinations by the FFIEC cover areas such as data integrity and data security.

Additionally, in July 2010, as part of the Dodd-Frank Act, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (the “CFPB”) was created.  The CFPB has significant authority to regulate consumer financial products, including consumer credit, deposit, payment, and similar products.  It is not entirely clear whether and/or to what extent the CFPB will regulate broader aspects of payment card network operations.  In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act created the Financial Stability Oversight Council (“FSOC”) in order to identify risks to the financial stability of the United States that could arise from the material financial distress or failure of, or ongoing activities by, large, interconnected bank holding companies or nonbank financial companies.  Among other responsibilities, the FSOC is tasked with identifying payment, clearing and settlement systems that are “systemically important” under the applicable statutory standard.  Under the Dodd-Frank Act, such systems will be subject to new regulation, supervision and examination requirements.  To date, MasterCard has not been designated “systemically important.”  However, the imposition of any additional regulatory or other obligations on MasterCard could result in costly new compliance burdens that could negatively impact our business.  See our risk factor in "Risk Factors - Legal and Regulatory Risks" in Part I, Item 1A related to the Dodd-Frank Act.









Retail Payments System Regulation.  Regulators in several countries such as Australia, Mexico, Colombia, India, Singapore, Russia, Ukraine and Indonesia have received statutory authority to regulate certain aspects of the payments systems in these countries.  Such authority includes, or could include, providing broad regulatory oversight over retail payments system operators to the central banks in such countries, and could result in regulation of various aspects of the payments system.  For example, India has created a national domestic debit switch and has created a licensing regime with oversight over all payments system operators in India.  In Belgium, MasterCard Europe is subject to oversight as a retail payments system operator in Europe by the National Bank of Belgium pursuant to standards published by the European Central Bank that are principally targeted at managing financial, legal and operations risk. Additionally, in the European Union, the European Commission announced its intention to propose legislation in the second quarter of 2013 that addresses several elements of the payments industry.

National Payments Systems.  Governments in some countries may act to provide resources or preferential treatment or other protection to selected domestic payment card and processing providers or may create a domestic payment provider.  This action could develop due to a country's broad oversight of retail payments systems, such as in Russia, Ukraine and India.  It could also develop as a result of legislative activity.  This action could displace us from, or prevent us from entering into, or substantially restrict us from participating in, particular geographies.  See our risk factor in "Risk Factors - Legal and Regulatory Risks" in Part I, Item 1A related to government actions that may prevent us from competing effectively against providers of domestic payments or processing services in certain countries.

Issuer Practice Regulation.Our customers are subject to numerous regulations and legislation applicable to banks and other financial institutions in the United States and elsewhere in their capacity as issuers and otherwise, and as a consequence MasterCard is impacted by such regulations.  For example, in the United States in 2009, the Federal Reserve adopted regulations addressing overdraft fees imposed in connection with ATM and debit card transactions.  Additionally, the CFPB launched an investigation into bank overdraft practices in 2012, and it remains to be seen whether the CFPB investigation will result in further regulation in this area.  Any new regulation in this area may further restrict the ability of our customers to charge overdraft fees in connection with debit programs, which may diminish the attractiveness of debit card programs to our customers and adversely affect transaction volumes and revenues.  Additionally, regulation of issuer practices around the world include regulation of the issuance of prepaid cards.  In Germany, additional consumer information is required in connection with prepaid transactions, which could restrict the issuance of prepaid cards.  In India, prepaid cards not associated with a bank cannot be issued.  Any similar regulation restricting issuance of prepaid cards and devices could directly impact our business and our volumes.

Regulation of Internet Transactions.  In October 2006, the U.S. Congress enacted legislation requiring the coding and blocking of payments for certain types of Internet gambling transactions.  The legislation applies to payments system participants, including MasterCard and our U.S. customers, and is implemented through a federal regulation.  The federal law requires us and our customers to implement compliance programs.  Also, Congress may consider additional legislation to legalize and regulate Internet gambling that could increase our costs and/or could decrease our transaction volumes.  In addition, the U.S. Congress continues its consideration of regulatory initiatives in the areas of Internet prescription drug purchases, copyright and trademark infringement, and privacy, among others, that could impose additional compliance burdens on us and/or our customers.  Some U.S. states are considering a variety of similar legislation.  If implemented, these initiatives could require us or our customers to monitor, filter, restrict, or otherwise oversee various categories of payment card transactions, thereby increasing our costs or decreasing our transaction volumes.

Additional Regulatory Developments.Various regulatory agencies also continue to examine a wide variety of issues, including identity theft, account management guidelines, privacy, disclosure rules, security and marketing that would impact our customers directly.  New requirements and developments may affect our customers' ability to extend credit through the use of payment cards, which could decrease our transaction volumes.

Additional Information

MasterCard Incorporated was incorporated as a Delaware stock corporation in May 2001.  We conduct our business principally through MasterCard Incorporated's principal operating subsidiary, MasterCard International Incorporated (“MasterCard International”), a Delaware non-stock (or membership) corporation that was formed in November 1966.  In May 2006, we completed a plan for a new ownership and governance structure for MasterCard Incorporated (including an initial public offering of a new class of common stock (the “IPO”)) which included the appointment of a new Board of Directors which is comprised almost entirely of directors who are independent from our customers.  For more information about our capital structure, including our Class A common stock (our voting stock) and Class B common stock (our non-voting stock), see Note 13 (Stockholders' Equity) to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8.
