Item 1.Business



Overview



MasterCard is a global payments and technology company that connects billions of consumers, thousands of financial institutions, millions of merchants, governments and businesses worldwide, enabling them to use electronic forms of payment instead of cash and checks.  We envision an environment where electronic payment is the predominant means of payment. We use our technology and expertise to make payments more convenient, secure and efficient to enable consumers to meet their needs and to provide value to all stakeholders in the payments system.



We offer a wide range of payment solutions that enable our customers and partners to develop and implement credit, debit, prepaid and related payment programs and solutions to deliver value to consumers.  Our customers and partners include financial institutions and other entities that act as “issuers” and “acquirers”, merchants, government entities, telecommunications companies and other businesses.  We manage a family of well-known, widely-accepted payment brands, including MasterCard®, Maestro® and Cirrus®, which we license to our customers for use in their payment programs and solutions.  We process payment transactions over the MasterCard Worldwide Network and provide support services to our customers and other partners.  As part of managing our brands, we establish and enforce a common set of standards for adherence by our customers for the efficient and secure use of our payments network.



MasterCard generates revenue by charging fees to our customers for providing transaction processing and other payment-related services and by assessing our customers based primarily on the dollar volume of activity, or gross dollar volume (“GDV”), on the cards and other devices that carry our brands.



A typical transaction processed over our network involves four parties in addition to us:  the cardholder, the merchant, the issuer (the cardholder's financial institution) and the acquirer (the merchant's financial institution).  Consequently, the payment network we operate supports what is often referred to as a “four-party” payment system.  Using our transaction processing services, issuers and acquirers who are our customers facilitate payment transactions between cardholders and merchants throughout the world, providing merchants with an efficient and secure means of receiving payment, and consumers and businesses with a convenient, quick and secure payment method that is accepted worldwide.  We guarantee the settlement of many of these transactions among our customers to ensure the integrity of our payment network. In addition, we undertake a variety of marketing activities designed to maintain and enhance the value of our brands. We partner with merchants on initiatives to help provide value to them and benefits to consumers.  However, cardholder and merchant transaction relationships are managed principally by our customers.  We do not issue cards, extend credit to cardholders, determine the interest rates (if applicable) or other fees charged to cardholders by issuers, or establish the “merchant discount” charged by acquirers in connection with the acceptance of cards that carry our brands.



Our business has a global reach and has continued to experience growth.  In 2011, we processed27.3 billiontransactions, a18.3%increase over the number of transactions processed in 2010.  GDV on cards carrying the MasterCard brand as reported by our customers was approximately$3.2 trillionin 2011, a16.1%increase in local currency terms and a19.3%increase in U.S. dollar terms over the GDV reported in 2010.



We analyze our ability to grow based on three drivers:

•we track trends in personal consumption expenditures;

•we focus on the trend within the global payments industry from paper-based forms of payment, such as cash and checks, toward electronic forms of payment (such as payment card transactions); and

•we seek to grow our share in electronic payments, including with innovative solutions and new technology.



We support our focus on these drivers by continuing to:



•grow our core businesses globally, including credit, debit, prepaid, commercial and processing payment transactions over the MasterCard Worldwide Network,



•diversify our business by seeking new areas of growth in markets around the world, expanding points of acceptance for our brands throughout the world, seeking to maintain unsurpassed acceptance, and working with new partners such as merchants, government agencies and telecommunications companies, and











•build new businesses through technology and continued strategic efforts and alliances with respect to innovative payment methods such as electronic commerce (e-Commerce) and mobile capabilities.



We operate in a dynamic and rapidly evolving legal and regulatory environment.  In recent years, we have faced heightened regulatory scrutiny and other legal challenges, including legislation, particularly with respect to interchange fees.  Interchange fees, which represent a balancing of payment system costs among acquirers and issuers (and in turn, among merchants and cardholders), have been the subject of regulatory review and challenges and legislative action, as well as litigation, as electronic forms of payment have become relatively more important to local economies.  Although we establish certain interchange rates and collect and remit interchange fees on behalf of our customers, we do not earn revenues from interchange fees.  See “Risk Factors-Legal and Regulatory Risks” in Part I, Item 1A.



The Global Payments Industry



We operate in the global payments industry, which consists of all forms of payment including:



•Paper-based payments - cash, personal checks, money orders, official checks, travelers cheques and other paper-based means of transferring value;



•Card-based payments - credit cards, charge cards, debit and deferred debit cards (including cash access or Automated Teller Machine (“ATM”) cards), prepaid cards and other types of cards;



•Contactless, mobile and web-based payments - contactless payments, electronic payments through mobile phones and other handheld devices using a variety of applications, and e-Commerce transactions on the Internet and through web browsers; and



•Other Electronic Payments - wire transfers, electronic benefits transfers, bill payments and automated clearing house payments, among others.



The most common card-based forms of payment are general purpose cards, which are payment cards carrying logos that permit widespread usage of the cards within countries, regions or around the world.  General purpose cards have different attributes depending on the type of accounts to which they are linked:



•credit or charge cards typically access a credit account that either requires payment of the full balance within a specified period (a charge card) or that permits the cardholder to carry a balance in a revolving credit account (a credit card);



•debit cards typically access a deposit account or other account with accessible funds maintained by the cardholder; and



•prepaid cards typically access previously-funded monetary value.



The primary general purpose card brands include MasterCard, Visa®, American Express®, JCB®, Diners Club®, UnionPay® and Discover®.  These brands, including MasterCard, have come to be associated with a variety of forms of payment in the United States and other markets around the world, including (depending on the brand) credit, charge, debit and prepaid cards.  Regional and domestic/local debit brands that require a personal identification number (“PIN”) for verification are the primary brands in many countries.  In these markets, issuers have historically relied on the Maestro and Cirrus brands (and other brands) to enable cross-border transactions, which typically constitute a small portion of the overall number of transactions.



In addition to general purpose cards, private label cards comprise a portion of all card-based forms of payment. Typically, private label cards are credit cards issued by, or on behalf of, a merchant (such as a department store or gasoline retailer) and can be used only at that merchant's locations.



Payment Services and Solutions



We provide transaction processing and other payment-related services as well as a wide range of payment solutions to enable our customers to design, package and implement products and programs targeted to the specific needs of their customers.  We work with customers to provide customized solutions, as well as more general solutions.  Our payment solutions are built upon our expertise in payment programs, product development, payment processing technology, payment security, consulting and information services and marketing.We also manage and promote our brands for the benefit of all customers through brand advertising, promotional and interactive programs and sponsorship initiatives.











Transaction Processing on the MasterCard Worldwide Network



Introduction.We operate the MasterCard Worldwide Network, our proprietary, global payments network that links issuers and acquirers around the globe to facilitate the processing of transactions and, through them, permits MasterCard cardholders to use their cards and other payment devices at millions of merchants worldwide.  We process transactions through our network for financial institutions and other entities that are our customers, in more than 150 currencies in more than 210 countries and territories.



Typical Transaction.  A typical transaction processed over the MasterCard Worldwide Network involves four participants in addition to us: cardholder, merchant, issuer (the cardholder's financial institution) and acquirer (the merchant's financial institution).  The following diagram depicts a typical point-of-interaction card transaction:







In a typical transaction, a cardholder (A) purchases goods or services from a merchant (B) using a card or other payment device.  After the transaction is authorized by the issuer (D) using our network, the issuer pays the acquirer (C) an amount equal to the value of the transaction, minus the interchange fee (described below), and posts the transaction to the cardholder's account.  The acquirer pays the amount of the purchase, net of a discount (referred to as the “merchant discount”), to the merchant.  The merchant discount, among other things, takes into consideration the amount of the interchange fee.  We generally guarantee the payment of transactions using MasterCard-branded products and certain transactions using Cirrus and Maestro-branded products between issuers and acquirers.



Interchange Fees.



Merchant Discount.The merchant discount is established by the acquirer to cover its costs of participating in the four-party system and generally to provide for a profit margin with respect to services rendered to the merchant.  The discount takes into









consideration the amount of the interchange fee which the acquirer generally pays to the issuer, and the balance of the discount consists of fees established by the acquirer and paid by the merchant for certain of the acquirer's services to the merchant.



Additional Fees and Economic Considerations.Among the parties in a four-party system, various types of fees may be charged to different constituents for various services.  For example, acquirers may charge merchants processing and related fees in addition to the merchant discount.  Issuers may also charge cardholders fees for the transaction, including, for example, fees for extending revolving credit.  As described below, we charge issuers and acquirers transaction-based and related fees for the transaction processing and related services we provide them.



In a four-party payment system, the economics of a payment transaction relative to MasterCard vary widely depending on such factors as whether the transaction is domestic (and, if it is domestic, the country in which it takes place) or cross-border, whether it is a point-of-sale purchase transaction or cash withdrawal, and whether the transaction is processed over our network or a third-party network or is handled solely by a financial institution that is both the acquirer for the merchant and the issuer to the cardholder (an “on-us” transaction).



Authentication.  Generally, transactions processed over our network can be authenticated at the point of interaction and across the processing value chain.  A typical transaction processed over our network can be authenticated in several ways (depending on the type of card or device being used):



•“signature” transactions that typically require a cardholder to sign a sales receipt as the primary means of validation at the point of interaction (other than circumstances, such as with respect to low value purchases, where a signature is not necessary),



•“PIN-based” transactions that require the cardholder to use a PIN for verification which can be validated by the issuer at their processing site and



•transactions using chip-enabled cards and point of interaction devices which allow for automatic authentication between the card and device (as well as, depending on the card or device, signature or PIN authentication).



In addition, some payment cards and devices are equipped with an RFID (radio frequency identification) microchip, which provides an advanced authentication technique, and technology which allows contactless payments requiring neither signature nor PIN under established maximum transaction amounts.



MasterCard Worldwide Network Architecture and Operations.  We believe the architecture of the MasterCard Worldwide Network is unique, featuring a globally integrated structure that provides scalability for our customers and enables them to expand into regional and global markets.  Our network also features an intelligent architecture that enables it to adapt to the needs of each transaction by blending two distinct processing structures-distributed (peer-to-peer) and centralized (hub-and-spoke).  Transactions that require fast, reliable processing, such as those submitted using a MasterCard PayPass®-enabled device in a tollway, use the network's distributed processing structure, ensuring they are processed close to where the transaction occurred.  Transactions that require value-added processing, such as real-time access to transaction data for fraud scoring or rewards at the point-of-sale, or customization of transaction data for unique consumer-spending controls, use the network's centralized processing structure, ensuring advanced processing services are applied to the transaction.  Through the unique architecture of our network, we are able to connect all parties with respect to payments transactions regardless of whether the transaction is occurring at a traditional physical location, at an ATM, on the internet or through a mobile device, enabling electronic commerce.



The network typically operates at under 80% capacity and has the capacity to handle more than 160 million transactions per hour with an average network response time of 130 milliseconds.  The network can also substantially scale capacity to meet demand.  Our transaction processing services are available 24 hours per day, every day of the year.  Our global payment network provides multiple levels of back-up protection and related continuity procedures should the issuer, acquirer or payment network experience a service interruption.  Moreover, the network features multiple layers of protection against hacking or other cybersecurity attacks.  We supplement this protection with mitigation efforts to strengthen our protection against such threats, both in terms of operability of the network and protection of the information transmitted through the network.  To date, we have consistently maintained availability of our global processing systems more than 99.9% of the time.



Processing Capabilities.



•Transaction Switching - Authorization, Clearing and Settlement.MasterCard provides transaction switching (authorization, clearing and settlement) through the MasterCard Worldwide Network.











◦Authorization.  Authorization refers to the process by which a transaction is routed to the issuer for approval and then a decision whether or not to approve the transaction is made by the issuer or, in certain circumstances such as when the issuer's systems are unavailable or cannot be contacted, by MasterCard or others on behalf of the issuer in accordance with either the issuer's instructions or applicable rules (also known as "stand-in").  Our standards, which may vary across regions, establish the circumstances under which merchants and acquirers must seek authorization of transactions.



◦Clearing. Clearing refers to the exchange of financial transaction information between issuers and acquirers after a transaction has been successfully conducted at the point of interaction.  MasterCard clears transactions among customers through our central and regional processing systems.  MasterCard clearing solutions can be managed with minimal system development, which has enabled us to accelerate our customers' ability to develop customized programs and services.



◦Settlement.  Once transactions have been authorized and cleared, MasterCard helps to settle the transactions by facilitating the exchange of funds between parties.  Once clearing is completed, a daily reconciliation is provided to each customer involved in settlement, detailing the net amounts by clearing cycle and a final settlement position.  The actual exchange of funds takes place between a settlement bank, designated by the customer and approved by MasterCard, and a settlement bank chosen by MasterCard.  Customer settlement occurs in U.S. dollars or in a limited number of other currencies in accordance with our established rules.





•

Cross-Border and Domestic Processing.



•Extended Processing Capabilities.In addition to transaction switching, MasterCard continually evaluates and invests in ways to strategically extend our processing capabilities in the payment value chain by seeking to provide our customers with an expanded suite of payment processing solutions that meet the unique processing needs of their markets.  Examples include:



◦MasterCard Integrated Processing Solutions® (IPS).MasterCard Integrated Processing Solutions (“IPS”) is a debit and prepaid issuer processing platform designed to provide medium to large global issuing customers with a complete processing solution to help create differentiated products and services and allow quick deployment of payments portfolios across banking channels.  Through a single processing platform, IPS can, among other things, authorize debit and prepaid transactions, assist issuers in managing risk using fraud detection tools, manage an issuer's card base, and manage and monitor an issuer's ATMs.  The proprietary MasterCard Total Portfolio View™ provides a user-friendly customer interface to IPS, delivering aggregate cardholder intelligence across accounts and product lines to provide our customers with a view of information that can help them customize their products and programs.  We continue to develop opportunities to further enhance our IPS offerings and global presence.



◦Internet Payment Gateways.  MasterCard provides e-Commerce processing solutions through internet payment gateways, which are interfaces between the merchant and its acquirer as a transaction moves to a payments network.  Our gateways include our MasterCard Internet Gateway Service (MiGS), which provides gateway









infrastructure in Asia Pacific, and DataCash®, a payment service provider with operations in Europe and Brazil.  DataCash offers a single interface that provides e-Commerce merchants with the ability to process secure payments across the world, and develops and provides outsourced electronic payments solutions, fraud prevention, alternative payment options, and other solutions.



◦Strategic Alliances.  We have invested in strategic alliances to pursue opportunities in prepaid and acquirer and third-party processing both through joint ventures and minority investments.  These alliances include: (1) Prepay Solutions, a joint venture with Edenred (previously named Accor Services) which supports prepaid processing in Europe, (2) Strategic Payment Services, which provides acquirer processing in Asia Pacific, (3) ElectraCard Services, which provides third-party processing services and software, as well as switching solutions, in Asia Pacific, the Middle East and Africa, (4) Trevica, which provides third-party issuer processing services in Poland and other central and eastern European markets and (5) Mobile Payment Solutions (“MPS”), which provides complete processing solutions for mobile payments around the globe.



MasterCard Programs and Solutions



Our principal payment programs and solutions, which are facilitated through our brands, include consumer credit and charge, debit and prepaid programs, commercial payment solutions and emerging payments solutions.  Our issuer customers determine the competitive features for the cards and other products issued under our programs, including interest rates and fees.  We determine other aspects of our programs-such as required services and the marketing strategy-in order to help ensure consistency in connection with these programs.



Consumer Credit and Charge.MasterCard offers a number of consumer credit and charge programs that are designed to meet the needs of our customers.  For the year ended December 31, 2011, our consumer credit and charge programs generated approximately $1.8 trillion in GDV globally, representing 56% of our total GDV for this period.  As of December 31, 2011, the MasterCard brand mark appeared on approximately 672 million consumer credit and charge cards worldwide, representing a 3.7% increase from December 31, 2010.



•United States. We offer customized programs to customers in the United States to address specific consumer segments.  Our consumer credit programs include Standard (general purpose cards targeted to consumers with basic credit card needs), Gold and Platinum (cards featuring higher credit lines and spending limits and a varying level of enhanced services) and World and World Elite MasterCard® (cards offered to affluent consumers which feature a wider range of enhanced services).



•Regions Outside of the United States.MasterCard makes available to customers outside of the United States a variety of consumer card programs in selected markets throughout the world.  Examples of such programs include MasterCard Electronic™ cards (which offer additional control and risk management features designed to curb fraud and control exposure in high risk markets) and cards targeted to affluent consumers (such as Platinum MasterCard® and MasterCard Black™ cards in Latin America, World and World Elite MasterCard® cards in Europe and Canada and Platinum and World MasterCard® cards in Asia Pacific, Middle East and Africa (“APMEA”)).



•General Services.All MasterCard credit cards include services, such as lost/stolen card reporting, emergency card replacement and emergency cash advance, which are generally arranged by MasterCard and are provided through third-party service providers.



Debit.MasterCard supports a range of payment solutions that allow our customers to provide consumers with convenient access to funds in deposit accounts and other accounts. Our debit and deposit access programs may be branded with the MasterCard, Maestro and/or Cirrus logos, and can be used to obtain cash in bank branches or at ATMs.  In addition, MasterCard and Maestro-branded debit products may be used to make purchases or obtain cash back at the point of sale.  Debit programs we offer include Maestro and Gold Maestro, as well as Standard, Gold, Platinum, Premium and World Debit MasterCard® programs.



•MasterCard-branded Debit Card.MasterCard-branded debit programs issue cards which include functionality for signature authenticated transactions, as well as PIN-based functionality.  For the year ended December 31, 2011, our MasterCard-branded debit programs generated approximately $1.2 trillion in GDV globally, representing 36% of our total GDV for this period.  As of December 31, 2011, the MasterCard brand mark appeared on approximately 354 million debit cards worldwide, representing 20.1% growth from December 31, 2010.  MasterCard-branded debit card programs are offered in the United States, and are also offered as a complement to existing Maestro-branded debit programs.











•Maestro-branded Debit Card.Maestro is our global PIN-based debit program, and is the only PIN-based solution that operates globally.  Some Maestro cards also feature signature functionality. As of December 31, 2011, the Maestro brand mark appeared on approximately 752 million cards worldwide, representing 14.8% growth from December 31, 2010.  As of December 31, 2011, Maestro was accepted for purchases at more than 14.1 million merchant locations globally.  Our Maestro brand has a leading position among PIN-based debit brands in many markets throughout the world, particularly in Europe.  The strong presence of Maestro in Europe positions us well as the SEPA initiative creates a more open and competitive payment market in many European countries that had been previously mandated to process domestic debit transactions with domestic processors.  The global acceptance of Maestro contributes to the growth of our debit business and adds value to the services that we provide to our customers.



•MasterCard Global ATM Solutions.Cirrus is our primary global cash access brand.  Any debit, credit or ATM-accessible prepaid card bearing the MasterCard, Maestro or Cirrus logos could have had access to cash and account information at approximately 1.9 million participating ATMs around the world as of December 31, 2011.  MasterCard Global ATM Solutions provides domestic (in-country) and cross-border access to cards allowing for varied types of transactions, including cash withdrawal (deposit accounts), cash advance (credit accounts), cash drawdown (prepaid accounts), balance inquiries, account transfers and deposits at ATMs that participate in the MasterCard Worldwide Network.



Prepaid.Prepaid programs involve a balance that is funded with monetary value prior to use. Holders access funds via a traditional magnetic stripe or chip-enabled payment card which may leverage the PayPass functionality or other payment devices, such as mobile devices.  MasterCard customers may implement prepaid payment programs using any of our brands.  MasterCard provides processing services (including transaction switching) in support of either magnetic stripe or chip-enabled prepaid card programs.  MasterCard provides and customizes programs to meet unique commercial and consumer needs in all prepaid segments, including programs such as general purpose reloadable, gift, employee benefit, payroll, travel, incentive and government disbursement programs.  In particular, we focus on three categories:



•government, which includes programs targeted to achieve cost savings and efficiencies by moving traditional paper disbursement methods to electronic solutions in government programs such as Social Security payments, unemployment benefits and others;



•corporate, which includes programs targeted to achieve cost savings and efficiencies by moving traditional paper disbursement methods to electronic solutions in business applications such as payroll, health savings accounts and others; and



•consumer reloadable, which includes programs to address the payment needs of  individuals without formal banking relationships, individuals who are not traditional users of credit or debit cards or individuals who want to segment funds for security or convenience purposes, such as travel.



MasterCard also provides prepaid card program management services through Access Prepaid Worldwide (“Access”).  Access was formed as a result of MasterCard acquiring the prepaid card program management operations of Travelex Holding Ltd. in April 2011.  Through Access, MasterCard manages and delivers consumer and corporate prepaid travel cards to business partners around the world, including financial institutions, retailers, travel agents and foreign exchange bureaus.  Combined with MasterCard's existing processing assets (such as IPS) and other strategic alliances, these services augment and support partners and issuers of prepaid cards around the world, with a focus outside of the United States.  Access enables MasterCard to offer end-to-end prepaid solutions encompassing branded switching, issuer processing and program management services, primarily focused on the travel sector.



Commercial Payment Solutions.MasterCard offers commercial payment solutions that help large corporations, mid-sized companies, small businesses and government entities to streamline their procurement and payment processes, manage information and expenses and reduce administrative costs.  In the year ended December 31, 2011, our commercial credit and charge programs generated approximately $251 billion in GDV globally, representing approximately 8% of our total GDV for this period.  As of December 31, 2011, the MasterCard brand mark appeared on approximately 33 million commercial credit and charge cards worldwide, representing a 10.8% increase from December 31, 2010.  We offer various corporate payment programs and value-added services, including corporate cards, corporate premium cards, corporate purchasing cards and fleet cards (as well as the MasterCard Corporate Multi Card®, which combines the functionality of one or more of these cards) that allow corporations to manage travel and entertainment expenses and provide corporations with additional transactional detail.  Among the platforms MasterCard provides is SmartData, a MasterCard-powered tool which provides information reporting and expense management capabilities.  We also offer government entities a variety of payment programs that are similar to the procurement, travel, purchasing, fleet and Multi Card programs offered to corporations.  The MasterCard BusinessCard®, the Debit MasterCard BusinessCard™,









the World MasterCard for Business®, the World Elite MasterCard for Business®, Small Business Controller and Professional Debit and Credit Cards are targeted at the small-business segment, offering business owners the ability to gain access to working capital, to extend payments and to separate business expenses from personal expenses.



Emerging Payments Solutions and Innovation.MasterCard focuses on innovation to enhance our current programs and extend our products and services to new customers (including merchants, telecommunications companies and government entities) and into new geographies.  Supporting this innovation isMasterCard Labs, a global innovation group dedicated to developing new and innovative products and solutions for MasterCard, our customers and our cardholders.  MasterCard Labs enables us to take a portfolio approach to research and development by incubating new product concepts, building prototypes and running pilots.  MasterCard Labs is designed for a rapid evaluation process, through which innovations either rapidly advance into MasterCard's new product development process or are quickly disregarded.



Our focus in emerging payments includes:



•e-Commerce.  e-Commerce involves the purchase and sale of goods over the Internet.  Our initiatives focus on:



◦the development of e-Commerce capability through internet payment gateways (including DataCash and MiGS) to support growth in the e-Commerce area,



◦the development of programs and services intended to drive GDV and transactions and to improve the consumer experience, including: (1) the development of OpenAPI, our application programming interface through which we can more easily integrate with our customers to deliver our products and solutions; and (2) expanding the use of MasterCard-branded cards for e-Commerce transactions, including by enabling Maestro cards for this purpose, and



◦the development of tools to help customers prevent fraud over the Internet.



We have entered into a strategic relationship with Intel Corporation to provide consumers and merchants enhanced security and convenience with e-Commerce shopping by enabling consumers using Intel's Ultrabook PC devices to make purchases using MasterCard PayPass-enabled devices (described below) at e-Commerce site checkouts which feature enhanced authentication.



•Contactless Payment Solutions.MasterCard PayPass, our “contactless” payment solution, utilizes radio frequency, or near-field communication (NFC) technology, to securely transmit payment details wirelessly through payment devices to PayPass-branded contactless-enabled payment terminals for processing through the MasterCard Worldwide Network.  This technology enables consumers simply to tap their payment card or other payment device, such as a  key fob, wristband or PayPass tag that adheres to the back of a mobile device on a PayPass-enabled terminal to complete a transaction.  Our mobile contactless payment solution, MasterCard Mobile PayPass, is used to enable consumers to use their mobile devices in a similar way through integrated payment solutions.  Our PayPass program primarily targets everyday purchases that rely on speed and convenience (such as supermarkets, fast food restaurants, parking, and transit).  As of December 31, 2011, PayPass programs have been rolled out in 37 countries worldwide.



•Mobile.  MasterCard works with customers and leading technology companies to develop products and solutions for mobile commerce payments.  These initiatives generally focus on:



◦Mobile Wallets and Mobile Alliances:MasterCard works with strategic partners to develop infrastructure and applications to enable smartphones with MasterCard Mobile PayPass, our mobile contactless payment solution, to provide integrated payment solutions, or “digital wallets”, which enable consumers to securely use their phones to make payments and obtain other related services.  Recently, MasterCard has partnered with Google, First Data and Citibank in the United States to launch a digital wallet featuring an integrated MasterCard prepaid card.  MasterCard has also partnered with our customers in Korea, the United Kingdom and Turkey to launch digital wallets enabled by MasterCard Mobile PayPass.  In addition, MasterCard has licensed Mobile PayPass to ISIS (a joint venture formed in the United States by AT&T, Verizon and T-Mobile) and to others to ensure that third-party digital wallets are embedded with MasterCard payment functionality.



◦Mobile Money Services:MasterCard provides various services to customers to enable consumers to pay from any type of mobile phone.  These services include linking mobile accounts to virtual MasterCard account numbers to allow subscribers (many of whom do not have traditional payment cards) to shop online, enabling person-to-person transfers (including MasterCard's money transfer solution, MasterCard MoneySend®) on









behalf of MasterCard's customers for their consumers using mobile devices, and enabling mobile subscribers to send payments to handsets of merchants who otherwise do not accept electronic payments.  Mobile money services are provided through mobile payments gateways, such as the MasterCard Mobile Payments Gateway, commercialized through our MPS joint venture with Smart Hub.  These gateways are turnkey mobile payment processing platforms that facilitate transaction routing and prepaid processing for mobile-initiated transactions for our customers.  Recently, MasterCard entered into two joint ventures with Telefonicato provide consumers with mobile payments services in Brazil and 12 Spanish-speaking countries in Latin America where Telefonica operates.  MasterCard also entered into a global agreement in 2011 with Western Union to enable consumers using its money transfer services to send or receive funds from or on to an eligible MasterCard card.



•Value-Added Services.  MasterCard develops services designed to support and enhance its products and solutions.  MasterCard inControl® is an innovative platform featuring an array of advanced authorization, transaction routing and alert controls and virtual card number capabilities that uses the functionality of the MasterCard Worldwide Network and is designed to assist financial institutions in creating new and enhanced payment offerings.  MasterCard offers several fraud detection and prevention solutions, including Expert Monitoring System®, a comprehensive suite of services designed to help its customers detect and prevent fraudulent activity.



•EMV and Chip Development.  MasterCard continues to pursue chip technology development in accordance with the EMV (the international standard for chip technology).  We continue to work with our customers to help them replace traditional payment cards relying solely on magnetic stripe technology with chip-enabled payment cards that offer additional point-of-interaction functionality and the ability to provide value-added services to the cardholder.  We are focused on broad migration towards chip-enabled technology as an opportunity to ensure the global interoperability of MasterCard brands, reduce potential fraud and improve consumers' experience in using electronic payments by providing greater security and control in their payment choices.  We intend to continue to take steps to help realize these opportunities in the United States and around the world and maintain our competitive position.  These steps include solidifying EMV technology as the foundation of future payment products and services and working with acquirers to develop the necessary infrastructure for a migration to EMV.  We are also involved in a number of organizations that facilitate the development and use of EMV and chip-enabled cards globally.  This includes participation with others in the industry in a “smart card” standards organization that maintains standards and specifications designed to ensure interoperability and acceptance of chip-based payment applications on a worldwide basis.



Acceptance Initiatives



Overview.We estimate that, as of December 31, 2011, cards carrying the MasterCard brand were accepted at 33.3 million acceptance locations worldwide, including 1.9 million ATMs and 0.6 million other locations where cash may be obtained.  Information on ATM and manual cash access locations is reported by our customers and is partly based on publicly-available reports of payment industry associations, government agencies and independent market analysts.  Cards bearing the Maestro or Cirrus brand marks are accepted at many of these same locations.



Initiatives.We seek to maintain unsurpassed acceptance of MasterCard-branded programs by focusing on three core initiatives:



•We seek to increase the categories of merchants that accept products carrying our brands. In addition to our focus on expanding acceptance in e-Commerce and mobile commerce environments, we are also focused on using the functionality of the MasterCard Worldwide Network to expand acceptance in quick service businesses (such as fast food restaurants), transportation (such as commuter train systems, buses and taxis), and public sector payments (such as those involving taxes, fees, fines and tolls), among other categories.



•We seek to increase the number of payment channels in which MasterCard programs are accepted, such as by introducing MasterCard acceptance in connection with bill payment applications.  We are working with customers to encourage consumers to make bill payments in a variety of categories including rent, utilities and insurance with their MasterCard-branded products.



•We seek to increase usage of our programs at selected merchants by sponsoring a wide range of promotional programs on a global basis.  We also enter into arrangements with selected merchants under which these merchants receive performance incentives for the increased use of MasterCard-branded programs or indicating a preference for MasterCard-branded programs when accepting payments from consumers.



Additional Services.In addition, we provide research, marketing support and financial assistance to our customers and their marketing partners in connection with the launch and marketing of co-branded and affinity card programs.  Co-branded cards are









payment cards bearing the logos or other insignia of an issuer and a marketing partner, such as an airline, mobile operator or retail merchant.  Affinity cards are similar to co-branded cards except that the issuer's marketing partner is typically a charitable, educational or other non-profit organization.



Merchants.Merchants are an important constituency in the MasterCard payment system and we are working to further develop our relationships with them.  We believe that consolidation in the retail industry is producing a set of larger merchants with increasingly global scope.  These merchants are having a significant impact on all participants in the global payments industry, including MasterCard.  We believe that the growing role of merchants in the payments system represents both an opportunity and a challenge for MasterCard.  In particular, large merchants are supporting many of the litigation, legislative and regulatory challenges related to interchange fees that MasterCard is now defending against, since interchange fees can represent a significant component of the costs that merchants pay to accept payment cards.  See “Risk Factors-Legal and Regulatory Risks” and “Risk Factors-Business Risks-Merchants continue to be focused on the costs of accepting card-based forms of payment, which may lead to additional litigation and regulatory proceedings and may increase the costs of our incentive programs, which could materially and adversely affect our profitability” in Part I, Item 1A.



Many opportunities exist to enhance our relationships with merchants and provide them value, while continuing to expand acceptance of our products.  In addition to partnering with merchants to increase opportunities for acceptance using PayPass, we also work with merchants to convert private label cards into co-branded cards.  We have also partnered with merchants to provide value to consumers, providing cardholders with enhanced benefits, experiences and offers.  Moreover, we work with merchants to provide employees the option of being paid on MasterCard payroll cards, and to enable merchants the ability to collect payments using MasterCard payment solutions.  We also offer a suite of information products, data analytics and marketing services which can help merchants understand specific activity in their industry, evaluate their sales performance against competitors and focus direct marketing efforts to target desirable prospects and hard to reach segments.



Customer and Partner Relationship Management



We are committed to providing financial institutions, merchants, government entities, telecommunications companies and our other business partners with coordinated services in a manner that allows us to take advantage of our expertise in payment programs, product development, technology, operations, processing, consulting and information services and marketing.  We manage our relationships with our customers and other partners on a global and regional basis to ensure that their priorities are consistently identified and incorporated into our product, brand, processing, technology and related strategies.



We enter into business agreements pursuant to which we offer customers financial incentives and other support benefits to issue and promote our branded cards and other payment programs.  Financial incentives may be based on GDV or other performance-based criteria, such as issuance of new cards, launch of new programs or execution of marketing initiatives.  We believe that our business agreements with customers have contributed to our volume and revenue growth in recent years.  In addition, we have standard licensing arrangements with all of our customers that permit them to use our trademarks and subject them to the standards governing our payment programs.



MasterCard Advisors



MasterCard Advisors is our global professional services group which provides proprietary analysis, data-driven consulting and marketing services solutions and is focused exclusively on the payments industry.  It differentiates us from our competitors by transforming data we collect into actionable insights for our customers and other clients.  We provide services based on this data through three business lines: Information Services, Consulting Services, and Managed Services.

Marketing



We manage and promote our brands through brand advertising, promotions, sponsorships and digital, mobile and social media initiatives.  Our brands support our strategic vision of advancing commerce globally.  Our marketing activities combine advertising, sponsorships, promotions, digital, mobile and social media, public relations and issuer and merchant  engagement as part of an integrated program designed to increase consumer preference for MasterCard brands and usage of MasterCard products.  We also seek to tailor our global marketing messages by customizing them in individual countries, while maintaining a common global theme.  Our initiatives are designed to build the value of the MasterCard brand and drive stockholder value.



Our advertising plays an important role in building brand visibility, usage and overall preference among cardholders globally.  Our award-winning “Priceless®” advertising campaign has run in 53 languages in 112 countries worldwide.  The “Priceless” campaign promotes MasterCard usage benefits and acceptance that permit cardholders to pay for what they need, when they need it as well as marketing MasterCard credit, debit, prepaid and commercial products and solutions.  It also provides MasterCard with a globally consistent, recognizable message that supports our brand positioning.  MasterCard continues to refine its consumer marketing approach, including by placing greater strategic focus on consumers spending preferences.  Priceless Cities™ is a global program intended to increase preference  for the MasterCard brand by offering cardholders special experiences and offers when they are at home or traveling. MasterCard launched Priceless Cities in 2011 in three initial cities - New York, London and Toronto.



We continue to support our brand by utilizing digital, mobile and social channels to allow us to engage more directly with our stakeholders and allow consumers and customers to engage directly in brand programs, promotions and merchant offers, as well as provide relevant information on MasterCard products, services and tools.  MasterCard has also introduced global and regional specific smart phone applications, including MasterCard's ATM Hunter®, MasterCard Easy Savings®,  PayPass® Locator,  MasterCard MoneySend®, MCompass, and Budget Pilot  that provide consumers with on-the-go utility. MasterCard continues to use digital and mobile channels and social media to develop preference and usage with consumers and more effectively partner with customers and merchants to help them drive their respective businesses.  For example, we have used Facebook to run our Debit Priceless Music Promotion which offers concert tickets and other music benefits to holders of MasterCard debit cards in Australia.



We also seek to deliver value to customers and consumers through the sponsorship of a variety of sporting, entertainment and charity-related marketing properties.  MasterCard has partnerships with Major League Baseball, the PGA Tour, the Union of European Football Association Champions League, The Grammy Awards, The Brit Awards and the Walt Disney Company in Europe.  In 2011 MasterCard entered into a new cause marketing partnership with Stand Up to Cancer to encourage MasterCard cardholders to made donations tied to usage of MasterCard cards.   We also sponsored the Copa America 2011 tournament in Argentina and Rugby World Cup in New Zealand in 2011.  Our approach to sponsorship assets aligns with consumer segments important to MasterCard and our customers.



MasterCard Revenue Sources



MasterCard generates revenues by charging fees to our customers for providing transaction processing and other payment-related services and assessing our customers based on GDV on the cards that carry our brands.  Accordingly, our revenues are impacted both by the number of transactions that we process and by the use of cards carrying our brands.  Our net revenues are classified into the following five categories:



•Domestic assessments:Domestic assessments are fees charged to issuers and acquirers based primarily on the volume of activity on cards that carry our brands where the acquirer country and the issuer country are the same.



•Cross-border volume fees:Cross-border volume fees are charged to issuers and acquirers based on the volume of activity on cards that carry our brands where the acquirer country and issuer country are different.



•Transaction processing fees:Transaction processing fees are charged for both domestic and cross-border transactions and are primarily based on the number of transactions.



•Other revenues:Other revenues for other payment-related services include fees associated with fraud products and services, cardholder service fees, consulting and research fees, compliance and penalty fees, account and transaction enhancement services, holograms and publications.



•Rebates and incentives (contra-revenue):Rebates and incentives are provided to certain MasterCard customers and are recorded as contra-revenue in the same period that performance occurs.











Our pricing is complex and is dependent on the nature of the volumes, types of transactions and other products and services we offer to our customers.  A combination of the following factors determines the pricing:



•Domestic or cross-border



•Signature-based or PIN-based



•Tiered pricing, with rates decreasing as customers meet incremental volume/transaction hurdles



•Geographic region or country



•Retail purchase or cash withdrawal



•Processed or not processed by MasterCard



In general, cross-border transactions generate higher revenue than domestic transactions since cross-border fees are higher than domestic fees, and in most cases also include fees for currency conversion.  We review our pricing and implement pricing changes on an ongoing basis.  In addition, standard pricing varies among our regional businesses, and such pricing can be modified for our customers through incentive and rebate agreements.  Revenues from processing cross-border transactions fluctuate with cross-border activities.  See “Risk Factors-Business Risks- A decline in cross-border travel could adversely affect our revenues and profitability, as a significant portion of our revenue is generated from cross-border transactions” in Part I, Item 1A.



In 2011, net revenues from our five largest customers accounted for approximately $1.7 billion, or 26% of our total revenue.  No single customer generated greater than 10% of total revenue.



See “Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Revenues” in Part II, Item 7 for more detail.











GDV and Processed Transactions



The tables below provide information regarding two key drivers of our revenue:  (1) GDV, which forms the basis of volume-based revenues, and (2) processed transactions.



GDV.The GDV table below provides information regarding the GDV for all MasterCard-branded cards (excluding Cirrus and Maestro) and for both MasterCard credit and charge programs and MasterCard debit and prepaid programs in the United States and in all of our other regions for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010.  Growth rates are provided on both a U.S. dollar and local currency basis for the periods indicated.  GDV represents the aggregate dollar amount of purchases made and cash disbursements obtained with MasterCard-branded cards and includes the impact of balance transfers and convenience checks.

Participation Standards



We establish and enforce our standards surrounding participation in MasterCard and the use and acceptance of cards carrying our brands.



Rulemaking and Application of Standards



Participation in the MasterCard payments network is generally open to financial institutions and other entities that are our customers.  Applicants for participation must meet specified requirements.  In general, MasterCard grants licenses by territory to applicants that meet those specified criteria.  Licenses provide customers with certain rights, including access to the network and usage of our brands. Anti-money laundering due diligence reviews and customer risk management reviews are conducted on all new customers prior to issuing a license and existing customers are evaluated applying a risk-based approach.  All customers must meet the requirements of MasterCard's anti-money laundering program, and MasterCard can suspend and ultimately terminate participation for non-compliance with the program.  As a condition of our licenses, customers agree to comply with our standards, which include requirements set forth within our certificate of incorporation, bylaws, policies, rules and operating regulations and procedures.  MasterCard and certain of its affiliates are the governing bodies that establish and apply our standards, which relate to topics such as participation eligibility and financial soundness criteria; the standards, design and features of cards and card programs; the use of MasterCard trademarks; merchant acquiring activities (including acceptance standards applicable to merchants); and guaranteed settlement and customer failures.



Customer Risk Management



As a guarantor of certain obligations of principal customers, we are exposed to customer credit risk arising from the potential financial failure of any principal customers of MasterCard, Maestro and Cirrus, and affiliate debit licensees.  Our gross settlement risk exposure for MasterCard, Maestro and Cirrus-branded transactions, which is primarily estimated using the average daily card volume during the quarter multiplied by the estimated number of days to settle, was approximately$39.1 billionas of December 31, 2011.  Principal customers participate directly in MasterCard programs and are responsible for the settlement and other activities of their sponsored affiliate customers.



To minimize the contingent risk to MasterCard of a failure, we monitor the financial health of, economic and political operating environments of, and compliance with our standards by, our principal customers, affiliate debit licensees and other entities to which we grant licenses.  If the financial condition of a customer or the state of the economy or political environment in which it operates indicates that it may not be able to satisfy its obligations to us or to other MasterCard customers, or its payment obligations to MasterCard merchants, we may require the customer to make operational changes and/or post collateral.  This collateral is typically in the form of a standby letter of credit, a bank guarantee or a secured cash account and is required to mitigate our exposure.  As of December 31, 2011, we had customers who had posted approximately

$3.5 billion





Payment System Integrity



The integrity of our payment system can be affected by fraudulent activity and illegal uses of our products and our system.  Fraud is most often committed in connection with lost, stolen or counterfeit cards or stolen account information, often resulting from security breaches of third-party systems that inappropriately transmit, process or store cardholder account data.  See “Risk Factors-Business Risks-Account data breaches involving card data stored, processed or transmitted by us or third parties could adversely affect our reputation and revenue” in Part I, Item 1A of this Report.  Fraud is also more likely to occur in transactions where the card is not present, such as e-Commerce, mobile commerce, mail order and telephone order transactions.  Security and









cardholder authentication for these remote channels are particularly critical issues facing our customers and merchants who engage in these forms of commerce, where a signed cardholder sales receipt or the presence of the card or merchant agent is unavailable.



We monitor areas of risk exposure and enforce our standards to combat fraudulent activity.  We also operate several compliance programs to help ensure that the integrity of our payment system is maintained by our customers and their agents.  Key compliance programs include merchant audits (for high fraud, excessive chargebacks and processing of illegal transactions) and security compliance (including our MasterCard Site Data Protection Service®, which assists customers and merchants in protecting commercial sites from hacker intrusions and subsequent account data compromises) by requiring proper adherence to the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards (PCI DSS).  Our customers are also required to report instances of fraud to us in a timely manner so we can monitor trends and initiate action where appropriate.



Our customers generally are responsible for fraud losses associated with the products they issue and the merchants from which they acquire transactions.  However, we have implemented a series of programs and systems to aid them in detecting and preventing the fraudulent use of MasterCard products.  We provide education programs and various risk management tools to help prevent fraud, including MasterCard SecureCode®, a global Internet authentication solution that permits cardholders to authenticate themselves to their issuer using a unique, personal code, and our Site Data Protection program to advance adherence to the PCI DSS.  We also provide fraud detection and prevention solutions, including our suite of fraud management products and services, Expert Monitoring System, and DataCash fraud prevention tools for e-Commerce merchants.



Enterprise Risk Management



MasterCard faces a number of risks in operating its business (for a description of material risks, see “Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A of this Report).  Managing risk is an integral component of our business activities and the degree to which we manage risk is vital to our financial condition and profitability.  We have an Enterprise Risk Management (“ERM”) program which is integrated with the business and designed to ensure appropriate and comprehensive oversight and management of end-to-end risk.  The ERM program leverages our business processes to, among other things, ensure: allocation of resources to appropriately address risk; establishment of clear accountability for risk management; and provision of transparency of risks to senior management, the Board of Directors and appropriate Board committees.  Our ERM program seeks to accomplish these goals by:  identifying, prioritizing and monitoring key risks; providing an independent view of our risk profile; and strengthening business operations by integrating ERM principles and continuing to create a risk aware culture within MasterCard.  MasterCard's integrated risk management structure balances risk and return by having business units and central functions (such as finance and law) identify, own and manage risks; our executive officers set policy and accountability and our Board of Directors and committees provide oversight of the process.



Intellectual Property



We own a number of valuable trademarks that are essential to our business, including MasterCard®, Maestro® and Cirrus®, through one or more affiliates.  We also own numerous other trademarks covering various brands, programs and services offered by MasterCard to support our payment programs.  Trademark and service mark registrations are generally valid indefinitely as long as they are used and/or properly maintained.  Through license agreements with our customers, we authorize the use of our trademarks in connection with our customers' card issuing and merchant acquiring businesses.  In addition, we own a number of patents and patent applications relating to payments solutions, transaction processing, smart cards, contactless, mobile, electronic commerce, security systems and other matters, some of which may be important to our business operations.  Patents are of varying duration depending on the jurisdiction and filing date, and will typically expire at the end of their natural term.



Competition



General.MasterCard programs compete against all forms of payment, including paper-based transactions (principally cash and checks); card-based payment systems, including credit, charge, debit, prepaid, private-label and other types of general purpose and limited use cards; contactless, mobile and web-based payments; and other electronic transactions such as wire transfers and Automated Clearing House payments.  As a result of a global trend, electronic forms of payment such as payment cards are increasingly displacing paper forms of payment, and card brands such as MasterCard, Visa, American Express and Discover are benefiting from this displacement.  However, cash and checks still capture the largest overall percentage of worldwide payment volume.



Payment Card, Processing and Alternative Competitors.



•General Purpose Payment Card Industry.Within the general purpose payment card industry, we face substantial and increasingly intense competition worldwide from systems such as Visa (including Plus® Electron and Interlink), American









Express and Discover, among others. Within the global general purpose card industry, Visa has significantly greater volume than we do.  Outside of the United States, some of our competitors such as JCB in Japan and UnionPay in China have leading positions in their domestic markets.  Regulation can also play a role in determining competitive market advantages for competitors.  For example, UnionPay is the sole domestic processor designated by the Chinese government and operates the sole national cross-bank bankcard information switch network in China as a result of local regulation.  Some governments, such as India and Russia, are promoting local networks for domestic processing and there are similar developments in other countries.  See “Risk Factors-Legal and Regulatory Risks-Government actions may prevent us from competing effectively against providers of domestic payments services in certain countries, which could adversely affect our ability to maintain or increase our revenues” in Part I, Item 1A of this Report.



•Particular Segments.We face competition with respect to particular segments of the payment card industry, including:



◦Debit.In the debit card sector, we also encounter substantial and increasingly intense competition from ATM and point-of-sale debit networks in various countries, such as Interlink™, Plus and Visa Electron (owned by Visa Inc.), Star® (owned by First Data Corporation), NYCE® (owned by FIS), and Pulse™ (owned by Discover), in the United States; Interac in Canada; EFTPOS in Australia; and Bankserv in South Africa.  In addition, in many countries outside of the United States, local debit brands serve as the main brands while our brands are used mostly to enable cross-border transactions, which typically represent a small portion of overall transaction volume.



◦PIN-Based Debit Transactions.In the United States, some of our competitors process a greater number of PIN-based debit transactions at the point of sale than we do.  In addition, our business and revenues could be impacted adversely by the tendency among U.S. merchants to migrate from signature-based debit transactions to PIN-based debit transactions because we generally earn less revenue from the latter types of transactions.  This tendency may be accelerated as a result of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the “Federal Reserve”) implementing regulations associated with the Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (as defined and described below under “Government Regulation”).  In addition, PIN-based debit transactions are more likely to be processed by other domestic ATM/debit point-of-sale networks rather than by us.  See “Risk Factors-Business Risks-If we are unable to grow our debit business, particularly in the United States, we may fail to maintain and increase our revenue growth” in Part I, Item 1A of this Report.



◦Private-Label.Private-label cards, which can generally be used to make purchases solely at the sponsoring retail store, gasoline retailer or other types of merchants, also serve as another form of competition.



•End-to-End Payment Networks.Our competitors include operators of proprietary end-to-end payment networks that have direct acquiring relationships with merchants and direct issuing relationships with cardholders, such as American Express and Discover.  These competitors have certain advantages that we do not enjoy.  Among other things, these competitors do not require formal interchange fees to balance payment system costs among issuers and acquirers, because they typically have direct relationships with both merchants and cardholders.  Interchange fees, which are a characteristic of four-party payments systems such as ours, are subject to increased regulatory and legislative scrutiny worldwide.  See “Risk Factors-Legal and Regulatory Risks-Interchange fees and related practices have been receiving significant and increasingly intense legal, regulatory and legislative scrutiny worldwide, and the resulting decisions, regulations and legislation may have a material adverse impact on our revenue, our prospects for future growth and our overall business, financial condition and results of operations” in Part I, Item 1A of this Report.  To date, operators of end-to-end payment networks have generally avoided the same regulatory and legislative scrutiny and litigation challenges we face because they do not utilize formal interchange fees.  Accordingly, these operators may enjoy a competitive advantage over four-party payments systems.



•Competition for Customer Business.  We compete intensely with other card networks for customer business.  Globally, financial institutions typically issue both MasterCard and Visa-branded payment cards, and we compete with Visa for business on the basis of individual card portfolios or programs.  Some of our customers also do business with American Express or Discover in the United States, and a number of our large customers now issue American Express and/or Discover-branded cards.We also compete for new business partners with whom we seek to work, such as merchants, government agencies and telecommunication companies.  See “Risk Factors-Business Risks-Our revenues, operating results, prospects for future growth and overall business may suffer because of substantial and increasingly intense competition worldwide in the global payments industry” in Part I, Item 1A of this Report.  Our ability to compete in the global payments industry for customer business can be affected by the outcome of litigation, regulatory proceedings and legislative activity.  For example, in October 2011, the Federal Reserve implemented regulations, pursuant to the enactment into law of the Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, prohibiting arrangements under which a debit card or









prepaid card can be processed only by one network (or only by a group of affiliated networks).  The Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act also prohibits any restrictions on a merchant's ability to route a transaction over any one of the networks that is enabled on a debit card or prepaid card.These events have resulted in challenges, as well as potential opportunities to compete for business in this area.



•Transaction Processors.  We face competition from transaction processors throughout the world, such as First Data Corporation and Total System Services, Inc., some of which are seeking to enhance their networks that link issuers directly with point-of-sale devices for payment card transaction authorization and processing services.  Certain of these transaction processors could potentially displace MasterCard as the provider of these payment processing services.



•New Entrants and Alternative Payment Systems.  We also compete against relatively new entrants and alternative payment providers, such as PayPal® (a business segment of eBay), which have developed payment systems in e-Commerce and across mobile devices.  While PayPal is an established and important player in Internet payments, this is an increasingly competitive area, as evidenced by the proliferation of new online competitors.  Among other services, these competitors provide Internet payment services that can be used to buy and sell goods online, and services that support payments to and from deposit accounts or proprietary accounts for Internet, mobile commerce and other applications.  A number of these new entrants rely principally on the Internet and potential wireless communication networks to support their services, and may enjoy lower costs than we do.  The payment card industry is also facing changes in services and technology related to mobile payments and emerging competition from mobile operators and handset manufacturers.   Micro-payments on social networks such as Facebook® are relatively small today but have the potential to grow rapidly, representing the potential for competition from a new payment form.



Financial Institution Customers.



•Pricing.We face increasingly intense competitive pressure on the prices we charge our customers.  We seek to enter into business agreements with customers through which we offer incentives and other support to issue and promote our cards.  In order to stay competitive, we may have to increase the amount of rebates and incentives we provide to our customers and merchants, as we have in the last several years.  See “Risk Factors-Business Risks-We face increasingly intense competitive pressure on the prices we charge our customers, which may materially and adversely affect our revenue and profitability” in Part I, Item 1A.





•

Banking Industry Consolidation.

The banking industry has undergone substantial accelerated consolidation over the last several years, and we expect some consolidation to continue in the future.  Consolidations have included customers with a substantial MasterCard portfolio being acquired by institutions with a strong relationship with a competitor.  Significant ongoing consolidation in the banking industry may result in a substantial loss of business for MasterCard.  The continued consolidation in the banking industry, whether as a result of an acquisition of a substantial MasterCard portfolio by an institution with a strong relationship with a competitor or the combination of two institutions with which MasterCard has a strong relationship, would also produce a smaller number of large customers, which generally have a greater ability to negotiate pricing discounts with MasterCard. Consolidations could prompt our customers to renegotiate our business agreements to obtain more favorable terms.  This pressure on the prices we charge our customers could materially and adversely affect our revenue and profitability.  See “Risk Factors- Business Risks-Additional consolidation or other changes in or affecting the banking industry could result in a loss of business for MasterCard and create pressure on the fees we charge our customers, resulting in lower prices and/or more favorable terms for our customers, which may materially and adversely affect our revenue and profitability” in Part I, Item 1A.



Competitive Position.We believe that the principal factors influencing our competitive position in the global payments industry are:



•the ability to develop and implement competitive new card programs, systems and technologies in both physical and virtual environments;



•the ability to participate in new payment forms;



•customer relationships;



•the impact of existing and future litigation, legislation and government regulation;



•the impact of globalization and consolidation of financial institutions and merchants;











•the acceptance base, reputation and brand recognition of payment cards;



•pricing;



•the success and scope of marketing and promotional campaigns;



•the quality, security and integrity of transaction processing;



•the relative value of services and products offered; and



•the impact of new market entrants.



Government Regulation



General.Government regulation impacts key aspects of our business.  We are subject to regulations that affect the payment industry in the many countries in which our cards are used.  Regulation of the payments industry has increased significantly in the last several years, including in the United States.  Regulators in several countries outside of the United States have also become increasingly interested in payment issues, a number of which have launched official proceedings related to payment industry issues.  See “Risk Factors-Legal and Regulatory Risks” in Part I, Item 1A of this Report.



Interchange Fees.Interchange fees associated with four-party payment systems like ours are being reviewed or challenged in various jurisdictions.  Such challenges include regulatory proceedings in the European Union (by the European Commission, as well as by individual European Union member states) and elsewhere.  Interchange fees have also become the subject of legislative action.  In particular, regulations implemented in October 2011 by the Federal Reserve in accordance with the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the “Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act”) set limits on debit and prepaid “interchange transaction fees”.  See “Risk Factors - Legal and Regulatory Risks - Interchange fees and related practices have been receiving significant and increasingly intense legal, regulatory and legislative scrutiny worldwide, and the resulting decisions, regulations and legislation may have a material adverse impact on our revenue, our prospects for future growth and our overall business, financial condition and results of operations” and “The Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act may have a material, adverse effect on our revenue, our prospects for future growth and our overall business, financial condition and results of operations” in Part I, Item 1A and in Note 20 (Legal and Regulatory Proceedings) to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Report.



No-Surcharge Rules.We have historically implemented policies in certain regions that prohibit merchants from charging higher prices to consumers who pay using MasterCard instead of other means.  Several jurisdictions have indicated interest in either ending or limiting the application of these no-surcharge rules.  In particular, the Reserve Bank of Australia (the "RBA") had enacted regulations prohibiting the networks from enforcing no-surcharge rules.  In December 2011, the RBA indicated that it would consider allowing certain limitations to a merchant's ability to surcharge.  Our no-surcharge rules in Canada have also been challenged by the Canadian Competition Bureau.



Data Protection and Information Security.Aspects of our operations or business are subject to privacy and data protection regulation in the United States, the European Union and elsewhere.  For example, in the United States, we and our customers are respectively subject to Federal Trade Commission and federal banking agency information safeguarding requirements under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act.  The Federal Trade Commission's information safeguarding rules require us to develop, implement and maintain a written, comprehensive information security program containing safeguards that are appropriate for our size and complexity, the nature and scope of our activities, and the sensitivity of any customer information at issue.  Our customers in the United States are subject to similar requirements under the guidelines issued by the federal banking agencies.  As part of their compliance with the requirements, each of our U.S. customers is expected to have a program in place for responding to unauthorized access to, or use of, customer information that could result in substantial harm or inconvenience to customers.



In the United States, during the past several years, a number of bills have been considered by Congress and there have been several congressional hearings to address consumer privacy, passive collection of information (such as use of “cookies” and other technology), information safeguarding and data breach issues.  Congress continues to consider these issues, which could result in legislation that may have an adverse impact on us and our customers.  A large number of U.S. states have enacted security breach legislation, requiring varying levels of consumer notification in the event of a security breach.  In Europe, the European Parliament and Council is in the process of revising the European Directive 95/46/EC (the “Directive”), which provides for the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data.  The revised regulation, as well as the Directive, obligates the controller of an individual's personal data to take the necessary technical and organizational measures to protect personal data.  Both the current Directive and the proposed regulation establish general principles with regard to the









processing of personal data, including the legal grounds for processing, the rights of individuals with regard to their personal data, restrictions on transfers of the personal data outside the European Economic Area, and the obligation of the controller of that information to take the necessary technical and organizational measures to protect personal data.  In addition to the United States and Europe, many jurisdictions around the world are enacting similar privacy, data protection and information security regulations which have similar impacts to our businesses in these jurisdictions.  See “Risk Factors - Legal and Regulatory Risks - Regulation in the areas of consumer privacy, data use and/ or security could decrease the number of payment cards issued and could increase our costs” in Part I, Item 1A of this Report.



Anti-Money Laundering and Anti-Terrorism.MasterCard and other participants in the payment industry are also subject to the regulatory requirements of Section 352 of the USA PATRIOT Act.  Section 352 of the USA PATRIOT Act requires MasterCard to maintain a comprehensive anti-money laundering program and imposes similar requirements on our financial institution customers in the United States.  Our anti-money laundering program must be reasonably designed to prevent our system from being used to facilitate money laundering and the financing of terrorist activities.  The program must include the designation of a compliance officer, provide for the training of appropriate personnel regarding anti-money laundering responsibilities, as well as incorporate policies, procedures, and controls to mitigate money laundering risks, and be independently audited.



We are also subject to regulations imposed by the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control (“OFAC”) restricting financial transactions with Cuba, Burma/Myanmar, Iran, Syria and Sudan and with persons and entities included in OFAC's list of Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons (the “SDN List”).  Cuba, Iran, Sudan and Syria also have been identified by the U.S. State Department as terrorist-sponsoring states.  MasterCard takes measures to prevent transactions that do not comply with OFAC sanctions; however, it is possible that such transactions may be processed through our payment system.  It is possible that our reputation may suffer due to our customer financial institutions' association with these countries or the existence of any such transactions, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on the value of our stock.



Financial Industry Regulation.  MasterCard customers are subject to numerous regulations applicable to banks and other financial institutions in the United States and elsewhere, and as a consequence MasterCard is impacted by such regulations.  Certain of our operations are periodically reviewed by the U.S. Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (“FFIEC”) under its authority to examine financial institutions' technology service providers.  Examinations by the FFIEC cover areas such as data integrity and data security.  In recent years, the U.S. federal banking regulators have adopted a series of regulatory measures affecting credit card payment terms and requiring more conservative accounting, greater risk management and in some cases higher capital requirements for bank credit card activities, particularly in the case of banks that focus on subprime cardholders.  In addition, MasterCard Europe operates a retail payment system in Europe and is subject to oversight by the National Bank of Belgium pursuant to standards published by the European Central Bank that are principally targeted at managing financial, legal and operations risk.





Government-Imposed Market Participation Regulations.  Regulators in several countries such as Australia, Mexico, Colombia, India, Singapore, Russia and Indonesia have received statutory authority to regulate certain aspects of the payments systems in these countries.  Such regulations include, or could include, providing broad regulatory oversight over retail payment system operators to the central banks in such countries.  In addition, governments in some countries may act to provide resources or preferential treatment or other protection to selected domestic payment card and processing providers, which could displace us from, or prevent us from entering into, or substantially restrict us from participating in, particular geographies.



Issuer Practice Regulation.The Federal Reserve has also adopted regulations addressing overdraft fees imposed in connection with ATM and debit card transactions.  These regulations may limit the ability of our customers to charge overdraft fees in connection









with debit card programs.  This may diminish the attractiveness of debit card programs to our customers and may adversely affect transaction volumes and revenues.



Regulation of Internet Transactions.  In October 2006, the U.S. Congress enacted legislation requiring the coding and blocking of payments for certain types of Internet gambling transactions.  The legislation applies to payment system participants, including MasterCard and our U.S. customers, and is implemented through a federal regulation.  Compliance was required no later than June 1, 2010, although Congress may consider additional legislation to legalize and regulate Internet gambling.  The federal regulation required us and our customers to implement compliance programs that could increase our costs and/or could decrease our transaction volumes.  In addition, the U.S. Congress continues its consideration of regulatory initiatives in the areas of Internet prescription drug purchases, copyright and trademark infringement, and privacy, among others, that could impose additional compliance burdens on us and/or our customers.  Some U.S. states are considering a variety of similar legislation.  If implemented, these initiatives could require us or our customers to monitor, filter, restrict, or otherwise oversee various categories of payment card transactions, thereby increasing our costs or decreasing our transaction volumes.



Additional Regulatory Developments.Various regulatory agencies also continue to examine a wide variety of issues, including identity theft, account management guidelines, privacy, disclosure rules, security and marketing that would impact our customers directly.  These new requirements and developments may affect our customers' ability to extend credit through the use of payment cards, which could decrease our transaction volumes.  In some circumstances, new regulations could have the effect of limiting our customers' ability to offer new types of payment programs or restricting their ability to offer our existing programs such as prepaid cards, which could materially and adversely reduce our revenue and revenue growth.
