AIG's Global Insurance Operations



HOW WE GENERATE REVENUES AND PROFITABILITY



We earn revenuesprimarily from insurance premiums, policy fees from
universal life insurance and investment products, and income from investments.

Our operating
expensesconsist of policyholder benefits and claims incurred, interest credited to policyholders, commissions and other costs of selling and
servicing our products, and general business expenses.

Our profitabilityis dependent on our ability to price and manage risk on
insurance and annuity products, to manage our portfolio of investments effectively, and control costs through expense discipline.

Commencing
in the third quarter of 2012, the Chartis segment was renamed AIG Property Casualty and the SunAmerica segment was renamed AIG Life and Retirement, although certain existing brands will
continue to be used in certain geographies and market segments.

Restructuring and Rebuilding: AIG Moving Forward

We have taken significant steps to position our company for future growth and in 2012 fully repaid governmental financial support of AIG. These amounts are discussed below in 2011-2012 Accomplishments.Federal Reserve Bank of New YorkWe repaid the governmental support that we received in September 2008 and thereafter during the global economic crisis. This support included a credit facility from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York (the FRBNY and such credit facility, the FRBNY
Credit Facility) and funding from the Department of the Treasury through the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP). After receiving this support, our Board of Directors and management placed a strong focus on improving our businesses and pursued four
main priorities:•building AIG's value by
strengthening our international property and casualty and domestic life insurance and retirement businesses;•repaying support from the U.S.
government, including through significant divestitures;•decreasing our operating costs;
and•reducing risk by winding down our
exposure to certain financial products and derivatives trading activities.We have made substantial progress in each of these four main priority areas during the past few years. Our efforts have centered on protecting and enhancing the value of our key businesses, restoring AIG's
 financial strength, repaying U.S. taxpayers and reducing risk.

AIG 2012 Form 10-K









Department of the Treasury

Through a series of transactions that closed on January 14, 2011 (the Recapitalization), we exchanged various forms of government support for AIG Common Stock, and the
Department of the Treasury became AIG's majority shareholder, with approximately 92 percent of outstanding AIG Common Stock at that time.

The
Department of the Treasury, as selling shareholder, sold all of its shares of AIG Common Stock through six registered public offerings completed in May 2011 and March, May, August, September and
December 2012. We purchased approximately 421 million shares of AIG Common Stock in the first four of the 2012 offerings for approximately $13.0 billion. We did not purchase any shares
in the May 2011 or December 2012 offerings.

See
Item 7. MD&A – Liquidity and Capital Resources and Notes 4, 17, 18, and 25 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the government
support provided to AIG, the Recapitalization and significant asset dispositions.

These
and other key accomplishments are described in the following table:



*         AIG
did not receive any proceeds from the sale of AIG Common Stock by the Department of the Treasury. The Department of the Treasury still owns ten-year warrants to purchase

Other Operations

Mortgage Guaranty (United Guaranty Corporation or UGC)offers private
residential mortgage guaranty insurance, which protects mortgage lenders and investors from loss due to borrower default and loan foreclosure. With over 1,100 employees, United Guaranty currently
insures over one million mortgage loans in the United States and has operations in nine other countries. In 2012, United Guaranty generated more than $37 billion in new insurance written, which
represents the original principal balance of the insured mortgages, becoming the leading provider of private mortgage insurance in the United States and is the highest rated private mortgage insurance
company in the U.S.



Mortgage Guaranty Business Strategy

Risk
Selection:Ensure the high quality of our business through a continuous focus on risk selection and risk based pricing using a
proprietary, multi-variant risk evaluation model and disciplined underwriting approach.







Innovation:Focus on innovation through the development and enhancement of products, technology, and processes, addressing the needs of
stakeholders in the mortgage system.







Ease of
Use:Eliminate complexity in the mortgage insurance system to create growth without sacrificing disciplined risk selection and
management.







Expense
Management:Streamline our processes through the use of technology and shared services to more quickly react to the changing dynamics of
the mortgage industry.











Mortgage Guaranty Insurance

Products and Services:United Guaranty
provides an array of products and services including first-lien mortgage guaranty insurance in a range of premium payment plans. United Guaranty's primary product is private mortgage
insurance. The coverage we provide – which is called mortgage guaranty insurance, mortgage insurance, or simply "MI" – enables borrowers to purchase a house with
a modest down payment. This is because MI protects lenders against the increased risk of borrower default related to high loan-to-value (LTV) mortgages –
those with less than 20 percent equity. In short, MI lets lenders provide more mortgage loans to more people.

Homeowner Support:United Guaranty also works
with homeowners who are behind on their mortgage payments to identify ways to retain their home. As a liaison between the borrower and the mortgage servicer, United Guaranty provides the added support
to qualified homeowners to help them avoid foreclosure.

Mortgage Guaranty Competition and Competitive Strengths

United
Guaranty competes with six private providers of mortgage insurance, both well-established and new entrants to the industry, and The Federal Housing
Administration, which is the largest provider of mortgage insurance in the United States.

The
United Guaranty brand has 50 years of history and is well regarded in the industry. We differentiate ourselves through our financial strength, our risk based pricing strategy, which
provides for lower premiums for lower risk mortgages, our innovative products and our rigorous approach to risk management. Despite these strengths there are potential challenges arising in the
mortgage market from increasingly complex regulations relating to mortgage originations as well as uncertainty in the government's involvement in the domestic residential housing finance system in the
future. These challenges may have an adverse impact on our business.



Other operations also include:

Global Capital Markets (GCM)consist of the
operations of AIG Markets, Inc. (AIG Markets) and the remaining derivatives portfolio of AIG Financial Products Corp. and AIG Trading Group Inc. and their respective subsidiaries
(collectively AIGFP). AIG Markets acts as the derivatives intermediary between AIG and its subsidiaries and third parties to provide hedging services. The AIGFP portfolio continues to be wound down
and is managed consistent with AIG's risk management objectives. Although the portfolio may experience periodic fair value volatility, it consists predominantly of transactions that AIG believes are
of low complexity, low risk or currently not economically appropriate to unwind based on a cost versus benefit analysis.

Direct Investment Book (DIB)consists of a
portfolio of assets and liabilities held directly by AIG Parent in the Matched Investment Program (MIP) and certain subsidiaries not related to AIG's core insurance operations (including certain
non-derivative assets and liabilities of AIGFP). The management of the DIB portfolio is focused on an orderly wind down to maximize returns consistent with AIG's risk management
objectives. Certain non-derivative assets and liabilities of the DIB are accounted for under the fair value option and thus operating results are subject to periodic market volatility.

Retained Interestsincludes the fair value gains
or losses, prior to their sale, of the AIA ordinary shares retained following the AIA initial public offering and the MetLife, Inc. (MetLife) securities that were received as consideration from
the sale of American Life Insurance Company (ALICO) and the fair value gains or losses, prior to the FRBNY liquidation of ML III assets, on the retained interest in ML III.

AIG 2012 Form 10-K









Corporate & Other Operationsconsist
primarily of interest expense, intercompany interest income that is eliminated in consolidation, expenses of corporate staff not attributable to specific reportable segments, certain expenses related
to internal controls and the financial and operating platforms, corporate initiatives, certain compensation plan expenses, corporate level net realized capital gains and losses, certain
litigation-related charges and credits, the results of AIG's real estate investment operations and net gains and losses on sale of divested businesses and properties that did not meet the criteria for
discontinued operations accounting treatment.

Divested BusinessesWe have divested a number of
businesses since 2009 in connection with our strategies to focus on core businesses, repay governmental support, and improve our financial flexibility and risk management. Divested businesses include
the historical results of divested entities that did not meet the criteria for discontinued operations accounting treatment.

Divested
businesses include the historical results of AIA through October 29, 2010 and AIG's remaining consumer finance business, discussed below. In the third quarter of 2010, AIG completed an
initial public offering of ordinary shares of AIA. Upon completion of this initial public offering, AIG owned approximately 33 percent of the outstanding shares of AIA. Because of this
ownership position in AIA, as well as AIG's prior representation on the AIA board of directors, AIA was not presented as a discontinued operation.



Discontinued Operationsconsist of entities that were sold, or are being sold, that met specific accounting criteria discussed in Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements.

On December 9, 2012, AIG entered into an agreement to sell 80.1 percent of ILFC for approximately $4.2 billion in cash, with an option for
the purchaser to buy an additional 9.9 percent stake. The sale is expected to be consummated in 2013. The operating results for ILFC are reflected as a discontinued operation in all periods
presented and its assets and liabilities have been classified as held for sale at December 31, 2012.

On
August 18, 2011, AIG closed the sale of Nan Shan Life Insurance Company, Ltd. (Nan Shan). On February 1, 2011, AIG closed the sale of AIG Star Life
Insurance Co., Ltd. (AIG Star) and AIG Edison Life Insurance Company (AIG Edison). The operating results for Nan Shan, AIG Star and AIG Edison through the dates of their respective sales
are reflected as discontinued operations in all periods prior to 2012.

In
the fourth quarter of 2010, AIG closed the sales of ALICO and American General Finance, Inc. (AGF). Periods prior to 2011 reflect ALICO and AGF as discontinued operations.

Additionally,
following the classification of AGF as a discontinued operation in the third quarter of 2010, AIG's remaining consumer finance business, which is primarily conducted through the AIG
Federal Savings Bank and the Consumer Finance Group in Poland, is now reported in AIG's Other operations category as part of Corporate & Other.



A REVIEW OF LIABILITY FOR UNPAID CLAIMS AND CLAIMS ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE



The liability for unpaid claims and claims adjustment expenses represents the accumulation of estimates for unpaid reported claims and claims that have been incurred but not
reported (IBNR) for our AIG Property Casualty subsidiaries and Mortgage Guaranty. Unpaid claims and claims adjustment expenses are also referred to as unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses, or just
loss reserves.

We
recognized as assets the portion of this liability that will be recovered from reinsurers. Reserves are discounted for future expected investment income, where permitted, in accordance with
U.S. GAAP.

AIG 2012 Form 10-K











The Loss Reserve Development Process

The
process of establishing the liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses is complex and imprecise because it must take into consideration many variables that
are subject to the outcome of future events. As a result, informed subjective estimates and judgments about our ultimate exposure to losses are an integral component of our loss reserving process.

We use a number of techniques to analyze the adequacy of the established net liability for unpaid claims and claims adjustment expense (net loss reserves). Using these analytical techniques, we monitor the adequacy of
AIG's established reserves and determine appropriate assumptions for inflation and other factors influencing loss costs. Our analysis also takes into account emerging specific development patterns, such as case reserve redundancies or deficiencies
and IBNR emergence. We also consider specific factors that may impact losses, such as changing trends in medical costs, unemployment levels and other economic indicators, as well as changes in legislation and social attitudes that may affect
decisions to file claims or the magnitude of court awards. See Item 7. MD&A – Critical Accounting Estimates for a description of our loss reserving process.A significant portion of AIG Property Casualty's business is in the U.S. commercial casualty class, which tends to involve longer periods of time for the reporting and settlement of claims and may increase the risk and uncertainty with respect to our
loss reserve development.Because reserve estimates are subject to the outcome of future events, changes in prior year estimates are unavoidable in the insurance industry. These changes in estimates are sometimes referred to as
 "loss development" or "reserve development."





Analysis of Consolidated Loss Reserve Development

The
"Analysis of Consolidated Loss Reserve Development" table shown on page 22 presents the development of prior year net loss reserves for calendar years 2002
through 2012 for each balance sheet in that period. The information in the table is presented in accordance with reporting requirements of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). This table
should be interpreted with care by those not familiar with its format or those who are familiar with other loss development analyses arranged in an accident year or underwriting year basis rather than
the balance sheet, as shown below. See Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

The top row of the table showsNet Reserves Held(the
net liability for unpaid claims and claims adjustment expenses) at each balance sheet date, net of discount.This liability represents the estimated
amount of losses and loss adjustment expenses for claims arising in all years prior to the balance sheet date that were unpaid as of that balance sheet date, including estimates for IBNR claims. The
amount of loss reserve discount included in the net reserves at each date is shown immediately below the net reserves held. The undiscounted reserve at each date is equal to the sum of the discount
and the net reserves held.

For
example,Net Reserves Held (Undiscounted)was $30.8 billion at December 31, 2002.

The next section of the table shows the originalNet Undiscounted Reserves
re-estimatedover 10 years. This re-estimation takes into consideration a number of factors, including changes in the estimated frequency of
reported claims, effects of significant judgments, the emergence of latent exposures, and changes in medical cost trends.For example, the original
undiscounted reserve of $30.8 billion at December 31, 2002, was re-estimated to $58.0 billion at December 31, 2012. The amount of the development related to
losses settled or re-estimated in 2012, but incurred in 2009, is included in the cumulative development amount for years 2009, 2010 and 2011. Any increase or decrease in the estimate is
reflected in operating results in the period in which the estimate is changed.

AIG 2012 Form 10-K









The middle of the table showsNet Redundancy/(Deficiency).This is the aggregate change in estimates over the period
of years covered by the table.For example, the net loss reserve
deficiency of $27.1 billion for 2002 is the difference between the original undiscounted reserve of $30.8 billion at December 31, 2002 and the $58.0 billion of
re-estimated reserves at December 31, 2012. The net redundancy/(deficiency) amounts are cumulative; in other words, the amount shown in the 2011 column includes the amount shown in
the 2010 column, and so on. Conditions and trends that have affected development of the liability in the past may not necessarily occur in the future. Accordingly, it generally is not appropriate to
extrapolate future development based on this table.

The bottom portion of the table shows thePaid (Cumulative)amounts during successive years related to the
undiscounted loss reserves.For example, as of December 31, 2012, AIG
had paid a total of $47.9 billion of the $58.0 billion in re-estimated reserves for 2002, resulting in Remaining Reserves (Undiscounted) of $10.1 billion for 2002.
Also included in this section are theRemaining Reserves (Undiscounted)and theRemaining Discountfor
each year.

The following table presents loss reserves and the related loss development 2002 through 2012 and consolidated gross liability (before discount), reinsurance recoverable and
net liability recorded for each calendar year, and the re-estimation of these amounts as of December 31, 2012.(a)

(a)     During
2009, we deconsolidated Transatlantic Holdings, Inc. and sold 21st Century Insurance Group and HSB Group, Inc. The sales and deconsolidation are reflected
in the table above as a reduction in December 31, 2009 net reserves of $9.7 billion and as an $8.6 billion increase in paid losses for the years 2000 through 2008 to remove the
reserves for these divested entities from the ending balance.(b)     The
increase in Net Reserves Held from 2009 to 2010 is partially due to the $1.7 billion in Net Reserves Held by Fuji, which was acquired in 2010. The decrease in 2011 is due
to the cession of asbestos reserves described in Item 7. MD&A – Results of Operations – Segment Results – AIG Property Casualty
Operations – Liability for Unpaid Claims and Claims Adjustment Expense – Asbestos and Environmental Reserves.

AIG 2012 Form 10-K









The Liability for unpaid claims and claims adjustment expense as reported in AIG's Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2012 differs from the total
reserve reported in the annual statements filed with state insurance departments and, where applicable, with foreign regulatory authorities primarily for the following reasons:

•Reserves for certain foreign operations are not required or permitted to be reported in the United States for statutory
reporting purposes, including contingency reserves for catastrophic events;•Statutory practices in the United States require reserves to be shown net of applicable reinsurance recoverable; and•Unlike statutory financial statements, AIG's consolidated Liability for unpaid claims and claims adjustment expense
excludes the effect of intercompany transactions.

Gross
loss reserves are calculated without reduction for reinsurance recoverables and represent the accumulation of estimates for reported losses and IBNR. We review the adequacy of established gross
loss reserves in the manner previously described for net loss reserves. A reconciliation of activity in the Liability for unpaid claims and claims adjustment expense is included in Note 13 to
the Consolidated Financial Statements.



REINSURANCE ACTIVITIES



AIG subsidiaries operate worldwide primarily by underwriting and accepting risks for their direct account on a gross basis and reinsuring a portion of the exposure on either
an individual risk or an aggregate basis to the extent those risks exceed the desired retention level. In addition, as a condition of certain direct
underwriting transactions, we are required by clients, agents or regulation to cede all or a portion of risks to specified reinsurance entities, such as captives, other insurers, local reinsurers and
compulsory pools.

In
2012, AIG Property Casualty adopted a new ceded reinsurance framework and strategy to improve the efficiency of our legal entity capital management and support our global product line risk and
profitability objectives. Reinsurance is also used to manage overall capital adequacy and mitigate the effects of certain events such as natural and man-made catastrophes. As a result of
adopting the new framework and strategy, many individual reinsurance contracts were consolidated into more efficient global programs and reinsurance ceded to third parties in support of risk and
capital management objectives has decreased in 2012. There are many different forms of reinsurance agreements and different markets that may be used to achieve our risk and profitability objectives.
We continually evaluate the reinsurance markets and the relative attractiveness of various arrangements that may be used to achieve our risk and profitability objectives.

The
form of reinsurance that we may choose from time to time will generally depend on whether we are seeking (i) proportional reinsurance, whereby we cede a specified percentage of premium and
losses to reinsurers, or non-proportional or excess of loss reinsurance, whereby we cede all or a specified portion of losses in excess of a specified amount on a per risk, per occurrence
(including catastrophe reinsurance) or aggregate basis and (ii) treaties that cover a defined book of policies, or facultative placements that cover an individual policy.

Reinsurance
markets include:

•Traditional local and global reinsurance markets including in the United States, Bermuda, London and Europe, accessed
directly and through reinsurance intermediaries;•Capital markets through investors in ILS and collateralized reinsurance transactions, such as catastrophe bonds,
"sidecars" (special purpose entities that allow investors to take on the risk of a book of business from an insurance company in exchange for a premium) and similar vehicles; and•Other insurers which engage in both direct and assumed reinsurance and/or engage in swaps.

Reinsurance
arrangements do not relieve the AIG subsidiaries from their direct obligations to insureds. However, an effective reinsurance program substantially mitigates our exposure to potentially
significant losses.

See
Item 7. MD&A – Enterprise Risk Management – Insurance Operations Risks – AIG Property Casualty Key Insurance
Risks – Reinsurance Recoverables for a summary of significant reinsurers.

AIG 2012 Form 10-K











GENERATING REVENUES: INVESTMENT ACTIVITIES OF OUR INSURANCE OPERATIONS



AIG Property Casualty and AIG Life and Retirement generally receive premiums and deposits well in advance of paying covered claims or benefits. In the intervening periods, we invest these premiums and deposits to generate
net investment income and fee income that is available to pay claims or benefits. As a result, we generate significant revenues from insurance investment activities.AIG's worldwide insurance investment policy places primary emphasis on investments in fixed maturity securities of corporations, municipal bonds and government issuances in all of its portfolios, and, to a lesser extent, investments in high-yield
bonds, common stock, real estate, hedge funds and other alternative investments.We generate significant revenues in our AIG Property Casualty and AIG Life and Retirement operations from investment activities.

The majority of assets backing insurance liabilities at AIG consist of intermediate and long duration fixed maturity securities.

AIG Property Casualty– Fixed maturity
securities held by the insurance companies included in AIG Property Casualty domestic operations historically have consisted primarily of laddered holdings of tax-exempt municipal bonds.
These tax-exempt municipal bonds provided attractive after-tax returns and limited credit risk. To meet our domestic operations' current risk-return and tax
objectives, our domestic property and casualty companies have begun to shift investment allocations away from tax-exempt municipal bonds towards taxable instruments. Any taxable
instruments must meet our liquidity, duration and quality objectives as well as current risk-return and tax objectives. Fixed maturity securities held by AIG Property Casualty
international operations consist primarily of intermediate duration high-grade securities, primarily in the markets being served. In addition, AIG Property Casualty has redeployed cash in
excess of operating needs and short-term investments into longer-term, higher-yielding securities.

AIG Life and Retirement– Our investment
strategy is to generally match the duration of our liabilities with assets of comparable duration. AIG Life and Retirement also invests in a diversified portfolio of private equity funds, hedge funds
and affordable housing partnerships. Although these types of investments are subject to periodic earnings volatility, through December 31, 2012, they have achieved total returns in excess of
AIG Life and Retirement's base portfolio yield. AIG Life and Retirement expects that these alternative investments will continue to outperform the base portfolio yield over the long term.

The following table summarizes the investment results of AIG's insurance operations, excluding the results of discontinued operations

REGULATION



Our operations around the world are subject to regulation by many different types of regulatory authorities, including banking, insurance, securities and investment advisory
regulators in the United States and abroad. The insurance

AIG 2012 Form 10-K









and
financial services industries generally have been subject to heightened regulatory scrutiny and supervision in recent years.

Federal Reserve Supervision



We are a savings and loan holding company (SLHC) within the meaning of the Home Owners' Loan Act (HOLA) and are regulated and subject to the examination, supervision and
enforcement authority and reporting requirements of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (FRB). Because we were grandfathered as a unitary SLHC within the meaning of HOLA when we
organized AIG Federal Savings Bank and became an SLHC in 1999, we generally are not restricted under existing laws as to the types of business activities in which we may engage, as long as AIG Federal
Savings Bank continues to be a qualified thrift lender.

The
Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank) has effected comprehensive changes to the regulation of financial services in the United States and
subjects us to substantial additional federal regulation. The FRB supervises and regulates SLHCs, and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) supervises and regulates federal savings
associations, such as AIG Federal Savings Bank. Dodd-Frank directs existing and newly-created government agencies and oversight bodies to promulgate regulations implementing the law, an
ongoing process that has begun and is anticipated to continue over the next few years.

Changes
mandated by Dodd-Frank include directing the FRB to promulgate minimum capital requirements for SLHCs. The FRB, OCC and Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) have proposed
revised minimum leverage and risk-based capital requirements that would apply to all bank holding companies and SLHCs, as well as to insured depository institutions, such as AIG Federal
Savings Bank. As required by Dodd-Frank, the FRB has also proposed enhanced prudential standards for large bank holding companies and non-bank systemically important financial
institutions (SIFIs) and has stated its intention to propose enhanced prudential standards for SLHCs pursuant to HOLA. We cannot predict whether the capital regulations will be adopted as proposed or
what enhanced prudential standards the FRB will promulgate for SLHCs, either generally or as applicable to insurance businesses. Further, we cannot predict how the FRB will exercise general
supervisory authority over us, although the FRB could, as a prudential matter, for example, limit our ability to pay dividends, purchase shares of AIG Common Stock or acquire or enter into other
businesses. We cannot predict with certainty the requirements of the regulations ultimately adopted or how or whether Dodd-Frank and such regulations will affect the financial markets
generally, impact our businesses, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition, or require us to raise additional capital or result in a downgrade of our credit ratings.

Furthermore,
Dodd-Frank requires SIFIs to be subject to regulation, examination and supervision by the FRB (including minimum leverage and risk-based capital requirements).
Nonbank SIFIs will be designated by the Financial Stability Oversight Council (Council) created by Dodd-Frank. If we are
designated as a SIFI, we will be regulated by the FRB both in that capacity and in our capacity as an SLHC. The regulations applicable to SIFIs and to SLHCs, when all have been adopted as final rules,
may differ materially from each other. In October 2012, we received a notice that we are under consideration by the Council for a proposed determination that we are a SIFI. The notice stated that we
will be reviewed in Stage 3 of the SIFI determination process described in the Council's interpretive guidance for nonbank financial company determinations. If we are designated as a SIFI, we
would also be subject to additional regulatory requirements, including heightened prudential standards. For a description of those standards as currently proposed and a discussion of the potential
effects on us if we are designated as a SIFI, see Item 1A. Risk Factors – Regulation.

As
part of its general prudential supervisory powers, the FRB has the authority to limit our ability to conduct activities that would otherwise be permissible for us to engage in if we do not satisfy
certain requirements.

Directive
2002/87/EC (the Directive) issued by the European Parliament provides that certain financial conglomerates with regulated entities in the European Union, such as AIG, are subject to
supplementary supervision. Pursuant to the Directive, the Commission Bancaire, the French banking regulator, was appointed as our supervisory coordinator. We have been in discussions with, and have
provided information to, the Autorité de Contrôle Prudentiel (formerly, the Commission Bancaire) and the UK Financial Services Authority regarding the possibility of
proposing another of our existing regulators as our equivalent supervisor.

AIG 2012 Form 10-K








Capital Requirements



Section 171 of Dodd-Frank (the Collins Amendment) subjects SLHCs to capital requirements that must be no less stringent than the requirements generally
applicable to insured depository institutions or quantitatively lower than the requirements in effect for insured depository institutions as of July 21, 2010. The regulatory capital
requirements currently applicable to insured depository institutions, such as AIG Federal Savings Bank, are computed in accordance with the U.S. federal banking agencies' generally applicable
risk-based capital requirements, which are based on accords established by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (Basel Committee). These accords have evolved over time, and are
referred to as Basel I, Basel II and Basel III.

In
June 2012, the federal banking agencies issued proposed rules that would revise and replace current regulatory capital rules for banking organizations, including SLHCs.

We
are still considering the full impact of the proposed capital rules and the FRB and the other federal banking agencies have not adopted final rules. In addition, the FRB has announced that the
rules will not be effective as of January 1, 2013, as originally proposed, but has not provided a revised effective date.

Also
in June 2012, the FRB and the other federal banking agencies issued revised final rules that modify their market risk regulatory capital requirements for banking institutions with significant
trading activities. These modifications are designed to address the adjustments to the market risk regulatory capital framework that were announced by the Basel Committee in June 2010 (referred to as
"Basel II.5") and the prohibition on the use of external credit ratings, as required by Dodd-Frank. These changes become effective for banking institutions in 2013 and will likely become
effective for us when capital requirements for SLHCs are implemented. These changes will result in increased regulatory capital requirements for market risk. We are still considering the full impact
of these capital requirements.

Volcker Rule



In July 2012, Section 619 of Dodd-Frank, referred to as the "Volcker Rule," became effective, although the final rule implementing Section 619 has
not yet been released. Under the proposed rule released in October 2011, if we continue to be regulated as an SLHC due to our control of AIG Federal Savings Bank, or control another insured depository
institution, we and our affiliates would be considered banking entities for purposes of the rule and, after the rule's conformance date of July 21, 2014, would be prohibited from "proprietary
trading" and sponsoring or investing in "covered funds," subject to the rule's exceptions. Even if we are no longer regulated as an SLHC or no longer control an insured depository institution, we
could be subject to restrictions on these activities if we are designated as a SIFI, as Dodd-Frank authorizes the FRB to subject SIFIs to capital requirements, quantitative limits or other
restrictions if they engage in activities prohibited for banking entities under the Volcker Rule. The Volcker Rule, as proposed, contains an exemption for proprietary trading by insurance companies
for their general account, but the final breadth and scope of this exemption is uncertain.

Other Effects of Dodd-Frank



In
addition, Dodd-Frank will also have the following effects on us:

•If we are designated as a SIFI, the FRB could (i) limit our ability to merge with, acquire, consolidate with, or
become affiliated with another company, to offer specified financial products or to terminate specified activities; (ii) impose conditions on how we conduct our activities or (iii) with
approval of the Council, and a determination that the foregoing actions are inadequate to mitigate a threat to U.S. financial stability, require us to sell or otherwise transfer assets or
off-balance-sheet items to unaffiliated entities.•If we are designated as a SIFI, we will be required to provide to regulators an annual plan for our rapid and orderly
resolution in the event of material financial distress or failure, which must, among other things, ensure that AIG Federal Savings Bank is adequately protected from risks arising from our other
entities and meet several specific standards, including requiring a detailed resolution strategy and analyses of our material entities, organizational structure, interconnections and
interdependencies, and management information systems, among other elements.

AIG 2012 Form 10-K








•

The Council may recommend that state insurance regulators or other regulators apply new or heightened standards and
safeguards for activities or practices that we and other insurers or other financial services companies engage in.

•

Title II of Dodd-Frank provides that a financial company whose largest United States subsidiary is an insurer
(such as us) may be subject to a special liquidation process outside the federal bankruptcy code. That process is to be administered by the FDIC upon a coordinated determination by the Secretary of
the Treasury, the director of the Federal Insurance Office and the FRB, in consultation with the FDIC, that such a financial company is in default or in danger of default and presents a systemic risk
to U.S. financial stability.

•

Dodd-Frank establishes a new framework for regulation of the over-the-counter (OTC)
derivatives markets – including the imposition of margin and collateral requirements, centralized clearing and reporting/record keeping requirements – that could
affect various activities of AIG and its insurance subsidiaries.

•

Dodd-Frank mandated a study to determine whether stable value contracts should be included in the definition
of "swap." If that study concludes that stable value contracts are swaps, Dodd-Frank authorizes certain federal regulators to determine whether an exemption from the definition of a swap
is appropriate and in the public interest. Certain of our affiliates are in or may participate in the stable value contract business. We cannot predict what regulations might emanate from the
aforementioned study or be promulgated applicable to this business in the future.

•

Dodd-Frank established a Federal Insurance Office (FIO) within the Department of the Treasury headed by a
director appointed by the Secretary of the Treasury. While not having a general supervisory or regulatory authority over the business of insurance, the director of this office performs various
functions with respect to insurance (other than health insurance), including serving as a non-voting member of the Council and participating in the Council's decisions regarding insurers,
potentially including AIG, to be designated as a SIFI. The director is also required to conduct a study on how to modernize and improve the system of insurance regulation in the United States,
including by increased national uniformity through either a federal charter or effective action by the states. The FIO may also recommend enhanced regulations to state insurance regulatory bodies.

•

Dodd-Frank established the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) as an independent agency within the FRB
to regulate consumer financial products and services offered primarily for personal, family or household purposes. Insurance products and services are not within the CFPB's general jurisdiction,
although the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development has since transferred authority to the CFPB to investigate mortgage insurance practices. Broker-dealers and investment advisers are not
subject to the CFPB's jurisdiction when acting in their registered capacity.

•

Title XIV of Dodd-Frank also restricts certain terms for mortgage loans, such as loan fees, prepayment fees
and other charges, and imposes certain duties on a lender to ensure that a borrower can afford to repay the loan.

Dodd-Frank
imposes various assessments on financial companies, including, as applicable to us, ex-post assessments to provide funds necessary to repay any borrowing and to
cover the costs of any special resolution of a financial company conducted under Title II (although the regulatory authority would have to take account of the amounts paid by us into state guaranty
funds).

We
cannot predict whether these actions will become effective or the effect they may have on the financial markets or on our business, results of operations, cash flows, financial condition and credit
ratings. However, it is possible that such effect could be materially adverse. See Item 1A. Risk Factors – Regulation for additional information.

Other Regulatory Developments



In addition to the adoption of Dodd-Frank in the United States, regulators and lawmakers around the world are actively reviewing the causes of the financial
crisis and taking steps to avoid similar problems in the future. The Financial Stability Board (FSB), consisting of representatives of national financial authorities of the G20 nations, has issued a
series of frameworks and recommendations intended to produce significant changes in how financial companies, particularly SIFIs, should be regulated. These frameworks and recommendations address such
issues as financial group supervision, capital and solvency standards, systemic economic risk, corporate governance including compensation, and a host of related issues associated with responses to
the financial crisis. The FSB has directed the International Association of Insurance Supervisors (the IAIS, headquartered in Basel, Switzerland) to create

AIG 2012 Form 10-K








standards
relative to these areas and incorporate them within that body's Insurance Core Principles. IAIS Insurance Core Principles form the baseline threshold for how countries' financial services
regulatory efforts are measured relative to the insurance sector. That measurement is made by periodic Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) reviews conducted by the World Bank and the
International Monetary Fund and the reports thereon spur the development of country-specific additional or amended regulatory changes. Lawmakers and regulatory authorities in a number of jurisdictions
in which our subsidiaries conduct business have already begun implementing legislative and regulatory changes consistent with these recommendations, including proposals governing consolidated
regulation of insurance holdings companies by the Financial Services Agency in Japan, financial and banking regulation adopted in France and compensation regulations proposed or adopted by the
financial regulators in Germany and the United Kingdom Financial Services Authority.

Legislation
in the European Union could also affect our international insurance operations. The Solvency II Directive (2009/138/EEC) (Solvency II), which was adopted on November 25, 2009 and is
expected to become effective in January 2014, reforms the insurance industry's solvency framework, including minimum capital and solvency requirements, governance requirements, risk management and
public reporting standards. The impact on us will depend on whether the U.S. insurance regulatory regime is deemed "equivalent" to Solvency II; if the U.S. insurance regulatory regime is not
equivalent, then we, along with other insurance companies, could be required to be supervised under Solvency II standards. Whether the U.S. insurance regulatory regime will be deemed "equivalent" is
still under consideration by European authorities and remains uncertain, so we are not currently able to predict the impact of Solvency II.

We
expect that the regulations applicable to us and our regulated entities will continue to evolve for the foreseeable future.

Regulation of Insurance Subsidiaries



Certain states require registration and periodic reporting by insurance companies that are licensed in such states and are controlled by other corporations. Applicable
legislation typically requires periodic disclosure concerning the corporation that controls the registered insurer and the other companies in the holding company system and prior approval of
intercompany services and transfers of assets, including in some instances
payment of dividends by the insurance subsidiary, within the holding company system. Our subsidiaries are registered under such legislation in those states that have such requirements.

Our
insurance subsidiaries are subject to regulation and supervision by the states and by other jurisdictions in which they do business. Within the United States, the method of such regulation varies
but generally has its source in statutes that delegate regulatory and supervisory powers to an insurance official. The regulation and supervision relate primarily to the financial condition of the
insurers and their corporate conduct and market conduct activities. This includes approval of policy forms and rates, the standards of solvency that must be met and maintained, including with respect
to risk-based capital, the licensing of insurers and their agents, the nature of and limitations on investments, restrictions on the size of risks that may be insured under a single
policy, deposits of securities for the benefit of policyholders, requirements for acceptability of reinsurers, periodic examinations of the affairs of insurance companies, the form and content of
reports of financial condition required to be filed and reserves for unearned premiums, losses and other purposes. In general, such regulation is for the protection of policyholders rather than the
equity owners of these companies.

In
the U.S., the Risk-Based Capital (RBC) formula is designed to measure the adequacy of an insurer's statutory surplus in relation to the risks inherent in its business. Virtually every
state has adopted, in substantial part, the RBC Model Law promulgated by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC), which allows states to act upon the results of RBC calculations,
and provides for four incremental levels of regulatory action regarding insurers whose RBC calculations fall below specific thresholds. Those levels of action range from the requirement to submit a
plan describing how an insurer would regain a calculated RBC ratio above the respective threshold through a mandatory regulatory takeover of the company. The action thresholds are based on RBC levels
that are calculated so that a company subject to such actions is solvent but its future solvency is in doubt without some type of corrective action. The RBC formula computes a
risk-adjusted surplus level by applying discrete factors to various asset, premium and reserve items. These factors are developed to be risk-sensitive so that higher factors
are applied to items exposed to greater risk. The statutory surplus of each of our U.S.-based life and property and casualty insurance subsidiaries exceeded RBC minimum required levels as of
December 31, 2012.

If
any of our insurance entities fell below prescribed levels of statutory surplus, it would be our intention to provide appropriate capital or other types of support to that entity, under formal
support agreements or capital maintenance agreements (CMAs) or otherwise. For additional details regarding CMAs that we have entered into with our insurance subsidiaries, see Item 7.

and – AIG Life and Retirement.

The
National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) has undertaken the Solvency Modernization Initiative (SMI) which focuses on a review of insurance solvency regulations throughout the U.S.
financial regulatory system and is expected to lead to a set of long-term solvency modernization goals. SMI is broad in scope, but the NAIC has stated that its focus will include the U.S.
solvency framework, group solvency issues, capital requirements, international accounting and regulatory standards, reinsurance and corporate governance.

A
substantial portion of AIG Property Casualty's business is conducted in foreign countries. The degree of regulation and supervision in foreign jurisdictions varies. Generally, we must satisfy local
regulatory requirements, licenses issued by foreign authorities to our subsidiaries are subject to modification or revocation by such authorities, and therefore these subsidiaries could be prevented
from conducting business in certain of the jurisdictions where they currently operate.

In
addition to licensing requirements, our foreign operations are also regulated in various jurisdictions with respect to currency, policy language and terms, advertising, amount and type of security
deposits, amount and type of reserves, amount and type of capital to be held, amount and type of local investment and the share of profits to be returned to policyholders on participating policies.
Some foreign countries regulate rates on various types of policies. Certain countries have established reinsurance institutions, wholly or partially owned by the local government, to which admitted
insurers are obligated to cede a portion of their business on terms that may not always allow foreign insurers, including our subsidiaries, full compensation. In some countries, regulations governing
constitution of technical reserves and remittance balances may hinder remittance of profits and repatriation of assets.
