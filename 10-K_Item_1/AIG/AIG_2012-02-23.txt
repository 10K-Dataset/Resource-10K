ITEM 1. BUSINESS

American International Group, Inc. (AIG) is a leading international insurance organization serving customers in more than 130 countries.
AIG companies serve commercial, institutional and individual customers through one of the most extensive worldwide property-casualty networks of any insurer. In addition, AIG companies are leading
providers of life insurance and retirement services in the United States. AIG Common Stock, par value $2.50 per share (AIG Common Stock), is listed on the New York Stock Exchange and the Tokyo Stock
Exchange.

Throughout
this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the terms AIG, the Company, we, us and our are used to collectively refer to AIG, a Delaware corporation, and its
consolidated subsidiaries, unless the context otherwise requires. The term AIG Parent refers solely to American International Group, Inc., a Delaware corporation, and not to any of its
consolidated subsidiaries.

In
September 2008, liquidity issues resulted in AIG seeking and receiving governmental support through a credit facility from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York (the FRBNY, and such
credit facility, the FRBNY Credit Facility) and funding from the United States Department of the Treasury (Department of the Treasury) through the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP).

On
January 14, 2011, AIG was recapitalized (the Recapitalization) and the FRBNY Credit Facility was repaid and terminated through a series of transactions that resulted in the
Department of the Treasury becoming AIG's majority shareholder with ownership of approximately 92 percent of outstanding AIG Common Stock at that time. AIG understands that, subject to market
conditions, the Department of the Treasury intends to dispose of its ownership interest over time, and AIG has granted certain registration rights to the Department of the Treasury to facilitate such
sales.

On
May 27, 2011, AIG and the Department of the Treasury, as the selling shareholder, completed a registered public offering of AIG Common Stock. AIG issued and sold
100 million shares of AIG Common Stock for aggregate net proceeds of approximately $2.9 billion and the Department of the Treasury sold 200 million shares of AIG Common Stock. AIG
did not receive any of the proceeds from the sale of the shares of AIG Common Stock by the Department of the Treasury. As a result of the sale of AIG Common Stock in this offering, the Series G
Cumulative Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock, par value $5.00 per share (the Series G Preferred Stock) was cancelled and the ownership of the outstanding AIG Common Stock by the Department
of the Treasury was reduced from approximately 92 percent to approximately 77 percent after the completion of the offering.

See
Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A) — Capital Resources and Liquidity and Notes 1
and 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the governmental support provided to AIG and the Recapitalization.

In
order to align financial reporting with the manner in which AIG's chief operating decision makers review the businesses to allocate resources and assess performance, changes were made
during 2011 to AIG's segment information. See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. AIG now reports its results of operations as

AIRCRAFT LEASING

Aircraft Leasing operations include the results of ILFC (and, since the date of its acquisition by ILFC, AeroTurbine, as discussed below). ILFC,
one of the world's leading aircraft lessors, acquires commercial jet aircraft from various manufacturers and other parties and leases those aircraft to airlines around the world. ILFC believes its
scale, the breadth and mix of its aircraft portfolio and its long-standing relationships with a global customer base that includes the majority of the world's leading airlines allow it to
lease aircraft under favorable terms and maximize their utilization.

As
of December 31, 2011, ILFC managed a lease portfolio of over 1,000 aircraft, including an owned fleet of 930 aircraft with a net book value of approximately
$35.5 billion. ILFC reported $4.5 billion in revenues for 2011. More than 94 percent of ILFC's lease revenue came from non-U.S. carriers, and its fleet continues to be
in high demand from such carriers.

On
September 2, 2011, ILFC Holdings, Inc., an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of AIG, which is intended to become a holding company for ILFC, filed a registration
statement on Form S-1 with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for a proposed initial public offering. The number of shares to be offered, price range and timing for any
offering have not been determined. The timing of any offering will depend on market conditions and no assurance can be given regarding the terms of any offering or that an offering will be completed.
On October 7, 2011, ILFC completed the acquisition of all the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of AeroTurbine from AerCap, Inc. for an aggregate cash purchase price of
$228 million. AeroTurbine is one of the world's largest providers of certified aircraft engines, aircraft and engine parts and supply chain solutions.

ILFC
continues to execute on its strategy to manage its fleet of aircraft by ordering new aircraft with high customer demand and through potential sales or part-outs of its
older aircraft which cannot be economically leased to customers.

OTHER OPERATIONS

AIG's Other operations include results from Mortgage Guaranty operations, Global Capital Markets operations, Direct Investment book, Retained
Interests, Corporate & Other operations (after allocations to AIG's business segments), and in periods prior to 2011, those divested businesses not included in Discontinued operations.

MORTGAGE GUARANTY

UGC's main business is the issuance of residential mortgage guaranty insurance, both domestically and internationally, that covers mortgage
lenders for the first loss for credit defaults on high loan-to-value conventional first-lien mortgages for the purchase or refinance of one- to
four-family residences. UGC previously insured second-lien and private student loans, but ceased insuring new business in these products in 2008, although certain of the
second-lien policies are subject to reinstatement.

GLOBAL CAPITAL MARKETS

Global Capital Markets consist of the operations of AIG Markets and the remaining derivatives portfolio of AIGFP. AIG Markets acts as the
derivatives intermediary between AIG companies and third parties, and executes its derivative trades under International Swaps and Derivatives Association, Inc. (ISDA) agreements. The

12            AIG 2011 Form 10-K










agreements
with third parties typically require collateral postings. Many of AIG Markets' transactions with AIG and its subsidiaries also include collateral posting requirements. However, generally,
no collateral is called under these contracts unless it is needed to satisfy posting requirements with third parties.

The
active wind-down of the AIGFP derivatives portfolio was completed by the end of the second quarter of 2011. Although the remaining AIGFP derivatives portfolio may
experience periodic fair value volatility, the portfolio consists predominantly of transactions AIG believes are of low complexity, low risk, supportive of AIG's risk management objectives or not
economically appropriate to unwind based on a cost versus benefit analysis. AIGFP is entering into new derivative transactions only to hedge its current portfolio.

DIRECT INVESTMENT BOOK

The Direct Investment book includes results of the MIP, AIG's historical program to generate spread income from investments yielding returns
greater than AIG's cost of funds, and certain non-derivative assets and liabilities of AIGFP. The MIP assets and liabilities and the AIGFP portfolio are currently managed on a collective
program basis to limit the need for additional liquidity from AIG Parent. Direct Investment book operating results are significantly affected by performance in the credit, equity, interest rate and
foreign exchange markets.

RETAINED INTERESTS

Retained Interests represents the fair value gains or losses on the AIA Group Limited (AIA) ordinary shares retained following the AIA initial
public offering, the retained interest in Maiden Lane III LLC (ML III) and, prior to their sale in March 2011, the MetLife, Inc. (MetLife) securities that were received as
consideration from the sale of American Life Insurance Company (ALICO).

CORPORATE & OTHER

AIG's Corporate & Other operations consist primarily of interest expense, intercompany interest income that is eliminated in consolidation,
expenses of corporate staff not attributable to specific reportable segments (including restructuring costs), certain expenses related to internal controls and the financial and operating platforms,
corporate initiatives, certain compensation plan expenses, corporate level net realized capital gains and losses, certain litigation-related charges and credits, the results of AIG's real estate
investment operations and net gains
and losses on sale of divested businesses and properties that did not meet the criteria for discontinued operations accounting treatment.

DIVESTED BUSINESSES

Divested businesses include the historical results of divested entities that did not meet the criteria for discontinued operations accounting
treatment. Divested businesses include the historical results of AIA through October 29, 2010 and AIG's remaining consumer finance business, discussed below. In the third quarter of 2010, AIG
completed an initial public offering of ordinary shares of AIA; upon completion of the initial public offering, AIG owned approximately 33 percent of the outstanding shares of AIA. Based on
AIG's continuing involvement with AIA, as a result of its ownership of 33 percent of AIA's shares and board representation, AIA is not presented as a discontinued operation. Businesses divested
in 2009 included Transatlantic Holdings, Inc. (Transatlantic), 21st Century Insurance Group; (including Agency Auto Division but excluding Chartis Private Client Group)
(21st Century) and HSB Group, Inc. (HSB).

DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS

Discontinued operations include the results of ALICO, AIG Star Life Insurance Co., Ltd. (AIG Star), AIG Edison Life Insurance
Company (AIG Edison), Nan Shan Life Insurance Company, Ltd. (Nan Shan) and American General Finance, Inc. (AGF). In the fourth quarter of 2010, AIG closed the sales of ALICO and AGF. On
February 1, 2011 AIG closed the sale of AIG Star and AIG Edison and on August 18, 2011, AIG closed the sale of Nan Shan.

AIG 2011 Form 10-K            13








Additionally,
following the classification of AGF as a discontinued operation in the third quarter of 2010, AIG's remaining consumer finance business, which is primarily conducted
through the AIG Federal Savings Bank and the Consumer Finance Group in Poland, is now reported in AIG's Other operations category as part of Corporate & Other.

See
Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on discontinued operations.

INSURANCE ACTIVITIES

LIABILITY FOR UNPAID CLAIMS AND CLAIMS ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE

Background

Insurance companies are required to establish a liability for the ultimate costs, including loss adjustment expenses, of claims that have been
reported but not settled and estimates of claims that have been incurred but not reported (IBNR). Insurance companies are also required to recognize as assets the portion of such liability that will
be recovered from reinsurers. Reserves are discounted for future expected investment income, where permitted, as disclosed in Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Because
reserve estimates are subject to the outcome of future events, changes in estimates are unavoidable in the insurance industry. These changes in estimates are sometimes referred
to as "loss development" or "reserve development".

Management
reviews the adequacy of the established net liability for unpaid claims and claims adjustment expense (net loss reserves) utilizing a number of analytical reserve development
techniques. Through the use of these techniques, management monitors the adequacy of AIG's established reserves and determines appropriate assumptions for inflation and other factors influencing loss
costs. Also, analysis of emerging specific development patterns, such as case reserve redundancies or deficiencies and IBNR emergence, or analysis of specific structural
drivers of losses such as the historical versus expected future levels of medical cost trends, unemployment levels and other macroeconomics indicators, as well as the legislative framework and social
attitudes that affected the propensity to file claims or the magnitude of court awards, allows management to determine any required adjustments. A significant portion of Chartis' business is in the
commercial casualty class, which tends to involve longer periods of time for the reporting and settlement of claims and may increase the risk and uncertainty with respect to Chartis' loss reserve
development.

Analysis of Consolidated Loss Reserve Development

To understand the changes in estimates, it is useful to put them in the context of cumulative reserve development experienced by AIG over a longer
time frame. The first table that follows presents the development of net loss reserves for calendar years 2001 through 2011. The net liability for unpaid claims and claims adjustment expenses (Net
Reserves Held) at the balance sheet date is shown on the first row of the table, net of discount. This liability represents the estimated amount of losses and loss adjustment expenses for claims
arising in all years prior to the balance sheet date that were unpaid as of that balance sheet date, including estimates for incurred but not reported claims. The amount of loss reserve discount
included in the net reserves at each date is shown immediately below the net reserves held. The undiscounted reserve at each date is equal to the sum of the discount and the net reserves held.

The
upper portion of the table presents the re-estimation over the years of the original undiscounted reserves. This re-estimation takes into consideration a
number of factors, including changes in the estimated frequency of reported claims, effects of significant judgments, the emergence of latent exposures, and changes in medical cost trends. For
example, in the first table, the original undiscounted reserve of $27.4 billion at December 31, 2001 was re-estimated to $55.4 billion at December 31, 2011. The
amount of the development related to losses settled or re-estimated in 2011, but incurred in 2008, is included in the cumulative development amount for years 2008, 2009, and 2010. Any
increase or decrease in the estimate is reflected in operating results in the period in which the estimate is changed.

14            AIG 2011 Form 10-K








The
net redundancy (deficiency) depicted in the middle of the table presents the aggregate change in estimates over the period of years subsequent to the balance sheet date reflected at
the top of the respective column heading. For example, in the first table, the net loss reserve deficiency of $28.0 billion for 2001 is the difference between the original undiscounted reserve
of $27.4 billion at December 31, 2001 and the $55.4 billion of re-estimated reserves at December 31, 2011. The net redundancy (deficiency) amounts are
cumulative; in other words, the amount shown for the 2010 balance sheet date includes the amount shown for the 2009 balance sheet date. Conditions and trends that have affected development of the
liability in the past may not necessarily occur in the future. Accordingly, it generally is not appropriate to extrapolate future development based on this table.

The
bottom portion of the table presents the cumulative amounts paid during successive years related to the undiscounted loss reserves. For example, AIG has paid a total of
$45.6 billion of the $55.4 billion in re-estimated reserves for December 31, 2001 at December 31, 2011, resulting in remaining undiscounted reserves of
$9.8 billion for 2001. Also included in this section are the remaining undiscounted and discounted net loss reserves for each year.

The following table presents for each calendar year the loss reserves and the development thereof including those with respect to asbestos and environmental
claims.(a)

(a)During 2009, Transatlantic was deconsolidated and 21st Century and HSB were sold. The sales and deconsolidation are reflected in the table above as a
reduction in December 31, 2009 net reserves of $9.6 billion and as an $8.6 billion increase in paid losses for the years 2000 through 2008 to remove the reserves for these
divested entities from the ending balance.(b)The increase in Net Reserves Held from 2009 to 2010 is partially attributable to the $1.7 billion in Net Reserves Held by
Fuji, which was acquired in 2010.

The Liability for unpaid claims and claims adjustment expense as reported in AIG's Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2011 differs
from the total reserve reported in the annual statements filed with state insurance departments and, where applicable, with foreign regulatory authorities. The differences at December 31, 2011
relate primarily to reserves for certain foreign operations not required or permitted to be reported in the United States for statutory reporting purposes, including contingency reserves for
catastrophic events. Further, statutory practices in the United States require reserves to be shown net of applicable reinsurance recoverables. In addition, unlike statutory financial statements,
AIG's Liability for unpaid claims and claims adjustment expense reported on its Consolidated Balance Sheet and the amounts in the tables above exclude the effect of intercompany transactions.

Gross
loss reserves are calculated without reduction for reinsurance recoverables and represent the accumulation of estimates for reported losses and IBNR. Management reviews the
adequacy of established gross loss reserves in the manner previously described for net loss reserves.

Additional
information related to reserve development is included in Item 7. MD&A — Results of Operations — Segment
Results — Chartis Operations — Liability for Unpaid Claims and Claims Adjustment Expense. A sensitivity analysis of loss reserves held at December 31,
2011, is included in Item 7. MD&A — Critical Accounting Estimates — Liability for Unpaid Claims and Claims Adjustment Expense.

REINSURANCE ACTIVITIES

AIG subsidiaries operate worldwide primarily by underwriting and accepting risks for their direct account on a gross line basis and subsequently
reinsuring on either an individual risk or an aggregate basis to the extent those risks exceed the desired retention level.

For
a further discussion of reinsurance, see Item 1A. Risk Factors — Reinsurance; and Item 7. MD&A — Enterprise Risk
Management — Business Unit Risk Management — Reinsurance.

18            AIG 2011 Form 10-K








INSURANCE INVESTMENT ACTIVITIES

A significant portion of the revenues of Chartis and SunAmerica operations is derived from AIG's insurance investment activities. As insurance
companies, Chartis and SunAmerica generally receive premiums and deposits well in advance of paying covered claims or benefits. In the intervening periods, these premiums and deposits are invested to
generate net investment income and fee income that is available to pay claims or benefits.

AIG's
worldwide insurance investment policy places primary emphasis on investments in fixed income securities of corporations, municipal bonds and government issuances in all of its
portfolios, and, to a lesser extent, investments in high-yield bonds, common stocks, real estate, hedge funds and other alternative investments.

The
majority of assets backing insurance liabilities at AIG consist of intermediate and long duration fixed maturity securities.

In
the case of SunAmerica, the fundamental investment strategy is, as nearly as is practicable, to match the duration characteristics of the liabilities with assets of comparable
duration. SunAmerica also invests in a diversified portfolio of private equity funds, hedge funds and affordable housing partnerships. Although subject to periodic volatility, these investments, to
date, have achieved yields in excess of SunAmerica's base portfolio yield. SunAmerica's expectation is that these alternative investments will continue to outperform the base portfolio yield over the
long-term.

Fixed
maturity securities held by the insurance companies included in Chartis domestic operations historically have consisted primarily of laddered holdings of tax-exempt
municipal bonds, which provided attractive after-tax returns and limited credit risk. In order to meet the Chartis domestic operations' current risk/return and tax objectives, the domestic
property and casualty companies have begun to shift investment allocations away from tax-exempt municipal bonds towards taxable instruments meeting the companies' liquidity, duration and
quality objectives as well as current risk-return and tax objectives. Fixed maturity securities held by Chartis operations internationally consist primarily of intermediate duration
high-grade securities.

See
Item 7. MD&A — Investments — Investment Strategies for discussion of AIG's investment strategy.

The following table summarizes the investment results of AIG's insurance operations, excluding the results of discontinued operations:

LOCATIONS OF CERTAIN ASSETS

As of December 31, 2011, approximately 14 percent of the consolidated assets of AIG were located outside the U.S. and Canada,
including $188 million of cash and securities on deposit with regulatory authorities in those locations. Operations outside the U.S. and Canada and assets held abroad may be adversely affected
by political developments in foreign countries, including tax changes, nationalization and changes in regulatory policy, as well as by consequence of hostilities and unrest. The risks of such
occurrences and their overall effect upon AIG vary from country to country and cannot easily be predicted. If expropriation or nationalization does occur, AIG's policy is to take all appropriate
measures to seek recovery of any affected assets. Certain of the countries in which AIG's business is conducted have currency restrictions that generally cause a delay in a company's ability to
repatriate assets and profits. See also Item 1A. Risk Factors — Foreign Operations and Notes 2 and 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

REGULATION

AIG's operations around the world are subject to regulation by many different types of regulatory authorities, including insurance, securities,
investment advisory, banking and thrift regulators in the United States and abroad.

SUPERVISORY COORDINATOR

In 1999, AIG became a unitary savings and loan holding company within the meaning of the Home Owners' Loan Act (HOLA) when the U.S. Office of
Thrift Supervision (OTS) granted AIG approval to organize AIG Federal Savings Bank. Until March 2010, AIG was subject to OTS regulation, examination, supervision and reporting requirements.

Under
prior law, a unitary savings and loan holding company, such as AIG, was not restricted as to the types of business in which it could engage, provided that its savings association
subsidiary continued to be a qualified thrift lender. The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 (GLBA) provides that no company may acquire control of an OTS-regulated institution after
May 4, 1999 unless it engages only in the financial activities permitted for financial holding companies under the law or for multiple savings and loan holding companies. The GLBA, however,
grandfathered the unrestricted authority for activities with respect to a unitary savings and loan holding company existing prior to May 4, 1999, so long as its savings association subsidiary
continues to be a qualified thrift lender under HOLA. As a unitary savings and loan holding company whose application was pending as of May 4, 1999, AIG is grandfathered under GLBA and
generally is not restricted under existing laws as to the types of business activities in which it may engage, provided that AIG Federal Savings Bank continues to be a qualified thrift lender under
HOLA.

Directive
2002/87/EC (the Directive) issued by the European Parliament provides that certain financial conglomerates with regulated entities in the European Union, such as AIG, are
subject to supplementary supervision. Pursuant to the Directive, the Commission Bancaire, the French banking regulator, was appointed as AIG's supervisory coordinator. From February 2007 until March
2010, with the approval of the Commission Bancaire, the OTS acted as AIG's equivalent supervisor, as permitted by the Directive in circumstances in which a financial conglomerate organized outside the
European Union, such as AIG, has proposed to have one of its existing regulators recognized as its coordinator and such regulator's supervision is determined to be equivalent to that required by the
Directive. Since March 2010, AIG has been in discussions with, and has provided information to, the Autorité de Contrôle Prudentiel (formerly, the Commission Bancaire)
and the UK Financial Services Authority regarding the possibility of proposing another of AIG's existing regulators as its equivalent supervisor.

DODD-FRANK WALL STREET REFORM AND CONSUMER PROTECTION ACT

On July 21, 2010, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank) was signed into law.
Dodd-Frank effects comprehensive changes to the regulation of financial services in the United States and will subject AIG to substantial additional federal regulation.
Dodd-Frank is intended to enhance the safety and soundness of U.S. financial institutions and increase public confidence in them. Dodd-Frank directs existing and newly-created
government agencies and oversight bodies to promulgate regulations implementing the law, an

20            AIG 2011 Form 10-K










ongoing
process that has begun and is anticipated to continue over the next few years. While a number of regulations have been adopted, other regulations have only been proposed or have yet to be
proposed. Therefore, AIG cannot predict with certainty the requirements of the regulations ultimately adopted or how or whether Dodd-Frank and such regulations will affect the financial
markets generally; impact AIG's businesses, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition; or require AIG to raise additional capital or result in a downgrade of AIG's credit ratings.

On
January 5, 2012, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the FRB) published for public comment a notice of proposed rulemaking implementing the enhanced
prudential standards and early remediation requirements that will apply to non-bank systemically important financial institutions (SIFIs). If those rules are adopted in the form proposed
and AIG is designated as a non-bank SIFI, AIG would be required, among other things,

•

to comply with FRB regulations relating to capital plans and stress tests and to calculate AIG's minimum
risk-based and leverage capital requirements, each as if it were a bank holding company;

•

to maintain a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of four percent, a total risk-based capital
ratio of eight percent and a Tier 1 leverage ratio of four percent;

•

to maintain a ratio of Tier 1 common equity to risk weighted assets of five percent under both expected and
stressed conditions in order to be able to engage in capital distributions;

•

to comply with additional liquidity-related requirements, such as to produce comprehensive cash flow projections, to
regularly stress test cash flow projections, to maintain a liquidity buffer of highly liquid assets that are unencumbered, to establish and maintain a contingency funding plan for liquidity stress
events, and to establish or maintain limits on potential sources of liquidity risk;

•

not to have aggregate net credit exposure to any single unaffiliated counterparty that exceeds 25 percent of AIG's
consolidated capital stock and surplus, or 10 percent if the counterparty has $500 billion or more in total consolidated assets;

•

to be subject to an annual stress test conducted by the FRB and annual and semi-annual
self-administered stress tests;

•

to be subject to early remediation actions upon occurrence of trigger events (such as failure to maintain the capital that
is commensurate with the level and nature of the risks to which AIG is exposed, or non-compliance with FRB's stress test), which early remediation actions could vary from heightened
supervisory review by the FRB to an FRB-recommended resolution of AIG, based on the seriousness of the trigger events;

•

to maintain a debt-to-equity ratio, measured by "total liabilities" and "total equity capital", of
no more than 15-to-1 upon a determination by the Financial Stability Oversight Council (the Council) that (i) the company poses a grave threat to the financial stability
of the United States and (ii) the imposition of such requirement is necessary to mitigate the risk that such company poses to the financial stability of the United States; and

•

to comply with certain corporate governance requirements, such as additional responsibilities of the board of directors
and the creation of a separate risk committee of the board of directors.

Dodd-Frank's
potential impact on AIG also includes the following:

•The new legislation provides two scenarios in which the Board of Governors of the FRB could become AIG's regulator:
(1) if AIG is recognized as a "savings and loan holding company" as defined by the HOLA and/or (2) if Council designates AIG as a SIFI.•If AIG becomes subject, as a savings and loan holding company, to the examination, enforcement and supervisory authority
of the FRB, the FRB would be required to impose minimum leverage and risk-based capital requirements on AIG and its subsidiaries. AIG cannot predict what capital regulations the FRB would
promulgate under these authorizations, either generally or as applicable to insurance businesses, nor

AIG 2011 Form 10-K            21








can
AIG predict how the FRB would exercise general supervisory authority over AIG. AIG expects, however, that when the Department of the Treasury ceases to own at least 50 percent of the
outstanding shares of AIG Common Stock, AIG will become regulated by the FRB as a savings and loan holding company.

•

If AIG is designated as a SIFI the FRB could (i) limit AIG's ability to merge with, acquire, consolidate with, or
become affiliated with another company, to offer specified financial products or to terminate specified activities; (ii) impose conditions on how we conduct our activities or (iii) with
approval of the Council, and a determination that the foregoing actions are inadequate to mitigate a threat to U.S. financial stability, require AIG to sell or otherwise transfer assets or
off-balance-sheet items to unaffiliated entities.

•

In either scenario, AIG would become subject to stress tests to determine whether, on a consolidated basis, AIG has the
capital necessary to absorb losses due to adverse economic conditions.

•

The Council may recommend that state insurance regulators or other regulators apply new or heightened standards and
safeguards for activities or practices that AIG and other insurers or other financial services companies engage in.

•

In October 2011, federal regulators issued a proposed rule implementing certain provisions in Dodd-Frank
referred to as the "Volcker Rule". Under the proposed rule, if AIG continues to control AIG Federal Savings Bank, AIG and its affiliates would be considered banking entities and would become subject
to the provisions of Dodd-Frank prohibiting, subject to the rule's exceptions, "proprietary trading" and the sponsorship of, or investment in, hedge, private equity or similar funds and
the provision of guarantees related to such activities. Even if AIG no longer controlled an insured depository institution, AIG might still be subject to additional capital and quantitative
limitations under the Volcker Rule. The Volcker Rule, as proposed, contains an exemption for proprietary trading by insurance companies for their general account, but the final breadth and scope of
this exemption is uncertain.

•

Title II of Dodd-Frank provides that a financial company whose largest United States subsidiary is an insurer
may be subject to a special liquidation process outside the federal bankruptcy code. That process is to be administered by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the FDIC) upon a coordinated
determination by the Secretary of the Treasury, the director of the Federal Insurance Office and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, in consultation with the FDIC, that such a
financial company is in default or in danger of default and presents a systemic risk to U.S. financial stability. AIG is a financial company and its largest U.S. subsidiary is an insurer.

•

Dodd-Frank establishes a new framework for regulation of the over-the-counter (OTC)
derivatives markets and certain market participants that could affect various activities of AIG and its insurance subsidiaries, as well as Global Capital Markets. These regulations could impose margin
or collateral requirements on derivative transactions entered into by AIG prior to the passage of Dodd-Frank or intercompany derivative transactions between AIG and one or more of its
affiliates or between affiliates. Any such margin or collateral requirements could adversely affect AIG's liquidity and credit ratings. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and SEC have
published proposed rules governing major swap participants and major security-based swap participants. If AIG or one or more of its subsidiaries meet the tests finally adopted by the CFTC or SEC, AIG
or one or more of its subsidiaries may become subject to derivative transaction clearing, execution and reporting requirements, capital and margin requirements and business conduct rules.

•

Dodd-Frank mandated a study to determine whether stable value contracts should be included in the definition
of "swap." If that study concludes that stable value contracts are swaps, Dodd-Frank authorizes certain federal regulators to determine whether an exemption from the definition of a swap
is appropriate and in the public interest. Certain affiliates of AIG are in or may participate in the stable value contract business. AIG cannot predict what regulations might emanate from the
aforementioned study or be promulgated applicable to this business in the future.

•

Dodd-Frank established a Federal Insurance Office (FIO) within the Department of the Treasury headed by a
director appointed by the Secretary of the Treasury. While not having a general supervisory or regulatory

over the business of insurance, the director of this office performs various functions with respect to insurance (other than health insurance), including serving as a non-voting
member of the Council and participating in the Council's decisions regarding insurers, potentially including AIG, to be designated as a SIFI. The director is also required to conduct a study on how to
modernize and improve the system of insurance regulation in the United States, including by increased national uniformity through either a federal charter or effective action by the states. The FIO
may also recommend enhanced regulations to state insurance regulatory bodies.

•

Dodd-Frank authorizes the FRB to require a savings and loan holding company or a SIFI to place its financial
activities in an intermediate holding company separate from non-financial activities (as defined for purposes of the Bank Holding Company Act) and imposes restrictions on transactions
between the two businesses, which could be burdensome and costly to implement.

•

Dodd-Frank established the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) as an independent agency within the FRB
to regulate consumer financial products and services offered primarily for personal, family or household purposes. Insurance products and services are not within the CFPB's general jurisdiction,
though the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development has since transferred authority to the CFPB to investigate mortgage insurance practices. Broker-dealers and investment advisers are not
subject to the CFPB's jurisdiction when acting in their registered capacity.

•

Title XIV of Dodd-Frank also restricts certain terms for mortgage loans, such as loan fees, prepayment fees
and other charges, and imposes certain duties on a lender to ensure that a borrower can afford to repay the loan.

•

Dodd-Frank seeks to increase efficiency, reduce transaction costs and improve consumer access in the
nonadmitted property and casualty insurance market (excess and surplus lines). AIG expects that these measures will make certain of Chartis' operations within the U.S. more streamlined and efficient,
although they could lead to greater competition in these markets.

•

Dodd-Frank includes various securities law reforms that may affect AIG's business practices and the
liabilities and/or exposures associated therewith, including:•The SEC completed a staff report on registered broker-dealers who provide personalized investment advice to retail
investors, such as certain of SunAmerica's operations. The staff report recommended to Congress a uniform fiduciary standard of conduct for broker-dealers and investment advisers. The SEC may also
require broker-dealers selling proprietary or a limited range of products to make certain disclosures and obtain customer consents or acknowledgements.•The SEC and other regulators proposed regulations requiring the originator of certain asset-backed securities to retain at
least five percent of the credit risk of securities sold, which, if adopted, may apply to activities of subsidiaries of AIG as part of their funding activities in the future.

Dodd-Frank
imposes various assessments on financial companies, including, as applicable to AIG, ex-post assessments to provide funds necessary to repay any
borrowing and to cover the costs of any special resolution of a financial company conducted under Title II (although the regulatory authority would have to take account of the amounts paid by AIG into
state guaranty funds). AIG cannot predict the potential effects the new legislation will have on its organizational structure, financial condition or results of operations. However, it is possible
that such effect could be materially adverse. See Item 1A. Risk Factors — Regulation for additional information.

In
addition to the adoption of Dodd-Frank in the United States, regulators and lawmakers around the world are actively reviewing the causes of the financial crisis and taking
steps to avoid similar problems in the future. The Financial Stability Board (FSB), consisting of representatives of national financial authorities of the G20 nations, has issued a series of
frameworks and recommendations intended to produce significant changes in how financial companies, particularly systematically important financial institutions, should be regulated. These frameworks
and recommendations address such issues as financial group supervision, capital and solvency standards, systemic economic risk, corporate governance including compensation, and a host of related
issues associated with responses to the financial crisis. The FSB has directed the International Association of Insurance Supervisors (the

AIG 2011 Form 10-K            23










IAIS,
headquartered in Basel, Switzerland) to create standards relative to these areas and incorporate them within that body's Insurance Core Principles. IAIS Insurance Core Principles form the
baseline threshold for how countries' financial services regulatory efforts are measured relative to the insurance sector. That measurement is made by periodic Financial Sector Assessment Program
(FSAP) reviews conducted by the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund and the reports thereon spur the development of country-specific additional or amended regulatory changes. Lawmakers and
regulatory authorities in a number of jurisdictions in which AIG's subsidiaries conduct business have already begun implementing legislative and regulatory changes consistent with these
recommendations, including proposals governing consolidated regulation of insurance holdings companies by the Financial Services Agency in Japan, financial and banking regulation adopted in France and
compensation
regulations proposed or adopted by the financial regulators in Germany and the United Kingdom Financial Services Authority.

AIG
cannot predict whether these actions will become effective or the effect they may have on the financial markets or on AIG's business, results of operations, cash flows, financial
condition and credit ratings.

OTHER REGULATORY DEVELOPMENTS

AIG's operations are subject to regulatory supervision and the possibility of intervention. In light of AIG's liquidity problems beginning in the
third quarter of 2008, AIG and its regulated subsidiaries have been subject to intense review and supervision around the world. Regulators have taken significant steps to protect the businesses of the
entities they regulate. These steps have included:

•restricting or prohibiting the payment of dividends to AIG Parent and its subsidiaries;•restricting or prohibiting other payments to AIG Parent and its subsidiaries;•requesting additional capital contributions from AIG Parent;•requesting that intercompany reinsurance reserves be covered by assets locally;•restricting the business in which the subsidiaries may engage;•requiring pre-approval of all proposed transactions between the regulated subsidiaries and AIG Parent or any
affiliate; and•requiring more frequent reporting, including with respect to capital and liquidity positions.

Many
of these prohibitions and restrictions have been relaxed. However, AIG continues to be subject to heightened regulatory scrutiny.

Legislation
in the European Union could also affect AIG's international insurance operations. The Solvency II Directive (2009/138/EEC), which was adopted on November 25, 2009 and
is expected to become effective in January 2014 (Solvency II), reforms the insurance industry's solvency framework, including minimum capital and solvency requirements, governance requirements, risk
management and public reporting standards. The impact on AIG will depend on whether the U.S. insurance regulatory regime is deemed "equivalent" to Solvency II; if the U.S. insurance regulatory regime
is not equivalent, then AIG as a group could be required to be supervised under Solvency II standards. Whether the U.S. insurance regulatory regime will be deemed "equivalent" is still under
consideration by European authorities and remains uncertain, so AIG is not currently able to predict the impact of Solvency II.

AIG
expects that the regulations applicable to it and its regulated entities will continue to evolve for the foreseeable future.

REGULATION OF INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES

Certain states require registration and periodic reporting by insurance companies that are licensed in such states and are controlled by other
corporations. Applicable legislation typically requires periodic disclosure concerning the corporation that controls the registered insurer and the other companies in the holding company system and
prior approval of intercorporate services and transfers of assets, including in some instances payment of dividends

24            AIG 2011 Form 10-K










by
the insurance subsidiary, within the holding company system. AIG's subsidiaries are registered under such legislation in those states that have such requirements.

AIG's
insurance subsidiaries, in common with other insurers, are subject to regulation and supervision by the states and by other jurisdictions in which they do business. Within the
United States, the method of such regulation varies but generally has its source in statutes that delegate regulatory and supervisory powers to an insurance official. The regulation and supervision
relate primarily to the financial condition of the insurers and their corporate conduct and market conduct activities. This includes approval of policy forms and rates, the standards of solvency that
must be met and maintained, including with respect to risk-based capital, the licensing of insurers and their agents, the nature of and limitations on investments, restrictions on the size
of risks that may be insured under a single policy, deposits of securities for the benefit of policyholders, requirements for acceptability of reinsurers, periodic examinations of the affairs of
insurance companies, the form and content of reports of financial condition required to be filed and reserves for unearned premiums, losses and other purposes. In general, such regulation is for the
protection of policyholders rather than the equity owners of these companies.

AIG
has taken various steps to enhance the capital positions of the domestic Chartis and SunAmerica companies. AIG entered into capital maintenance agreements with these companies that
set forth procedures through which AIG has provided, and expects to continue to provide, capital support. Also, in order to allow the domestic Chartis and SunAmerica companies to record as an admitted
asset at December 31, 2011 certain reinsurance ceded to reinsurers, which has the effect of maintaining the level of the statutory surplus of such companies, AIG obtained and entered into
reimbursement agreements for approximately $1.45 billion and $800 million of letters of credit issued by several commercial banks in favor of certain Chartis and SunAmerica companies,
respectively.

In
the U.S., the Risk-Based Capital (RBC) formula is designed to measure the adequacy of an insurer's statutory surplus in relation to the risks inherent in its business. The
RBC Model Law, which allows states to act upon the results of RBC calculations, provides for four incremental levels of regulatory action regarding insurers whose RBC calculations fall below specific
thresholds. Those levels of action range from the requirement to submit a plan describing how an insurer would regain a calculated RBC ratio above the respective threshold through a mandatory
regulatory takeover of the company. The action thresholds are based on RBC levels that are calculated so that a company, subject to such actions, is solvent but its future solvency is in doubt without
some type of corrective action. The RBC formula computes a risk-adjusted surplus level by applying discrete factors to various asset, premium and reserve items. These factors are developed
to be risk-sensitive so that higher factors are applied to items exposed to greater risk.

The
statutory surplus of each of AIG's U.S.-based life and property and casualty insurance subsidiaries exceeded RBC minimum required levels as of December 31, 2011.

To
the extent that any of AIG's insurance entities would fall below prescribed levels of statutory surplus, it would be AIG's intention to provide appropriate capital or other types of
support to that entity, under formal support agreements or CMAs or otherwise. For additional details regarding CMAs that AIG has entered into with its insurance subsidiaries, see Item 7.
MD&A — Liquidity of Parent and Subsidiaries — Chartis, and Liquidity of Parent and Subsidiaries.

There
are a number of proposals to amend state insurance laws and regulations in ways that could affect AIG and its subsidiaries. The National Association of Insurance Commissioners
(NAIC) has recently adopted or amended model laws on holding company regulation that would provide for supervision of insurers at the corporate group level. Although these changes are only beginning
to be adopted by individual state regulators, it can be expected
that most will ultimately adopt them in some form. The various proposals to implement group supervision include:

•uniform standards for insurer corporate governance;•group-wide supervision of insurance holding companies;•adjustments to RBC calculations to account for group-wide risks; and•additional regulatory and disclosure requirements for insurance holding companies.

AIG 2011 Form 10-K            25








Additionally,
the NAIC has undertaken the Solvency Modernization Initiative (SMI) which focuses on a review of insurance solvency regulations throughout the U.S. financial regulatory
system and will lead to a set of long-term solvency modernization goals. SMI is broad in scope, but the NAIC has stated that its focus will include the U.S. solvency framework, group
solvency issues, capital requirements, international accounting and regulatory standards, reinsurance and corporate governance.

AIG
cannot predict the potential effect that any new regulations would have on AIG's insurance subsidiaries or on AIG's business, results of operations, cash flows or financial
condition.

REGULATION OF DOMESTIC SUBSIDIARIES IN FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS

A substantial portion of Chartis' business is conducted in foreign countries. The degree of regulation and supervision in foreign jurisdictions
varies. Generally, AIG, as well as the underwriting companies operating in such jurisdictions, must satisfy local regulatory requirements. Licenses issued by foreign authorities to AIG subsidiaries
are subject to modification or revocation by such authorities, and these subsidiaries could be prevented from conducting business in certain of the jurisdictions where they currently operate.

In
addition to licensing requirements, AIG's foreign operations are also regulated in various jurisdictions with respect to currency, policy language and terms, advertising, amount and
type of security deposits, amount and type of reserves, amount and type of capital to be held, amount and type of local investment and the share of profits to be returned to policyholders on
participating policies. Some foreign countries regulate rates on various types of policies. Certain countries have established reinsurance institutions, wholly or partially owned by the local
government, to which admitted insurers are obligated to cede a portion of their business on terms that may not always allow foreign insurers, including AIG subsidiaries, full compensation. In some
countries, regulations governing constitution of technical reserves and remittance balances may hinder remittance of profits and repatriation of assets.

See
Item 7. MD&A — Capital Resources and Liquidity — Regulation and Supervision and Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

COMPETITION

AIG's businesses operate in highly competitive environments, both domestically and overseas. Principal sources of competition are insurance
companies, banks, investment banks and other non-bank financial institutions. AIG considers its principal competitors to be other large multi-national insurance organizations.

The
insurance industry in particular is highly competitive. Within the United States, Chartis subsidiaries compete with approximately 3,200 other stock companies, specialty insurance
organizations, mutual companies and other underwriting organizations. SunAmerica subsidiaries compete in the United States with approximately 2,000 life insurance companies and other participants in
related financial services fields. Overseas, AIG's subsidiaries compete for business with the foreign insurance operations of large U.S. insurers and with global insurance groups and local companies
in particular areas in which they are active.

As
a result of the reduction of the credit ratings of AIG and its subsidiaries, AIG's businesses have faced and continue to face intense competition to retain existing customers and to
maintain business with existing customers and counterparties at historical levels. General insurance and life insurance companies compete through a combination of risk acceptance criteria, product
pricing, and terms and conditions. Retirement services companies compete through crediting rates and the issuance of guaranteed benefits.

For
a further discussion of the risks relating to retaining existing customers, soliciting new customers and retaining key employees, see Item 1A. Risk
Factors — Competition.
