Item 1.    Business

American International Group, Inc. (AIG) is a leading international insurance organization serving customers in more than
130 countries. AIG companies serve commercial, institutional and individual customers through one of the most extensive worldwide property-casualty networks of any insurer. In addition, AIG
companies are leading providers of life insurance and retirement services in the United States. AIG Common Stock, par value $2.50 per share (AIG Common Stock), is listed on the New York Stock
Exchange, as well as the stock exchanges in Ireland and Tokyo.

Throughout
this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the terms AIG, the Company, we, us and our are used to collectively refer to AIG, a Delaware corporation, and its
consolidated subsidiaries. The term AIG Parent refers solely to American International Group, Inc., a Delaware corporation, and not to any of its consolidated subsidiaries.

In
September 2008, liquidity issues resulted in AIG seeking and receiving governmental support through a credit facility from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York (the FRBNY, and
such credit facility, the FRBNY Credit Facility) and funding from the United States Department of the Treasury (Department of the Treasury) through the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP). On
January 14, 2011, AIG was recapitalized (the Recapitalization) and the FRBNY Credit Facility was repaid and terminated through a series of transactions that resulted in the Department of the
Treasury becoming AIG's majority shareholder with ownership of approximately 92 percent of AIG's outstanding common stock. AIG understands that, subject to market conditions, the Department of
the Treasury intends to dispose of its ownership interest over time, and AIG has granted certain registration rights to the Department of the Treasury to facilitate such sales. See Management's
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Capital Resources and Liquidity and Notes 1 and 26 to the Consolidated Financial Statements
for further discussion of the governmental support provided to AIG and the Recapitalization.

Chartis Operations

Chartis is a major global property and casualty insurance franchise built over 90 years and serving more than 45 million
clients. Chartis wrote $31.6 billion in net premiums in 2010. Chartis is diversified both in terms of classes of businesses and geographic locations. Chartis U.S. writes commercial and
consumer products throughout the U.S. and Canada. Chartis International writes commercial and consumer products outside the U.S. and
Canada. For the year ended December 31, 2010, Chartis U.S. and Chartis International comprised approximately 55 percent and 45 percent, respectively, of the Chartis business,
measured by net premiums written.

Chartis'
combination of global reach and scale, extensive range of products and services, diversified, multi-channel distribution network and strong capital positions it to meet the
demands of a broad range of customers worldwide.

Chartis
is diversified both in terms of classes of business and geographic locations. During 2010, 6 percent and 5 percent of its direct premiums written (gross
premiums less return premiums and cancellations, excluding insurance assumed and before deducting reinsurance ceded) were written in the states of California and New York, respectively, and
13 percent and 8 percent in Japan and the United Kingdom, respectively. No other state or foreign jurisdiction accounted for more than five percent of such premiums.

The composition of Chartis net premiums written in 2010 is as follows:

Business Strategy

Chartis
leverages its global knowledge and experience in the property and casualty markets by competing in selected commercial lines such as executive
liability/ director's and officer's liability (D&O), large risk management programs and commercial property. In recent years, Chartis has repositioned its Commercial Lines business mix by increasingly
complementing its portfolio of Fortune 1000 and multinational clients with small-and medium-sized enterprises. Its global geographic footprint and local presence enable Chartis to provide
multinational customers with insurance programs across borders and continents.

Chartis
also has a strong and growing consumer business. The consumer business underwrites lines such as Accident & Health, property, auto and liability for
high-net-worth individuals, extended warranty and travel insurance products and services.

Chartis'
scale and diverse product offerings allow it to pursue cross-selling opportunities among its businesses. For example, Chartis can provide primary casualty coverage for an
account as part of its commercial casualty unit, underwrite that account's board of directors through its executive liability business and insure the personal needs of its management through its
Private Client Group as part of its Consumer segment.

Client
Approach

Chartis
clients benefit from its substantial underwriting capacity, long-term commitment to the markets and clients it serves and tradition of
product innovation and expertise. In 2010, Chartis introduced more than 200 products and services worldwide.

Capital
Deployment

Chartis'
scale and geographical diversification also allow the business to strategically deploy capital to pursue the more attractive long-term
opportunities around the world. Chartis regularly reviews and adjusts its business mix with the goals of aligning risk profile with risk tolerance and meeting capital management objectives.

Chartis
U.S.

The
Chartis U.S. companies comprise the largest U.S.-domiciled commercial property and casualty group by 2010 net premiums written. Chartis U.S. distributes
its products through independent retail and wholesale brokers, and writes business on both an admitted and surplus line basis. Chartis U.S. business in the United States and Canada is conducted
through American Home, National Union, Lexington, the market leader in surplus lines, and certain other property-casualty insurance company subsidiaries of Chartis U.S. Inc.

Chartis
U.S.'s business strategy focuses on growing high-margin, less capital intensive lines of business, including segments of consumer lines, specialty markets and its
multinational business, while leveraging its distribution relationships, innovation, national footprint and extensive product offering.

Chartis
U.S. commercial lines include:

Casualty:Includes general liability, commercial automobile liability, excess casualty and workers' compensation coverages. Also includes insurance
and risk management programs for large corporate customers and other customized structured insurance products.

Property:Includes industrial and commercial property insurance products, which cover exposures to man-made and natural disasters.

Specialty:Includes aviation, marine and energy, environmental, kidnap-ransom, export credit and political risk coverages. It also offers various
forms of professional liability insurance including D&O, fidelity, employment practices, fiduciary liability and errors and omissions coverages. Chartis U.S. also offers products and services to
U.S.-based multinational clients doing business overseas and to foreign corporations doing business in the U.S. as part of its Worldsource business.

Chartis
International

Chartis
International is the largest U.S.-based property and casualty insurer in Europe, the largest foreign insurance company in Japan and China, and an
established leader in other developing markets such as India, Korea, Argentina and Russia. Chartis International is also a market leader in aerospace, marine, energy and financial lines.

Chartis
International's geographic footprint, its history in markets and its access to local resources allow it to better serve global clients and to take advantage of new and emerging
opportunities around the world.

Chartis
International writes commercial (Casualty, Property and Specialty) and consumer (A&H, Personal and Life) lines through a network of agencies, branches and foreign-based insurance
subsidiaries. Chartis International uses various marketing methods and multiple distribution channels to write both commercial and consumer lines of insurance with refinements for local laws, customs
and needs. Given its extensive worldwide presence, Chartis International organizes itself into three broad regions: the Far East, Europe and Growth Economies (which primarily include Asia Pacific, the
Middle East and Latin America).

Chartis
International's business strategy, aided by its competitive position in the international market and ability to write both commercial and consumer lines, is focused on growing
its commercial business in emerging economies and consumer lines in many parts of the world.

The
acquisition of a controlling stake in Fuji Fire & Marine Insurance Company Limited (Fuji) in 2010 was consistent with this strategy. The acquisition of Fuji enhances
Chartis' position in the substantial Japanese insurance market and provides a new distribution channel. As a result of this transaction, Chartis International has solidified its position as the
largest foreign-owned property and casualty insurance group at December 31, 2010.

Discussion
and Analysis of Consolidated Loss Reserve Development

The
net liability for unpaid claims and claims adjustment expense (net loss reserves) shown in the following tables represents management's best estimate of
future payments for covered losses, which is derived from the accumulation of estimates for reported losses (case basis reserves) and provisions for losses incurred but not reported (IBNR), both
reduced by applicable reinsurance recoverable and the discount for future expected investment income, where permitted. Net losses and loss expenses are charged to income as incurred. For a discussion
of our loss reserve experience in 2010, see Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Results of Operations —
Segment Results — Chartis Operations — Liability for Unpaid Claims and Claims Adjustment Expense.

The
loss reserves established with respect to foreign business are set and monitored in the currencies in which payment is expected to be made. Therefore, no assumption is included for
changes in exchange rates. See Note 2(v) to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

A
significant portion of Chartis' business is in the commercial casualty class, which tends to involve longer periods of time for the reporting and settlement of claims and may increase
the risk and uncertainty with respect to Chartis' loss reserve development.

Management
reviews the adequacy of established net loss reserves utilizing a number of analytical reserve development techniques. Through the use of these techniques, management monitors
the adequacy of AIG's established reserves and determines appropriate assumptions for inflation and other factors influencing loss costs. Also, analysis of emerging specific development patterns, such
as case reserve redundancies or deficiencies and IBNR emergence, allows management to determine any required adjustments.

The
"Analysis of Consolidated Loss Reserve Development" table presents the development of net loss reserves for calendar years 2000 through 2010. Immediately following this table is a
second table that presents all data on a basis that excludes asbestos and environmental net loss reserve development. The opening reserves held are shown at the top of the table for each
year-end date. The amount of loss reserve discount included in the opening reserve at each date is shown immediately below the reserves held for each year. The undiscounted reserve at each
date is equal to the sum of the discount and the reserve held.

The
upper half of the table presents the cumulative amounts paid during successive years related to the undiscounted opening loss reserves. For example, in the table that excludes
asbestos and environmental losses, with respect to the net loss reserve of $35.56 billion at December 31, 2003, by the end of 2010 (seven years later) $43.18 billion had actually
been paid in settlement of this net loss reserve. In addition, as reflected in the lower section of the table, the original undiscounted reserve of $37.08 billion was re-estimated
to be $55.75 billion at December 31, 2010. This increase from the original estimate generally results from a combination of a number of factors, including claims being settled for larger
amounts than originally estimated. The original estimates are also increased or decreased

as
more information becomes known about the individual claims and overall claim frequency and severity patterns. The redundancy (deficiency) depicted in the table, for any particular calendar year,
presents the aggregate change in estimates over the period of years subsequent to the calendar year reflected at the top of the respective column heading. For example, the deficiency of
$2.68 billion at December 31, 2010 related to December 31, 2009 net losses and loss expense reserves of $69.24 billion represents the cumulative amount by which reserves in
2009 and prior years have developed unfavorably during 2010.

The
bottom of each table below presents the remaining undiscounted and discounted net loss reserves for each year. For example, in the table that excludes asbestos and environmental
losses, for the 2002 year-end, the remaining undiscounted reserves held at December 31, 2010 are $11.04 billion, with a corresponding discounted net reserve of
$10.08 billion.

For
a sensitivity analysis of loss reserves held at December 31, 2010, see Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations — Critical Accounting Estimates — Liability for Unpaid Claims and Claims Adjustment Expense.

*During 2009, Transatlantic was deconsolidated and 21st Century and HSB were sold. The sales and deconsolidation are reflected in the table above as a
reduction in December 31, 2009 net reserves of $9.6 billion and as an $8.6 billion increase in paid losses for the years 1999 through 2008 to remove the reserves for these
divested entities from the ending balance.

The Liability for unpaid claims and claims adjustment expense as reported in AIG's Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2010 differs
from the total reserve reported in the Annual Statements filed with state insurance departments and, where appropriate, with foreign regulatory authorities. The differences at December 31, 2010
relate primarily to reserves for certain foreign operations not required to be reported in the United States for statutory reporting purposes. Further, statutory practices in the United States require
reserves to be shown net of applicable reinsurance recoverable. In addition, AIG's Consolidated Balance Sheet and the amounts in the tables above are reflected net of intercompany transactions,
whereas statutory financial statements include reserves for intercompany transactions.

Gross
loss reserves are calculated without reduction for reinsurance recoverable and represent the accumulation of estimates for reported losses and IBNR. Management reviews the adequacy
of established gross loss reserves in the manner previously described for net loss reserves.

Reinsurance Activities

Chartis subsidiaries operate worldwide primarily by underwriting and accepting risks for their direct account on a gross line basis and
subsequently reinsuring on either an individual risk or an aggregate basis to the extent those risks exceed the desired retention level.

For
a further discussion of reinsurance, see Item 1A. Risk Factors — Reinsurance; and Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
and Results of Operations — Risk Management — Insurance Risk Management — Reinsurance.

Insurance Investment Activities

A significant portion of the revenues of Chartis and SunAmerica operations are derived from AIG's insurance investment activities. As
insurance companies, Chartis and SunAmerica generally receive premiums and deposits well in advance of paying covered claims or benefits. In the intervening periods, these premiums and deposits are
invested to generate net investment income and fee income that is available to pay claims or benefits.

AIG's
worldwide insurance investment policy places primary emphasis on investments in fixed income securities of corporations, municipal bonds and government issuances in all of its
portfolios, and, to a lesser extent, investments in high-yield bonds, common stocks, real estate, hedge funds and other alternative investments.

The
majority of assets backing insurance liabilities at AIG consist of intermediate and long duration fixed maturity securities. In the case of SunAmerica, the fundamental investment
strategy is, as nearly as is practicable, to match the duration characteristics of the liabilities with assets of comparable duration. Fixed maturity securities held by the insurance companies
included in Chartis U.S. historically have consisted primarily of laddered holdings of tax-exempt municipal bonds, which provided attractive after-tax returns and limited
credit risk. In order to meet the Chartis U.S. current risk/return and tax objectives, the domestic property and casualty companies have begun to shift investment allocations away from
tax-exempt municipal bonds towards taxable instruments which meet the companies' liquidity, duration and quality objectives as well as current risk-return and tax objectives.
Fixed maturity securities held by Chartis International companies consist primarily of intermediate duration high-grade securities.

See
Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Investments — Investment Strategy for
discussion of AIG's investment strategy.

The following table summarizes the investment results of AIG's insurance operations, excluding the results of discontinued operations:

Aircraft
Leasing

International
Lease Finance Corporation (ILFC), one of the world's leading aircraft lessors, acquires commercial jet aircraft from various manufacturers and
other parties and leases those aircraft to airlines around the world.

As
of December 31, 2010, ILFC managed a lease portfolio of over 1,000 aircraft, including an owned fleet of 933 aircraft with a net book value of approximately
$38.5 billion. Additionally, ILFC had contracted with Boeing and Airbus to purchase 115 new aircraft through 2019, with an estimated purchase price of approximately $13.5 billion.

ILFC
believes its scale, the breadth and mix of its aircraft portfolio and its long-standing relationships with a global customer base that includes the majority of the
world's leading airlines allow it to lease aircraft under favorable terms and maximize utilization.

As
part of its ongoing fleet strategy, ILFC may pursue potential aircraft sales or opportunities to sell parts of aircraft. In evaluating its fleet strategies, ILFC is balancing the need
for funding with the long-term value of holding aircraft and other financing alternatives.

Capital
Markets

AIGFP
has continued to unwind its portfolios, including those associated with credit protection written through credit default swaps on super senior risk
tranches of diversified pools of loans and debt securities. As a consequence of its wind-down strategy, AIGFP is entering into new derivative transactions only to hedge its current
portfolio, reduce risk and hedge the currency, interest rate and other market
risks associated with its affiliated businesses. See Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Liquidity of Parent and
Subsidiaries — Financial Services — Capital Markets Wind-down. Prior to the wind-down, AIGFP engaged as principal in a wide variety of
financial transactions, including standard and customized financial products involving commodities, credit, currencies, energy, equities and interest rates.

Historically,
AIGFP derived a significant portion of its revenues from hedged financial positions entered into in connection with counterparty transactions. Prior to the
wind-down, AIGFP also participated as a dealer in a wide variety of financial derivatives transactions.

Other Operations

AIG's Other operations include results from Parent & Other operations, after allocations to AIG's business segments, Mortgage
Guaranty operations, Asset Management operations and results from those divested businesses not included in Discontinued operations.

Parent &
Other

AIG's
Parent & Other operations consist primarily of interest expense, intercompany interest income that is eliminated in consolidation, restructuring
costs, expenses of corporate staff not attributable to specific reportable segments, expenses related to efforts to improve internal controls and the financial and operating platforms, corporate
initiatives, certain compensation plan expenses, corporate level net realized capital gains and losses, certain litigation related charges and net gains and losses on sale of divested businesses and
properties that did not qualify for discontinued operations accounting treatment. In addition, fair value gains or losses on AIG's remaining interest in AIA and in the MetLife, Inc. (MetLife)
securities received as consideration from the sale of ALICO are recorded as Net investment income and are included in Parent & Other operations.

Mortgage
Guaranty

The
main business of the subsidiaries of UGC is the issuance of residential mortgage guaranty insurance, both domestically and internationally, that covers
mortgage lenders for the first loss for credit defaults on high loan-to-value conventional first-lien mortgages for the purchase or refinance of one- to
four-family residences.

American International Group, Inc., and Subsidiaries



UGC
previously insured second-lien and private student loans, but ceased insuring new business in these products in 2008, although certain of the second-lien policies are
subject to reinstatement.

Mortgage
Guaranty is seeking to take advantage of its risk-based pricing approach, expand into new attractive markets and manage its legacy exposures through risk mitigation
strategies.

Asset
Management Operations

AIG's
Asset Management operations include the results of the Direct Investment business and the Institutional Asset Management business.

On
March 26, 2010, AIG completed the sale of its third-party asset management business. The results of operations through the closing of the sale are included in the Institutional
Asset Management results. Subsequent to the sale, Institutional Asset Management derives the majority of its revenues from providing asset management services to AIG and its subsidiaries and are
eliminated in consolidation.

Direct
Investment Business

The
Direct Investment business includes results of AIG Global Real Estate, the Matched Investment Program (MIP), AIG's historical program to generate spread
income from investments yielding returns greater than AIG's cost of funds, and certain non-derivative assets and liabilities of AIGFP. The MIP assets and liabilities and the AIGFP
portfolio are being managed as a single portfolio to better match maturities of assets and liabilities. AIG Global Real Estate is selling, restructuring or otherwise divesting its assets and reducing
its funding obligations. Direct Investment business operating results are significantly impacted by performance in the credit, equity, interest rate, foreign exchange and real estate markets.

Institutional
Asset Management Business

AIG's
Institutional Asset Management business is conducted through AIG Global Asset Management Holdings Corp. and its subsidiaries, including AIG
Markets, Inc. (AIG Markets). AIG Markets acts as a derivative intermediary transacting with AIG, its subsidiaries and third parties.

Divested
Businesses

Divested
businesses include the historical results of divested entities that did not meet the criteria for discontinued operations accounting treatment as well
as certain immaterial non-core businesses currently in run-off. Divested businesses include the historical results of AIA through October 29, 2010 and AIG's remaining
consumer finance business, discussed below. In the third quarter of 2010 AIG completed an initial public offering of ordinary shares of AIA; upon completion of the initial public offering, AIG owned
approximately 33 percent of the outstanding shares of AIA. Based on AIG's continuing involvement with AIA, as a result of its ownership of 33 percent of AIA's shares and board
representation, AIA is not presented as a discontinued operation.

Discontinued
Operations

Discontinued
operations include the results of ALICO, AIG Star, AIG Edison, Nan Shan and AGF. In the fourth quarter of 2010 AIG closed the sales of ALICO and
AGF, and on February 1, 2011 AIG closed the sale of AIG Star and AIG Edison. On January 12, 2011, AIG entered into an agreement to sell Nan Shan, and expects to close the sale within the
next 12 months. See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on discontinued operations.

Additionally,
following the classification of AGF as a discontinued operation in the third quarter of 2010 (see Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements), AIG's remaining
consumer finance business, which is conducted through the AIG Federal Savings Bank and the Consumer Finance Group in Poland, is now reported in AIG's Other operations category as part of Divested
businesses.

AIG 2010 Form 10-K            17








American International Group, Inc., and Subsidiaries

Locations of Certain Assets

As of December 31, 2010, approximately 25 percent of the consolidated assets of AIG were located outside the U.S. and
Canada, including $3.6 billion of cash and securities on deposit with regulatory authorities in those locations. Operations outside the U.S. and Canada and assets held abroad may be adversely
affected by political developments in foreign countries, including tax changes, nationalization and changes in regulatory policy, as well as by consequence of hostilities and unrest. The risks of such
occurrences and their overall effect upon AIG vary from country to country and cannot easily be predicted. If expropriation or nationalization does occur, AIG's policy is to take all appropriate
measures to seek recovery of any affected assets. Certain of the countries in which AIG's business is conducted have currency restrictions that generally cause a delay in a company's ability to
repatriate assets and profits. See also Item 1A. Risk Factors — Foreign Operations and Notes 2 and 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Regulation

AIG's operations around the world are subject to regulation by many different types of regulatory authorities, including insurance,
securities, investment advisory, banking and thrift regulators in the United States and abroad.

Supervisory
Coordinator

In
1999, AIG became a unitary savings and loan holding company within the meaning of the Home Owners' Loan Act (HOLA) when the U.S. Office of Thrift
Supervision (OTS) granted AIG approval to organize AIG Federal Savings Bank. Until March 2010, AIG was subject to OTS regulation, examination, supervision and reporting requirements.

Under
prior law, a unitary savings and loan holding company, such as AIG, was not restricted as to the types of business in which it could engage, provided that its savings association
subsidiary continued to be a qualified thrift lender. The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 (GLBA) provides that no company may acquire control of an OTS-regulated institution after
May 4, 1999 unless it engages only in the financial activities permitted for financial holding companies under the law or for multiple savings and loan holding companies. The GLBA, however,
grandfathered the unrestricted authority for activities with respect to a unitary savings and loan holding company existing prior to May 4, 1999, so long as its savings association subsidiary
continues to be a qualified thrift lender under the HOLA. As a unitary savings and loan holding company whose application was pending as of May 4, 1999, AIG is grandfathered under the GLBA and
generally is not restricted under existing laws as to the types of business activities in which it may engage, provided that AIG Federal Savings Bank continues to be a qualified thrift lender under
the HOLA.

Directive
2002/87/EC (Directive) issued by the European Parliament provides that certain financial conglomerates with regulated entities in the European Union, such as AIG, are subject
to supplementary supervision. Pursuant to the Directive, the Commission Bancaire, the French banking regulator, was appointed as AIG's supervisory coordinator. From February 2007 until March 2010,
with the approval of the Commission Bancaire, OTS acted as AIG's equivalent supervisor, as permitted by the Directive in circumstances in which a financial conglomerate organized outside the European
Union, such as AIG, has proposed to have one of its existing regulators recognized as its coordinator and such regulator's supervision is determined to be equivalent to that required by the Directive.
Since March 2010, AIG has been in discussions with, and has provided information to, the Autorité de Contrôle Prudentiel (formerly, the Commission Bancaire) and the UK
Financial Services Authority regarding the possibility of proposing another of AIG's existing regulators as its equivalent supervisor.

Dodd-Frank
Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act

On
July 21, 2010, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank) was signed into law.
Dodd-Frank effects comprehensive changes to the regulation of financial services in the United States and will subject AIG to substantial additional federal regulation.
Dodd-Frank is intended to enhance the safety and soundness of U.S. financial institutions and increase public confidence in them. Dodd-Frank directs existing and newly-created
government agencies and oversight bodies to promulgate regulations implementing the law, an

18            AIG 2010 Form 10-K








American International Group, Inc., and Subsidiaries



ongoing
process anticipated to continue over the next few years. Many of the regulations must be adopted before July 16, 2011. AIG cannot predict with certainty the requirements of the
regulations ultimately adopted or how or whether Dodd-Frank and such regulations will affect the financial markets generally; impact AIG's businesses, results of operations, cash flows or
financial condition; or require AIG to raise additional capital or result in a downgrade of AIG's credit ratings.

Dodd-Frank's
potential impact on AIG includes the following:

•

The new legislation provides two scenarios in which the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (FRB) could
become AIG's regulator: (1) if AIG is recognized as a "savings and loan holding company" as defined by the Home Owners' Loan Act (HOLA); and/or (2) if the newly created systemic risk
regulator — the Financial Stability Oversight Council (Council) — designates AIG as a company whose material financial distress, or whose nature, scope, size,
scale, concentration, interconnectedness or mix of activities, could pose a threat to the financial stability of the United States (a Designated Financial Company).

•

If AIG becomes subject, as a savings and loan holding company, to the examination, enforcement and supervisory authority
of the FRB, the FRB would be required to impose minimum leverage and risk-based capital requirements on AIG and its subsidiaries. AIG cannot predict what capital regulations the FRB would
promulgate under these authorizations, either generally or as applicable to insurance businesses, nor can AIG predict how the FRB would exercise general supervisory authority over AIG. If designated
as a Designated Financial Company, AIG would become subject to stricter prudential standards not yet specified, including stricter requirements and limitations relating to risk-based
capital, leverage, liquidity and credit exposure, as well as overall risk management requirements, management interlock prohibitions, a new early remediation process and a requirement to maintain a
plan for rapid and orderly dissolution in the event of severe financial distress.

•

If AIG is designated as a Designated Financial Company and determined to be a grave threat to U.S. financial stability, it
would be required to maintain a debt-to-equity ratio of no more than 15:1, and the FRB could (i) limit AIG's ability to merge with, acquire, consolidate with, or become
affiliated with another company, to offer specified financial products or to terminate specified activities; (ii) impose conditions on how we conduct our activities or (iii) with
approval of the Council, and a determination that the foregoing actions are inadequate to mitigate a threat to U.S. financial stability, require AIG to sell or otherwise transfer assets or
off-balance-sheet items to unaffiliated entities.

•

In either scenario, AIG may become subject to stress tests to determine whether, on a consolidated basis, AIG has the
capital necessary to absorb losses due to adverse economic conditions. AIG cannot predict how the stress tests would be designed or conducted or whether the results thereof would cause AIG to alter
its business practices or affect the perceptions of regulators, rating agencies, customers, counterparties or investors about AIG's financial strength.

•

The Council may recommend that state insurance regulators or other regulators apply new or heightened standards and
safeguards for activities or practices that AIG and other insurers or other financial services companies engage in.

•

If AIG is considered a banking entity for purposes of certain provisions in Dodd-Frank referred to as the "Volcker Rule"
AIG would become subject to the provisions of Dodd-Frank prohibiting, subject to the rule's exceptions, "proprietary trading" and the sponsorship of, or investment in, hedge, private
equity or similar funds. Even if AIG no longer controlled an insured depository institution, AIG might still be subject to additional capital and quantitative limitations under the Volcker Rule.

•

Title II of Dodd-Frank provides that a financial company whose largest United States subsidiary is an insurer
may be subject to a special liquidation process outside the federal bankruptcy code. That process is to be administered by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) upon a coordinated
determination by the Secretary of the Treasury, the director of the Federal Insurance Office and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, in consultation with the FDIC, that such a
financial company is in default or in

AIG 2010 Form 10-K            19








American International Group, Inc., and Subsidiaries

danger
of default and presents a systemic risk to U.S. financial stability. AIG is a financial company and its largest U.S. subsidiary is an insurer.

•

Dodd-Frank establishes a new framework for regulation of the over-the-counter (OTC)
derivatives markets and certain market participants that could affect various activities of AIG and its insurance subsidiaries, as well as Capital Markets. These regulations could impose margin or
collateral requirements on derivative transactions entered into by AIG prior to the passage of Dodd-Frank or intercompany derivative transactions between AIG and one or more of its
affiliates or between affiliates. Any such margin or collateral requirements could adversely affect AIG's liquidity and credit ratings. The CFTC and SEC have published proposed rules governing major
swap participants and major security-based swap participants. If AIG or one or more of its subsidiaries meet the tests finally adopted by the CFTC or SEC, AIG or one or more of its subsidiaries may
become subject to derivative transaction clearing, execution and reporting requirements, capital and margin requirements and business conduct rules.

•

Dodd-Frank establishes a Federal Insurance Office (FIO) within the Department of the Treasury to be headed by
a director appointed by the Secretary of the Treasury. While not having a general supervisory or regulatory authority over the business of insurance, the director of this office would perform various
functions with respect to insurance (other than health insurance), including serving as a non-voting member of the Council and participating in the Council's decisions regarding insurers,
potentially including AIG to be designated for stricter prudential regulation. The director is also required to conduct a study on how to modernize and improve the system of insurance regulation in
the United States, including by increased national uniformity through either a federal charter or effective action by the states. The FIO may also recommend enhanced regulations to state insurance
regulatory bodies.

•

Dodd-Frank authorizes the FRB to require a savings and loan holding company or a Designated Financial Company
to place its financial activities in an intermediate holding company separate from non-financial activities (as defined for purposes of the Bank Holding Company Act) and imposes
restrictions on transactions between the two businesses, which could be burdensome and costly to implement.

•

Dodd-Frank establishes the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection (BCFP) as an independent agency within the
FRB to regulate consumer financial products and services offered primarily for personal, family or household purposes. Insurance products and services are not within the BCFP's general jurisdiction,
and broker-dealers and investment advisers are not subject to the BCFP's jurisdiction when acting in their registered capacity.

•

Title XIV of Dodd-Frank also restricts certain terms for mortgage loans, such as loan fees, prepayment fees
and other charges, and imposes certain duties on a lender to ensure that a borrower can afford to repay the loan. These changes may adversely affect UGC's business.

•

Dodd-Frank seeks to increase efficiency, reduce transaction costs and improve consumer access in the
nonadmitted property and casualty insurance market (excess and surplus lines). AIG expects that these measures will make certain of Chartis' operations within the U.S. more streamlined and efficient,
although they could lead to greater competition in these markets.

•

Dodd-Frank includes various securities law reforms that may affect AIG's business practices and the
liabilities and/or exposures associated therewith, including:•The SEC recently completed a staff report on registered broker-dealers who provide personalized investment advice to
retail investors, such as certain of SunAmerica's operations. The staff report recommended to Congress a uniform fiduciary standard of conduct for broker-dealers and investment advisers. The SEC may
also require broker-dealers selling proprietary or a limited range of products to make certain disclosures and obtain customer consents or acknowledgements.•The SEC and other regulators are required to promulgate regulations requiring the originator of certain asset-backed
securities to retain at least five percent of the credit risk of securities sold, which may apply to activities of subsidiaries of AIG as part of their funding activities in the future.

20            AIG 2010 Form 10-K








American International Group, Inc., and Subsidiaries

Dodd-Frank
imposes various assessments on financial companies, including, as applicable to AIG, ex-post assessments to provide funds necessary to repay any
borrowing and to cover the costs of any special resolution of a financial company conducted under Title II (although the regulatory authority would have to take account of the amounts paid by AIG into
state guaranty funds). AIG cannot predict the potential effects the new legislation will have on its organizational structure, financial condition or results of operations. However, it is possible
that such effect could be materially adverse.

AIG
cannot predict whether these actions will become effective or the effect they may have on the financial markets or on AIG's business, results of operations, cash flows, financial
condition and credit ratings.

Other
Regulatory Developments

AIG's
operations are subject to regulatory supervision and the possibility of intervention. In light of AIG's liquidity problems beginning in the third quarter
of 2008, AIG and its regulated subsidiaries have been subject to intense review and supervision around the world. Regulators have taken significant steps to protect the businesses of the entities they
regulate. These steps have included:

•restricting or prohibiting the payment of dividends to AIG Parent and its subsidiaries;•restricting or prohibiting other payments to AIG Parent and its subsidiaries;•requesting additional capital contributions from AIG Parent;•requesting that intercompany reinsurance reserves be covered by assets locally;•restricting the business in which the subsidiaries may engage;•requiring pre-approval of all proposed transactions between the regulated subsidiaries and AIG Parent or any
affiliate; and•requiring more frequent reporting, including with respect to capital and liquidity positions.

Legislation
in the European Union could also affect AIG's international insurance operations. The Solvency II Directive (2009/138/EEC), which was adopted on November 25, 2009 and
is expected to become effective in January 2013 (Solvency II), reforms the insurance industry's solvency framework, including minimum capital and solvency requirements, governance requirements, risk
management and public reporting standards. The impact on AIG will depend on whether the U.S. insurance regulatory regime is deemed "equivalent" to Solvency II; if the U.S. insurance regulatory regime
is not equivalent, then AIG as a group could be required to be supervised under

AIG 2010 Form 10-K            21








American International Group, Inc., and Subsidiaries



Solvency
II standards. Whether the U.S. insurance regulatory regime will be deemed "equivalent" is still under consideration by European authorities and remains uncertain, so AIG is not currently able
to predict the impact of Solvency II.

AIG
expects that the regulations applicable to it and its regulated entities will continue to evolve for the foreseeable future.

Regulation
of Domestic Insurance Subsidiaries

Certain
states require registration and periodic reporting by insurance companies that are licensed in such states and are controlled by other corporations.
Applicable legislation typically requires periodic disclosure concerning the corporation that controls the registered insurer and the other companies in the holding company system and prior approval
of intercorporate services and transfers of assets, including in some instances payment of dividends by the insurance subsidiary, within the holding company system. AIG's subsidiaries are registered
under such legislation in those states that have such requirements.

AIG's
insurance subsidiaries, in common with other insurers, are subject to regulation and supervision by the states and by other jurisdictions in which they do business. Within the
United States, the method of such regulation varies but generally has its source in statutes that delegate regulatory and supervisory powers to an insurance official. The regulation and supervision
relate primarily to the financial condition of the insurers and their corporate conduct and market conduct activities. This includes approval of policy forms and rates, the standards of solvency that
must be met and maintained, including with respect to risk-based capital, the licensing of insurers and their agents, the nature of and limitations on investments, restrictions on the size
of risks that may be insured under a single policy, deposits of securities for the benefit of policyholders, requirements for acceptability of reinsurers, periodic examinations of the affairs of
insurance companies, the form and content of reports of financial condition required to be filed and reserves for unearned premiums, losses and other purposes. In general, such regulation is for the
protection of policyholders rather than the equity owners of these companies.

AIG
has taken various steps to enhance the capital positions of the Chartis U.S. and SunAmerica companies. AIG entered into capital maintenance agreements with these companies that set
forth procedures through which AIG has provided, and expects to continue to provide, capital support. Also, in order to allow the Chartis U.S. companies to record as an admitted asset at
December 31, 2010 certain reinsurance ceded to non-U.S. reinsurers, which has the effect of maintaining the level of the statutory surplus of such companies, AIG obtained and
entered into reimbursement agreements for approximately $6.1 billion of letters of credit issued by several commercial banks in favor of certain Chartis and SunAmerica companies and funded
trusts totaling $800 million in favor of certain Chartis companies.

In
the U.S., the Risk-Based Capital (RBC) formula is designed to measure the adequacy of an insurer's statutory surplus in relation to the risks inherent in its business. The
RBC Model Law, which allows states to act upon the results of RBC calculations, provides for four incremental levels of regulatory action regarding insurers whose RBC calculations fall below specific
thresholds. Those levels of action range from the requirement to submit a plan describing how an insurer would regain a calculated RBC ratio above the respective threshold through a mandatory
regulatory takeover of the company. The action thresholds are based on RBC levels that are calculated so that a company, subject to such actions, is solvent but its future solvency is in doubt without
some type of corrective action. The RBC formula computes a risk-adjusted surplus level by applying discreet factors to various asset, premium and reserve items. These factors are developed
to be risk-sensitive so that higher factors are applied to items exposed to greater risk.

The
statutory surplus of each of AIG's U.S.-based life and property and casualty insurance subsidiaries exceeded RBC minimum required levels as of December 31, 2010.

To
the extent that any of AIG's insurance entities would fall below prescribed levels of statutory surplus, it would be AIG's intention to provide appropriate capital or other types of
support to that entity, under formal support or capital maintenance agreements or otherwise.

There
are a number of proposals to amend state insurance laws and regulations in ways that could affect AIG and its subsidiaries. The National Association of Insurance Commissioners
(NAIC) has recently adopted or amended model laws on holding company regulation that would provide for supervision of insurers at the corporate group level. Although these changes are only beginning
to be adopted by individual state regulators, it can be expected that most will ultimately adopt them in some form. The various proposals to implement group supervision
include:

•uniform standards for insurer corporate governance;•group-wide supervision of insurance holding companies;•adjustments to RBC calculations to account for group-wide risks; and•additional regulatory and disclosure requirements for insurance holding companies.

Additionally,
the NAIC has undertaken the Solvency Modernization Initiative (SMI) which focuses on a review of insurance solvency regulations throughout the U.S. financial regulatory
system and will lead to a set of long-term solvency modernization goals. SMI is broad in scope, but NAIC has stated that its focus
will include the U.S. solvency framework, group solvency issues, capital requirements, international accounting and regulatory standards, reinsurance and corporate governance.

AIG
cannot predict the potential effect that any new regulations would have on AIG's insurance subsidiaries or on AIG's business, results of operations, cash flows or financial
condition.

Regulation
of Domestic Subsidiaries in Foreign Jurisdictions

A
substantial portion of Chartis' business is conducted in foreign countries. The degree of regulation and supervision in foreign jurisdictions varies.
Generally, AIG, as well as the underwriting companies operating in such jurisdictions, must satisfy local regulatory requirements. Licenses issued by foreign authorities to AIG subsidiaries are
subject to modification or revocation by such authorities, and these subsidiaries could be prevented from conducting business in certain of the jurisdictions where they currently operate.

In
addition to licensing requirements, AIG's foreign operations are also regulated in various jurisdictions with respect to currency, policy language and terms, advertising, amount and
type of security deposits, amount and type of reserves, amount and type of capital to be held, amount and type of local investment and the share of profits to be returned to policyholders on
participating policies. Some foreign countries regulate rates on various types of policies. Certain countries have established reinsurance institutions, wholly or partially owned by the local
government, to which admitted insurers are obligated to cede a portion of their business on terms that may not always allow foreign insurers, including AIG subsidiaries, full compensation. In some
countries, regulations governing constitution of technical reserves and remittance balances may hinder remittance of profits and repatriation of assets.

Competition

AIG's businesses operate in highly competitive environments, both domestically and overseas. Principal sources of competition are
insurance companies, banks, investment banks and other non-bank financial institutions. AIG considers its principal competitors to be other large multi-national insurance organizations.

The
insurance industry in particular is highly competitive. Within the United States, Chartis subsidiaries compete with approximately 3,300 other stock companies, specialty insurance
organizations, mutual companies and other
underwriting organizations. SunAmerica subsidiaries compete in the United States with approximately 1,800 life insurance companies and other participants in related financial services fields.
Overseas, AIG's subsidiaries compete for business with the foreign insurance operations of large U.S. insurers and with global insurance groups and local companies in particular areas in which they
are active.

As
a result of the reduction of the credit ratings of AIG and its subsidiaries, AIG's businesses have faced and continue to face intense competition to retain existing customers and to
maintain business with existing customers and counterparties at historical levels. General insurance and life insurance companies compete through a combination of risk acceptance criteria, product
pricing, and terms and conditions. Retirement services companies compete through crediting rates and the issuance of guaranteed benefits.

a further discussion of the risks relating to retaining existing customers, soliciting new customers and retaining key employees, see Item 1A. Risk Factors.
