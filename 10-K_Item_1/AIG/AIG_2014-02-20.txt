Mortgage Guaranty

Mortgage Guaranty (United Guaranty Corporation or UGC)offers private residential mortgage
guaranty insurance, which protects mortgage lenders and investors from loss due to borrower default and loan foreclosure. With over 1,000 employees, UGC currently insures over one million mortgage
loans in the United States. In 2013, UGC generated more than $49 billion in new insurance written, which represents the original principal balance of the insured mortgages, making it a leading
provider of private mortgage insurance in the United States.

Products and Services:UGC provides an array of products and services including first-lien
mortgage guaranty insurance in a range of premium payment plans. UGC's primary product is private mortgage insurance. The coverage we provide — which is called mortgage guaranty
insurance, mortgage insurance, or simply "MI", protects lenders against the increased risk of borrower default related to high loan-to-value (LTV) mortgages — those with less than
20 percent equity — enabling borrowers to purchase a house with a modest down payment.

Homeowner Support:UGC also works with homeowners who are behind on their mortgage payments
to identify ways to retain their home. As a liaison between the borrower and the mortgage servicer, UGC provides the added support to qualified homeowners to help them avoid foreclosure.

A REVIEW OF LIABILITY FOR UNPAID CLAIMS AND CLAIMS ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE



The
liability for unpaid claims and claims adjustment expense represents the accumulation of estimates for unpaid reported claims and claims that have been incurred but not reported (IBNR) for AIG
Property Casualty and UGC. Unpaid claims and claims adjustment expenses are also referred to as unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses, or just loss reserves.

We
recognize as assets the portion of this liability that will be recovered from reinsurers. Reserves are discounted, where permitted, in accordance with U.S. GAAP.

AIG 2013 Form 10-K









ITEM 1 / BUSINESS



The Loss Reserve Development Process

The
process of establishing the liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expense is complex and imprecise because it must take into consideration many variables that
are subject to the outcome of future events. As a result, informed subjective estimates and judgments about our ultimate exposure to losses are an integral component of our loss reserving process.

We use a number of techniques to analyze the adequacy of the established net liability for unpaid claims and claims adjustment expense (net loss reserves). Using these analytical techniques, we monitor the adequacy of
AIG's established reserves and determine appropriate assumptions for inflation and other factors influencing loss costs. Our analysis also takes into account emerging specific development patterns, such as case reserve redundancies or deficiencies
and IBNR emergence. We also consider specific factors that may impact losses, such as changing trends in medical costs, unemployment levels and other economic indicators, as well as changes in legislation and social attitudes that may affect
decisions to file claims or the magnitude of court awards. See Item 7. MD&A — Critical Accounting Estimates for a description of our loss reserving process.A significant portion of AIG Property Casualty's business is in the U.S. commercial casualty class, including asbestos and environmental, which tends to involve longer periods of time for the reporting and settlement of claims and may increase the
risk and uncertainty with respect to our loss reserve development.Because reserve estimates are subject to the outcome of future events, changes in prior year estimates are unavoidable in the insurance industry. These changes in estimates are sometimes referred to as
 "loss development" or "reserve development."



Analysis of Consolidated Loss Reserve Development

The
"Analysis of Consolidated Loss Reserve Development" table presents the development of prior year net loss reserves for calendar years 2003 through 2013 for each balance sheet in that period. The
information in the table is presented in accordance with reporting requirements of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). This table should be interpreted with care by those not familiar with
its format or those who are familiar with other loss development analyses arranged in an accident year or underwriting year basis rather than the balance sheet, as shown below. See Note 12 to
the Consolidated Financial Statements.

The top row of the table showsNet Reserves Held(the net liability for unpaid claims and claims adjustment expenses) at each
balance sheet date, net of discount.This liability represents the estimated amount of losses and loss adjustment expenses for claims arising in all years prior to the balance
sheet date that were unpaid as of that balance sheet date, including estimates for IBNR claims. The amount of loss reserve discount included in the net reserves at each date is shown immediately below
the net reserves held. The undiscounted reserve at each date is
equal to the sum of the discount and the net reserves held. For example,Net Reserves Held (Undiscounted)was $37.7 billion at
December 31, 2003.

The next section of the table shows the originalNet Undiscounted Reserves re-estimatedover 10 years. This re-estimation
takes into consideration a number of factors, including changes in the estimated frequency of reported claims, effects of significant judgments, the emergence of latent exposures, and changes in
medical cost trends.For example, the original undiscounted reserve of $37.7 billion at December 31, 2003, was re-estimated to $62.1 billion at
December 31, 2013. The amount of the development related to losses settled or re-estimated in 2013, but incurred in 2010, is included in the cumulative development amount for years 2010, 2011
and 2012. Any increase or decrease in the estimate is reflected in operating results in the period in which the estimate is changed.

The middle of the table showsNet Redundancy (Deficiency).This is the aggregate change in estimates over the period of years
covered by the table.For example, the net loss reserve deficiency of $24.4 billion for 2003 is the difference between the original undiscounted reserve of
$37.7 billion at December 31, 2003 and the $62.1 billion of re-estimated reserves at December 31, 2013. The net deficiency amounts are cumulative; in other words, the
amount

ITEM 1 / BUSINESS

shown
in the 2012 column includes the amount shown in the 2011 column, and so on. Conditions and trends that have affected development of the liability in the past may not necessarily occur in the
future. Accordingly, it generally is not appropriate to extrapolate future development based on this table.

The bottom portion of the table shows thePaid (Cumulative)amounts during successive years related to the undiscounted loss
reserves.For example, as of December 31, 2013, AIG had paid a total of $51.6 billion of the $62.1 billion in re-estimated reserves for 2003, resulting in
Remaining Reserves (Undiscounted) of $10.5 billion for 2003. Also included in this section are theRemaining Reserves (Undiscounted)and theRemaining
Discountfor each year.

The following table presents loss reserves and the related loss development 2003 through 2013 and consolidated gross liability (before discount), reinsurance recoverable and

(a)  During
2009, we deconsolidated Transatlantic Holdings, Inc. and sold 21st Century Insurance Group and HSB Group, Inc. The sales and deconsolidation are reflected
in the table above as a reduction in December 31, 2009 net reserves of $9.7 billion and as an $8.6 billion increase in paid losses for the years 2000 through 2008 to remove the
reserves for these divested entities from the ending balance.(b)  The
increase in Net Reserves Held from 2009 to 2010 is partially due to the $1.7 billion in Net Reserves Held by Fuji, which was acquired in 2010. The decrease in 2011 is due
to the cession of asbestos reserves described in Item 7. MD&A — Results of Operations — Segment Results — AIG Property Casualty
Operations — Liability for Unpaid Claims and Claims Adjustment Expense — Asbestos and Environmental Reserves.

The Liability for unpaid claims and claims adjustment expense as reported in AIG's Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2013 differs from the total
reserve reported in the annual statements filed with state insurance departments and, where applicable, with foreign regulatory authorities primarily for the following reasons:

•Reserves for certain foreign operations are not required or permitted to be reported in the United States for statutory
reporting purposes, including contingency reserves for catastrophic events;

AIG 2013 Form 10-K











ITEM 1 / BUSINESS

•Statutory practices in the United States require reserves to be shown net of applicable reinsurance recoverable; and•Unlike statutory financial statements, AIG's consolidated Liability for unpaid claims and claims adjustment expense
excludes the effect of intercompany transactions.

Gross
loss reserves are calculated without reduction for reinsurance recoverables and represent the accumulation of estimates for reported losses and IBNR, net of estimated salvage and subrogation. We
review the adequacy of established gross loss reserves in the manner previously described for net loss reserves. A reconciliation of activity in the Liability for unpaid claims and claims adjustment
expense is included in Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

For
further discussion of asbestos and environmental reserves, see Item 7. MD&A — Results of Operations — Segment Results — AIG Property
Casualty Operations — Liability for Unpaid Claims and Claims Adjustment Expense — Asbestos and Environmental Reserves.



REINSURANCE ACTIVITIES



Reinsurance
is used primarily to manage overall capital adequacy and mitigate the insurance loss exposure related to certain events such as natural and man-made
catastrophes.

AIG
subsidiaries operate worldwide primarily by underwriting and accepting risks for their direct account on a gross basis and reinsuring a portion of the exposure on either an individual risk or an
aggregate basis to the extent those risks exceed the desired retention level. In addition, as a condition of certain direct underwriting transactions, we are required by clients, agents or regulation
to cede all or a portion of risks to specified reinsurance entities, such as captives, other insurers, local reinsurers and compulsory pools.

Over
the last several years, AIG Property Casualty revised its ceded reinsurance framework and strategy to improve capital management and support our global product line risk and profitability
objectives. As a result of adopting the revised framework and strategy, many individual reinsurance contracts were consolidated into more efficient global programs and reinsurance ceded to third
parties in support of risk and capital management objectives has decreased for the full year 2013 compared to the prior year. There are many different forms of reinsurance agreements and different
markets that may be used to achieve our risk and profitability objectives. We continually evaluate the relative attractiveness of various reinsurance markets and arrangements that may be used to
achieve our risk and profitability objectives.

Reinsurance
markets include:

•Traditional local and global reinsurance markets including in the United States, Bermuda, London and Europe, accessed
directly and through reinsurance intermediaries;•Capital markets through investors in insurance-linked securities and collateralized reinsurance transactions, such as
catastrophe bonds, "sidecars" (special purpose entities that allow investors to take on the risk of a book of business from an insurance company in exchange for a premium) and similar vehicles; and•Other insurers that engage in both direct and assumed reinsurance and/or engage in swaps.

The
form of reinsurance that we may choose from time to time will generally depend on whether we are seeking (i) proportional reinsurance, whereby we cede a specified percentage of premium and
losses to reinsurers, or non-proportional or excess of loss reinsurance, whereby we cede all or a specified portion of losses in excess of a specified amount on a per risk, per occurrence (including
catastrophe reinsurance) or aggregate basis and (ii) treaties that cover a defined book of policies, or facultative placements that cover an individual policy. The vast majority of our
reinsurance is non-proportional.

Reinsurance
arrangements do not relieve AIG subsidiaries from their direct obligations to insureds. However, an effective reinsurance program substantially mitigates our exposure to potentially
significant losses.

In
certain markets, we are required to participate on a proportional basis in reinsurance pools based on our relative share of direct writings in those markets. Such mandatory reinsurance generally
covers higher-risk consumer exposures such as assigned-risk automobile and earthquake, as well as certain commercial exposures such as workers' compensation.

AIG 2013 Form 10-K











ITEM 1 / BUSINESS

We
continued our strategy to take advantage of the pricing differential between traditional reinsurance markets and capital markets. On July 9, 2013, we entered into a five-year catastrophe
bond transaction with Tradewynd Re Ltd., which will provide $125 million of indemnity protection against U.S., Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico named storms, and U.S. and Canadian
earthquakes. The transaction provides us with fully collateralized coverage against losses from the events described above on a per-occurrence basis through June 2018.

In
addition, we entered into a five-year capital markets reinsurance transaction, effective as of January 1, 2014 with Tradewynd Re Ltd., which will provide $400 million of
indemnity reinsurance protection against U.S., Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico named storms, and U.S. and Canadian earthquakes. To fund its potential obligations to AIG, Tradewynd Re Ltd. issued
three tranches of notes, one with a one-year term and two with three-year terms. The transaction closed December 18, 2013 and provides AIG with fully collateralized coverage against losses from
the events described above on a per-occurrence basis through December 2018.

Risks — Reinsurance Recoverable for a summary of significant reinsurers.



GENERATING REVENUES: INVESTMENT ACTIVITIES OF OUR INSURANCE OPERATIONS



AIG Property Casualty and AIG Life and Retirement generally receive premiums and deposits well in advance of paying covered claims or benefits. In the intervening periods, we invest these premiums and deposits to generate
net investment income that is available to pay claims or benefits. As a result, we generate significant revenues from insurance investment activities.AIG's worldwide insurance investment policy places primary emphasis on investments in fixed maturity securities of corporations, municipal bonds and government issuances in all of its portfolios, and, to a lesser extent, investments in high-yield
bonds, common stock, real estate, hedge funds and other alternative investments.We generate significant revenues in our AIG Property Casualty and AIG Life and Retirement operations from investment activities.

The majority of assets backing our insurance liabilities at AIG consist of intermediate and long duration fixed maturity securities.

AIG Property Casualty— Fixed maturity securities held by the insurance companies included in AIG Property Casualty domestic
operations have historically consisted primarily of laddered holdings of corporate bonds, municipal bonds and government bonds. These investments provided attractive returns and limited credit risk.
To meet our domestic operations' current risk return and business objectives, our domestic property and casualty companies have been shifting investment allocations to a broader array of debt,
including structured securities and equity sectors. Our fixed maturity securities must meet our liquidity, duration and quality objectives as well as current capital, risk return and business
objectives. Fixed maturity securities held by AIG Property Casualty international operations consist primarily of intermediate duration high-grade securities, primarily in the markets being served. In
addition, AIG Property Casualty has redeployed cash in excess of operating needs and short-term investments into longer-term, higher-yielding securities.

AIG Life and Retirement— Our investment strategy is to largely match the duration of our liabilities with assets of
comparable duration, to the extent practicable. AIG Life and Retirement primarily invests in a diversified portfolio of fixed maturity securities, including corporate bonds, RMBS, CMBS and CDO/ABS. To
further diversify the portfolio, investments are made in private equity funds, hedge funds and affordable housing partnerships. Although these alternative investments are subject to periodic earnings
fluctuations, for the three years ended December 31, 2013, they have achieved total returns in excess of AIG Life and Retirement's fixed maturity security returns. AIG Life and Retirement
expects that these alternative investments will continue to outperform the fixed maturity security portfolio over the long term.

REGULATION



Our
operations around the world are subject to regulation by many different types of regulatory authorities, including insurance, securities, derivatives, investment
advisory, banking and thrift regulators in the United States and abroad.

Our
insurance subsidiaries are subject to regulation and supervision by the states and jurisdictions in which they do business. The insurance and financial services industries generally have been
subject to heightened regulatory scrutiny and supervision in recent years.

The following table provides a general overview of our primary regulators and related bodies and a brief description of their oversight with respect to us and our subsidiaries,
including key regulations or initiatives that we are currently, or may in the future be, subject to. Such regulations and initiatives, both in the United States and abroad, are discussed in more
detail following the table.



U.S. Federal Regulation

Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (FRB):Oversees and regulates financial institutions, including non-bank systemically important
financial institutions (SIFIs), bank holding companies and savings and loan holding companies (SLHCs). We are currently subject to the FRB's examination, supervision and enforcement authority, and
reporting requirements, as an SLHC and as a SIFI.

Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC):Charters, regulates and supervises all national banks and federal savings associations. The OCC
supervises and regulates AIG Federal Savings Bank, our federal savings association subsidiary.

Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC):Oversees and regulates the U.S. securities and security-based swap markets, U.S. mutual funds, U.S.
broker-dealers and U.S. investment advisors. Principal regulator of the mutual funds offered by our broker-dealer subsidiaries owned by AIG Life and Retirement. The SEC is in the process of
implementing rules and regulations governing reporting, execution and margin requirements for security-based swaps entered into within the U.S. Our security-based swap activities conducted by Global
Capital Markets are subject to these rules and regulations.

Commodities Futures Trading Commission (CFTC):Oversees and regulates the U.S. swap, commodities and futures markets. The CFTC has implemented, and is
in the process of implementing, rules and regulations governing reporting, execution and margin requirements for swaps entered into within the U.S. or by U.S. persons. Our swap activities conducted by
Global Capital Markets are subject to these rules and regulations.

Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank):Dodd-Frank has effected comprehensive changes to financial services regulation
and subjects us, or will subject us, as applicable, to additional federal regulation, including:

•minimum capital requirements for SLHCs and insured depository institutions;•enhanced prudential standards for SIFIs (including minimum leverage and risk-based capital requirements, stress tests and
an early remediation regime process);•prohibitions on proprietary trading; and•increased regulation and restrictions on derivatives markets and transactions.

AIG 2013 Form 10-K









ITEM 1 / BUSINESS



U.S. State Regulation

State Insurance Regulators:Our insurance subsidiaries are subject to regulation and supervision by the states and other jurisdictions in which they do
business. Regulation is generally derived from statutes that delegate supervisory and regulatory powers to a state insurance regulator, and primarily relates to the insurer's financial condition,
corporate conduct and market conduct activities.NAIC Standards:The National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) is a standard-setting and regulatory support organization created and
governed by the chief insurance regulators from the 50 states, the District of Columbia and five U.S. territories. The NAIC itself is not a regulator, but through the NAIC, state insurance regulators
establish standards and best practices, conduct peer review and coordinate regulatory oversight.



Foreign Regulation

Financial Stability Board (FSB):Consists of representatives of national financial authorities of the G20 nations. The FSB itself is not a regulator,
but it coordinates the work of national financial authorities and international
standard-setting bodies and develops and promotes implementation of regulatory, supervisory and other financial policies.

International Association of Insurance Supervisors (IAIS):Represents insurance regulators and supervisors of more than 200 jurisdictions in nearly 140
countries and seeks to promote globally consistent insurance industry supervision. The IAIS itself is not a regulator, but the FSB has directed the IAIS to create standards on issues such as financial
group supervision, capital and solvency standards, systemic economic risk and corporate governance and incorporate them into IAIS' Insurance Core Principles (ICPs). The FSB also charged IAIS with
developing a template for measuring systemic risks posed by insurer groups. Based on IAIS' assessment template, the FSB identified AIG as a global systemically important insurer (G-SII), which may
subject us to a policy framework that includes recovery and resolution planning requirements, enhanced group-wide supervision, basic capital requirements and higher loss absorbency capital
requirements. The IAIS is also developing ComFrame, a Common Framework for the Supervision of Internationally Active Insurance Groups (IAIGs), which includes additional supervisory oversight based on
its ICPs but also adds requirements and supervisory processes pertaining to the international business activities of IAIGs. AIG currently meets the parameters set forth to define an IAIG.

European Union (EU):Certain financial services firms with regulated entities in the EU, such as us, are subject to supplementary supervision, which
seeks to enable supervisors to perform consolidated banking supervision and insurance group supervision at the level of the ultimate parent entity. The objective of supplementary supervision is to
detect, monitor, manage and control group risks. The UK Prudential Regulatory Authority, the United Kingdom's prudential regulator, is our EU supervisory coordinator. The EU has also established a set
of regulatory requirements for EU derivatives activities under the European Market Infrastructure Regulation (EMIR) that include, among other things, risk mitigation, risk management and regulatory
reporting, which are effective, and clearing requirements expected to become effective in 2014.

The
EU's Solvency II Directive (2009/138/EEC) (Solvency II), which is expected to become effective in 2016, includes minimum capital and solvency requirements, governance requirements, risk management
and public reporting standards. The impact on us will depend on whether the U.S. insurance regulatory regime is deemed "equivalent" to Solvency II; if the U.S. insurance regulatory regime is not
equivalent, then we could be subjected to Solvency II standards.

Regulation of Foreign Insurance Company Subsidiaries:Generally, our subsidiaries operating in foreign jurisdictions must satisfy local regulatory
requirements. Our foreign operations are also regulated in various jurisdictions with respect to currency, policy language and terms, advertising, amount and type of security deposits, amount and type
of reserves, amount and type of capital to be held, amount and type of local investment and the share of profits to be returned to policyholders on participating policies. Some foreign countries also
regulate rates on various types of policies.

AIG 2013 Form 10-K











ITEM 1 / BUSINESS



Federal Reserve Supervision



We
are regulated by the FRB and subject to its examination, supervision and enforcement authority and reporting requirements as a SLHC and as a SIFI.

We
are a SLHC within the meaning of the Home Owners' Loan Act (HOLA). Because we were grandfathered as a unitary SLHC within the meaning of HOLA when we organized AIG Federal Savings Bank and became a
SLHC in 1999, we generally are not restricted under existing laws as to the types of business activities in which we may engage, as long as AIG Federal Savings Bank continues to be a qualified thrift
lender.

Dodd-Frank
has effected comprehensive changes to the regulation of financial services in the United States and subjects us to substantial additional federal regulation. The FRB supervises and
regulates SLHCs, and the OCC supervises and regulates federal savings associations, such as AIG Federal Savings Bank. Dodd-Frank directs existing and newly-created government agencies and oversight
bodies to promulgate regulations implementing the law, an ongoing process that has begun and is anticipated to continue over the next few years.

Changes
mandated by Dodd-Frank include directing the FRB to promulgate minimum capital requirements for SLHCs. The FRB, the OCC and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) have established
revised minimum leverage and risk-based capital requirements, which are based on accords established by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, that apply to bank holding companies and SLHCs, as
well as to insured depository institutions, such as AIG Federal Savings Bank. The requirements, however, do not apply to SLHCs that are substantially engaged in insurance underwriting activities. The
FRB expects to implement a capital framework for SLHCs that are substantially engaged in insurance underwriting activities by the time covered SLHCs must comply with the requirements in 2015.

As
required by Dodd-Frank, the FRB has also proposed enhanced prudential standards (including minimum leverage and risk-based capital requirements) for SIFIs and has stated its intention to propose
enhanced prudential standards for SLHCs pursuant to HOLA. We cannot predict whether the capital regulations will be adopted as proposed or what enhanced prudential standards the FRB will promulgate
for SLHCs, either generally or as applicable to insurance businesses. Further, we cannot predict how the FRB will exercise general supervisory authority over us as a SIFI, although the FRB could, as a
prudential matter, for example, limit our ability to pay dividends, repurchase shares of
AIG Common Stock or acquire or enter into other businesses. We cannot predict with certainty the requirements of the regulations ultimately adopted or how or whether Dodd-Frank and such regulations
will affect the financial markets generally, impact our businesses, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition, or require us to raise additional capital or result in a downgrade of our
credit ratings.

On
July 8, 2013, AIG received notice from the U.S. Treasury that the Financial Stability Oversight Council (Council) has made a final determination that AIG should be supervised by the FRB as a
SIFI pursuant to Dodd-Frank. As a SIFI, we are regulated by the FRB both in that capacity and, for as long as AIG continues to control an insured depository institution, in our capacity as a SLHC. The
regulations applicable to SIFIs and to SLHCs, when all have been adopted as final rules, may differ materially from each other. AIG is working to restructure AIG Federal Savings Bank into a trust-only
thrift and deregister AIG as a SLHC.

As
a SIFI, we anticipate we will be subject to:

•stress tests to determine whether, on a consolidated basis, we have the capital necessary to absorb losses due to adverse
economic conditions;•stricter prudential standards, including stricter requirements and limitations relating to risk-based capital, leverage,
liquidity and credit exposure, as well as overall risk management requirements, management interlock prohibitions and a requirement to maintain a plan for rapid and orderly resolution in the event of
severe financial distress; and•an early remediation regime process to be administered by the FRB.

Furthermore,
if the Council were to make an additional separate determination that AIG poses a "grave threat" to U.S. financial stability, we would be required to maintain a debt-to-equity ratio of no
more than 15:1 and the FRB may:

•limit our ability to merge with, acquire, consolidate with, or become affiliated with another company;•restrict our ability to offer specified financial products;

AIG 2013 Form 10-K











ITEM 1 / BUSINESS

•require us to terminate specified activities;•impose conditions on how we conduct our activities; and•with approval of the Council, and a determination that the foregoing actions are inadequate to mitigate a threat to U.S.
financial stability, require us to sell or otherwise transfer assets or off-balance-sheet items to unaffiliated entities.

As
part of its general prudential supervisory powers, the FRB has the authority to limit our ability to conduct activities that would otherwise be permissible for us to engage in if we do not satisfy
certain requirements.



Volcker Rule



On
December 10, 2013, the FRB, OCC, FDIC, SEC and CFTC adopted the final rule implementing Section 619 of Dodd-Frank, referred to as the "Volcker Rule." For as
long as AIG Federal Savings Bank continues to be a qualified thrift lender, we and our affiliates are considered banking entities for purposes of the rule and, after the end of the rule's conformance
period in July 2015 (subject to extension by the FRB until 2017),
would be prohibited from "proprietary trading" and sponsoring or investing in "covered funds," subject to the rule's exceptions. The term "covered funds" includes hedge, private equity or similar
funds and, in certain cases, issuers of asset-backed securities if such securities have equity-like characteristics. The Volcker Rule, as adopted, contains an exemption for proprietary trading and
"covered fund" sponsorship or investment by a regulated insurance company or its affiliate for the general account of the regulated insurance company or a separate account established by the regulated
insurance company. Even if we no longer control an insured depository institution, however, Dodd-Frank authorizes the FRB to subject SIFIs to additional capital requirements and quantitative
limitations if they engage in activities prohibited for banking entities under the Volcker Rule.



Other Effects of Dodd-Frank



In
addition, Dodd-Frank may also have the following effects on us:

•

As a SIFI, we will be required to provide to regulators an annual plan for our rapid and orderly resolution in the event
of material financial distress or failure, which must, among other things, ensure that AIG Federal Savings Bank is adequately protected from risks arising from our other entities and meet several
specific standards, including requiring a detailed resolution strategy and analyses of our material entities, organizational structure, interconnections and interdependencies, and management
information systems, among other elements.

•

The Council may recommend that state insurance regulators or other regulators apply new or heightened standards and
safeguards for activities or practices that we and other insurers or other financial services companies engage in.

•

Title II of Dodd-Frank provides that a financial company whose largest United States subsidiary is an insurer (such as us)
may be subject to a special liquidation process outside the federal bankruptcy code. That process is to be administered by the FDIC upon a coordinated determination by the Secretary of the Treasury,
the director of the Federal Insurance Office and the FRB, in consultation with the FDIC, that such a financial company is in default or in danger of default and presents a systemic risk to U.S.
financial stability.

•

Dodd-Frank provides for significantly increased regulation of and restrictions on derivatives markets and transactions
that could affect various activities of AIG and its insurance and financial services subsidiaries, including (i) regulatory reporting for swaps (which are regulated by the CFTC) and
security-based swaps (which are regulated by the SEC), (ii) mandated clearing through central counterparties and execution through regulated exchanges or electronic facilities for certain swaps
and security-based swaps and (iii) margin and collateral requirements. Although the CFTC has not yet finalized certain requirements, many other requirements have taken effect, such as swap
reporting, the mandatory clearing of certain interest rate swaps and credit default swaps, and the mandatory trading of certain swaps on swap execution facilities or exchanges starting in February
2014. The SEC has proposed, but not yet finalized, rules with respect to the regulations and restrictions noted above. These regulations have affected and may further affect various activities of AIG
and its insurance and financial services subsidiaries as rules are finalized to implement additional elements of the regulatory regime.

AIG 2013 Form 10-K











ITEM 1 / BUSINESS

Similar
regulations have been proposed or adopted outside the United States. For instance, the EU has also established a set of new regulatory requirements for EU derivatives activities under EMIR.
These requirements include, among other things, various risk mitigation, risk management and regulatory reporting requirements that have already become effective and clearing requirements that are
expected to become effective in 2014. These requirements could result in increased administrative costs with respect to our EU derivatives activities and overlapping or inconsistent regulation
depending on the ultimate application of cross-border regulatory requirements between and among U.S. and non-U.S. jurisdictions.

•

Dodd-Frank mandated a study to determine whether stable value contracts should be included in the definition of "swap." If
that study concludes that stable value contracts are swaps, Dodd-Frank authorizes certain federal regulators to determine whether an exemption from the definition of a swap for stable value contracts
is appropriate and in the public interest. Certain of our affiliates participate in the stable value contract business. We cannot predict what regulations might emanate from the aforementioned study
or be promulgated applicable to this business in the future.

•

Dodd-Frank established a Federal Insurance Office (FIO) within the Department of the Treasury headed by a director
appointed by the Secretary of the Treasury. While not having a general supervisory or regulatory authority over the business of insurance, the director of this office performs various functions with
respect to insurance (other than health insurance), including serving as a non-voting member of the Council . On December 12, 2013, the FIO released a Dodd-Frank mandated study on how to
modernize and improve the system of insurance regulation in the United States. The report concluded that the uniformity and efficiency of the current state based regulatory system could be improved
and highlighted areas in which Federal involvement is recommended. In the near-term, the FIO recommended that the states undertake reforms regarding capital adequacy, reform of insurer resolution
practices, and marketplace regulation.

•

Dodd-Frank established the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) as an independent agency within the FRB to regulate
consumer financial products and services offered primarily for personal, family or household purposes. Insurance products and services are not within the CFPB's general jurisdiction, although the U.S.
Department of Housing and Urban Development has since transferred authority to the CFPB to investigate mortgage insurance practices. Broker-dealers and investment advisers are not subject to the
CFPB's jurisdiction when acting in their registered capacity.

•

Title XIV of Dodd-Frank also restricts certain terms for mortgage loans, such as loan fees, prepayment fees and other
charges, and imposes certain duties on a lender to ensure that a borrower can afford to repay the loan.

Dodd-Frank
imposes various assessments on financial companies, including, as applicable to us, ex-post assessments to provide funds necessary to repay any borrowing and to cover the costs of any
special resolution of a financial company conducted under Title II (although the regulatory authority would have to take account of the amounts paid by us into state guaranty funds).

We
cannot predict whether these actions will become effective or the effect they may have on the financial markets or on our business, results of operations, cash flows, financial condition and credit
ratings. However, it is possible that such effect could be materially adverse. See Item 1A. Risk Factors — Regulation for additional information.



Other Regulatory Developments



As
described below, AIG has been designated as a Global Systemically Important Insurer (G-SII).

In
addition to the adoption of Dodd-Frank in the United States, regulators and lawmakers around the world are actively reviewing the causes of the financial crisis and taking steps to avoid similar
problems in the future. The FSB, consisting of representatives of national financial authorities of the G20 nations, has issued a series of frameworks and recommendations intended to produce
significant changes in how financial companies, particularly global systemically important financial institutions, should be regulated. These frameworks and recommendations address such issues as
financial group supervision, capital and solvency standards, systemic economic risk, corporate governance including compensation, and a number of related issues associated with responses to the
financial crisis. The FSB has directed the International Association of Insurance Supervisors (the IAIS, headquartered in Basel, Switzerland) to create standards relative to these areas and
incorporate them within that body's Insurance Core Principles (ICPs). IAIS's ICPs form the baseline threshold against which countries' financial services regulatory efforts in the insurance sector are
measured. That measurement is made by periodic Financial Sector Assessment Program

AIG 2013 Form 10-K











ITEM 1 / BUSINESS

(FSAP)
reviews conducted by the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund and the reports thereon spur the development of country-specific additional or amended regulatory changes. Lawmakers and
regulatory authorities in a number of jurisdictions in which our subsidiaries conduct business have already begun implementing legislative and regulatory changes consistent with these recommendations,
including proposals governing consolidated regulation of insurance holding companies by the Financial Services Agency in Japan, financial and banking regulation adopted in France and compensation
regulations proposed or adopted by the financial regulators in Germany and the United Kingdom Prudential Regulation Authority.

The
FSB has also charged the IAIS with developing a template for measuring systemic risks posed by insurer groups. The IAIS has requested data from selected insurers around the world to determine
which elements of the
insurance sector, if any, could materially and adversely impact other parts of the global financial services sector (e.g., commercial and investment banking, securities trading, etc.). The IAIS
has provided its assessment template to the FSB. Based on this assessment template, on July 18, 2013, the FSB, in consultation with the IAIS and national authorities, identified an initial list
of G-SIIs, which includes AIG. The IAIS intends G-SIIs to be subject to a policy framework that includes recovery and resolution planning requirements, enhanced group-wide supervision, basic capital
requirements and higher loss absorbency (HLA) capital requirements. The IAIS is currently developing a basic capital requirement (BCR), which it expects to finalize by the end of 2014. The BCR is
expected to cover all group activities and could be implemented by national authorities as soon as 2015. The BCR will also serve as a foundation for the application of HLA capital requirements, which
the IAIS intends to focus on non-traditional and non-insurance activities. It is expected that the IAIS will develop HLA capital requirements by the end of 2015 and the G-SII policy framework will be
fully implemented by 2019.

The
IAIS is also developing a ComFrame, a Common Framework for the Supervision of Internationally Active Insurance Groups (IAIGs), which includes additional supervisory oversight based on its ICPs but
also adds requirements and supervisory processes pertaining to the international business activities of IAIGs. As currently delineated under the ComFrame, AIG meets the parameters set forth to define
an IAIG. While we currently do not know when any ComFrame requirements will be finalized and become effective, the IAIS will undertake a field testing of the ComFrame, including the possibility of
additional capital requirements for IAIGs, which is expected to commence in the beginning of 2014. It is expected that implementation of the ComFrame would begin in 2019.

Legislation
in the European Union could also affect our international insurance operations. The Solvency II Directive (2009/138/EEC) (Solvency II), which was adopted on November 25, 2009 and is
expected to become effective in 2016, reforms the insurance industry's solvency framework, including minimum capital and solvency requirements, governance requirements, risk management and public
reporting standards. Solvency II is expected to be accompanied by Omnibus II, an EU proposal for a directive that also contains provisions for the capital treatment of products with long-term
guarantees. Additionally, the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority recently introduced interim guidelines effective January 1, 2014 that provide regulators in EU Member States
with a framework to ensure that insurers make demonstrable progress towards meeting Solvency II requirements in 2016. The impact on us will depend on whether the U.S. insurance regulatory regime is
deemed "equivalent" to Solvency II; if the U.S. insurance regulatory regime is not equivalent, then we, along with other U.S.-based insurance companies, could be required to be supervised under
Solvency II standards. Whether the U.S. insurance regulatory regime will be deemed "equivalent" is still under consideration by European authorities and remains uncertain, so we are not currently able
to predict the impact of Solvency II.

We
expect that the regulations applicable to us and our regulated entities will continue to evolve for the foreseeable future.



Regulation of Insurance Subsidiaries



Certain
states and other jurisdictions require registration and periodic reporting by insurance companies that are licensed in such jurisdictions and are controlled by other
corporations. Applicable legislation typically requires periodic disclosure concerning the corporation that controls the registered insurer and the other companies in the holding company system and
prior approval of intercompany services and transfers of assets, including in some instances payment of dividends by the insurance subsidiary, within the holding company system. Our subsidiaries are
registered under such legislation in those jurisdictions that have such requirements.

Our
insurance subsidiaries are subject to regulation and supervision by the states and by other jurisdictions in which they do business. Within the United States, the method of such regulation varies
but generally has its source in

AIG 2013 Form 10-K











ITEM 1 / BUSINESS

statutes
that delegate regulatory and supervisory powers to an insurance official. The regulation and supervision relate primarily to the financial condition of the insurers and their corporate
conduct and market conduct activities. This includes approval of policy forms and rates, the standards of solvency that must be met and maintained, including with respect to risk-based capital, the
licensing of insurers and their agents, the nature of and limitations on investments, restrictions on the size of risks that may be insured under a single policy, deposits of securities for the
benefit of policyholders, requirements for acceptability of reinsurers, periodic examinations of the affairs of insurance companies, the form and content of reports of financial condition required to
be filed and reserves for unearned premiums, losses and other purposes. In general, such regulation is for the protection of policyholders rather than the equity owners of these companies.

In
the U.S., the Risk-Based Capital (RBC) formula is designed to measure the adequacy of an insurer's statutory surplus in relation to the risks inherent in its business. Virtually every state has
adopted, in substantial part, the RBC Model Law promulgated by the NAIC, which allows states to act upon the results of RBC calculations, and provides for four incremental levels of regulatory action
regarding insurers whose RBC calculations fall below specific thresholds. Those levels of action range from the requirement to submit a plan describing how an insurer would
regain a calculated RBC ratio above the respective threshold through a mandatory regulatory takeover of the company. The action thresholds are based on RBC levels that are calculated so that a company
subject to such actions is solvent but its future solvency is in doubt without some type of corrective action. The RBC formula computes a risk-adjusted surplus level by applying discrete factors to
various asset, premium and reserve items. These factors are developed to be risk-sensitive so that higher factors are applied to items exposed to greater risk. The statutory surplus of each of our
U.S.-based life and property and casualty insurance subsidiaries exceeded RBC minimum required levels as of December 31, 2013.

If
any of our insurance entities fell below prescribed levels of statutory surplus, it would be our intention to provide appropriate capital or other types of support to that entity, under formal
support agreements or capital maintenance agreements (CMAs) or otherwise. For additional details regarding CMAs that we have entered into with our insurance subsidiaries, see Item 7.
MD&A — Liquidity and Capital Resources — Liquidity and Capital Resources of AIG Parent and Subsidiaries — AIG Property
Casualty — AIG Life and Retirement and — Other Operations — Mortgage Guaranty.

The
NAIC's Model Regulation "Valuation of Life Insurance Policies" (Regulation XXX) requires insurers to establish additional statutory reserves for term life insurance policies with long-term
premium guarantees and universal life policies with secondary guarantees (ULSGs). NAIC Actuarial Guideline 38 (Guideline AXXX) clarifies the application of Regulation XXX as to these
guarantees, including certain ULSGs. See Item 1A — Risk Factors and Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for risks and additional information related to
these statutory reserving requirements.

The
NAIC has undertaken the Solvency Modernization Initiative (SMI) which focuses on a review of insurance solvency regulations throughout the U.S. financial regulatory system and is expected to lead
to a set of long-term solvency modernization goals. SMI is broad in scope, but the NAIC has stated that its focus will include the U.S. solvency framework, group solvency issues, capital requirements,
international accounting and regulatory standards, reinsurance and corporate governance.

A
substantial portion of AIG Property Casualty's business is conducted in foreign countries. The degree of regulation and supervision in foreign jurisdictions varies. Generally, our subsidiaries
operating in foreign jurisdictions must satisfy local regulatory requirements, licenses issued by foreign authorities to our subsidiaries are subject to modification or revocation by such authorities,
and therefore these subsidiaries could be prevented from conducting business in certain of the jurisdictions where they currently operate.

In
addition to licensing requirements, our foreign operations are also regulated in various jurisdictions with respect to currency, policy language and terms, advertising, amount and type of security
deposits, amount and type of reserves, amount and type of capital to be held, amount and type of local investment and the share of profits to be returned to policyholders on participating policies.
Some foreign countries regulate rates on various types of policies. Certain countries have established reinsurance institutions, wholly or partially owned by the local government, to which admitted
insurers are obligated to cede a portion of their business on terms that may not always allow foreign insurers, including our subsidiaries, full compensation. In some countries, regulations governing
constitution of technical reserves and remittance balances may hinder remittance of profits and repatriation of assets.
