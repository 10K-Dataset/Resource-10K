Item 1.    Business

American International Group, Inc. (AIG), a Delaware corporation, is a holding company which, through its subsidiaries, is
engaged primarily in a broad range of insurance and insurance-related activities in the United States and abroad.

Since
September 2008, AIG has been working to protect and enhance the value of its key businesses, execute an orderly asset disposition plan, and position itself for the future. AIG has
entered into several important transactions and relationships with the Federal Reserve Bank of New York (FRBNY), the AIG Credit Facility Trust (together with its trustees, acting in their capacity as
trustees, the Trust) and the United States Department of the Treasury (the Department of the Treasury). As a result of these arrangements, AIG is controlled by the Trust, which was established for the
sole benefit of the United States Treasury.

AIG's
four reportable segments are as follows:

•General Insurance;•Domestic Life Insurance & Retirement Services;•Foreign Life Insurance & Retirement Services; and•Financial Services.

The
principal business units in each of AIG's reportable segments at year-end 2009 are shown below. For information on AIG's reportable segments, including geographic areas
of operation, and changes made in 2009, see Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Throughout this Annual Report on Form 10-K, AIG presents its operations in the way it believes will be
most meaningful, as well as most transparent. Certain of the measurements used by AIG management are "non-GAAP financial measures" under SEC rules and regulations. Underwriting profit
(loss) is utilized to report results for AIG's General Insurance operations. Pre-tax income (loss) before net realized capital gains (losses) is utilized to report results for AIG's life
insurance and retirement services operations. For an explanation of why AIG management considers these "non-GAAP measures" useful to investors, see Management's Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations.

Following
is additional information about AIG's operations:

General Insurance Operations

AIG's General Insurance subsidiaries are multiple line companies writing substantially all lines of property and casualty insurance
both domestically and abroad and comprise the
Commercial Insurance and the Foreign General Insurance operating segments. In July 2009, AIG's General Insurance subsidiaries were rebranded as Chartis (Commercial Insurance operates as Chartis U.S.
and Foreign General Insurance operates as Chartis International). Chartis Private Client Group (Private Client Group) is part of Chartis U.S.

AIG
is diversified both in terms of classes of business and geographic locations. In General Insurance, general and auto liability business is the largest class of business written and
represented approximately 15 percent of net premiums written for the year ended December 31, 2009. During 2009, 8 percent, 6 percent and 6 percent of the direct
General Insurance premiums written (gross premiums less return premiums and cancellations, excluding reinsurance assumed and before deducting reinsurance ceded) were written in the states of
California, New York and Texas, respectively, and 11 percent and 9 percent were written in Japan and the United Kingdom, respectively. No other state or foreign country accounted for
more than five percent of such premiums.

The
majority of AIG's General Insurance business is in the casualty classes, which tend to involve longer periods of time for the reporting and settling of claims. This may increase the
risk and uncertainty with respect to AIG's loss reserve development.

Commercial
Insurance

Commercial
Insurance's business in the United States and Canada is conducted through American Home, National Union, Lexington and certain other General
Insurance company subsidiaries of AIG.

Chartis
U.S. writes substantially all classes of business insurance, accepting such business mainly from insurance brokers. This provides Chartis U.S. the opportunity to select
specialized markets and retain underwriting control. Any licensed broker is able to submit business to Chartis U.S. without the traditional agent-company contractual relationship, but such broker
usually has no authority to commit Chartis U.S. to accept a risk.

In
addition to writing substantially all classes of business insurance, including large commercial or industrial property insurance, excess liability, inland marine, environmental,
workers' compensation and excess and umbrella

coverages,
Chartis U.S. offers many specialized forms of insurance such as aviation, accident and health, equipment breakdown, directors and officers liability (D&O),
difference-in-conditions, kidnap-ransom, export credit and political risk, and various types of professional errors and omissions coverages. Also included in Chartis U.S. are
the operations of Commercial Casualty, which provides insurance and risk management programs for large corporate customers and is a leading provider of customized structured insurance products, and
Chartis Environmental, which focuses on providing specialty products to clients with environmental exposures. Lexington writes surplus lines for risks on
which conventional insurance companies do not readily provide insurance coverage, either because of complexity or because the coverage does not lend itself to conventional contracts. The Chartis
Worldsource Division introduces and coordinates AIG's products and services to U.S.-based multinational clients and foreign corporations doing business in the U.S. Private Client Group provides a
broad range of coverages for high net worth individuals.

Foreign
General Insurance

Chartis
International writes both commercial and consumer lines of insurance through a network of agencies, branches and foreign-based insurance subsidiaries.
Chartis International uses various marketing methods and multiple distribution channels to write both commercial and consumer lines of insurance with certain refinements for local laws, customs and
needs. Chartis International operates in Asia, the Pacific Rim, Europe, the U.K., Africa, the Middle East and Latin America.

Discussion
and Analysis of Consolidated Net Losses and Loss Expense Reserve Development

The
reserve for net losses and loss expenses represents the accumulation of estimates for reported losses (case basis reserves) and provisions for losses
incurred but not reported (IBNR), both reduced by applicable reinsurance recoverable and the discount for future investment income, where permitted. Net losses and loss expenses are charged to income
as incurred.

The
Liability for unpaid claims and claims adjustment expense (loss reserves) established with respect to foreign business is set and monitored in terms of the currency in which payment
is expected to be made. Therefore, no assumption is included for changes in currency rates. See also Note 1(v) to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Management
reviews the adequacy of established loss reserves utilizing a number of analytical reserve development techniques. Through the use of these techniques, management is able to
monitor the adequacy of AIG's established reserves and determine appropriate assumptions for inflation. Also, analysis of emerging specific development patterns, such as case reserve redundancies or
deficiencies and IBNR emergence, allows management to determine any required adjustments.

The
"Analysis of Consolidated Losses and Loss Expense Reserve Development" table presents the development of net losses and loss expense reserves for calendar years 1999 through 2009.
Immediately following this table is a second table that presents all data on a basis that excludes asbestos and environmental net losses and loss expense reserve development. The opening reserves held
are shown at the top of the table for each year-end date. The amount of loss reserve discount included in the opening reserve at each date is shown immediately below the reserves held for
each year. The undiscounted reserve at each date is thus the sum of the discount and the reserve held.

The
upper half of the table presents the cumulative amounts paid during successive years related to the undiscounted opening loss reserves. For example, in the table that excludes
asbestos and environmental losses, with respect to the net losses and loss expense reserve of $28.65 billion at December 31, 2002, by the end of 2009 (seven years later)
$39.64 billion had actually been paid in settlement of these net loss reserves. In addition, as reflected in the lower section of the table, the original undiscounted reserve of
$30.15 billion was reestimated to be $50.79 billion at December 31, 2009. This increase from the original estimate generally results from a combination of a number of factors,
including claims being settled for larger amounts than originally estimated. The original estimates will also be increased or decreased as more information becomes known about the individual claims
and overall claim frequency and severity patterns. The redundancy (deficiency) depicted in the table, for any particular calendar year, presents the aggregate change in estimates over the period of
years subsequent to the calendar year reflected at the top of the respective column heading. For example, the deficiency of $2.62 billion at December 31, 2009 related to
December 31, 2008 net losses and loss expense reserves of $73.64 billion represents the cumulative amount by which reserves in 2008 and prior years have developed unfavorably during
2009.

American International Group, Inc., and Subsidiaries

The bottom of each table below presents the remaining undiscounted and discounted net loss reserve for each year. For example, in the table that excludes asbestos
and environmental losses, for the 2001 year-end, the remaining undiscounted reserves held at December 31, 2009 are $9.71 billion, with a corresponding discounted net
reserve of $8.98 billion.

*During 2009, Transatlantic was deconsolidated and 21st Century and HSB were sold. Immediately preceding these sales, the loss and loss expense reserves
for these entities totaled $9.6 billion. As a result of the sales and deconsolidation, these obligations ceased being the responsibility of AIG. The sales and deconsolidation are reflected in
the table above as a reduction in December 31, 2009 net reserves of $9.6 billion and as a $8.6 billion increase in paid losses for the years 1999 through 2008 to reflect no impact
on incurred losses for these periods.

The Liability for unpaid claims and claims adjustment expense as reported in AIG's Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2009 differs
from the total reserve reported in the Annual Statements filed with state insurance departments and, where appropriate, with foreign regulatory authorities. The differences at December 31, 2009
relate primarily to reserves for certain foreign operations not required to be reported in the United States for statutory reporting purposes. Further, statutory practices in the United States require
reserves to be shown net of applicable reinsurance recoverable.

The
reserve for gross losses and loss expenses is prior to reinsurance and represents the accumulation for reported losses and IBNR. Management reviews the adequacy of established gross
loss reserves in the manner previously described for net loss reserves.

For
further discussion regarding net reserves for losses and loss expenses, see Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations —

Domestic Life Insurance & Retirement Services Operations

AIG's Domestic Life Insurance & Retirement Services segment, rebranded as SunAmerica Financial Group in December 2009, is
comprised of several life insurance and retirement services businesses that market their products and services under the brands of American General, AGLA, VALIC, Western National, SunAmerica
Retirement Markets, SunAmerica Mutual Funds, SunAmerica Affordable Housing Partners, FSC Securities, Royal Alliance and SagePoint Financial. The businesses offer a comprehensive suite of life
insurance, retirement savings products and guaranteed income solutions through an established multi-channel distribution network that includes banks, national, regional and independent broker-dealers,
career financial advisors, wholesale life brokers, insurance agents and a direct-to-consumer platform.

AIG's
Domestic Life Insurance businesses offer a broad range of protection products, including individual term and universal life insurance and group life and health products. In
addition, Domestic Life Insurance offers a variety of payout annuities, which include single premium immediate annuities, structured settlements and terminal funding annuities.

Domestic
Retirement Services businesses offer group retirement products and individual fixed and variable annuities. Certain previously acquired closed blocks and other fixed and
variable annuity blocks that have been discontinued are reported as "runoff" annuities. Domestic Retirement Services also maintains a runoff block of Guaranteed Investment Contracts (GICs) that were
written in (or issued to) the institutional market place prior to 2006.

Results
for certain brokerage service, mutual fund, GIC and other asset management activities previously reported in the Asset Management segment are now included in Domestic Life
Insurance & Retirement Services.

Foreign Life Insurance & Retirement Services Operations

AIG's Foreign Life Insurance & Retirement Services operations include insurance and investment-oriented products such as whole
and term life, investment linked, universal life and endowments, personal accident and health products, group products, including pension, life and health, and fixed and variable annuities. The
Foreign Life Insurance & Retirement Services products are sold through independent producers, career agents, financial institutions and direct marketing channels.

AIG's
principal Foreign Life Insurance & Retirement Services operations include ALICO, AIG Star Life, AIG Edison Life, AIA and Philamlife ,which is now an AIA subsidiary. ALICO is
incorporated in Delaware and all of its business is written outside the United States. ALICO has operations either directly or through subsidiaries in Europe, including the U.K., Latin America, the
Caribbean, the Middle East, and Japan. AIA operates primarily in China (including Hong Kong), Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, Korea, Australia, New Zealand, Vietnam, Indonesia and India. The operations
in India are conducted through a joint venture, Tata AIG Life Insurance Company Limited. Philamlife is the largest life insurer in the Philippines. AIG Star Life and AIG Edison Life operate in Japan.

On
October 12, 2009, AIG entered into an agreement to sell its 97.57 percent share of Nan Shan Life Insurance Company, Ltd. (Nan Shan), for approximately
$2.15 billion. As a result of this transaction, Nan Shan qualified as a discontinued operation and met the criteria for "held-for-sale" accounting in the fourth quarter
of 2009. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.

Reinsurance Operations

Chartis subsidiaries operate worldwide primarily by underwriting and accepting risks for their direct account and securing reinsurance
on that portion of the risk in excess of the limit which they wish to retain. This operating policy differs from that of many insurance companies that will underwrite only up to their net retention
limit, thereby requiring the broker or agent to secure commitments from other underwriters for the remainder of the gross risk amount.

AIG classes of business, including Commercial Insurance, AIU and AIG Risk Finance, as well as certain life insurance subsidiaries, use AIRCO as a reinsurer for certain of their
businesses. In Bermuda, AIRCO discounts reserves attributable to certain classes of general insurance business assumed from other AIG subsidiaries.

a further discussion of reinsurance, see Item 1A. Risk Factors — Reinsurance; Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations — Risk Management — Insurance Risk Management — Reinsurance.

Insurance Investment Operations

A significant portion of AIG's General Insurance and Domestic and Foreign Life Insurance & Retirement Services revenues are
derived from AIG's insurance investment operations.

The following table summarizes the investment results of AIG's insurance operations, excluding the results of discontinued operations:

AIG's worldwide insurance investment policy places primary emphasis on investments in government and fixed income securities in all of its
portfolios and, to a lesser extent, investments in high-yield bonds, common stocks, real estate, hedge funds and other alternative investments, in order to enhance returns on
policyholders' funds and generate net investment income. The ability to implement this policy is somewhat limited in certain territories as there may be a lack of attractive long-term
investment opportunities or investment restrictions may be imposed by the local regulatory authorities.

Financial Services Operations

AIG's Financial Services subsidiaries engage in diversified activities including aircraft leasing, capital markets, consumer finance
and insurance premium finance. Together, the Aircraft Leasing, Capital Markets and Consumer Finance operations generate the majority of the revenues produced by the Financial Services operations. A.I.
Credit also contributes to Financial Services results principally by providing insurance premium financing for both AIG's policyholders and those of other insurers.

Aircraft
Leasing

AIG's
Aircraft Leasing operations are the operations of ILFC, which generates its revenues primarily from leasing new and used commercial jet aircraft to
foreign and domestic airlines. Revenues also result from the remarketing of commercial jet aircraft for ILFC's own account, and remarketing and fleet management services for airlines and financial
institutions.

Capital
Markets

Capital
Markets is comprised of the operations of AIGFP, which engaged as principal in a wide variety of financial transactions, including standard and
customized financial products involving commodities, credit, currencies, energy, equities and interest rates. AIGFP also invests in a diversified portfolio of securities and principal investments and
engages in borrowing activities that involve issuing standard and structured notes and other securities and entering into guaranteed investment agreements (GIAs). Due to the extreme market conditions
experienced in 2008, the downgrades of AIG's credit ratings by the rating agencies, as well as AIG's intent to refocus on its core businesses, beginning in late 2008 and continuing through 2009 AIGFP
has been unwinding its businesses and portfolios. See Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — 2010 Business
Outlook — Financial Services.

Consumer
Finance

AIG's
Consumer Finance operations in North America are principally conducted through AGF. AGF derives most of its revenues from finance charges assessed on
real estate loans, secured and unsecured non-real estate loans and retail sales finance receivables.

AIG's
foreign consumer finance operations are principally conducted through AIGCFG. AIGCFG operates primarily in emerging and developing markets. During 2009, AIG divested most of the
AIGCFG operations. As of December 31, 2009, AIGCFG had operations in Argentina, Taiwan, India, Colombia and Poland. The operations in Poland, at December 31, 2009, were under contract
for sale and met the criteria for held for sale accounting in 2009.

Other Operations

AIG's Other operations includes results from Parent & Other operations, after allocations to AIG's business segments, results
from noncore businesses and gains and losses on sales of divested businesses.

Parent &
Other

AIG's
Parent & Other operations consists primarily of interest expense, restructuring costs, expenses of corporate staff not attributable to specific
reportable segments, expenses related to efforts to
improve internal controls, corporate initiatives, certain compensation plan expenses, corporate level net realized capital gains and losses, certain litigation related charges and net gains and losses
on sale of divested businesses.

Noncore
Businesses

Noncore
businesses include results of certain businesses that have been divested or are being wound down or repositioned.

Noncore Insurance Businesses

Beginning in 2009, in order to better align financial reporting with the manner in which AIG's chief operating decision makers review
AIG's businesses to make decisions about resources to be allocated and to assess performance, the results for United Guaranty Corporation (UGC), Transatlantic, 21st Century and HSB are included
in AIG's Other operations category. These amounts were previously reported as part of General Insurance operations. Prior period amounts have been revised to conform to the current presentation. As a
result of the current year dispositions of 21st Century and HSB, and the deconsolidation of Transatlantic, only UGC is still reporting ongoing results of operations. See Management's Discussion
and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Capital Resources and Liquidity — AIG's Strategy for Stabilization and Repayment of its
Obligations as They Come Due — Asset Disposition Plan — Sales of Businesses and Specific Asset Dispositions for further discussion.

American International Group, Inc., and Subsidiaries

Mortgage Guaranty

The main business of the subsidiaries of UGC is the issuance of residential mortgage guaranty insurance, both domestically and
internationally, that covers the first loss for credit defaults on high loan-to-value first-lien mortgages for the purchase or refinance of one- to
four-family residences.

During
2008, UGC tightened underwriting guidelines and increased premium rates for its first-lien business, ceased insuring second-lien business as of
September 30, 2008 and during the fourth quarter of 2008 ceased insuring new private student loan business and suspended insuring new business throughout its European operations. All of these
actions were in response to the worsening conditions in the global housing markets and resulted in a significant decline in new business written during the second half of 2008 through 2009.

Transatlantic

On June 10, 2009, AIG closed the previously announced secondary public offering of 29.9 million shares of Transatlantic
common stock owned directly and indirectly by AIG for aggregate gross proceeds of $1.1 billion. As of the close of the offering, AIG indirectly retained 13.9 percent of the Transatlantic
common stock issued and outstanding. As of December 31, 2009, after confirmation from the New York Insurance Department that AIG is not considered to control Transatlantic, AIG no longer
considers Transatlantic to be a related party.

Noncore Asset Management Operations

With the announced sale of AIG's investment advisory and third party Institutional Asset Management business (excluding the Global Real
Estate investment management business), AIG will no longer benefit from the management fee and carried interest cash flows from these businesses, but the sale will reduce operating costs related to
AIG's asset management activities. Asset Management is no longer considered a reportable segment, and the results for these Asset Management operations described below have been presented as a Noncore
business in AIG's Other operations category. Brokerage service commissions, other asset management fees, and investment income from GICs previously reported in the Asset Management segment are now
included in the Domestic Life Insurance & Retirement Services segment. Results for prior periods have been revised accordingly.

Matched Investment Program

AIG's Matched Investment Program (MIP) is a spread-based investment operation which invests primarily in fixed maturity securities
(corporate and structured), loans and, to a lesser extent, single name credit default swaps. Due to the extreme market conditions experienced in 2008 and the downgrades of AIG's credit ratings, the
MIP is currently in run-off. No additional debt issuances are expected for the MIP for the foreseeable future.

Institutional Asset Management Business

AIG's Institutional Asset Management business, conducted through AIG Global Asset Management Holdings Corp. and its subsidiaries and
affiliated companies (collectively, AIG Investments), provides an array of investment products and services globally to institutional investors, pension funds, AIG subsidiaries, AIG affiliates and
high net worth investors. These products include traditional equity and fixed maturity securities, and a wide range of real estate and alternative asset classes. Services include investment advisory
and sub-advisory services, investment monitoring and transaction structuring. Within the equity and fixed maturity asset classes, AIG Investments offers various forms of structured
investments. Within the alternative asset class, AIG Investments offers hedge and private equity funds and fund-of-funds, direct investments and distressed debt investments.
AIG Global Real Estate Investment Corp. (AIG Global Real Estate) provides a wide range of real estate investment, development and management services for AIG subsidiaries, as well as for third-party
institutional investors, pension funds and high net worth investors. AIG Global Real Estate also maintains a proprietary real estate investment portfolio through various joint venture platforms.

On
September 5, 2009, AIG entered into an agreement to sell its investment advisory and third party Institutional Asset Management businesses. This sale will exclude those asset
management businesses providing traditional fixed

income
asset and liability management for AIG's insurance company subsidiaries and the AIG Global Real Estate investment management business, as well as proprietary real estate and private equity
investments. AIG expects to continue relationships with the divested businesses for other investment management services used by its insurance company subsidiaries. Upon completion of the sale, AIG
will no longer benefit from the management fee and carried interest cash flow from these businesses, but the sale will reduce operating costs related to AIG's asset management activities.

For
additional information regarding the business of AIG on a consolidated basis, the contributions made to AIG's consolidated revenues and pre-tax income and the assets held
by General Insurance, Domestic Life Insurance & Retirement Services, Foreign Life Insurance & Retirement Services, Financial Services and the Other operations category, see Selected
Financial Data, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Notes 1 and 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Locations of Certain Assets

As of December 31, 2009, approximately 44 percent of the consolidated assets of AIG were located in foreign countries (other
than Canada), including $6.9 billion of cash and securities on deposit with foreign regulatory authorities. Foreign operations and assets held abroad may be adversely affected by political
developments in foreign countries, including tax changes, nationalization and changes in regulatory policy, as well as by consequence of hostilities and unrest. The risks of such occurrences and their
overall effect upon AIG vary from country to country and cannot easily be predicted. If expropriation or nationalization does occur, AIG's policy is to take all appropriate measures to seek recovery
of such assets. Certain of the countries in which AIG's business is conducted have currency restrictions which generally cause a delay in a company's ability to repatriate assets and profits. See also
Item 1A. Risk Factors — Foreign Operations and Notes 1 and 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Regulation

AIG's operations around the world are subject to regulation by many different types of regulatory authorities, including insurance,
securities, investment advisory, banking and thrift regulators in the United States and abroad. AIG's operations have become more diverse and consumer-oriented, increasing the scope of regulatory
supervision and the possibility of intervention. In light of AIG's liquidity problems beginning in the third quarter of 2008, AIG and its regulated subsidiaries have been subject to intense review and
supervision around the world. Regulators have taken significant steps to protect the businesses of the entities they regulate. These steps have included:

•restricting or prohibiting the payment of dividends to AIG parent and its subsidiaries;•restricting or prohibiting other payments to AIG parent and its subsidiaries;•requesting additional capital contributions from AIG parent;•requesting that intercompany reinsurance reserves be covered by assets locally;•restricting the business in which the subsidiaries may engage;•requiring pre-approval of all proposed transactions between the regulated subsidiaries and AIG parent or with
any affiliate; and•requiring more frequent reporting, including with respect to capital and liquidity positions.

These
and other actions have made it challenging for AIG to continue to engage in business in the ordinary course. AIG does not expect these conditions to change significantly in the
foreseeable future.

In
1999, AIG became a unitary thrift holding company within the meaning of the Home Owners' Loan Act (HOLA) when the Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS) granted AIG approval to organize
AIG Federal Savings Bank. AIG is subject to OTS regulation, examination, supervision and reporting requirements. In addition, the OTS has enforcement authority over AIG and its subsidiaries. Among
other things, this permits the OTS to restrict or prohibit

13            AIG 2009 Form 10-K








American International Group, Inc., and Subsidiaries



activities
that are determined to be a serious risk to the financial safety, soundness or stability of AIG's subsidiary savings association, AIG Federal Savings Bank.

Under
prior law, a unitary savings and loan holding company, such as AIG, was not restricted as to the types of business in which it could engage, provided that its savings association
subsidiary continued to be a qualified thrift lender. The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 (GLBA) provides that no company may acquire control of an OTS regulated institution after May 4, 1999
unless it engages only in the financial activities permitted for financial holding companies under the law or for multiple savings and loan holding companies. The GLBA, however, grandfathered the
unrestricted authority for activities with respect to a unitary savings and loan holding company existing prior to May 4, 1999, so long as its savings association subsidiary continues to be a
qualified thrift lender under the HOLA. As a unitary savings and loan holding company whose application was pending as of May 4, 1999, AIG is grandfathered under the GLBA and generally is not
restricted under existing laws as to the types of business activities in which it may engage, provided that AIG Federal Savings Bank continues to be a qualified thrift lender under the HOLA.

Certain
states require registration and periodic reporting by insurance companies that are licensed in such states and are controlled by other corporations. Applicable legislation
typically requires periodic disclosure concerning the corporation that controls the registered insurer and the other companies in the holding company system and prior approval of intercorporate
services and transfers of assets (including in some instances payment of dividends by the insurance subsidiary) within the holding company system. AIG's subsidiaries are registered under such
legislation in those states that have such requirements.

AIG's
insurance subsidiaries, in common with other insurers, are subject to regulation and supervision by the states and by other jurisdictions in which they do business. Within the
United States, the method of such regulation varies but generally has its source in statutes that delegate regulatory and supervisory powers to an insurance official. The regulation and supervision
relate primarily to approval of policy forms and rates, the standards of solvency that must be met and maintained, including risk-based capital, the licensing of insurers and their agents,
the nature of and limitations on investments, restrictions on the size of risks that may be insured under a single policy, deposits of securities for the benefit of policyholders, requirements for
acceptability of reinsurers, periodic examinations of the affairs of insurance companies, the form and content of reports of financial condition required to be filed, and reserves for unearned
premiums, losses and other purposes. In general, such regulation is for the protection of policyholders rather than the equity owners of these companies.

AIG
has taken various steps to enhance the capital positions of the Chartis U.S. companies. AIG entered into capital maintenance agreements with these companies that set forth procedures
through which AIG has provided, and expects to continue to provide, capital support. Also, in order to allow the Chartis companies to record as an admitted asset at December 31, 2009 certain
reinsurance ceded to non-U.S. reinsurers (which has the effect of maintaining the level of the statutory surplus of such companies), AIG obtained and entered into reimbursement agreements
for approximately $1.5 billion of letters of credit issued by several commercial banks in favor of certain Chartis companies and funded trusts totaling $2.8 billion.

In
the U.S., the Risk-Based Capital (RBC) formula is designed to measure the adequacy of an insurer's statutory surplus in relation to the risks inherent in its business.
Thus, inadequately capitalized general and life insurance companies may be identified. The U.S. RBC formula develops a risk-adjusted target level of statutory surplus by applying certain
factors to various asset, premium and reserve items. Higher factors are applied to more risky items and lower factors are applied to less risky items. Thus, the target level of statutory surplus
varies not only as a result of the insurer's size, but also based on the risk profile of the insurer's operations.

The
RBC Model Law provides for four incremental levels of regulatory attention for insurers whose surplus is below the calculated RBC target. These levels of attention range in severity
from requiring the insurer to submit a plan for corrective action to placing the insurer under regulatory control.

The
statutory surplus of each of the U.S.-based life and property and casualty insurance subsidiaries exceeded their RBC minimum required levels as of December 31, 2009.

AIG 2009 Form 10-K            14








American International Group, Inc., and Subsidiaries

To
the extent that any of AIG's insurance entities would fall below prescribed levels of statutory surplus, it would be AIG's intention, subject to FRBNY approval, to provide appropriate
capital or other types of support to that entity.

A
substantial portion of AIG's general insurance business and a majority of its life insurance business is conducted in foreign countries. The degree of regulation and supervision in
foreign jurisdictions varies. Generally, AIG, as well as the underwriting companies operating in such jurisdictions, must satisfy local regulatory requirements. Licenses issued by foreign authorities
to AIG subsidiaries are subject to modification or revocation by such authorities, and these subsidiaries could be prevented from conducting business in certain of the jurisdictions where they
currently operate.

In
addition to licensing requirements, AIG's foreign operations are also regulated in various jurisdictions with respect to currency, policy language and terms, advertising, amount and
type of security deposits, amount and type of reserves, amount and type of capital to be held, amount and type of local investment and the share of profits to be returned to policyholders on
participating policies. Some foreign countries regulate rates on various types of policies. Certain countries have established reinsurance institutions, wholly or partially owned by the local
government, to which admitted insurers are obligated to cede a portion of their business on terms that may not always allow foreign insurers, including AIG subsidiaries, full compensation. In some
countries, regulations governing constitution of technical reserves and remittance balances may hinder remittance of profits and repatriation of assets.

See
Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Capital Resources and Liquidity — Regulation and
Supervision and Note 17 to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Competition

AIG's businesses operate in highly competitive environments, both domestically and overseas. Principal sources of competition are
insurance companies, banks, investment banks and other non-bank financial institutions.

The
insurance industry in particular is highly competitive. Within the United States, Chartis subsidiaries compete with approximately 3,300 other stock companies, specialty insurance
organizations, mutual companies and other underwriting organizations. AIG's Domestic Life Insurance & Retirement Services subsidiaries compete in the United States with approximately 1,900 life
insurance companies and other participants in related financial services fields. Overseas, AIG's subsidiaries compete for business with the foreign insurance operations of large U.S. insurers and with
global insurance groups and local companies in particular areas in which they are active.

As
a result of the reduction of the credit ratings of AIG and its subsidiaries, uncertainty relating to AIG's financial condition and AIG's asset disposition plan, AIG's businesses have
faced and continue to face intense competition to retain existing customers and to maintain business with existing customers and counterparties at historical levels. Further, AIG has been and
continues to be at a significant disadvantage in certain markets in soliciting new customers. Although surrender rates have begun to stabilize, AIG expects these difficult conditions to continue for
the foreseeable future.

Competition
is also intense for key employees. The announced asset dispositions, limitations placed by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 and the Special Master for
Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) Executive Compensation on compensation arrangements and programs, decline in AIG's common stock price and uncertainty surrounding AIG's financial condition have
adversely affected AIG's ability to retain and motivate key employees and to attract new employees. It is unclear whether, for the foreseeable future, AIG will be able to create a compensation
structure that permits AIG to retain and motivate key employees.

For
a further discussion of the risks relating to retaining existing customers, soliciting new customers and retaining key employees, see item 1A. Risk Factors.

Other Information about AIG

At December 31, 2009, AIG and its subsidiaries had approximately 96,000 employees.

Directors and Executive Officers of AIG

All directors of AIG are elected for one-year terms at the annual meeting of shareholders. In addition, the terms of each
of the AIG Series E Fixed Rate Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, par value $5.00 per share, (AIG Series E Preferred Stock) and the AIG Series F Fixed Rate
Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, par value $5.00 per share, (AIG Series F Preferred Stock) provide for the election of the greater of two additional directors or up to
20 percent of the total number of AIG directors (rounded up after giving effect to the election) upon a failure of AIG to make four quarterly dividend payments, whether or not consecutive.
These preferred directors would be elected by a majority of the votes cast by the holder of the AIG Series E Preferred Stock and the AIG Series F Preferred Stock, voting together as a
single class. If elected, such preferred directors would hold office until the next annual meeting (or special meeting called to elect directors) or until all dividends payable on all outstanding
shares of the AIG Series E Preferred Stock and the AIG Series F Preferred Stock have been declared and paid in full for four consecutive quarters. As of February 17, 2010, the
holder of the AIG Series E Preferred Stock and the AIG Series F Preferred Stock had not elected any directors pursuant to the provision, although AIG had failed to make four quarterly
dividend payments.
