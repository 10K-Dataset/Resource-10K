The project is supported by long-term commitments and is expected to be completed in mid-2021.



DCP Midstream



Our Midstream segment includes our50%equity investment in DCP Midstream, which is headquartered in Denver, Colorado.  AtDecember 31, 2019, DCP Midstream, through its subsidiary DCP Midstream, LP (DCP Partners), owned or operated 44 active natural gas processing facilities, with a net processing capacity of approximately 6.5 billion cubic feet per day (Bcf/d).  DCP Midstream’s owned or operated natural gas pipeline systems included gathering services for these facilities, as well as natural gas transmission, and totaled approximately 58,000 miles of pipeline.  DCP Midstream also owned or operated 11 NGL fractionation plants, along with natural gas and NGL storage facilities, and NGL pipelines.



The residual natural gas, primarily methane, which results from processing raw natural gas, is sold by DCP Midstream at market-based prices to marketers and end users, including large industrial companies, natural gas distribution companies and electric utilities.  DCP Midstream purchases or takes custody of substantially all of its raw natural gas from producers, principally under contractual arrangements that expose DCP Midstream to the prices of NGL, natural gas and condensate.  DCP Midstream also has fee-based arrangements with producers to provide midstream services such as gathering and processing.  In addition, DCP Midstream markets a portion of its NGL to us and our equity affiliates under existing contracts.



On November 6, 2019, DCP Partners completed a transaction to eliminate all general partner economic interests in DCP Partners and IDRs in exchange for 65 million newly issued DCP Partners common units.

CHEMICALS



The Chemicals segment consists of our 50% equity investment in CPChem, which is headquartered in The Woodlands, Texas.  At December 31,2019, CPChem owned or had joint venture interests in 28 manufacturing facilities located in Belgium, Colombia, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Singapore and the United States.  Additionally, CPChem has two research and development centers in the United States.



We structure our reporting of CPChem’s operations around two primary business lines: Olefins and Polyolefins (O&P) and Specialties, Aromatics and Styrenics (SA&S).  The O&P business line produces and markets ethylene and other olefin products.  The ethylene produced is primarily used by CPChem to produce polyethylene, normal alpha olefins (NAO) and polyethylene pipe.  The SA&S business line manufactures and markets aromatics and styrenics products, such as benzene, cyclohexane, styrene and polystyrene.  SA&S also manufactures and/or markets a variety of specialty chemical products including organosulfur chemicals, solvents, catalysts, and chemicals used in drilling and mining.



The manufacturing of petrochemicals and plastics involves the conversion of hydrocarbon-based raw material feedstocks into higher-value products, often through a thermal process referred to in the industry as “cracking.”  For example, ethylene can be produced by cracking ethane, propane, butane, natural gasoline or certain refinery liquids, such as naphtha and gas oil.  Ethylene primarily is used as a raw material in the production of plastics, such as polyethylene and polyvinyl chloride (PVC).  Plastic resins, such as polyethylene, are manufactured in a thermal/catalyst process, and the produced output is used as a further raw material for various applications, such as packaging and plastic pipe.
