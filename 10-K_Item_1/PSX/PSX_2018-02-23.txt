Items 1 and 2.  BUSINESS AND PROPERTIES







CORPORATE STRUCTURE



Phillips 66, headquartered in Houston, Texas, was incorporated in Delaware in 2011 in connection with, and in anticipation of, a restructuring of ConocoPhillips that separated its downstream businesses into an independent, publicly traded company named Phillips 66.  The two companies were separated by ConocoPhillips distributing to its stockholders all the shares of common stock of Phillips 66 after the market closed on April 30, 2012 (the Separation).  Phillips 66 stock trades on the New York Stock Exchange under the “PSX” stock symbol.



Our business is organized into four operating segments:



1)Midstream—Provides crude oil and refined products transportation, terminaling and processing services, as well as natural gas, natural gas liquids (NGL) and liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) transportation, storage, processing and marketing services, mainly in the United States.This segment includes our master limited partnership (MLP), Phillips 66 Partners LP (Phillips 66 Partners), as well as our50 percentequity investment in DCP Midstream, LLC (DCP Midstream).



2)Chemicals—Consists of our50 percentequity investment in Chevron Phillips Chemical Company LLC (CPChem), which manufactures and markets petrochemicals and plastics on a worldwide basis.



3)Refining—Refines crude oil and other feedstocks into petroleum products (such as gasoline, distillates and aviation fuels) at13refineries in the United States and Europe.



4)Marketing and Specialties—Purchases for resale and markets refined petroleum products, mainly in the United States and Europe.  In addition, this segment includes the manufacturing and marketing of specialty products (such as base oils and lubricants), as well as power generation operations.



Corporate and Other includes general corporate overhead, interest expense, our investment in new technologies and various other corporate activities.  Corporate assets include all cash and cash equivalents.



AtDecember 31, 2017, Phillips 66 had approximately14,600employees.

•DCP Midstream—Gathers, processes, transports and markets natural gas and transports, fractionates and markets NGL.



Phillips 66 Partners

In 2013, we formed Phillips 66 Partners, an MLP, to own, operate, develop and acquire primarily fee-based crude oil, refined petroleum products and NGL pipelines and terminals, as well as other midstream assets.At December 31, 2017, we owned a55 percentlimited partner interest and a2 percentgeneral partner interest in Phillips 66 Partners, while the public owned a43 percentlimited partner interest and13.8 millionperpetual convertible preferred units.



Headquartered in Houston, Texas, Phillips 66 Partners’ assets and equity investments currently consist of crude oil, refined petroleum products and NGL transportation, terminaling and storage systems, as well as crude oil and NGL processing facilities, that are geographically dispersed throughout the United States.  The majority of Phillips 66 Partners’ assets are integral to Phillips 66-operated refineries.



During2017, Phillips 66 Partners expanded its business by acquiring from us:



•A 25 percent interest in both Dakota Access, LLC (Dakota Access) and Energy Transfer Crude Oil Company, LLC (ETCO), which collectively own the Bakken Pipeline.

The Beaumont Terminal in Nederland, Texas, is the largest terminal in the Phillips 66 portfolio.  During 2017, we continued to invest in the terminal by adding 0.9 million barrels of crude storage capacity and 1.3 million barrels of products storage.  AtDecember 31, 2017, including these additions, the terminal capacity was 11.1 million barrels, of which 7.4 million barrels was crude oil storage capacity and 3.7 million barrels was refined product storage capacity.  We have 3.5 million barrels of incremental crude storage capacity under construction that will be commissioned throughout 2018.  In addition, during the fourth quarter of 2017, we completed expansion of the terminal’s export facilities from 400,000 to 600,000 barrels per day (BPD).  We have also initiated a variety of other projects aimed at increasing storage and throughput capabilities as we continue the expansion of the Beaumont terminal to 16 million barrels.



The Bakken Pipeline went into commercial service in June 2017.  The pipeline is approximately 1,915 miles long with an estimated capacity of 525,000 BPD atDecember 31, 2017.  Phillips 66 Partners has a 25 percent interest in the Bakken Pipeline, through its 25 percent interests in both the Dakota Access and ETCO joint ventures.  Energy Transfer Partners, L.P. (ETP) and MarEn Bakken Company LLC also have 38.25 percent and 36.75 percent interests, respectively, in the Bakken Pipeline, with ETP serving as the operator.  The Dakota Access section of the Bakken Pipeline is approximately 1,172 miles long and delivers crude oil from the Bakken/Three Forks production area in North Dakota to a storage and terminaling hub outside of Patoka, Illinois, which includes an interconnection with the ETCO pipeline.  The ETCO pipeline section of the Bakken Pipeline is approximately 743 miles long and transports crude oil from the Midwest to Phillips 66 and ETP storage terminals located in Nederland, Texas.

Truck movements are provided through numerous third-party trucking companies, as well as through our 100-percent-owned subsidiary, Sentinel Transportation LLC.



NGL and Other



Our NGL and Other business includes the following:



•A U.S. Gulf Coast NGL market hub comprising the Freeport LPG Export Terminal and Phillips 66 Partners’ 100,000 BPD Sweeny Fractionator.  These assets are supported by 9 million barrels of gross capacity at Phillips 66 Partners’ Clemens storage facility.  We refer to these facilities as the “Sweeny Hub.”



•A 22.5 percent interest in Gulf Coast Fractionators, which owns an NGL fractionation plant in Mont Belvieu, Texas.  We operate the facility, and our net share of its capacity is 32,625 BPD.



•A 12.5 percent undivided interest in a fractionation plant in Mont Belvieu, Texas.  Our net share of its capacity is 30,250 BPD.



•A 40 percent undivided interest in a fractionation plant in Conway, Kansas.  Our net share of its capacity is 43,200 BPD.



•Phillips 66 Partners owns the River Parish NGL logistics system in southeast Louisiana, comprising approximately 500 miles of pipelines and a storage cavern connecting multiple fractionation facilities, refineries and a petrochemical facility.



•Phillips 66 Partners owns a direct one-third interest in both the DCP Sand Hills Pipeline, LLC (Sand Hills) and DCP Southern Hills Pipeline, LLC, which own pipelines that connect Eagle Ford, Permian and Midcontinent production to the Mont Belvieu, Texas, market.



•Phillips 66 Partners, through its ownership of MSLP, owns a 125,000 BPD capacity vacuum distillation unit and a 70,000 BPD capacity delayed coker unit located at our Sweeny Refinery in Old Ocean, Texas.



The Sweeny Fractionator is located adjacent to our Sweeny Refinery in Old Ocean, Texas, and supplies purity ethane to the petrochemical industry and LPG to domestic and global markets.  Raw NGL supply to the fractionator is delivered from nearby major pipelines, including the Sand Hills Pipeline.

The Freeport LPG Export Terminal leverages our fractionation, transportation and storage infrastructure to supply petrochemical, heating and transportation markets globally.  The terminal can simultaneously load two ships with refrigerated propane and butane at a combined rate of 36,000 barrels per hour.  In support of the terminal, a 100,000 BPD unit to upgrade domestic propane for export was installed near the Sweeny Fractionator.  In addition, the terminal exports 10,000 to 15,000 BPD of natural gasoline (C5+) produced at the Sweeny Fractionator.



MSLP processes long residue, which is produced from heavy sour crude oil, for a processing fee.  The fuel-grade petroleum coke and other by-products produced as a result of the processing are retained by our Sweeny Refinery.








Table of ContentsIndex to Financial Statements



During 2017, Phillips 66 Partners continued development of a new 25,000 BPD isomerization unit at our Lake Charles Refinery to increase production of higher octane gasoline blend components.  The project is expected to be completed by the end of 2019.



DCP Midstream



Our Midstream segment includes our 50 percent equity investment in DCP Midstream, which is headquartered in Denver, Colorado.  As ofDecember 31, 2017, DCP Midstream owned or operated 61 natural gas processing facilities, with a net processing capacity of approximately 7.8 billion cubic feet per day (Bcf/d).  DCP Midstream’s owned or operated natural gas pipeline systems included gathering services for these facilities, as well as natural gas transmission, and totaled approximately 63,000 miles of pipeline.  DCP Midstream also owned or operated 12 NGL fractionation plants, along with natural gas and NGL storage facilities, a propane wholesale marketing business and NGL pipeline assets.



The residual natural gas, primarily methane, which results from processing raw natural gas, is sold by DCP Midstream at market-based prices to marketers and end users, including large industrial companies, natural gas distribution companies and electric utilities.  DCP Midstream purchases or takes custody of substantially all of its raw natural gas from producers, principally under contractual arrangements that expose DCP Midstream to the prices of NGL, natural gas and condensate.  DCP Midstream also has fee-based arrangements with producers to provide midstream services such as gathering and processing.



DCP Midstream markets a portion of its NGL to us and CPChem under existing contracts.  The primary commitment on certain contracts began a ratable wind-down period in December 2014 and expires in January 2019.  These purchase commitments are on an “if-produced, will-purchase” basis.

During 2017, DCP Midstream completed or advanced the following growth projects:

•In the first quarter of 2017, DCP Midstream announced the construction of a 200-million-cubic-feet-per-day (MMcf/d) natural gas processing plant, the Mewbourn 3 plant, and further expansion of its Grand Parkway gathering system.  Both are located in the Denver-Julesburg (DJ) Basin and are expected to be in service in the third quarter of 2018.

•In the second quarter of 2017, DCP Midstream approved the 200 MMcf/d O'Connor 2 natural gas processing plant in the DJ Basin.  The O'Connor 2 plant and associated gathering infrastructure are expected to be in service in 2019.

•In the second quarter of 2017, DCP Midstream increased capacity in the DJ Basin by up to 40 MMcf/d by placing additional field compression and plant bypass infrastructure in service.

•In the third quarter of 2017, DCP Midstream executed definitive joint-venture agreements on its 25 percent interest in the development of the Gulf Coast Express pipeline project (GCX project).  The GCX project is designed to transport up to 1.98 Bcf/d of natural gas.  The mostly 42-inch pipeline would traverse approximately 500 miles and be placed in service in 2019, pending regulatory approvals.

•DCP Midstream is jointly developing the Cheyenne Connector pipeline with Tallgrass Energy Partners, LP (Tallgrass) and Western Gas Partners, LP (Western Gas).  Tallgrass serves as the operator, and both DCP Midstream and Western Gas hold an option to invest in this pipeline at a later date.  The Cheyenne Connector pipeline will provide takeaway solutions with capacity of at least 600 MMcf/d for DCP Midstream's DJ Basin assets, connecting natural gas to REX’s Cheyenne Hub, where it can then be delivered to numerous demand markets across the country.

•DCP Midstream is currently expanding the Sand Hills Pipeline to 365,000 BPD, which is expected to be completed in the first quarter of 2018.  Further expansion to 450,000 BPD is progressing and is expected to be in service during the second half of 2018.  This expansion includes a partial looping of the pipeline and the addition of new pump stations.

Effective January 1, 2017, DCP Midstream and its master limited partnership (then named DCP Midstream Partners, LP, subsequently renamed DCP Midstream, LP on January 11, 2017, and referred to herein as DCP Partners) closed a transaction in which DCP Midstream contributed subsidiaries owning all of its operating assets and its existing debt to DCP Partners, in exchange for approximately 31.1 million DCP Partners units.  Following the transaction, we and our co-venturer retained our 50/50 investment in DCP Midstream, DCP Midstream retained its incentive distribution rights in DCP Partners through its ownership of the general partner of DCP Partners, and DCP Midstream held a 36 percent limited partner interest and a 2 percent general partner interest in DCP Partners.  See the “Equity Affiliates” section of “Significant Sources of Capital” in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” for additional information on this transaction.







CHEMICALS



The Chemicals segment consists of our 50 percent equity investment in CPChem, which is headquartered in The Woodlands, Texas.  At the end of2017, CPChem owned or had joint-venture interests in 30 global manufacturing facilities and two U.S. research and development centers.



We structure our reporting of CPChem’s operations around two primary business segments: Olefins and Polyolefins (O&P) and Specialties, Aromatics and Styrenics (SA&S).  The O&P business segment produces and markets ethylene and other olefin products; the ethylene produced is primarily consumed within CPChem for the production of polyethylene, normal alpha olefins (NAO) and polyethylene pipe.  The SA&S business segment manufactures and markets aromatics and styrenics products, such as benzene, styrene, paraxylene and cyclohexane, as well as polystyrene.  SA&S also manufactures and/or markets a variety of specialty chemical products including organosulfur chemicals, solvents, catalysts, drilling chemicals and mining chemicals.



The manufacturing of petrochemicals and plastics involves the conversion of hydrocarbon-based raw material feedstocks into higher-value products, often through a thermal process referred to in the industry as “cracking.”  For example, ethylene can be produced from cracking the feedstocks ethane, propane, butane, natural gasoline or certain refinery liquids, such as naphtha and gas oil.  The produced ethylene has a number of uses, primarily as a raw material in the production of plastics, such as polyethylene and polyvinyl chloride.  Plastic resins, such as polyethylene, are manufactured in a thermal/catalyst process, and the produced output is used as a further raw material for various applications, such as packaging and plastic pipe.



CPChem and its equity affiliates have manufacturing facilities located in Belgium, China, Colombia, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Singapore and the United States.
