Items 1 and 2.  BUSINESS AND PROPERTIES







CORPORATE STRUCTURE



Phillips 66, headquartered in Houston, Texas, was incorporated in Delaware in 2011 in connection with, and in anticipation of, a restructuring of ConocoPhillips that separated its downstream businesses into an independent, publicly traded company named Phillips 66.  The two companies were separated by ConocoPhillips distributing to its stockholders all the shares of common stock of Phillips 66 after the market closed on April 30, 2012 (the Separation).  On May 1, 2012, Phillips 66 stock began trading “regular-way” on the New York Stock Exchange under the “PSX” stock symbol.



Our business is organized into four operating segments:

SEGMENT AND GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION



For operating segment and geographic information, seeNote 26—Segment Disclosures and Related Information, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which is incorporated herein by reference.







MIDSTREAM



The Midstream segment consists of three business lines:



•Transportation—Transports crude oil and other feedstocks to our refineries and other locations, delivers refined and specialty products to market, and provides terminaling and storage services for crude oil and petroleum products.



•DCP Midstream—Gathers, processes, transports and markets natural gas and transports, fractionates and markets NGL.

Phillips 66 Partners LP

In 2013, we formed Phillips 66 Partners LP, a master limited partnership (MLP), to own, operate, develop and acquire primarily fee-based crude oil, refined petroleum product and NGL pipelines and terminals, as well as other midstream assets.  At December 31, 2016, we owned a59 percentlimited partner interest and a2 percentgeneral partner interest in Phillips 66 Partners, while the public owned a39 percentlimited partner interest.



Headquartered in Houston, Texas, Phillips 66 Partners’ assets and equity investments consist of crude oil, NGL and refined petroleum product pipelines, terminals, rail racks and storage systems, as well as an NGL fractionator, that are geographically dispersed throughout the United States.  The majority of Phillips 66 Partners’ assets are integral to Phillips 66-operated refineries.



During 2016, Phillips 66 Partners expanded its business by acquiring from us:



•A 25 percent interest in our then wholly owned subsidiary, Phillips 66 Sweeny Frac LLC, which owns both the Sweeny Fractionator, an NGL fractionator located within our Sweeny Refinery complex in Old Ocean, Texas, and the Clemens Caverns, an NGL salt dome storage facility located near Brazoria, Texas. This acquisition closed in March 2016.



•The remaining 75 percent interest in Phillips 66 Sweeny Frac LLC and a 100 percent interest in our then wholly owned subsidiary, Phillips 66 Plymouth LLC, which owned Standish Pipeline, a refined petroleum product pipeline system extending from Phillips 66’s Ponca City Refinery in Ponca City, Oklahoma, and terminating at Phillips 66 Partners’ North Wichita Terminal in Wichita, Kansas. This acquisition closed in May 2016.



•A large number of crude oil, refined product and NGL pipeline and terminal assets supporting the Billings, Ponca City, Bayway and Borger refineries. This acquisition, Phillips 66 Partners’ largest to date, closed in October 2016.



During 2016, Phillips 66 Partners expanded its business through the following transactions with third parties:



•During the third quarter of 2016, Phillips 66 Partners acquired an additional 2.5 percent equity interest in the Explorer Pipeline Company (Explorer), resulting in total ownership of approximately 22 percent. Explorer is a 1,830-mile pipeline that transports gasoline, diesel, fuel oil, and jet fuel to more than 70 major cities in 16 states.



•During the third quarter of 2016, Phillips 66 Partners and Plains All American Pipeline, L.P. (Plains) formed STACK Pipeline LLC (STACK JV), a 50/50 limited liability company that owns and operates a common carrier pipeline that transports crude oil from the Sooner Trend, Anadarko Basin, Canadian and Kingfisher counties play in northwestern Oklahoma to Cushing, Oklahoma. The crude oil pipeline is approximately 54 miles long with a






Table of ContentsIndex to Financial Statements



current capacity of approximately 100,000 barrels per day, with plans to expand the pipeline through a variety of growth opportunities.



•During the fourth quarter of 2016, Phillips 66 Partners acquired an NGL logistics system (River Parish) in southeast Louisiana.  The acquisition included 1.5 million barrels of storage and an approximate 300-mile, bidirectional NGL pipeline system connected to third-party fractionators, refineries and a petrochemical plant, as well as our Alliance Refinery.  The acquisition also included approximately 200 miles of regulated pipelines that transport raw NGL from third-party natural gas processing plants to pipeline and fractionation infrastructure.



The operations and financial results of Phillips 66 Partners are included in Midstream’s Transportation and NGL business lines, based on the nature of the activity within the partnership.



Transportation



We own or lease various assets to provide terminaling and storage of crude oil, refined products, natural gas and NGL.  These assets include pipeline systems; petroleum product, crude oil and LPG terminals; a petroleum coke handling facility; marine vessels; railcars and trucks.



Pipelines and Terminals

AtDecember 31, 2016, our Transportation business managed over 18,000 miles of crude oil, natural gas, NGL and petroleum products pipeline systems in the United States, including those partially owned or operated by affiliates.  We owned or operated 40 finished product terminals, 38 storage locations, 5 LPG terminals, 17 crude oil terminals and 1 petroleum coke exporting facility.



During 2016, we continued to invest in our Beaumont Terminal in Nederland, Texas, the largest terminal in the Phillips 66 portfolio, which currently has 5.9 million barrels of crude oil storage capacity and 2.4 million barrels of refined product storage capacity. During 2016, we added 1.2 million barrels of crude storage capacity.  Additionally, as of December 31, 2016, we had 800,000 barrels of incremental crude storage capacity under construction to be commissioned in the first quarter of 2017 and 1.2 million barrels of additional products storage expected to be available by mid-2017.  In addition, we have initiated a variety of other projects aimed at increasing storage and throughput capabilities as we continue the expansion of the Beaumont terminal from its current 8.3 million barrels of storage capacity to 16 million barrels.



Construction progressed in 2016 on two crude oil pipeline systems being developed by our joint ventures, Dakota Access LLC (DAPL) and Energy Transfer Crude Oil Company, LLC (ETCOP).  Phillips 66 owns a 25 percent interest in each joint venture, with Energy Transfer Partners, L.P. (ETP), one of our co-venturers, acting as the operator of both the DAPL and ETCOP pipeline systems.  The DAPL pipeline is expected to deliver 470,000 barrels per day of crude oil from the Bakken/Three Forks production area in North Dakota to market centers in the Midwest.  The DAPL pipeline will provide shippers with access to Midwestern refineries, unit-train rail loading facilities to facilitate deliveries to East Coast refineries, and the Gulf Coast market through an interconnection with the ETCOP pipeline in Patoka, Illinois.  While DAPL awaited the issuance of an easement from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to complete work beneath the Missouri River, construction was completed on the remaining segments of the pipeline.  The easement was granted on February 8, 2017, and construction of the pipeline under the river resumed.  ETCOP, which is complete and ready for commissioning, will transport crude oil from the Midwest to the Sunoco Logistics Partners L.P. (Sunoco Logistics) and Phillips 66 storage terminals located in Nederland, Texas.  The pipelines are expected to be operational in the first half of 2017.



In the second quarter of 2016, the Bayou Bridge Pipeline joint venture began delivering crude oil from Nederland, Texas, to Lake Charles, Louisiana.  Phillips 66 Partners has a 40 percent equity interest in the joint venture, while ETP and Sunoco Logistics each hold a 30 percent interest, with Sunoco Logistics serving as the operator.  The remaining section of the pipeline, which is being constructed by ETP, will deliver crude oil from Lake Charles to St. James, Louisiana, and is scheduled for completion in the second half of 2017.



In the fourth quarter of 2016, the 91-mile Sacagawea Pipeline was placed in service. The pipeline receives crude oil from areas in Dunn County and McKenzie County, North Dakota, and delivers crude oil to terminals and pipelines located in Stanley, North Dakota, including the 100,000 barrel per day Palermo Rail Terminal. The Palermo Rail Terminal is a

Rockies Express Pipeline LLC (REX)

We have a 25 percent interest in REX.  The REX natural gas pipeline runs 1,712 miles from Meeker, Colorado, to Clarington, Ohio, and has a natural gas transmission capacity of 1.8 billion cubic feet per day (BCFD), with most of its system having a pipeline diameter of 42 inches.  Numerous compression facilities support the pipeline system.  The REX pipeline was originally designed to enable natural gas producers in the Rocky Mountain region to deliver natural gas supplies to the Midwest and eastern regions of the United States.  During 2015, as a result of east-to-west expansion projects, the REX Pipeline began transporting natural gas supplies from the Appalachian Basin to Midwest markets. In the fourth quarter of 2016, as a result of capacity enhancement projects, the east-to-west capacity was increased to 2.6 BCFD in order to deliver additional natural gas into Midwestern gas markets.






Table of ContentsIndex to Financial Statements



Marine Vessels

AtDecember 31, 2016, we had 13 double-hulled, international-flagged crude oil and product tankers under term charter, with capacities ranging in size from 300,000 to 1,100,000 barrels.  Additionally, we had under term charter two Jones Act-compliant tankers and 50 tug/barge units.  These vessels are used primarily to transport feedstocks or provide product transportation for certain of our refineries, including delivery of domestic crude oil to our Gulf Coast and East Coast refineries.



Truck and Rail

Truck and rail operations support our feedstock and distribution operations.  Rail movements are provided via a fleet of more than 10,800 owned and leased railcars.  Truck movements are provided through approximately 150 third-party trucking companies, as well as through Sentinel Transportation LLC, which became a wholly owned subsidiary on December 31, 2016.



DCP Midstream



Our Midstream segment includes our 50 percent equity investment in DCP Midstream, which is headquartered in Denver, Colorado.  As ofDecember 31, 2016, DCP Midstream owned or operated 61 natural gas processing facilities, with a net processing capacity of approximately 8.0 BCFD.  DCP Midstream’s owned or operated natural gas pipeline systems included gathering services for these facilities, as well as natural gas transmission, and totaled approximately 64,000 miles of pipeline.  DCP Midstream also owned or operated 12 NGL fractionation plants, along with natural gas and NGL storage facilities, a propane wholesale marketing business and NGL pipeline assets.



The residual natural gas, primarily methane, which results from processing raw natural gas, is sold by DCP Midstream at market-based prices to marketers and end users, including large industrial companies, natural gas distribution companies and electric utilities.  DCP Midstream purchases or takes custody of substantially all of its raw natural gas from producers, principally under contractual arrangements that expose DCP Midstream to the prices of NGL, natural gas and condensate.  DCP Midstream also has fee-based arrangements with producers to provide midstream services such as gathering and processing.



DCP Midstream markets a portion of its NGL to us and CPChem under existing 15-year contracts, the primary commitment of which began a ratable wind-down period in December 2014 and expires in January 2019.  These purchase commitments are on an “if-produced, will-purchase” basis.

During 2016, DCP Midstream completed or advanced the following growth projects:

•The Sand Hills pipeline mainline capacity expansion was placed into service during the second quarter of 2016.

•In the first quarter of 2016, DCP Partners (defined below) began to participate in earnings for its 15 percent interest in the Panola intrastate NGL pipeline which completed an expansion in the third quarter of 2016.

•Also in the first quarter of 2016, construction was completed on the Grand Parkway gathering system in the Denver-Julesburg (DJ) Basin.



Effective January 1, 2017, DCP Midstream, LLC and its master limited partnership (then named DCP Midstream Partners, LP, subsequently renamed DCP Midstream, LP on January 11, 2017, and referred to herein as DCP Partners) closed a transaction in which DCP Midstream, LLC contributed subsidiaries owning all of its operating assets and its existing debt to DCP Partners, in exchange for approximately 31.1 million DCP Partners units.  Following the transaction, we and our co-venturer retained our 50/50 investment in DCP Midstream, LLC and DCP Midstream, LLC retained its incentive distribution rights in DCP Partners, through its ownership of the general partner of DCP Partners, and held a 38 percent interest in DCP Partners.  See the “Equity Affiliates” section of “Significant Sources of Capital” in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” for additional information on this transaction.








Table of ContentsIndex to Financial Statements



NGL



Our NGL business includes the following:



•A U.S. Gulf Coast NGL market hub comprising the Freeport LPG Export Terminal and Phillips 66 Partners’ 100,000 barrels-per-day (BPD) Sweeny Fractionator.  These assets are supported by Phillips 66 Partners’ 7.5-million-barrel Clemens storage facility.



•A 22.5 percent equity interest in Gulf Coast Fractionators, which owns an NGL fractionation plant in Mont Belvieu, Texas.  We operate the facility, and our net share of its capacity is 32,625 BPD.



•A 12.5 percent equity interest in a fractionation plant in Mont Belvieu, Texas.  Our net share of its capacity is 30,250 BPD.



•A 40 percent interest in a fractionation plant in Conway, Kansas.  Our net share of its capacity is 43,200 BPD.



•Phillips 66 Partners owns an NGL logistics system in southeast Louisiana comprising approximately 500 miles of pipelines and a storage cavern connecting multiple fractionation facilities, refineries and a petrochemical facility.



•Phillips 66 Partners owns a direct one-third interest in both Sand Hills and Southern Hills pipelines, which connect Eagle Ford, Permian and Midcontinent production to the Mont Belvieu, Texas market.



The Sweeny Fractionator is located adjacent to our Sweeny Refinery in Old Ocean, Texas and supplies purity ethane to the petrochemical industry and LPG to domestic and global markets. Raw NGL supply to the fractionator is delivered from nearby major pipelines, including the Sand Hills pipeline.  The fractionator is supported by significant infrastructure including connectivity to two NGL supply pipelines, a 180,000 BPD pipeline connecting to the Mont Belvieu market center and a multi-million barrel salt dome storage facility with access to our LPG export terminal in Freeport, Texas.



In December 2016, the Freeport LPG Export Terminal became fully operational and loaded its first cargos. The terminal leverages our fractionation, transportation and storage infrastructure to supply petrochemical, heating and transportation markets globally.  The terminal can simultaneously load two ships with refrigerated propane and butane at a combined rate of 36,000 barrels per hour. In support of the terminal, a 100,000 BPD unit to upgrade domestic propane for export was installed near the Sweeny Fractionator.  In addition, the terminal exports 10,000 to 15,000 BPD of natural gasoline (C5+) produced at the Sweeny Fractionator.







CHEMICALS



The Chemicals segment consists of our 50 percent equity investment in CPChem, which is headquartered in The Woodlands, Texas.  At the end of2016, CPChem owned or had joint-venture interests in 32 global manufacturing facilities and two U.S. research and development centers.



We structure our reporting of CPChem’s operations around two primary business segments: Olefins and Polyolefins (O&P) and Specialties, Aromatics and Styrenics (SA&S).  The O&P business segment produces and markets ethylene and other olefin products; the ethylene produced is primarily consumed within CPChem for the production of polyethylene, normal alpha olefins and polyethylene pipe.  The SA&S business segment manufactures and markets aromatics and styrenics products, such as benzene, styrene, paraxylene and cyclohexane, as well as polystyrene and styrene-butadiene copolymers.  SA&S also manufactures and/or markets a variety of specialty chemical products including organosulfur chemicals, solvents, catalysts, drilling chemicals and mining chemicals.



The manufacturing of petrochemicals and plastics involves the conversion of hydrocarbon-based raw material feedstocks into higher-value products, often through a thermal process referred to in the industry as “cracking.”  For example, ethylene can be produced from cracking the feedstocks ethane, propane, butane, natural gasoline or certain refinery liquids, such as naphtha and gas oil.  The produced ethylene has a number of uses, primarily as a raw material for the production of plastics, such as polyethylene and polyvinyl chloride.  Plastic resins, such as polyethylene, are






Table of ContentsIndex to Financial Statements



manufactured in a thermal/catalyst process, and the produced output is used as a further raw material for various applications, such as packaging and plastic pipe.



CPChem and its equity affiliates have manufacturing facilities located in Belgium, China, Colombia, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, South Korea and the United States.



The following table reflects CPChem’s petrochemicals and plastics product capacities atDecember 31, 2016:

In 2016, CPChem continued construction of a world-scale ethane cracker and polyethylene facilities in the U.S. Gulf Coast region.  The project will leverage the development of the significant shale resources in the United States.  CPChem’s Cedar Bayou facility, in Baytown, Texas, is the location of the 3.3 billion-pound-per-year ethylene unit.  The polyethylene facility will have two polyethylene units, each with an annual capacity of 1.1 billion pounds, and is located near CPChem’s Sweeny facility in Old Ocean, Texas.  The project is expected to be completed in 2017.



In March 2016, CPChem approved expansion of the polyalphaolefins (PAO) capacity at its Cedar Bayou plant by 22 million pounds per year, or 20 percent.  The expansion will allow CPChem to meet the increasing demand for high-performance lubricants.
