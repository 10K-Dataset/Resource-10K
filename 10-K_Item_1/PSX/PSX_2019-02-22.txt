CORPORATE STRUCTURE



Phillips 66, headquartered in Houston, Texas, was incorporated in Delaware in 2011 in connection with, and in anticipation of, a restructuring of ConocoPhillips that separated its downstream businesses into an independent, publicly traded company named Phillips 66.  The two companies were separated by ConocoPhillips distributing to its stockholders all the shares of common stock of Phillips 66 after the market closed on April 30, 2012 (the Separation).  Phillips 66 stock trades on the New York Stock Exchange under the “PSX” stock symbol.



Our business is organized into four operating segments:



1)Midstream—Provides crude oil and refined petroleum product transportation, terminaling and processing services, as well as natural gas and natural gas liquids (NGL) transportation, storage, processing and marketing services, mainly in the United States.This segment includes our master limited partnership (MLP), Phillips 66 Partners LP (Phillips 66 Partners), as well as our50 percentequity investment in DCP Midstream, LLC (DCP Midstream).



2)Chemicals—Consists of our50 percentequity investment in Chevron Phillips Chemical Company LLC (CPChem), which manufactures and markets petrochemicals and plastics on a worldwide basis.



3)Refining—Refines crude oil and other feedstocks into petroleum products (such as gasoline, distillates and aviation fuels) at13refineries in the United States and Europe.



4)Marketing and Specialties (M&S)—Purchases for resale and markets refined petroleum products, mainly in the United States and Europe.  In addition, this segment includes the manufacturing and marketing of specialty products (such as base oils and lubricants), as well as power generation operations.

Marine Vessels

AtDecember 31, 2018, we had 13 international-flagged crude oil, refined petroleum product and NGL tankers and two Jones Act-compliant tankers under time charter contracts, with capacities ranging in size from 300,000 to 1,100,000 barrels.  Additionally, we had a variety of inland and offshore tug/barge units.  These vessels are used primarily to transport crude oil and other feedstocks and refined petroleum products for certain of our refineries.  In addition, the NGL tankers are used to export propane and butane from our fractionation, transportation and storage infrastructure.



Truck and Rail

Our truck and rail fleets support our feedstock and distribution operations.  Rail movements are provided via a fleet of more than 10,000 owned and leased railcars.  Truck movements are provided through numerous third-party trucking companies, as well as through our wholly owned subsidiary, Sentinel Transportation LLC.



NGL and Other



Our NGL and Other business includes the following:



•A U.S. Gulf Coast NGL market hub comprised of the Freeport LPG Export Terminal and Phillips 66 Partners’ 100,000-BPD Sweeny Fractionator.  These assets are supported by 9 million barrels of gross capacity at Phillips 66 Partners’ Clemens Caverns storage facility.  We refer to these facilities as the “Sweeny Hub.”



•A 22.5 percent interest in Gulf Coast Fractionators, which owns an NGL fractionation plant in Mont Belvieu, Texas.  We operate the facility, and our net share of its capacity is 32,625 BPD.



•A 12.5 percent undivided interest in a fractionation plant in Mont Belvieu, Texas.  Our net share of its capacity is 30,250 BPD.



•A 40 percent undivided interest in a fractionation plant in Conway, Kansas.  Our net share of its capacity is 43,200 BPD.

At the Sweeny Hub, we are constructing two 150,000-BPD NGL fractionators and associated pipeline infrastructure, and Phillips 66 Partners is adding 6 million barrels of storage capacity at Clemens Caverns.  DCP Midstream has committed to supply the fractionators with raw NGL and has an option to acquire up to a 30 percent ownership interest in the fractionators.  Upon completion of the expansion, expected in late 2020, the Sweeny Hub will have 400,000 BPD of NGL fractionation capability and 15 million barrels of storage capacity at Clemens Caverns.



During 2018, Phillips 66 Partners continued development of a new 25,000-BPD isomerization unit at our Lake Charles Refinery to increase production of higher octane gasoline blend components.  The project is expected to be completed in the third quarter of 2019.



DCP Midstream



Our Midstream segment includes our 50 percent equity investment in DCP Midstream, which is headquartered in Denver, Colorado.  AtDecember 31, 2018, DCP Midstream owned or operated 49 active natural gas processing facilities, with a net processing capacity of approximately 6.7 billion cubic feet per day (Bcf/d).  DCP Midstream’s owned or operated natural gas pipeline systems included gathering services for these facilities, as well as natural gas transmission, and totaled approximately 62,000 miles of pipeline.  DCP Midstream also owned or operated 12 NGL fractionation plants, along with natural gas and NGL storage facilities, and NGL pipelines.



The residual natural gas, primarily methane, which results from processing raw natural gas, is sold by DCP Midstream at market-based prices to marketers and end users, including large industrial companies, natural gas distribution companies and electric utilities.  DCP Midstream purchases or takes custody of substantially all of its raw natural gas from producers, principally under contractual arrangements that expose DCP Midstream to the prices of NGL, natural gas and condensate.  DCP Midstream also has fee-based arrangements with producers to provide midstream services such as gathering and processing.  In addition, DCP Midstream markets a portion of its NGL to us and our equity affiliates under existing contracts.

During 2018, DCP Midstream completed or advanced the following growth projects:

•Construction of the 200-million-cubic-feet-per-day (MMcf/d) Mewbourn 3 natural gas processing plant located in the Denver-Julesburg (DJ) Basin was completed in the third quarter of 2018.

•Continued construction of the 300-MMcf/d O'Connor 2 natural gas processing facility and associated gathering infrastructure in the DJ Basin.  The O’Connor 2 facility will have 200 MMcf/d of processing capacity and up to 100 MMcf/d of bypass capacity, which are expected to be placed into service in the second and third quarters of 2019, respectively.

CHEMICALS



The Chemicals segment consists of our 50 percent equity investment in CPChem, which is headquartered in The Woodlands, Texas.  At December 31,2018, CPChem owned or had joint venture interests in 28 manufacturing facilities located in Belgium, Colombia, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Singapore and the United States.  Additionally, CPChem has two research and development centers in the United States.



We structure our reporting of CPChem’s operations around two primary business lines: Olefins and Polyolefins (O&P) and Specialties, Aromatics and Styrenics (SA&S).  The O&P business line produces and markets ethylene and other olefin products.  The ethylene produced is primarily used by CPChem to produce polyethylene, normal alpha olefins (NAO) and polyethylene pipe.  The SA&S business line manufactures and markets aromatics and styrenics products, such as benzene, cyclohexane, styrene and polystyrene.  SA&S also manufactures and/or markets a variety of specialty chemical products including organosulfur chemicals, solvents, catalysts, and chemicals used in drilling and mining.



The manufacturing of petrochemicals and plastics involves the conversion of hydrocarbon-based raw material feedstocks into higher-value products, often through a thermal process referred to in the industry as “cracking.”  For example, ethylene can be produced by cracking ethane, propane, butane, natural gasoline or certain refinery liquids, such as naphtha and gas oil.  Ethylene primarily is used as a raw material in the production of plastics, such as polyethylene and polyvinyl chloride (PVC).  Plastic resins, such as polyethylene, are manufactured in a thermal/catalyst process, and the produced output is used as a further raw material for various applications, such as packaging and plastic pipe.



The following table reflects CPChem’s petrochemicals and plastics product capacities atDecember 31, 2018:
