Items 1 and 2.  BUSINESS AND PROPERTIES







CORPORATE STRUCTURE



Phillips 66, headquartered in Houston, Texas, was incorporated in Delaware in 2011, in connection with, and in anticipation of, a restructuring of ConocoPhillips resulting in the separation of its downstream businesses into an independent, publicly traded company named Phillips 66.  The two companies were separated by ConocoPhillips distributing to its stockholders all the shares of common stock of Phillips 66 after the market closed on April 30, 2012 (the Separation).  Each ConocoPhillips stockholder received one share of Phillips 66 stock for every two shares of ConocoPhillips stock held at the close of business on the record date of April 16, 2012.  On May 1, 2012, Phillips 66 stock began trading “regular-way” on the New York Stock Exchange under the “PSX” stock symbol.



Our business is organized into four operating segments:



1)Midstream—Gathers, processes, transports and markets natural gas; and transports, fractionates and markets natural gas liquids (NGL) in the United States.  In addition, this segment transports crude oil and other feedstocks to our refineries and other locations, delivers refined and specialty products to market, and provides storage services for crude oil and petroleum products.  The Midstream segment includes, among other businesses, our50 percentequity investment in DCP Midstream, LLC (DCP Midstream) and our investment in Phillips 66 Partners LP.



2)Chemicals—Manufactures and markets petrochemicals and plastics on a worldwide basis.  The Chemicals segment consists of our50 percentequity investment in Chevron Phillips Chemical Company LLC (CPChem).



3)Refining—Buys, sells and refines crude oil and other feedstocks at14refineries, mainly in the United States and Europe.



4)Marketing and Specialties (M&S)—Purchases for resale and markets refined petroleum products (such as gasolines, distillates and aviation fuels), mainly in the United States and Europe.  In addition, this segment includes the manufacturing and marketing of specialty products, as well as power generation operations.



Corporate and Other includes general corporate overhead, interest expense, our investment in new technologies and various other corporate activities.  Corporate assets include all cash and cash equivalents.






Table of ContentsIndex to Financial Statements



Effective January 1, 2014, we changed the organizational structure of the internal financial information reviewed by our chief executive officer, and determined this resulted in a change in the composition of our operating segments.  The primary effects of this reporting reorganization were as follows:



•We moved two of our equity investments, Excel Paralubes and Jupiter Sulphur, LLC, as well as the commission revenues related to needle and anode coke, polypropylene and solvents, from the Refining segment to the M&S segment.

•We moved several refining logistics projects from the Refining segment to the Midstream segment.



The new segment alignment is presented for the periods ending December 31, 2014, with prior periods recast for comparability.



AtDecember 31, 2014, Phillips 66 had approximately 14,000 employees.

Rockies Express Pipeline LLC (REX)

We have a 25 percent interest in REX.  The REX natural gas pipeline runs 1,698 miles from Meeker, Colorado, to Clarington, Ohio, and has a natural gas transmission capacity of 1.8 billion cubic feet per day (BCFD), with most of its system having a pipeline diameter of 42 inches.  Numerous compression facilities support the pipeline system.  The REX pipeline is designed to enable natural gas producers in the Rocky Mountain region to deliver natural gas supplies to the Midwest and eastern regions of the United States.  Additionally, REX is exploring opportunities to bring Appalachian production into the system.



Phillips 66 Partners LP

In 2013, we formed Phillips 66 Partners, a master limited partnership (MLP), to own, operate, develop and acquire primarily fee-based crude oil, refined petroleum product and NGL pipelines and terminals, as well as other transportation and midstream assets.  At December 31, 2014, we owned a73 percentlimited partner interest and a2 percentgeneral partner interest in Phillips 66 Partners, while the public owned a25 percentlimited partner interest.






Table of ContentsIndex to Financial Statements



Headquartered in Houston, Texas, Phillips 66 Partners’ assets consist of crude oil and refined petroleum product pipeline, terminal, rail rack and storage systems in the Central, Gulf Coast, Atlantic Basin and Western regions of the United States, each of which is integral to a Phillips 66-operated refinery.

During 2014, Phillips 66 Partners expanded its business through acquisitions from us:

•Effective March 1, 2014, Phillips 66 Partners acquired the Gold Line products system and the Medford spheres.  The Gold Line products system includes a refined petroleum product pipeline system that runs from the Borger Refinery in Texas to Cahokia, Illinois.  The system includes four terminals.  The Medford spheres are two recently constructed refinery-grade propylene storage spheres located in Medford, Oklahoma, that connect to the Ponca City Refinery.

•On December 1, 2014, Phillips 66 Partners acquired two newly constructed rail unloading facilities connected to the Bayway and Ferndale refineries.

Phillips 66 Partners also made several smaller acquisitions from us in late 2014, consisting of terminal and pipeline projects under development.  Phillips 66 Partners is a consolidated subsidiary of Phillips 66.

Marine Vessels

AtDecember 31, 2014, we had 13 double-hulled, international-flagged crude oil and product tankers under term charter, with capacities ranging in size from 300,000 to 1,100,000 barrels.  Additionally, we had under term charter two Jones Act compliant tankers and 59 barges.  These vessels are used primarily to transport feedstocks or provide product transportation for certain of our refineries, including delivery of domestic crude oil to our Gulf Coast and East Coast refineries.



Truck and Rail

Truck and rail operations support our feedstock and distribution operations.  Rail movements are provided via a fleet of more than 11,400 owned and leased railcars.  Truck movements are provided through approximately 150 third-party truck companies, as well as through Sentinel Transportation LLC, in which we hold an equity interest.



DCP Midstream



Our Midstream segment includes our 50 percent equity investment in DCP Midstream, which is headquartered in Denver, Colorado.  As ofDecember 31, 2014, DCP Midstream owned or operated 64 natural gas processing facilities, with a net processing capacity of approximately 7.8 BCFD.  DCP Midstream’s owned or operated natural gas pipeline systems included gathering services for these facilities, as well as natural gas transmission, and totaled approximately 67,900 miles of pipeline.  DCP Midstream also owned or operated 12 NGL fractionation plants, along with natural gas and NGL storage facilities, a propane wholesale marketing business and NGL pipeline assets.



In2014, DCP Midstream gathered, processed and/or transported an average of7.3 trillionBritish thermal units (TBTU) per day of natural gas, and produced approximately454,000barrels per day of NGL, compared with7.1TBTU per day and426,000barrels per day in2013.

The residual natural gas, primarily methane, which results from processing raw natural gas, is sold by DCP Midstream at market-based prices to marketers and end users, including large industrial companies, natural gas distribution companies and electric utilities.  DCP Midstream purchases or takes custody of substantially all of its raw natural gas from producers, principally under contractual arrangements that expose DCP Midstream to the prices of NGL, natural gas and condensate.  DCP Midstream also has fee-based arrangements with producers to provide midstream services such as gathering and processing.

DCP Midstream markets a portion of its NGL to us and CPChem under existing 15-year contracts, the primary commitment of which expired in December 2014.  The contracts provide for a wind-down period which expires in January 2019, if not renegotiated or renewed.  These purchase commitments are on an “if-produced, will-purchase” basis.






Table of ContentsIndex to Financial Statements



During 2014, DCP Midstream and DCP Midstream Partners, LP (DCP Partners), the MLP formed by DCP Midstream,  completed or advanced natural gas processing capacity increases in the Denver-Julesburg (DJ) and the Eagle Ford Shale basins:

•In the DJ Basin, DCP Partners is constructing the Lucerne 2 gas processing plant, which has a planned capacity of 200 million cubic feet per day.  The plant is expected to go into service in the second quarter of 2015.

•Also in the DJ Basin, the O’Connor natural gas processing plant expansion, which increased processing capacity from 110 to 160 million cubic feet per day, was placed into service.  Both the Lucerne 2 and O’Connor plants connect to the Front Range NGL pipeline, in which DCP Partners owns a one-third interest.  The Front Range NGL pipeline was placed into service in the first quarter of 2014.

•In the Eagle Ford Shale Basin, the Goliad gas processing plant was placed into service during the first quarter of 2014.  The Goliad plant has a processing capacity of 200 million cubic feet per day, and its completion brought the collective natural gas processing capacity of DCP Midstream and DCP Partners in the Eagle Ford Shale Basin to 1.2 billion cubic feet per day.  The Goliad plant is connected to the Sand Hills pipeline.



The Sand Hills pipeline is engaged in the business of transporting NGL and provides takeaway service from the Permian and Eagle Ford Shale basins to fractionation facilities along the Texas Gulf Coast and at the Mont Belvieu, Texas, market hub.  The Southern Hills pipeline is also engaged in the business of transporting NGL and provides takeaway service from the Midcontinent to fractionation facilities at the Mont Belvieu, Texas, market hub. Phillips 66, Spectra Energy Partners, and DCP Partners each have a one-third direct interest in each of the DCP Southern Hills and DCP Sand Hills pipeline entities, the owners of these NGL pipelines.





NGL



Our NGL business includes the following:



•A 22.5 percent equity interest in Gulf Coast Fractionators, which owns an NGL fractionation plant in Mont Belvieu, Texas.  We operate the facility, and our net share of capacity is 32,625 barrels per day.



•A 12.5 percent equity interest in a fractionation plant in Mont Belvieu, Texas.  Our net share of capacity is 26,000 barrels per day.



•A 40 percent interest in a fractionation plant in Conway, Kansas.  Our net share of capacity is 43,200 barrels per day.



•A one-third direct interest in both the DCP Sand Hills and DCP Southern Hills pipeline entities, connecting Eagle Ford, Permian and Midcontinent production to the Mont Belvieu, Texas, market.



During 2014, final Board of Directors approval was received on the Sweeny Fractionator One and Freeport LPG Export Terminal projects.  These two projects represent an estimated investment of more than $3 billion as part of the company’s Midstream growth program.



The Sweeny Fractionator One is located in Old Ocean, Texas, close to our Sweeny Refinery, and will supply NGL products to the petrochemical industry and heating markets.  Raw NGL supply to the fractionator is expected from nearby  major pipelines, including the Sand Hills pipeline.  The 100,000 barrel-per-day NGL fractionator is expected to start up in the second half of 2015.



The Freeport LPG Export Terminal is located at the site of our existing marine terminal in Freeport, Texas, and will leverage our midstream, transportation and storage infrastructure to supply petrochemical, heating and transportation markets globally.  The terminal will have an initial export capacity of 4.4 million barrels per month with a ship loading rate of 36,000 barrels per hour.  Startup of the export terminal is expected in the second half of 2016.








Table of ContentsIndex to Financial Statements



Each of these projects will include NGL storage and additional pipelines with connectivity to market hubs in Mont Belvieu, Texas.  Also included with these projects is a 100,000 barrel-per-day de-ethanizer unit that will be installed close to the Sweeny Refinery to upgrade domestic propane for export.



To support these facilities, we are also installing significant infrastructure, including connectivity to three NGL supply pipelines, a new salt dome storage facility with an initial 6 million barrels of underground storage (expandable to 32 million barrels) and a 180,000 barrel-per-day, bi-directional pipeline connecting Sweeny to the Mont Belvieu market center.  In support of these projects, we have successfully secured long-term fee-based commitments for the majority of the feedstocks and products for Sweeny Fractionator One.



In response to the challenging market conditions driven by the recent decline in global crude oil prices, we have delayed the timing of investment decisions on a second-phase of Midstream projects in Texas, including our plans to build a second NGL fractionator, a crude and condensate pipeline, and a condensate splitter.







CHEMICALS



The Chemicals segment consists of our 50 percent equity investment in CPChem, which is headquartered in The Woodlands, Texas.  At the end of2014, CPChem owned or had joint-venture interests in 34 manufacturing facilities and two research and development centers located around the world.



CPChem’s business is structured around two primary operating segments: Olefins and Polyolefins (O&P) and Specialties, Aromatics and Styrenics (SA&S).  The O&P segment produces and markets ethylene and other olefin products; the ethylene produced is primarily consumed within CPChem for the production of polyethylene, normal alpha olefins and polyethylene pipe.  The SA&S segment manufactures and markets aromatics products, such as benzene, styrene, paraxylene and cyclohexane, as well as polystyrene and styrene-butadiene copolymers.  SA&S also manufactures and/or markets a variety of specialty chemical products including organosulfur chemicals, solvents, catalysts, drilling chemicals and mining chemicals.



The manufacturing of petrochemicals and plastics involves the conversion of hydrocarbon-based raw material feedstock into higher-value products, often through a thermal process referred to in the industry as “cracking.”  For example, ethylene can be produced from cracking the feedstocks ethane, propane, butane, natural gasoline or certain refinery liquids, such as naphtha and gas oil.  The produced ethylene has a number of uses, primarily as a raw material for the production of plastics, such as polyethylene and polyvinyl chloride.  Plastic resins, such as polyethylene, are manufactured in a thermal/catalyst process, and the produced output is used as a further raw material for various applications, such as packaging and plastic pipe.



CPChem, including through its subsidiaries and equity affiliates, has manufacturing facilities located in Belgium, China, Colombia, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, South Korea and the United States.

In 2014, CPChem began the construction of a world-scale ethane cracker and polyethylene facilities in the U.S. Gulf Coast region.  The project will leverage the development of the significant shale resources in the United States.  CPChem’s Cedar Bayou facility, in Baytown, Texas, will be the location of the 3.3 billion-pound-per-year ethylene unit.  The polyethylene facility will have two polyethylene units, each with an annual capacity of 1.1 billion pounds, and will be located near CPChem’s Sweeny facility in Old Ocean, Texas.  The project is expected to be completed in 2017.



In June 2014, CPChem completed the commissioning and start-up of an on-purpose 1-hexene plant, capable of producing up to 550 million pounds per year at its Cedar Bayou facility in Baytown, Texas.  1-hexene, a normal alpha olefin, is a critical component used in the manufacturing of polyethylene, a plastic resin commonly converted into film, plastic pipe, milk jugs, detergent bottles and food and beverage containers.  The new plant is the third such plant to utilize CPChem’s proprietary selective 1-hexene technology, which produces co-monomer-grade 1-hexene from ethylene with exceptional product purity.



In June 2014, CPChem’s Board of Directors approved construction to expand normal alpha olefin (NAO) production capacity at its Cedar Bayou plant in Baytown, Texas.  This investment will provide an additional 220 million pounds per year of capacity.  Completion of construction is anticipated in July 2015.  NAO and its derivatives are used extensively as polyethylene co-monomers, synthetic motor oils, lubricants, automotive additives and in a wide range of specialty applications.



In the second quarter of 2014, CPChem completed its sulfur-based products expansion and the new on-purpose hydrogen sulfide unit project at its facility in Tessenderlo, Belgium.








Table of ContentsIndex to Financial Statements



In July 2014, a localized fire occurred in the olefins unit at CPChem’s Port Arthur, Texas facility, shutting down ethylene production.  The Port Arthur ethylene unit restarted in November.  Because the Port Arthur ethylene unit was down due to the fire, CPChem experienced a significant reduction in production and sales in several of its product lines stemming from the lack of the Port Arthur ethylene supply.



In December 2014, CPChem completed an ethylene expansion at its Sweeny complex in Old Ocean, Texas.  With the addition of a tenth furnace to ethylene unit 33 at the Sweeny complex, the expansion is expected to increase annual production by 200 million pounds per year.



During 2014, CPChem made a decision to permanently shut down the K-Resin® styrene-butadiene copolymer (SBC) plant at its Pasadena Plastics Complex in Pasadena, Texas.  The plant was temporarily idled in February 2013. In December 2014, CPChem completed the sale of substantially all of the assets of its Ryton® polyphenylene sulfide (PPS) product line.



Saudi Polymers Company (SPCo), a 35-percent-owned joint venture company of CPChem, owns an integrated petrochemicals complex adjacent to S-Chem (two 50/50 SA&S joint ventures) at Jubail Industrial City, Saudi Arabia.  SPCo produces ethylene, propylene, polyethylene, polypropylene, polystyrene and 1-hexene.



In association with the SPCo project, CPChem committed to build a nylon 6,6 manufacturing plant and a number of polymer conversion projects at Jubail Industrial City, Saudi Arabia.  The projects are being undertaken through CPChem’s 50-percent-owned joint venture company, Petrochemical Conversion Company Ltd.  The projects are slated to begin operations in stages through 2015.  During 2014, commercial operations began on two polymer conversion units, polyethylene pipe and drip irrigation.



Our agreement with Chevron U.S.A. Inc. (Chevron), an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary of Chevron Corporation, regarding CPChem permits Chevron to buy our 50 percent interest in CPChem for fair market value if, at any time after the Separation, we experience a change in control or if both Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services (S&P) and Moody’s Investors Service (Moody’s) lower our credit ratings below investment grade and the credit rating from either rating agency remains below investment grade for 365 days thereafter, with fair market value determined by agreement or by nationally recognized investment banks.

In addition, this segment includes the manufacturing and marketing of specialty products, as well as power generation operations.



Marketing



Marketing—United States

In the United States, as ofDecember 31, 2014, we marketed gasoline, diesel and aviation fuel through approximately8,600 marketer-owned or -supplied outlets in 48 states.  These sites utilize thePhillips 66,Conocoor76brands.



AtDecember 31, 2014, our wholesale operations utilized a network of marketers operating approximately 7,000 outlets.We have placed a strong emphasis on the wholesale channel of trade because of its lower capital requirements.  In addition, we held brand-licensing agreements with approximately 700 sites.  Our refined products are marketed on both a branded and unbranded basis.  A high percentage of our branded marketing sales are made in the Midcontinent, Rockies and West Coast regions, where our wholesale marketing operations provide efficient off-take from our refineries.



The Gulf Coast and East Coast regions do not require a highly integrated marketing and distribution infrastructure to secure product placement for refinery pull through.  In these markets, most sales are conducted via unbranded sales.  We are expanding our export capability at our U.S. coastal refineries to meet growing international demand and increase flexibility to provide product to the highest-value markets.



During 2013, we entered into multi-year consignment fuels agreements with several marketers.  We own the fuel inventory and control the selling of fuel at the retail sites and the marketer is paid a fixed monthly fee.  Also in 2013, we temporarily acquired a small number of retail sites, some of which were sold in 2013 and 2014, with the remainder expected to be sold in the future.  The consignment fuels agreements and the temporary retail site acquisitions were designed to support branded pull through of our refinery production.



During 2014, we acquired a 50 percent interest in OnCue Holdings, LLC, which operated 44 convenience stores in Oklahoma as of December 31, 2014.  We are evaluating growth opportunities within this joint venture.
