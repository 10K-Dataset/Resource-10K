Item 1.Business.



General

Founded in 1967 by Mr. Ralph Lauren, we are a global leader in the design, marketing, and distribution of premium lifestyle products, including men’s, women’s, and children’s apparel, accessories, fragrances, and home furnishings. Our long-standing reputation and distinctive image have been consistently developed across an expanding number of products, brands, sales channels, and international markets. We believe that our global reach, breadth of product offerings, and multi-channel distribution are unique among luxury and apparel companies.

We operate in three distinct but integrated segments: Wholesale, Retail, and Licensing. Our Wholesale business, representing approximately45%of ourFiscal 2013net revenues, consists of sales made principally to major department stores and specialty stores located throughout North America, Europe, Asia, and Latin America. Our Retail business, representing approximately52%of ourFiscal 2013net revenues, consists of sales made directly to consumers through our retail stores located throughout North America, Europe, Asia, and Latin America; through concession-based shop-within-shops located primarily in Asia and Europe; and through our retail e-commerce channel in North America, Europe, and Asia. Our Licensing business, representing approximately3%of ourFiscal 2013net revenues, consists of royalty-based arrangements under which we license the right to third parties to use our various trademarks in connection with the manufacture and sale of designated products, such as apparel, eyewear, and fragrances, in specified geographical areas for specified periods. Approximately37%of ourFiscal 2013net revenues were earned in international regions outside of the U.S. SeeNote 22to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements for a summary of net revenues by reportable segment and by geographic location.










Over the past five fiscal years, our sales have grown over 38% to$6.945 billioninFiscal 2013from $5.019 billion in the fiscal year ended March 28, 2009. This growth has been attributable to both our acquisitions and organic growth. We have diversified our business by channels of distribution, price point, and target consumer, as well as by geography. Our global reach is extensive, with Ralph Lauren-branded merchandise available through our wholesale distribution channels at approximately 11,000 different retail locations worldwide. In addition to our wholesale distribution, we sell directly to customers throughout the world via our388retail stores, our494concession-based shop-within-shops, and oursevene-commerce sites. In addition to our directly-operated stores and shops, our international licensing partners operate 62 Ralph Lauren Stores, 32 Ralph Lauren concession shops, and 64 Club Monaco stores and shops.

We continue to invest in our business. In the past five fiscal years, we have invested approximately $1.371 billion for acquisitions and capital improvements, primarily funded through strong operating cash flow. We intend to continue to execute our long-term strategy, which includes expanding our presence internationally, extending our direct-to-consumer reach, expanding our accessories and other product and brand offerings, and investing in our operational infrastructure. See “Objectives and Opportunities”for further discussion of our long-term strategy.

We have been controlled by the Lauren family since the founding of our Company. As ofMarch 30, 2013, Mr. Ralph Lauren, or entities controlled by the Lauren family, owned approximately 83% of the voting power of the outstanding common stock of the Company.



Seasonality ofBusiness

Our business is typically affected by seasonal trends, with higher levels of wholesale sales in our second and fourth quarters and higher retail sales in our second and third quarters. These trends result primarily from the timing of seasonal wholesale shipments and key vacation travel, back-to-school, and holiday shopping periods in our Retail segment. As a result of the growth and other changes in our business, along with changes in consumer spending patterns and the macroeconomic environment, historical quarterly operating trends and working capital requirements may not be indicative of our future performance. In addition, fluctuations in sales, operating income, and cash flows in any fiscal quarter may be affected by, among other things, the timing of seasonal wholesale shipments and other events affecting retail sales, such as changes in weather patterns.

Working capital requirements vary throughout the year. Working capital requirements typically increase during the first half of the fiscal year as inventory builds to support peak shipping/selling periods and, accordingly, typically decrease during the second half of the fiscal year as inventory is shipped/sold. Cash provided by operating activities is typically higher in the second half of the fiscal year due to reduced working capital requirements during that period.



Objectives and Opportunities

Our core strengths include a portfolio of global premium lifestyle brands, a strong and experienced management team, a proven ability to develop and extend our brands distributed through multiple channels in global markets, and a disciplined investment philosophy, which is supported by a strong balance sheet. Despite the various risks and uncertainties associated with the current global economic environment, as discussed further in Item 7 – “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Global Economic Developments,” we believe our core strengths will allow us to continue to execute our strategy for long-term sustainable growth in revenue, net income, and operating cash flow.

As our business has grown, our portfolio mix and brand control has evolved from primarily that of a mono-brand U.S.-centric menswear wholesaler with a broad array of product and geographic licenses, to that of a portfolio of lifestyle brands with a “direct control” model over most of our brands, products, and international territories. We believe that this broader and better-diversified portfolio mix positions us for ongoing growth, offering our customers a range of products, price points, and channels of distribution. In addition, we believe that our size and global operations favorably position us to take advantage of synergies in design, sourcing, and distribution.

While balancing our key long-term strategic objectives with our near-term priorities to manage through the various risks associated with the current global economic environment, we intend to continue to pursue select opportunities for growth during the course of Fiscal 2014 and beyond. These opportunities and continued investment initiatives include:










•International Growth Opportunities

Recent Developments

Chaps

In April 2013, in connection with the transition of the North American Chaps-branded men's sportswear business from a licensed to a wholly-owned operation, we entered into an agreement with The Warnaco Group, Inc. (“Warnaco”), a subsidiary of PVH Corp. (“PVH”), to acquire certain net assets (including inventory, a finite-lived intangible asset, and certain customer liabilities), in exchange for an aggregate payment of approximately $18 million (the "Chaps Menswear License Acquisition"). We funded the Chaps Menswear License Acquisition with available cash on-hand. Warnaco was our licensee for Chaps-branded men's sportswear apparel in North America. In connection with the Chaps Menswear License Acquisition, we entered into a transition services agreement with PVH for the provision of certain support services related to sourcing, distribution, customer service, finance, and information systems through June 30, 2013. The operating results of the Chaps men's sportswear business will be consolidated in our operating results commencing on April 10, 2013. We are currently in the process of assessing the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed.

Wind-down of Rugby

In October 2012, we approved a plan to wind-down our Rugby brand retail operations (the “Rugby Closure Plan”). This decision was primarily based on the results of an analysis of the brand concept, as well as an opportunity to reallocate our resources related to these operations to support other high-growth business opportunities and initiatives. In connection with the Rugby Closure Plan, 13 of our 14 global freestanding Rugby stores and our related domestic e-commerce site located at Rugby.com were closed during Fiscal 2013. The one remaining Rugby store is expected to be closed during Fiscal 2014. The Rugby Closure Plan resulted in a reduction in our workforce of approximately160employees. See Notes 11 and 12 to our consolidated financial statements for detailed discussions of impairment and restructuring charges recorded during Fiscal 2013 in connection with the Rugby Closure Plan.

E-Commerce Expansion



DuringFiscal 2013, we continued to execute on our strategic objective of growing and expanding our global e-commerce operations as follows:

•We broadened our e-commerce presence in Europe by expanding our existing retail site in France to service customers in Italy, Greece, Spain, and Portugal;

•We expanded our global e-commerce presence into Asia by launching a new retail site for our Ralph Lauren business in Japan located at www.RalphLauren.co.jp; and

•We broadened our e-commerce presence in North America by launching a new retail site for our Club Monaco business in Canada located at www.ClubMonaco.ca.

Suspension of Argentina Operations

During the second quarter of Fiscal 2013, we suspended our business operations in Argentina. The suspension of these operations did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated or segment results.

Discontinuance of American Living

During the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2012, we decided, along with our wholesale partner J.C. Penney Company, Inc. (“JCPenney”), to discontinue the majority of the products sold under the American Living brand created for and exclusively sold to JCPenney, effective for the Fall 2012 wholesale selling season. The discontinuance of these American Living product lines did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated or segment results.

Asia-Pacific Restructuring Plan

In May 2011, we initiated a restructuring plan to reposition and upgrade our existing distribution network and merchandising operations in the Asia-Pacific region, which includes mainland China, Macau, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Malaysia, Singapore, Japan, and South Korea (the “Asia-Pacific Restructuring Plan”). This plan included a reduction in workforce and the closure of certain stores and concession shops that did not support our new merchandising strategy.

In the Greater China and Southeast Asia region, our wholesale products are sold at mid and top-tier department stores in China, Thailand, and the Philippines, and the mix of business is primarily weighted to Men’s and Women’s Blue Label.

We sell the majority of our excess and out-of-season products through secondary distribution channels worldwide, including our retail factory stores.

The following table presents the number of doors by geographic location in which Ralph Lauren-branded products distributed by our Wholesale segment were sold to consumers in our primary channels of distribution as ofMarch 30, 2013:

LocationNumber ofDoorsThe Americas6,043Europe4,504Asia78Total10,625

In addition, Chaps-branded products distributed by our Wholesale segment were sold domestically through approximately 1,200 doors as ofMarch 30, 2013.

We have three key wholesale customers that generate significant sales volume. ForFiscal 2013, these customers in the aggregate accounted for approximately45%of our total Wholesale revenues, with Macy’s, Inc. ("Macy's") representing approximately 25% of our total Wholesale revenues.

Our products are sold primarily through our own sales forces. Our Wholesale segment maintains its primary showrooms in New York City. In addition, we maintain regional showrooms in Boston, Milan, Paris, London, Munich, Madrid, and Stockholm.

Shop-within-Shops.As a critical element of our distribution to department stores, we and our licensing partners utilize shop-within-shops to enhance brand recognition, to permit more complete merchandising of our lines by the department stores, and to differentiate the presentation of our products. Shop-within-shop fixed assets primarily include items such as customized freestanding fixtures, wall cases and components, decorative items, and flooring.

As ofMarch 30, 2013, we had approximately 20,000 shop-within-shops dedicated to our Ralph Lauren-branded wholesale products worldwide. The size of our shop-within-shops ranges from approximately 100 to 7,400 square feet. We normally share in the cost of building-out these shop-within-shops with our wholesale customers.

Basic Stock Replenishment Program.Basic products such as knit shirts, chino pants, oxford cloth shirts, selected accessories, and Home products can be ordered by our wholesale customers at any time through our basic stock replenishment programs. We generally ship these products within two-to-five days of order receipt.



Our Retail Segment

As ofMarch 30, 2013, our Retail segment consisted of 388 directly-operated freestanding stores worldwide, totaling approximately 3 million square feet, 494 concession-based shop-within-shops, and seven e-commerce websites. The extension of our direct-to-consumer reach is one of our primary long-term strategic goals.










Ralph Lauren Stores

Our Ralph Lauren stores reinforce the luxury image and distinct sensibility of our brands and feature exclusive lines that are not sold in department stores. We opened 20 new Ralph Lauren stores, acquired 2 previously licensed stores, and closed 10 Ralph Lauren stores inFiscal 2013. Our retail stores are primarily situated in major upscale street locations and upscale regional malls, generally in large urban markets.

We operated the following Ralph Lauren stores as ofMarch 30, 2013:

LocationRalph Lauren StoresThe Americas56Europe27Asia32Total115

Ralph Lauren stores feature a broad range of Ralph Lauren apparel, accessories, and Home product assortments in an atmosphere reflecting the distinctive attitude and luxury positioning of the Ralph Lauren brand. Our seven flagship Ralph Lauren store locations showcase our upper-end luxury styles and products and demonstrate our most refined merchandising techniques. In addition to generating sales of our products, our worldwide Ralph Lauren stores set, reinforce, and capitalize on the image of our brands. Our Ralph Lauren stores range in size from approximately 700 to 38,000 square feet.

Club Monaco Stores

Our Club Monaco stores feature fashion apparel and accessories for both men and women. The brand’s clean and contemporary signature style forms the foundation of a modern wardrobe. As ofMarch 30, 2013, we operated 59 Club Monaco retail stores in North America. Our Club Monaco stores range in size from approximately 1,700 to 17,400 square feet.

Rugby Stores

In October 2012, we approved a plan to wind-down our retail Rugby brand operations, resulting in the closure of 13 of our 14 global freestanding Rugby stores and the related domestic e-commerce site during Fiscal 2013. As ofMarch 30, 2013, we continued to operate one Rugby store in Japan, which we plan to close in Fiscal 2014.

Factory Stores

We extend our reach to additional consumer groups through our 213 factory stores worldwide. Our factory stores are generally located in outlet centers. DuringFiscal 2013, we added 14 new factory stores and closed 2 factory stores.

We operated the following factory stores as ofMarch 30, 2013:

LocationFactory StoresThe Americas148Europe40Asia25Total213

•Our factory stores in theAmericas offer selections of our menswear, womenswear, childrenswear, accessories, home furnishings, and fragrances. Ranging in size from approximately 2,700 to 20,000 square feet, with an average of approximately 9,900 square feet, these stores are principally located in major outlet centers in 42 states in the U.S. and in Puerto Rico.

•Our factory stores in Europe offer selections of our menswear, womenswear, childrenswear, accessories, home furnishings, and fragrances. Ranging in size from approximately 1,400 to 19,700 square feet, with an average of approximately 6,500 square feet, these stores are located in 12 countries, principally in major outlet centers.

•Our factory stores in Asia offer selections of our menswear, womenswear, childrenswear, accessories, and fragrances. Ranging in size from approximately 2,800 to 11,800 square feet, with an average of approximately 6,600 square feet,










these stores are primarily located throughout Japan, in Hong Kong and in or near other major cities in Asia, principally in major outlet centers.

Factory stores obtain products from our suppliers, our product licensing partners, and our retail stores and e-commerce operations, and serve as a secondary distribution channel for our excess and out-of-season products.

Concession-based Shop-within-Shops

In Asia, the terms of trade for shop-within-shops are largely conducted on a concession basis, whereby inventory continues to be owned by us (not the department store) until ultimate sale to the end consumer. The salespeople involved in the sales transaction are generally our employees and not those of the department store.

As ofMarch 30, 2013, we had 494 concession-based shop-within-shops at 225 retail locations dedicated to our products, primarily in Asia. The size of our concession-based shop-within-shops ranges from approximately 140 to 4,300 square feet. We may share in the cost of building-out certain of these shop-within-shops with our department store partners.

E-commerce Websites

In addition to our stores, our Retail segment sells products online through our e-commerce channel, which includes:

•Our North American sites located at www.RalphLauren.com and www.ClubMonaco.com, including our Club Monaco site in Canada located at www.ClubMonaco.ca;

•Our Ralph Laurensites in Europe servicing Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, and the United Kingdom; and

•Our recently launched Ralph Laurensite in Japan located at www.RalphLauren.co.jp.

Our Ralph Lauren e-commerce sites in the U.S., Europe, and Japan offer our customers access to a broad array of Ralph Lauren apparel, accessories, and Home products, allow us to reach retail customers on a multi-channel basis, and reinforce the luxury image of our brands.

Our Club Monaco e-commerce sites in the U.S. and Canada offer our domestic and Canadian customers access to our Club Monaco global assortment of womenswear, menswear, and accessories product lines, as well as select online exclusives.



Our Licensing Segment

Through licensing alliances, we combine our consumer insight, design, and marketing skills with the specific product or geographic competencies of our licensing partners to create and build new businesses. We generally seek out licensing partners who are leaders in their respective markets, contribute the majority of the product development costs, provide the operational infrastructure required to support the business, and own the inventory.

We grant our product licensees the right to manufacture and sell at wholesale specified categories of products under one or more of our trademarks. We grant our international geographic area licensing partners exclusive rights to distribute certain brands or classes of our products and operate retail stores in specific international territories. These geographic area licensees source products from us, our product licensing partners, and independent sources. Each product licensing partner pays us royalties based upon its sales of our products, generally subject to a minimum royalty requirement for the right to use our trademarks and design services. In addition, licensing partners may be required to allocate a portion of their revenues to advertising our products and sharing in the creative costs associated with these products. Larger allocations are required in connection with launches of new products or in new territories. Our licenses generally have one to five-year terms and may grant the licensees conditional renewal options.

We work closely with all of our licensing partners to ensure that their products are developed, marketed, and distributed  to reach the intended market opportunity and are presented consistently to consumers across product categories and international markets to convey the distinctive identity and lifestyle associated with our brands. Virtually all aspects of the design, production quality, packaging, merchandising, distribution, advertising, and promotion of Ralph Lauren products are subject to our prior approval and continuing oversight. We perform a broader range of services for our Ralph Lauren Home licensing partners than










we do for our other licensing partners, including design, operating showrooms, marketing, advertising, and, in some cases, sales. In general, our Home licensing partners manufacture and own the inventory, and ship the products.

Approximately 44% of our licensing revenue forFiscal 2013was earned from four of our largest licensing partners: PVH Corp. (successor to The Warnaco Group, Inc.), Luxottica Group, S.p.A., Peerless, Inc., and L’Oreal S.A. The following table lists our largest product and Home licensing agreements as ofMarch 30, 2013. Except as noted in the table, these product licenses cover the U.S. or North America only.

(1)In connection with the acquisition of The Warnaco Group, Inc. by PVH Corp., we exercised our right under the existing licensing agreement to reacquire our North American Chaps men's sportswear license, and assumed control over this wholesale business effective April 10, 2013.

(2)Our Home products are sold under our Ralph Lauren Home, Lauren by Ralph Lauren, and Chaps brands. As of March 30, 2013, we had agreements with 11 domestic and three international Home product licensing partners, and one international Home product sublicensing partner.

International Licensing

We believe that international markets offer additional opportunities for our quintessential American designs and lifestyle image. Our international licensing partners acquire the right to sell, promote, market, and/or distribute various categories of our products in a given geographic area. These rights may include the right to own and operate retail stores. As ofMarch 30, 2013, our international licensing partners operated 62 Ralph Lauren stores, 32 Ralph Lauren concession shops, and 64 Club Monaco stores and concession shops.

In June 2012, our international licensing agreement with P.R.L. Enterprises, S.A. expired and we assumed control over the related product distribution in Latin America. As of March 30, 2013, our principal international licensing partners (excluding Ralph Lauren Home and Club Monaco Licensees) included Oroton Group/PRL Australia in Australia and New Zealand, and Commercial Madison, S.A. in Chile. Our license agreements with each of these licensing partners will terminate in June 2013, at which point we will assume control over the related product distribution.



Product Design

Our products reflect a timeless and innovative interpretation of American style with a strong international appeal. Our consistent emphasis on new and distinctive design has been an important contributor to the prominence, strength, and reputation of the Ralph Lauren brands.

Our Ralph Lauren products are designed by, or under the direction of, Mr. Ralph Lauren and our design staff. We form design teams around our brands and product categories to develop concepts, themes, and products for each brand and category. Through close collaboration with merchandising, sales, and production staff, these teams support all three segments of our business — Wholesale, Retail, and Licensing — in order to gain market and other valuable input.












Marketing and Advertising

Our marketing and advertising programs communicate the themes and images of our brands and are integral to our product offering. The majority of our advertising program is created and executed on a centralized basis through our in-house creative and advertising organization to ensure consistency of presentation, which is complemented by our marketing experts in each region who help to execute our international strategies.

We create distinctive image advertising for our brands, conveying the particular message of each one within the context of the overall Ralph Lauren aesthetic. Advertisements generally portray a lifestyle rather than a specific item and include a variety of products offered by ourselves and, in some cases, our licensing partners. Our primary advertising medium is print, with multiple page advertisements appearing regularly in a range of fashion, lifestyle, and general interest magazines. Major print advertising campaigns are conducted during the fall and spring retail seasons, with additions throughout the year to coincide with product deliveries. In addition to print, we utilize television and outdoor media in certain of our marketing programs. We also market our brand through direct-to-consumer marketing, special events, and interactive digital activities. We use our consumer database and consumer knowledge to guide these activities.

Our digital advertising programs focus on high impact and innovative digital media outlets, which allow us to convey our key brand messages and lifestyle positioning. We also develop digital editorial initiatives that allow for deeper education and engagement around the Ralph Lauren lifestyle, including the Ralph Lauren magazine, style guides, and brand videos. We deploy these marketing and advertising initiatives through the Internet, mobile platforms, and social media. Our e-commerce sites present the Ralph Lauren lifestyle on the Internet while offering a broad array of our apparel, accessories, and Home product lines.

We advertise in consumer and trade print and digital media, and participate in cooperative advertising on a shared cost basis with some of our retail and licensing partners. We also provide point-of-sale fixtures and signage to our wholesale customers to enhance the presentation of our products at their retail locations. In addition, when our licensing partners are required to spend an amount equal to a percent of their licensed product sales on advertising, we coordinate the advertising placement on their behalf. We believe our investments in shop-within-shop environments and retail stores, including our flagship locations worldwide, contribute to and enhance the themes of our brands to consumers. We expensed approximately$217 millionrelated to the advertising, marketing, and promotion of our products inFiscal 2013.

We also conduct a variety of public relations activities. Each of our spring and fall womenswear collections are presented at major fashion shows in New York City, which typically generate extensive domestic and international media coverage. We introduce each of the spring and fall menswear collections at press presentations in major cities such as New York and Milan. In addition, we organize in-store appearances by our models and certain professional athletes.

We continue to be the exclusive outfitter for all on-court officials at the Wimbledon tennis tournament and the official outfitter of all on-court officials at the U.S. Open tennis tournament. Both tournaments provide worldwide exposure for our brand in a relevant lifestyle environment. We also continue to be the exclusive Official Parade Outfitter for the U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Teams with the right to manufacture, distribute, advertise, promote, and sell products in the U.S. which replicate the Parade Outfits and associated leisure wear. As part of our involvement with Team U.S.A., we have established a partnership with athletes serving as brand ambassadors and as the faces of our advertising, marketing, and public relations campaigns.

In January 2011, we entered into a five-year agreement with the United States Golf Association (“USGA”) to be the official apparel outfitter for the USGA and the U.S. Open Championships and serve as the championship’s largest on-site apparel supplier. Additionally, in 2011, we entered into a five-year agreement with The Royal & Ancient to become an Official Patron of The Open Championship that is played annually on British links golf courses. As part of this agreement, we are outfitting all officials and staff members at The Open Championship and are serving as the championship’s largest on-site apparel retailer. We believe our partnerships with prestigious global tournaments reinforce our brand’s sporting heritage.



Sourcing, Production and Quality

We contract for the manufacture of our products and do not own or operate any production facilities. Over 700 different manufacturers worldwide produce our apparel, footwear, accessories, and home products, with no one manufacturer providing more than approximately 4% of our total production duringFiscal 2013. We source both finished products and raw materials. Raw materials include fabric, buttons, and other trim. Finished products consist of manufactured and fully assembled products ready for shipment to our customers. InFiscal 2013, less than 2% of our products (by dollar value) were produced in the U.S., and over 98% of our products (by dollar value) were produced outside the U.S., primarily in Asia, Europe, and Latin America. See “Import Restrictions and other Government Regulations” and Item 1A — “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business — Our business










is subject to risks associated with importing products and could suffer as a result of increases in the price of raw materials, freight, or labor or a manufacturer’s inability to produce our goods on time and to our specifications.”

Most of our businesses must commit to manufacture our garments before we sell finished goods, whether to wholly-owned retail stores or to wholesale customers. We also must commit to purchase fabric from mills well in advance of our sales. If we overestimate our primary customers’ demand for a particular product or the need for a particular fabric or yarn, we may sell the excess products or garments made from such fabric or yarn in our factory stores or through secondary distribution channels.

Suppliers operate under the close supervision of our global manufacturing division and buying agents headquartered in Asia, the Americas, the Middle East, and Europe. All products are produced according to our specifications. Production and quality control staff in Asia, the Americas, the Middle East, and Europe monitor manufacturing at supplier facilities in order to correct problems prior to shipment of the final product. Procedures have been implemented under our vendor certification and compliance programs so that quality assurance is reviewed early in the production process, allowing merchandise to be received at the distribution facilities and shipped to customers with minimal interruption.



Competition

Competition is very strong in the segments of the fashion and consumer product industries in which we operate. We compete with numerous designers and manufacturers of apparel and accessories, fragrances, and home furnishing products, both domestic and international. Some of our competitors may be significantly larger and have substantially greater resources than us. We compete primarily on the basis of fashion, quality, value, and service, which depend on our ability to:

•anticipate and respond to changing consumer demands in a timely manner;

•maintain favorable brand recognition, loyalty, and reputation for quality;

•develop and produce high quality products that appeal to consumers;

•appropriately source raw materials at cost-effective prices;

•appropriately price our products;

•provide strong and effective marketing support;

•ensure product availability; and

•obtain additional points of distribution and sufficient retail floor space, and effectively present our products at retail.

See Item 1A — “Risk Factors — Risks Relating to the Industry in Which We Compete — We face intense competition worldwide in the markets in which we operate.”












Distribution

To facilitate global distribution, our products are shipped from manufacturers to a network of distribution centers around the world for inspection, sorting, packing, and delivery to retail and wholesale customers. This network includes the following primary distribution facilities:

Geographic RegionFacility TypeFacility LocationFacilityOwnershipU.S.Wholesale and Retail distribution centerGreensboro, North CarolinaOwnedWholesale distribution centerHigh Point, North CarolinaLeasedE-commerce distribution centerHigh Point, North Carolina(1)LeasedDistribution centerChino Hills, CaliforniaThird-partyDistribution centerMiami, FloridaThird-partyCanadaDistribution centerToronto, OntarioThird-partyEuropeDistribution centerParma, Italy(2)Third-partyJapanDistribution centerYokohama, Japan(3)Third-partySouth KoreaDistribution centerBugok, South KoreaLeasedGreater China and Southeast Asia(4)Distribution centersHong Kong, China, Singapore,Malaysia, and TaiwanThird-partyLatin AmericaDistribution centersUruguay and PanamaThird-party

(2)This distribution center performs customer order fulfillment for our European businesses, including our e-commerce operations in Europe.

(3)This distribution center performs customer order fulfillment for our Japanese businesses, including our e-commerce operations in Japan.

(4)Includes China, Hong Kong, Macau, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Taiwan, and Thailand.



All facilities are designed to allow for high-density cube storage and value-added services, and utilize unit and carton tracking technology to facilitate process control and inventory management. The distribution network is managed through globally integrated information technology systems.



Management Information Systems

Our management information systems make the design, marketing, manufacturing, importing, and distribution of our products more efficient by providing, among other things:

•comprehensive order processing;

•production and design information;

•accounting information; and

•an enterprise view of information for our design, marketing, manufacturing, importing, and distribution functions.

The point-of-sale registers in conjunction with other systems in our stores enable us to track inventory from store receipt to final sale on a real-time basis. We believe our merchandising and financial systems, coupled with our point-of-sale registers and software programs, allow for stock replenishment, effective merchandise planning, and real-time inventory and sales accounting.

In the U.S. and Europe, we utilize an automated replenishment system to facilitate the processing of basic replenishment orders from our Retail segment and wholesale customers, the movement of goods through distribution channels, and the collection of information for planning and forecasting.










In the U.S. and Europe, we also utilize an automated allocation system to facilitate the flow of inventory for our Retail segment.

We are in the process of implementing a new global operating and financial reporting information technology system as part of a multi-year plan to integrate and upgrade our systems and processes. The implementation of this global system, scheduled to occur in phases over the next several years, began with the migration of certain of our domestic human resource systems during Fiscal 2011 and continued with the transition of certain of our domestic operational and financial systems to the new global operating and financial reporting system during Fiscal 2012. During Fiscal 2013, we continued to develop and enhance those operational and financial systems previously transitioned to the new global operating and financial reporting system. The next phase of this implementation effort involves the migration of certain core areas of our business to the new system, including global merchandise procurement, and customer order management and record-to-report for our North American wholesale operations, beginning in Fiscal 2014.

See Item 1A — “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—Implementation of management information systems may negatively impact our business”and“Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—Our business could suffer if our computer systems and websites are disrupted or cease to operate effectively.”



WholesaleCredit Control

We manage our own credit function. We sell our merchandise principally to major department stores and extend credit based on an evaluation of the wholesale customer’s financial capacity and condition, usually without requiring collateral. We monitor credit levels and the financial condition of our wholesale customers on a continuing basis to minimize credit risk. We do not factor or underwrite our accounts receivables, or maintain credit insurance to manage the risk of bad debts. In North America, collection and deduction transactional activities are provided through a third-party service provider. See Item 1A — “Risk Factors — Risks Related to Our Business—Our business could be negatively impacted by any financial instability of our customers.”



Wholesale Backlog

We generally receive wholesale orders for apparel products approximately three to five months prior to the time the products are delivered to customers. Such orders are generally subject to broad cancellation rights. Our total backlog was approximately $1.4 billion as ofMarch 30, 2013andMarch 31, 2012. We expect that substantially all of our backlog orders as ofMarch 30, 2013will be filled within the next fiscal year.

The size of our order backlog depends upon a number of factors, including the timing of the market weeks for our particular lines during which a significant percentage of our orders are received and the timing of shipments, which varies from year to year with consideration for holidays, consumer trends, concept plans, and the basic stock replenishment programs usage. As a consequence, a comparison of the size of our order backlog from period to period may not be meaningful, nor may it be indicative of eventual shipments.



Trademarks

We own the RALPH LAUREN, POLO, POLO BY RALPH LAUREN DESIGN, and the famous polo player astride a horse trademarks in the U.S. and approximately 100 countries worldwide. Other trademarks that we similarly own include:

•PURPLE LABEL;

•BLACK LABEL;

•BLUE LABEL;

•RRL;

•LAUREN RALPH LAUREN;

•PINK PONY;










•RLX;

•DENIM & SUPPLY RALPH LAUREN;

•LAUREN;

•RALPH;

•CHAPS;

•CLUB MONACO;

•RUGBY;

•AMERICAN LIVING; and

•Various trademarks pertaining to fragrances and cosmetics.

Mr. Ralph Lauren has the royalty-free right to use as trademarks RALPH LAUREN, DOUBLE RL, and RRL in perpetuity in connection with, among other things, beef and living animals. The trademarks DOUBLE RL and RRL are currently used by the Double RL Company, an entity wholly-owned by Mr. Lauren. In addition, Mr. Lauren has the right to engage in personal projects involving film or theatrical productions (not including or relating to our business) through RRL Productions, Inc., a company wholly-owned by Mr. Lauren. Any activity by these companies has no impact on us.

Our trademarks are the subject of registrations and pending applications throughout the world for use on a variety of items of apparel, apparel-related products, home furnishings, restaurant and café services, online services and online publications, and beauty products, as well as in connection with retail services, and we continue to expand our worldwide usage and registration of related trademarks. In general, trademarks remain valid and enforceable as long as the marks are used in connection with the related products and services and the required registration renewals are filed. We regard the license to use the trademarks and our other proprietary rights in and to the trademarks as extremely valuable assets in marketing our products and, on a worldwide basis, vigorously seek to protect them against infringement. As a result of the appeal of our trademarks, our products have been the object of counterfeiting. While we have a broad enforcement program which has been generally effective in protecting our intellectual property rights and limiting the sale of counterfeit products in the U.S. and in most major markets abroad, we face greater challenges with respect to enforcing our rights against trademark infringement in certain parts of Asia.

In markets outside of the U.S., our rights to some or all of our trademarks may not be clearly established. In the course of our international expansion, we have experienced conflicts with various third parties who have acquired ownership rights in certain trademarks, including POLO and/or a representation of a Polo Player Design, which impede our use and registration of our principal trademarks. While such conflicts are common and may arise again from time to time as we continue our international expansion, we have, in general, successfully resolved such conflicts in the past through both legal action and negotiated settlements with third-party owners of the conflicting marks (see Item 1A —“Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—Our trademarks and other intellectual property rights may not be adequately protected outside the U.S.”and Item 3 —“Legal Proceedings”for further discussion). Although we have not in the past suffered any material restraints or restrictions on doing business in desirable markets, we cannot assure that significant impediments will not arise in the future as we expand product offerings and introduce trademarks to new markets.



Import Restrictions and Other Government Regulations

Virtually all of our merchandise imported into the Americas, Europe, and Asia is subject to duties. In addition, most of the countries to which we ship could impose safeguard quotas and duties to protect their local industries from import surges that threaten to create market disruption. The U.S. and other countries may also unilaterally impose additional duties in response to a particular product being imported (from China or other countries) at unfairly traded prices in such increased quantities that would cause (or threaten) injury to the relevant domestic industry (generally known as “anti-dumping” actions). If dumping is suspected in the U.S., the U.S. Government may self-initiate a dumping case on behalf of the U.S. textile industry which could significantly affect our costs. Furthermore, additional duties, generally known as countervailing duties, can also be imposed by the U.S. Government to offset subsidies provided by a foreign government to foreign manufacturers if the importation of such subsidized merchandise injures or threatens to injure a U.S. industry. Legislative proposals have been introduced which, if adopted, would treat a manipulation by China of the value of its currency as actionable under the anti-dumping or countervailing duty laws.










We are also subject to other international trade agreements and regulations, such as the North American Free Trade Agreement, the Central American Free Trade Agreement, the Caribbean Basin Initiative, and other special trade programs. A portion of our imported products are eligible for certain of these duty-advantaged programs. In addition, each of the countries in which our products are sold has laws and regulations covering imports. Because the U.S. and the other countries in which our products are manufactured and sold may, from time to time, impose new duties, tariffs, surcharges, or other import controls or restrictions, including the imposition of a “safeguard quota,” or adjust presently prevailing duty or tariff rates or levels, we maintain a program of intensive monitoring of import restrictions and opportunities. We seek to minimize our potential exposure to import related risks through, among other measures, adjustments in product design and fabrication, shifts of production among countries and manufacturers, and through geographical diversification of our sources of supply.

As almost all our products are manufactured by foreign suppliers, the enactment of new legislation or the administration of current international trade regulations, executive action affecting textile agreements, or changes in sourcing patterns resulting from the elimination of quotas could adversely affect our operations. On January 1, 2005, the World Trade Organization's 148 member nations lifted all quotas on apparel and textiles. As a result, all textiles and apparel manufactured in each member nation and exported after January 1, 2005 are no longer subject to quota restrictions. Although we generally expect that the 2005 elimination of quotas will result, over the long term, in an overall reduction in the cost of apparel produced abroad, the implementation of any “safeguard quota provisions,” any “anti-dumping” or “countervailing duty” actions, or any other actions impacting international trade may result, in the near term, in cost increases and in disruption of the supply chain for certain product categories. See Item 1A —

and

“Risk Factors

Risks Related to Our Business

—

Our ability to conduct business in international markets may be affected by legal, regulatory, political and economic risks.”

Apparel and other products sold by us are also subject to regulation in the U.S. and other countries by other governmental agencies, including, in the U.S., the Federal Trade Commission, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, and the Consumer Products Safety Commission, including the Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act, which imposes limitations on the permissible amounts of lead and phthalates allowed in children's products. These regulations relate principally to product labeling, licensing requirements, flammability testing, and product safety particularly with respect to products used by children. We believe that we are in substantial compliance with these regulations, as well as applicable federal, state, local, and foreign rules and regulations governing the discharge of materials hazardous to the environment. We do not estimate any significant capital expenditures for environmental control matters either in the next fiscal year or in the near future. Our licensed products, licensing partners, buying/sourcing agents, and the vendors and factories with which we contract for the manufacture and distribution of our products are also subject to regulation. Our agreements require our licensing partners, buying/sourcing agents, vendors, and factories to operate in compliance with all laws and regulations, and we are not aware of any violations which could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on our business or operating results.

We are also subject to new disclosure and reporting requirements, established under existing or new federal or state laws, such as the requirements to identify the origin and existence of certain “conflict minerals” under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, and disclosures of abusive labor practices in portions of our supply chain under the California Transparency in Supply Chains Act, which could increase the cost of doing business, adversely affecting our results of operations.

Although we have not suffered any material restriction from doing business in desirable markets in the past, we cannot assure that significant impediments will not arise in the future as we expand product offerings and introduce additional trademarks to new markets.



Employees

As ofMarch 30, 2013, we had approximately 23,000 employees, including approximately 14,000 full-time and approximately 9,000 part-time employees. Approximately 14,000 of our employees are located in the U.S. and approximately 9,000 are located in foreign countries. Approximately 30 of our U.S. production and distribution employees in the womenswear business are members of Amalgamated Ladies Garment Cutters Union, Local 10 UNITE (which was previously known as UNITE HERE) under an industry association collective bargaining agreement, which our womenswear subsidiary has adopted. We consider our relations with both our union and non-union employees to be good.
