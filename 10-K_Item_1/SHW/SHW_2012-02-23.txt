Basis of Reportable Segments

The Company’s CODM has been identified
as the Chief Executive Officer because he has final authority over performance assessment and resource allocation decisions. Because of the diverse operations of the Company, the CODM regularly receives discrete financial information about each
reportable segment as well as a significant amount of additional financial information about certain divisions, business units or subsidiaries of the Company. The CODM uses all such financial information for performance assessment and







resource allocation decisions. The CODM evaluates the performance of and allocates resources to the Reportable Segments based on profit or loss before income taxes and cash generated from
operations. The accounting policies of the Reportable Segments are the same as those described in Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements on pages 48 through 52 of our 2011 Annual Report, which is incorporated herein by
reference.

Paint Stores Group

®

Consumer Group

The Consumer Group develops, manufactures and distributes a
variety of paint, coatings and related products to third party customers primarily in the United States and Canada and the Paint Stores Group. Approximately 62 percent of the total sales of the Consumer Group in 2011 were inter-segment
transfers of products primarily sold through the Paint Stores Group. Sales and marketing of certain controlled brand and private labeled products is performed by a direct sales staff. The products distributed through third party customers are
intended for resale to the ultimate end-user of the product. The Consumer Group had sales to certain customers that, individually, may be a significant portion of the sales of the segment. However, the loss of any single customer would not have a
material adverse effect on the overall profitability of the segment. This segment incurred most of the Company’s capital expenditures related to ongoing environmental compliance measures. The CODM uses discrete financial information about the
Consumer Group, supplemented with information by product types and customer, to assess performance of and allocate resources to the Consumer Group as a whole. In accordance with ASC 280-10-50-9, the Consumer Group as a whole is considered the
operating segment, and because it meets the criteria in ASC 280-10-50-10, it is also considered a reportable segment.

Global Finishes
Group

The Global Finishes Group develops, licenses, manufactures, distributes and sells a variety of
protective and marine products, automotive finishes and refinish products, OEM product finishes and related products in North and South America, Europe and Asia. This segment meets the demands of its customers for a consistent worldwide product
development, manufacturing and distribution presence and approach to doing business. This segment licenses certain technology and trade names worldwide. Sherwin-Williams®and other controlled brand products are distributed through the Paint Stores Group and this segment’s 303 company-operated branches and by a direct sales staff
and outside sales representatives to retailers, dealers, jobbers, licensees and other third party distributors. During 2011, this segment opened 1 new branch in the United States and closed 13 (6 in the United States, 5 in India and 2 in Canada) for
a net decrease of 12 branches. At December 31, 2011, the Global







Finishes Group consisted of operations in the United States, subsidiaries in 36 foreign countries and income from licensing agreements in 15 foreign countries. The CODM uses discrete
financial information about the Global Finishes Group, supplemented with information about geographic divisions, business units, and subsidiaries, to assess performance of and allocate resources to the Global Finishes Group as a whole. In accordance
with ASC 280-10-50-9, the Global Finishes Group as a whole is considered the operating segment, and because it meets the criteria in ASC 280-10-50-10, it is also considered a reportable segment. A map on pages 14 and 15 of our 2011 Annual
Report, which is incorporated herein by reference, shows the number of branches and their geographic locations.

Administrative Segment

The Administrative segment includes the administrative expenses of the Company’s corporate headquarters site. Also included in the Administrative segment was interest expense, interest and investment
income, certain expenses related to closed facilities and environmental-related matters, and other expenses which were not directly associated with the Reportable Segments. The Administrative segment did not include any significant foreign
operations. Also included in the Administrative segment was a real estate management unit that is responsible for the ownership, management, and leasing of non-retail properties held primarily for use by the Company, including the Company’s
headquarters site, and disposal of idle facilities. Sales of this segment represented external leasing revenue of excess headquarters space or leasing of facilities no longer used by the Company in its primary businesses. Gains and losses from the
sale of property were not a significant operating factor in determining the performance of the Administrative segment.

Segment Financial
Information

For financial information regarding our Reportable Segments, including net external sales, segment profit,
identifiable assets and other information by segment, see Note 19 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements on pages 76 through 79 of our 2011 Annual Report, which is incorporated herein by reference.

Domestic and Foreign Operations

Financial and other information regarding domestic and foreign operations is set forth in Note 19 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements on page 78 of our 2011 Annual Report, which is
incorporated herein by reference.









Additional information regarding risks attendant to foreign operations is set forth on
page 34 of our 2011 Annual Report under the caption “Market Risk” of “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation,” which is incorporated herein by reference.

Business Developments

For additional information regarding our business and business developments, see pages 6 through 16 of our 2011 Annual Report and the
“Letter to Shareholders” on pages 2 through 5 of our 2011 Annual Report, which is incorporated herein by reference.

Raw Materials and Products Purchased for Resale

We believe we generally have adequate sources of raw materials and fuel supplies used in our business. However, consolidation of raw material suppliers and a reduction in raw material manufacturing
capacity during the recent recession, along with an increase in global demand for certain raw materials, resulted in increased prices of certain raw materials in 2011. A continued increase in global demand for certain raw materials and coatings as
the global economy recovers may result in increased prices of certain raw materials for the Reportable Segments during 2012. There are sufficient suppliers of each product purchased for resale that none of the Reportable Segments anticipate any
significant sourcing problems during 2012. See Item 1A Risk Factors for more information regarding cost and sourcing of raw materials.

Seasonality

The
majority of the sales for the Reportable Segments traditionally occur during the second and third quarters. There is no significant seasonality in sales for the Administrative segment.

Working Capital

In order to meet increased demand during the second and
third quarters, the Company usually builds its inventories during the first quarter. Working capital items (inventories and accounts receivable) are generally financed through short-term borrowings, which include the use of lines of credit and the
issuance of commercial paper. For a description of the Company’s liquidity and capital resources, see pages 24 through 34 of our 2011 Annual Report under the caption “Financial Condition, Liquidity and Cash Flow” of
“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” which is incorporated herein by reference.

trade names collectively contribute significantly to our sales. The major trademarks and trade names used by each of the Reportable Segments are set forth below.

Patents

Although patents and licenses are not of material importance to
our business as a whole or any segment, the Global Finishes Group and Latin America Coatings Group derive a portion of their income from the licensing of technology, trademarks and trade names to foreign companies.

Backlog and Productive Capacity

Backlog orders are not significant in the business of any reportable segment since there is normally a short period of time between the placing of an order and shipment. We believe that sufficient
productive capacity currently exists to fulfill our needs for paint, coatings and related products through 2012.

Research and Development

For information regarding our costs of research and development included in technical expenditures, see Note 1 of the
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements on page 51 of our 2011 Annual Report, which is incorporated herein by reference.

Competition

We
experience competition from many local, regional, national and international competitors of various sizes in the manufacture, distribution and sale of our paint, coatings and related products. We are a leading manufacturer and retailer of paint,
coatings and related products to professional, industrial, commercial and retail customers, however, our competitive position varies for our different products and markets.

In the Paint Stores Group, competitors include other paint and wallpaper stores, mass merchandisers, home centers, independent hardware stores, hardware chains and manufacturer-operated direct outlets.
Product quality, product innovation, breadth of product line, technical expertise, service and price determine the competitive advantage for this segment.

In the Consumer Group, domestic and foreign competitors include manufacturers and distributors of branded and private labeled paint and coatings products. Technology, product quality, product innovation,
breadth of product line, technical expertise, distribution, service and price are the key competitive factors for this segment.

The Global Finishes Group has numerous competitors in its domestic and foreign markets with broad product offerings and several others
with niche products. Key competitive factors for this segment include technology, product quality, product innovation, breadth of product line, technical expertise, distribution, service and price.

In the Latin America Coatings Group, competitors include other paint and wallpaper stores, mass merchandisers, home centers, independent
hardware stores, hardware chains and manufacturer-operated direct outlets. Product quality, product innovation, breadth of product line, technical expertise, service and price determine the competitive advantage for this segment.

The Administrative segment has many competitors consisting of other real estate owners, developers and managers in areas in which this
segment owns property. The main competitive factors are the availability of property and price.
