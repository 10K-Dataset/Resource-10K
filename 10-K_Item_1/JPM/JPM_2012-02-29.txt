ITEM 1: BUSINESS



Overview

JPMorgan Chase & Co.(“JPMorgan Chase” or the “Firm”), a financial holding company incorporated under Delaware law in 1968, is a leading global financial services firm and one of the largest banking institutions in the United States of America (“U.S.”), with operations worldwide; the Firm has$2.3 trillionin assets and$183.6 billionin stockholders’ equity as ofDecember 31, 2011. The Firm is a leader in investment banking, financial services for consumers and small businesses, commercial banking, financial transaction processing, asset management and private equity. Under the J.P. Morgan and Chase brands, the Firm serves millions of customers in the U.S. and many of the world’s most prominent corporate, institutional and government clients.

JPMorgan Chase’s principal bank subsidiaries are JPMorgan Chase Bank, National Association (“JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.”), a national bank with U.S. branches in23states, and Chase Bank USA, National Association (“Chase Bank USA, N.A.”), a national bank that is the Firm’s credit card–issuing bank.JPMorgan Chase’s principal nonbank subsidiary is J.P. Morgan Securities LLC (“JPMorgan Securities”), the Firm’s U.S. investment banking firm. The bank and nonbank subsidiaries ofJPMorgan Chaseoperate nationally as well as through overseas branches and subsidiaries, representative offices and subsidiary foreign banks. One of the Firm’s principal operating subsidiaries in the United Kingdom (“U.K.”) is J.P. Morgan Securities Ltd., a subsidiary of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.

The Firm’s website is www.jpmorganchase.com.JPMorgan Chasemakes available free of charge, through its website, annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and any amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or Section 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as soon as reasonably practicable after it electronically files such material with, or furnishes such material to, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”). The Firm has adopted, and posted on its website, a Code of Ethics for its Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Chief Accounting Officer and other senior financial officers.



Business segments

JPMorgan Chase’s activities are organized, for management reporting purposes, into six business segments, as well as Corporate/Private Equity. The Firm’s wholesale businesses comprise the Investment Bank (“IB”), Commercial Banking (“CB”), Treasury & Securities Services (“TSS”) and Asset Management (“AM”) segments. The Firm’s consumer businesses comprise the Retail Financial Services (“RFS”) and Card Services & Auto (“Card”) segments.

A description of the Firm’s business segments and the products and services they provide to their respective client bases is provided in the “Business segment results” section



of Management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (“MD&A”), beginning on page 63 and in Note 33 on pages 300–303.



Competition

JPMorgan Chaseand its subsidiaries and affiliates operate in a highly competitive environment. Competitors include other banks, brokerage firms, investment banking companies, merchant banks, hedge funds, commodity trading companies, private equity firms, insurance companies, mutual fund companies, credit card companies, mortgage banking companies, trust companies, securities processing companies, automobile financing companies, leasing companies, e-commerce and other Internet-based companies, and a variety of other financial services and advisory companies.JPMorgan Chase’s businesses generally compete on the basis of the quality and range of their products and services, transaction execution, innovation and price. Competition also varies based on the types of clients, customers, industries and geographies served. With respect to some of its geographies and products,JPMorgan Chasecompetes globally; with respect to others, the Firm competes on a regional basis. The Firm’s ability to compete also depends on its ability to attract and retain its professional and other personnel, and on its reputation.

The financial services industry has experienced consolidation and convergence in recent years, as financial institutions involved in a broad range of financial products and services have merged and, in some cases, failed. This convergence trend is expected to continue. Consolidation could result in competitors ofJPMorgan Chasegaining greater capital and other resources, such as a broader range of products and services and geographic diversity. It is likely that competition will become even more intense as the Firm’s businesses continue to compete with other financial institutions that are or may become larger or better capitalized, that may have a stronger local presence in certain geographies or that operate under different rules and regulatory regimes than the Firm.



Supervision and regulation

The Firm is subject to regulation under state and federal laws in the United States, as well as the applicable laws of each of the various jurisdictions outside the United States in which the Firm does business.

Regulatory reform: On July 21, 2010, President Obama signed into law the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the “Dodd-Frank Act”), which is intended to make significant structural reforms to the financial services industry. As a result of the Dodd-Frank Act and other regulatory reforms, the Firm is currently experiencing a period of unprecedented change in regulation and such changes could have a significant impact on how the Firm conducts business. The Firm continues to work diligently in assessing and understanding the implications of the regulatory changes it is facing, and is devoting substantial resources to implementing all the new rules and regulations while meeting the needs and








Part I



expectations of its clients. Given the current status of the regulatory developments, the Firm cannot currently quantify the possible effects on its business and operations of all of the significant changes that are currently underway. For more information, see “Risk Factors” on pages 7–17. Certain of these changes include the following:

•Resolution plan. In September 2011, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the “Federal Reserve”) issued, pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, a final rule that will require bank holding companies with assets of $50 billion or more and companies designated as systemically important by the Financial Stability Oversight Council (the “FSOC”) to submit periodically to the Federal Reserve, the FDIC and the FSOC a plan for resolution under the Bankruptcy Code in the event of material distress or failure (a “resolution plan”). In January 2012, the FDIC also issued a final rule that will require insured depository institutions with assets of $50 billion or more to submit periodically to the FDIC a plan for resolution under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act in the event of failure. The timing of initial, annual and interim resolution plan submissions under both rules is the same. The Firm’s initial resolution plan submissions are due on July 1, 2012, with annual updates thereafter, and the Firm is in the process of developing its resolution plans.

•Debit interchange. On October 1, 2011, the Federal Reserve adopted final rules implementing the “Durbin Amendment” provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act, which limit the amount the Firm can charge for each debit card transaction it processes.

•Derivatives. Under the Dodd-Frank Act, the Firm will be subject to comprehensive regulation of its derivatives business, including capital and margin requirements, central clearing of standardized over-the-counter derivatives and the requirement that they be traded on regulated trading platforms, and heightened supervision. Further, the proposed margin rules for uncleared swaps may apply extraterritorially to U.S. firms doing business with clients outside of the United States. The Dodd-Frank Act also requires banking entities, such as JPMorgan Chase, to significantly restructure their derivatives businesses, including changing the legal entities through which certain transactions are conducted.

•Volcker Rule. The Firm will also be affected by the requirements of Section 619 of the Dodd-Frank Act, and specifically the provisions prohibiting proprietary trading and restricting the activities involving private equity and hedge funds (the “Volcker Rule”). On October 11, 2011, regulators proposed the remaining rules to implement the Volcker Rule, which are expected to be finalized sometime in 2012. Under the proposed rules, “proprietary trading” is defined as the trading of securities, derivatives, or futures (or options on any of the foregoing) that is predominantly for the purpose of short-term resale, benefiting from short-term movements



in prices or for realizing arbitrage profits for the Firm’s own account. The proposed rule’s definition of proprietary trading does not include client market-making, or certain risk management activities. The Firm ceased some proprietary trading activities during 2010, and is planning to cease its remaining proprietary trading activities within the timeframe mandated by the Volcker Rule.

•Capital. The treatment of trust preferred securities as Tier 1 capital for regulatory capital purposes will be phased out over a three year period, beginning in 2013. In addition, in June 2011, the Basel Committee and the Financial Stability Board (“FSB”) announced that certain global systemically important banks (“GSIBs”) would be required to maintain additional capital, above the Basel III Tier 1 common equity minimum, in amounts ranging from 1% to 2.5%, depending upon the bank’s systemic importance. In December 2011, the Federal Reserve, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (“OCC”) and FDIC issued a notice of proposed rulemaking for implementing ratings alternatives for the computation of risk-based capital for market risk exposures, which, if implemented, would result in significantly higher capital requirements for many securitization exposures. For more information, see “Capital requirements” on pages 4–5.

•FDIC Deposit Insurance Fund Assessments. In February 2011, the FDIC issued a final rule changing the assessment base and the method for calculating the deposit insurance assessment rate. These changes became effective on April 1, 2011, and resulted in an aggregate annualized increase of approximately $600 million in the assessments that the Firm’s bank subsidiaries pay to the FDIC. For more information, see “Deposit insurance” on page 5.

•Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection. The Dodd-Frank Act established a new regulatory agency, the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection (“CFPB”). The CFPB has authority to regulate providers of credit, payment and other consumer financial products and services. The CFPB has examination authority over large banks, such as JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and Chase Bank USA, N.A., with respect to the banks’ consumer financial products and services.

•Heightened prudential standards for systemically important financial institutions. The Dodd-Frank Act creates a structure to regulate systemically important financial companies, and subjects them to heightened prudential standards. For more information, see “Systemically important financial institutions” below.

•Concentration limits. The Dodd-Frank Act restricts acquisitions by financial companies if, as a result of the acquisition, the total liabilities of the financial company would exceed 10% of the total liabilities of all financial companies. The Federal Reserve is expected to issue rules related to this restriction in 2012.












The Dodd-Frank Act instructs U.S. federal banking and other regulatory agencies to conduct approximately 285 rulemakings and 130 studies and reports. These regulatory agencies include the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (the “CFTC”); the SEC; the Federal Reserve; the OCC; the FDIC; the CFPB; and the FSOC.

Other proposals have been made internationally, including additional capital and liquidity requirements that will apply to non-U.S. subsidiaries of JPMorgan Chase, such as J.P. Morgan Securities Ltd.

Systemically important financial institutions:The Dodd-Frank Act creates a structure to regulate systemically important financial institutions, and subjects them to heightened prudential standards, including heightened capital, leverage, liquidity, risk management, resolution plan, concentration limit, credit exposure reporting, and early remediation requirements. Systemically important financial institutions will be supervised by the Federal Reserve . Bank holding companies with over $50 billion in assets, including JPMorgan Chase, and certain nonbank financial companies that are designated by the FSOC will be considered systemically important financial institutions subject to the heightened standards and supervision.

In addition, if the regulators determine that the size or scope of activities of the company pose a threat to the safety and soundness of the company or the financial stability of the United States, the regulators have the power to require such companies to sell or transfer assets and terminate activities.

On December 20, 2011, the Federal Reserve issued proposed rules to implement these heightened prudential standards. For more information, see “Capital requirements” and “Prompt corrective action and early remediation” on page 5.

Permissible business activities: JPMorgan Chase elected to become a financial holding company as of March 13, 2000, pursuant to the provisions of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act. If a financial holding company or any depository institution controlled by a financial holding company ceases to meet certain capital or management standards, the Federal Reserve may impose corrective capital and/or managerial requirements on the financial holding company and place limitations on its ability to conduct the broader financial activities permissible for financial holding companies. In addition, the Federal Reserve may require divestiture of the holding company’s depository institutions if the deficiencies persist. Federal regulations also provide that if any depository institution controlled by a financial holding company fails to maintain a satisfactory rating under the Community Reinvestment Act, the Federal Reserve must prohibit the financial holding company and its subsidiaries from engaging in any additional activities other than those permissible for bank holding companies that are not financial holding companies. So long as the depository-institution subsidiaries of JPMorgan Chase meet the capital, management and Community Reinvestment Act requirements, the Firm is permitted to conduct the broader



activities permitted under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act.

The Federal Reserve has proposed rules under which the Federal Reserve could impose restrictions on systemically important financial institutions that are experiencing financial weakness, which restrictions could include limits on acquisitions, among other things. For more information on the restrictions, see “Prompt corrective action and early remediation” on page 5.

Regulation by Federal Reserve: The Federal Reserve acts as an “umbrella regulator” and certain of JPMorgan Chase’s subsidiaries are regulated directly by additional authorities based on the particular activities of those subsidiaries. For example, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., and Chase Bank USA, N.A., are regulated by the OCC. See “Other supervision and regulation” on pages 6–7 for a further description of the regulatory supervision to which the Firm’s subsidiaries are subject.

Dividend restrictions: Federal law imposes limitations on the payment of dividends by national banks. Dividends payable by JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and Chase Bank USA, N.A., as national bank subsidiaries of JPMorgan Chase, are limited to the lesser of the amounts calculated under a “recent earnings” test and an “undivided profits” test. Under the recent earnings test, a dividend may not be paid if the total of all dividends declared by a bank in any calendar year is in excess of the current year’s net income








Part I



combined with the retained net income of the two preceding years, unless the national bank obtains the approval of the OCC. Under the undivided profits test, a dividend may not be paid in excess of a bank’s “undivided profits.” See Note 27 on page 281 for the amount of dividends that the Firm’s principal bank subsidiaries could pay, at January 1, 2012, to their respective bank holding companies without the approval of their banking regulators.

In addition to the dividend restrictions described above, the OCC, the Federal Reserve and the FDIC have authority to prohibit or limit the payment of dividends by the banking organizations they supervise, including JPMorgan Chase and its bank and bank holding company subsidiaries, if, in the banking regulator’s opinion, payment of a dividend would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice in light of the financial condition of the banking organization.

Moreover, the Federal Reserve has issued rules requiring bank holding companies, such as JPMorgan Chase, to submit to the Federal Reserve a capital plan on an annual basis and receive a notice of non-objection from the Federal Reserve before taking capital actions, such as paying dividends, implementing common equity repurchase programs or redeeming or repurchasing capital instruments. The rules establish a supervisory capital assessment program that outlines Federal Reserve expectations concerning the processes that such bank holding companies should have in place to ensure they hold adequate capital and maintain ready access to funding under adverse conditions. The capital plan must demonstrate, among other things, how the bank holding company will maintain a pro forma Basel I Tier 1 common ratio above 5% under a supervisory stress scenario.

Capital requirements: Federal banking regulators have adopted risk-based capital and leverage guidelines that require the Firm’s capital-to-assets ratios to meet certain minimum standards.

The risk-based capital ratio is determined by allocating assets and specified off-balance sheet financial instruments into risk-weighted categories, with higher levels of capital being required for the categories perceived as representing greater risk. Under the guidelines, capital is divided into two tiers: Tier 1 capital and Tier 2 capital. The amount of Tier 2 capital may not exceed the amount of Tier 1 capital. Total capital is the sum of Tier 1 capital and Tier 2 capital. Under the guidelines, banking organizations are required to maintain a total capital ratio (total capital to risk-weighted assets) of 8% and a Tier 1 capital ratio of 4%. For a further description of these guidelines, see Note 28 on pages 281–283.

The federal banking regulators also have established minimum leverage ratio guidelines. The leverage ratio is defined as Tier 1 capital divided by adjusted average total assets. The minimum leverage ratio is 3% for bank holding companies that are considered “strong” under Federal Reserve guidelines or which have implemented the Federal Reserve’s risk-based capital measure for market risk. Other bank holding companies must have a minimum leverage



ratio of 4%. Bank holding companies may be expected to maintain ratios well above the minimum levels, depending upon their particular condition, risk profile and growth plans. The minimum risk-based capital requirements adopted by the federal banking agencies follow the Capital Accord of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (“Basel I”). In 2004, the Basel Committee published a revision to the Accord (“Basel II”). The goal of the Basel II Framework is to provide more risk-sensitive regulatory capital calculations and promote enhanced risk management practices among large, internationally active banking operations. In December 2010, the Basel Committee finalized further revisions to the Accord (“Basel III”) which narrowed the definition of capital, increased capital requirements for specific exposures, introduced short-term liquidity coverage and term funding standards, and established an international leverage ratio. In June 2011, the U.S. federal banking agencies issued rules to establish a permanent Basel I floor under Basel II/Basel III calculations. For further description of these capital requirements, see pages 119–122.

In connection with the U.S. Government’s Supervisory Capital Assessment Program in 2009, U.S. banking regulators developed a new measure of capital, Tier 1 common, which is defined as Tier 1 capital less elements of Tier 1 capital not in the form of common equity - such as perpetual preferred stock, noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries and trust preferred capital debt securities. Tier 1 common, a non-GAAP financial measure, is used by banking regulators, investors and analysts to assess and compare the quality and composition of the Firm’s capital with the capital of other financial services companies. The Firm uses Tier 1 common along with the other capital measures to assess and monitor its capital position. For more information, see Regulatory capital on pages 119–122.

In June 2011, the Basel Committee and the FSB announced that GSIBs would be required to maintain additional capital, above the Basel III Tier 1 common equity minimum, in amounts ranging from 1% to 2.5%, depending upon the bank’s systemic importance. Furthermore, in order to provide a disincentive for banks facing the highest required level of Tier 1 common equity to “increase materially their global systemic importance in the future,” an additional 1% charge could be applied.

The Basel III revisions governing the capital requirements are subject to prolonged observation and transition periods. The transition period for banks to meet the revised Tier 1 common equity requirement will begin in 2013, with implementation on January 1, 2019. The additional capital requirements for GSIBs will be phased-in starting January 1, 2016, with full implementation on January 1, 2019. The Firm will continue to monitor the ongoing rule-making process to assess both the timing and the impact of Basel III on its businesses and financial condition.

In addition to capital requirements, the Basel Committee has also proposed two new measures of liquidity risk: the












“Liquidity Coverage Ratio” and the “Net Stable Funding Ratio,” which are intended to measure, over different time spans, the amount of liquid assets held by the Firm. The observation periods for both these standards began in 2011, with implementation in 2015 and 2018, respectively.

The Dodd-Frank Act prohibits the use of external credit ratings in federal regulations. In December 2011, the Federal Reserve, OCC and FDIC issued a notice of proposed rulemaking for implementing ratings alternatives for the computation of risk-based capital for market risk exposures. The proposal, if implemented as currently proposed, would result in significantly higher capital requirements for many securitization exposures. The Firm anticipates that the U.S. banking agencies will apply a parallel capital treatment to securitizations in both the trading and banking books.

Effective January 1, 2008, the SEC authorized J.P. Morgan Securities LLC to use the alternative method of computing net capital for broker/dealers that are part of Consolidated Supervised Entities as defined by SEC rules. Accordingly, J.P. Morgan Securities LLC may calculate deductions for market risk using its internal market risk models.

For additional information regarding the Firm’s regulatory capital, see Regulatory capital on pages 119–122.

Prompt corrective action and early remediation: The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 requires the relevant federal banking regulator to take “prompt corrective action” with respect to a depository institution if that institution does not meet certain capital adequacy standards. The regulations apply only to banks and not to bank holding companies, such as JPMorgan Chase. However, the Federal Reserve is authorized to take appropriate action against the bank holding company based on the undercapitalized status of any bank subsidiary. In certain instances, the bank holding company would be required to guarantee the performance of the capital restoration plan for its undercapitalized subsidiary.

In addition, under the Dodd-Frank Act, the Federal Reserve is required to issue rules which would provide for early remediation of systemically important financial companies, such as JPMorgan Chase. In December 2011, the Federal Reserve issued proposed rules to implement these early remediation requirements on systemically important financial institutions that experience financial weakness. These proposed restrictions could include limits on capital distributions, acquisitions, and requirements to raise additional capital.

Deposit Insurance: The FDIC deposit insurance fund provides insurance coverage for certain deposits, which insurance is funded through assessments on banks, such as JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and Chase Bank USA, N.A. Higher levels of bank failures over the past few years have dramatically increased resolution costs of the FDIC and depleted the deposit insurance fund. In addition, the amount of FDIC insurance coverage for insured deposits has been increased generally from $100,000 per depositor to $250,000 per depositor, and until January 1, 2013, the



coverage for non-interest bearing demand deposits is unlimited. In light of the increased stress on the deposit insurance fund caused by these developments, and in order to maintain a strong funding position and restore the reserve ratios of the deposit insurance fund, the FDIC imposed a special assessment in June 2009, has increased assessment rates of insured institutions generally, and required insured institutions to prepay on December 30, 2009, the premiums that were expected to become due over the following three years.

As required by the Dodd-Frank Act, the FDIC issued a final rule in February 2011 that changes the assessment base from insured deposits to average consolidated total assets less average tangible equity, and changes the assessment rate calculation. These changes resulted in an aggregate annualized increase of approximately $600 million in the assessments that the Firm’s bank subsidiaries pay to the FDIC.

Powers of the FDIC upon insolvency of an insured depository institution or the Firm: Upon the insolvency of an insured depository institution, the FDIC will be appointed the conservator or receiver under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act. In such an insolvency, the FDIC has the power:

•to transfer any assets and liabilities to a new obligor without the approval of the institution’s creditors;

•to enforce the terms of the institution’s contracts pursuant to their terms; or

•to repudiate or disaffirm any contract or lease to which the institution is a party.

The above provisions would be applicable to obligations and liabilities of JPMorgan Chase’s subsidiaries that are insured depository institutions, such as JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., and Chase Bank USA, N.A., including, without limitation, obligations under senior or subordinated debt issued by those banks to investors (referred to below as “public noteholders”) in the public markets.

Under federal law, the claims of a receiver of an insured depository institution for administrative expense and the claims of holders of U.S. deposit liabilities (including the FDIC) have priority over the claims of other unsecured creditors of the institution, including public noteholders and depositors in non-U.S. offices.

An FDIC-insured depository institution can be held liable for any loss incurred or expected to be incurred by the FDIC in connection with another FDIC-insured institution under common control with such institution being “in default” or “in danger of default” (commonly referred to as “cross-guarantee” liability). An FDIC cross-guarantee claim against a depository institution is generally superior in right of payment to claims of the holding company and its affiliates against such depository institution.

Under the Dodd-Frank Act, where a systemically important financial institution, such as JPMorgan Chase, is in default or danger of default, the FDIC may be appointed receiver in order to conduct an orderly liquidation of such systemically








Part I



important financial institution. The FDIC has issued rules to implement its orderly liquidation authority, and is expected to propose additional rules. The FDIC has powers as receiver similar to those described above. However, the details of certain powers will be the subject of additional rulemakings and have not yet been fully delineated.

The Bank Secrecy Act: The Bank Secrecy Act (“BSA”) requires all financial institutions, including banks and securities broker-dealers, to, among other things, establish a risk-based system of internal controls reasonably designed to prevent money laundering and the financing of terrorism. The BSA includes a variety of recordkeeping and reporting requirements (such as cash and suspicious activity reporting), as well as due diligence/know-your-customer documentation requirements. The Firm has established a global anti-money laundering program in order to comply with BSA requirements.

Holding company as source of strength for bank subsidiaries: Under current Federal Reserve policy, JPMorgan Chase is expected to act as a source of financial strength to its bank subsidiaries and to commit resources to support these subsidiaries in circumstances where it might not do so absent such policy. Effective July 2011, provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act codified the Federal Reserve’s policy that require a bank holding company to serve as a source of strength for any depository institution subsidiary. However, because the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act provides for functional regulation of financial holding company activities by various regulators, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act prohibits the Federal Reserve from requiring payment by a holding company or subsidiary to a depository institution if the functional regulator of the payor objects to such payment. In such a case, the Federal Reserve could instead require the divestiture of the depository institution and impose operating restrictions pending the divestiture.

Restrictions on transactions with affiliates:The bank subsidiaries of JPMorgan Chase are subject to certain restrictions imposed by federal law on extensions of credit to, and certain other transactions with, the Firm and certain other affiliates, and on investments in stock or securities of JPMorgan Chase and those affiliates. These restrictions prevent JPMorgan Chase and other affiliates from borrowing from a bank subsidiary unless the loans are secured in specified amounts and are subject to certain other limits. For more information, see Note 27 on page 281. Effective in 2012, the Dodd-Frank Act extends such restrictions to derivatives and securities lending transactions. In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act’s Volcker Rule imposes similar restrictions on transactions between banking entities, such as JPMorgan Chase and its subsidiaries, and hedge funds or private equity funds for which the banking entity serves as the investment manager, investment advisor or sponsor.

Other supervision and regulation:The Firm’s banks and certain of its nonbank subsidiaries are subject to direct supervision and regulation by various other federal and state authorities (some of which are considered “functional



regulators” under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act). JPMorgan Chase’s national bank subsidiaries, such as JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., and Chase Bank USA, N.A., are subject to supervision and regulation by the OCC and, in certain matters, by the Federal Reserve and the FDIC. Supervision and regulation by the responsible regulatory agency generally includes comprehensive annual reviews of all major aspects of the relevant bank’s business and condition, and imposition of periodic reporting requirements and limitations on investments, among other powers.

The Firm conducts securities underwriting, dealing and brokerage activities in the United States through J.P. Morgan Securities LLC and other broker-dealer subsidiaries, all of which are subject to regulations of the SEC, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority and the New York Stock Exchange, among others. The Firm conducts similar securities activities outside the United States subject to local regulatory requirements. In the United Kingdom, those activities are conducted by J.P. Morgan Securities Ltd., which is regulated by the U.K. Financial Services Authority. The operations of JPMorgan Chase mutual funds also are subject to regulation by the SEC.

The Firm has subsidiaries that are members of futures exchanges in the United States and abroad and are registered accordingly.

In the United States, two subsidiaries are registered as futures commission merchants, and other subsidiaries are either registered with the CFTC as commodity pool operators and commodity trading advisors or exempt from such registration. These CFTC-registered subsidiaries are also members of the National Futures Association. The Firm’s U.S. energy business is subject to regulation by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. It is also subject to other extensive and evolving energy, commodities, environmental and other governmental regulation both in the U.S. and other jurisdictions globally.

Under the Dodd-Frank Act, the CFTC and SEC will be the regulators of the Firm’s derivatives businesses. The Firm expects that JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and J.P. Morgan Securities LLC will register with the CFTC as swap dealers and with the SEC as security-based swap dealers, and that J.P. Morgan Ventures Energy Corporation will register with the CFTC as a swap dealer.

The types of activities in which the non-U.S. branches of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and the international subsidiaries of JPMorgan Chase may engage are subject to various restrictions imposed by the Federal Reserve. Those non-U.S. branches and international subsidiaries also are subject to the laws and regulatory authorities of the countries in which they operate.

The activities of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and Chase Bank USA, N.A. as consumer lenders also are subject to regulation under various U.S. federal laws, including the Truth-in-Lending, Equal Credit Opportunity, Fair Credit Reporting, Fair Debt Collection Practice, Electronic Funds Transfer and CARD acts, as well as various state laws. These statutes impose requirements on consumer loan origination












and collection practices. Under the Dodd-Frank Act, the CFPB will be responsible for rulemaking and enforcement pursuant to such statutes.

Under the requirements imposed by the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, JPMorgan Chase and its subsidiaries are required periodically to disclose to their retail customers the Firm’s policies and practices with respect to the sharing of nonpublic customer information with JPMorgan Chase affiliates and others, and the confidentiality and security of that information. Under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, retail customers also must be given the opportunity to “opt out” of information-sharing arrangements with nonaffiliates, subject to certain exceptions set forth in the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act.
