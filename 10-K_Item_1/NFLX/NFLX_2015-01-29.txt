ABOUT US

Netflix, Inc. (“Netflix”, “the Company”, “we”, or “us”) is the world’s leading Internet television network with over 57 million streaming members in nearly 50 countries enjoying more than two billion hours of TV shows and movies per month, including original series, documentaries and feature films.  Our members can watch as much as they want, anytime, anywhere, on nearly any Internet-connected screen.  Members can play, pause and resume watching, all without commercials or commitments.  Additionally, in the United States ("U.S."), our members can receive DVDs delivered quickly to their homes.



We are a pioneer in the Internet delivery of TV shows and movies, launching our streaming service in 2007.  Since this launch, we have developed an ecosystem for Internet-connected screens and have licensed and acquired increasing amounts of content that enable consumers to enjoy TV shows and movies directly on their TVs, computers and mobile devices.  As a result of these efforts, we have experienced growing consumer acceptance of, and interest in, the delivery of TV shows and movies directly over the Internet.

Our core strategy is to grow our streaming membership business globally within the parameters of our consolidated net income and operating segment contribution profit (loss) targets. We are continuously improving our members' experience by expanding our streaming content with a focus on a programming mix of content that delights our members. We are continually enhancing our user interface and extending our streaming service to even more Internet-connected screens.



We continue to grow our streaming service both domestically and internationally.  We began our international expansion with Canada in 2010 and have since launched our service in Latin America and several European countries. We have also expanded our streaming content offering to include more exclusive and original programming, including several Emmy, Golden Globe and Academy Award nominated original series and documentaries.



Prior to July 2011, in the U.S., our streaming and DVD-by-mail operations were combined and members could receive both streaming content and DVDs under a single “hybrid” plan.  In July 2011, we separated the combined plans, making it necessary for members who wish to receive both DVDs-by-mail and streaming content to have two separate membership plans.



BUSINESS SEGMENTS

The Company has three reportable segments: Domestic streaming, International streaming and Domestic DVD.  The Domestic and International streaming segments derive revenues from monthly membership fees for services consisting solely of streaming content.  The Domestic DVD segment derives revenues from monthly membership fees for services consisting solely of DVD-by-mail.  For additional information regarding our segments, including information about our financial results by geography, seeNote 12of Item 8,Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.











COMPETITION

The market for entertainment video is intensely competitive and subject to rapid change.  We compete against other entertainment video providers, such as multichannel video programming distributors ("MVPDs"), Internet-based movie and TV content providers (including those that provide pirated content) and DVD rental outlets and more broadly against other sources of entertainment that our members could choose in their moments of free time. We also compete against entertainment video providers in obtaining content that our members love, both for licensed streaming content and for original content projects.

While consumers may maintain simultaneous relationships with multiple entertainment sources, we strive for consumers to choose us in their moments of free time.  We have often referred to this choice as our objective of "winning moments of truth." In attempting to win these moments of truth with our members, we are continually improving our service, including both our technology and our content, which is increasingly exclusive and curated, including our own original programming.

SEASONALITY

Our member growth exhibits a seasonal pattern that reflects variations when consumers buy Internet-connected devices and when they tend to increase their viewing.  Our domestic member growth is generally greatest in our fourth and first quarters (October through March), slowing in our second quarter (April through June) and then accelerating in our third quarter (July through September).  We expect each market in our International Steaming segment to demonstrate more predictable seasonal patterns as our service offering in each market becomes more established and we have a longer history to assess such patterns.  Additionally, the variable expenses associated with shipments of DVDs are highest in the first quarter due to the seasonal nature of DVD usage.

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY

We regard our trademarks, service marks, copyrights, patents, domain names, trade dress, trade secrets, proprietary technologies and similar intellectual property as important to our success.  We use a combination of patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws and confidentiality agreements to protect our proprietary intellectual property.  Our ability to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights is subject to certain risks and from time to time we encounter disputes over rights and obligations concerning intellectual property.  We cannot provide assurance that we will prevail in any intellectual property disputes.

EMPLOYEES

As of December 31, 2014, we had 2,189 full-time employees.  We also utilize part-time and temporary employees, primarily in our DVD fulfillment operations, to respond to the fluctuating demand for DVD shipments.  As of December 31, 2014, we had 261 part-time and temporary employees.  Our employees are not covered by collective bargaining agreements, however, to the extent we develop and produce our own content, certain employees of affiliated entities may be covered by such agreements, including certain writers, directors, actors and production personnel.
