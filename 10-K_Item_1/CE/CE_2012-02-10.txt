Business Strategy

Our strategic foundation is based on three pillars to deliver growth and create sustainable value: Business Focus, Strategic Growth Levers and Strategic Results.

Business Focus to Generate Long-Term Earnings Growth

We focus on businesses where we have a clear, sustainable and competitive advantage to generate long-term earnings growth. We continue to optimize our business portfolio to achieve industry, cost and technology leadership while expanding our product mix into higher value-added products.

Strategic Growth Levers for Value Creation

We expect to accelerate earnings growth, further strengthen our businesses and increase stockholder value through premier execution of our key strategic growth levers:

•Geographic Growth- Celanese is poised for future earnings growth through its geographically-balanced global footprint. Our global presence is aligned with the current and expected growth of our customers and provides flexible access to key feedstocks. We have established a strong presence and manufacturing base in Asia, one of the world's fastest growing regions. Our integrated chemical complex in Nanjing, China, the largest integrated acetyls complex in the world, serves as a foundation for our expansion in Asia and supports the region's increasing demand. We are also capturing growth with our established positions in North America and Europe, while pursuing growth opportunities in other emerging regions such as India, Indonesia and Brazil.

We own or lease27production facilities throughout the world. Our infrastructure of manufacturing plants, terminals, warehouses and sales offices provides us with a competitive advantage in anticipating and meeting the needs of our global and local customers in well-established and growing industries, while our geographic diversity reduces the potential impact of volatility in any individual country or region. Additionally, our equity and cost investments represent an important component of our strategy for expanding our global reach, providing our core businesses with a significant presence in Asia and the Middle East.

Due to our geographic breadth, our net sales are balanced across the global regions. For the year endedDecember 31, 2011,27%of our net sales were to customers located in North America,41%to customers in Europe and Africa,29%to customers in Asia-Pacific and3%to customers in South America.

•Innovation- Our innovation efforts are focused on creating value and finding solutions for our customers through new technologies, new applications and platforms, alternative raw materials and new market channels. These efforts bolster our earnings potential and drive technology leadership in our products and processes. For example, our Advanced Engineered Materials business has industry-leading polymer technologies used in high performance applications and our Industrial Specialties business provides attractive economic solutions for environmentally-sensitive low-VOC applications, including paints, coatings and adhesives. Our Acetyl Intermediates business uses industry-leading proprietary and licensed technologies, including our AOPlus®, AOPlus®2 and AOPlus®3 technologies for acetic acid production and VAntage®, VAntage Plus™, and VAntage®2 technologies for VAM production. Innovation opportunities in our Consumer Specialties business are focused on product and end-use diversification and build off of our core foundation of acetylation chemistry, fiber processing and food chemistry. In 2010, we introduced our innovative Celanese TCX®ethanol process technology which is expected to help meet the world's increasing need for low cost liquid fuels. Using basic hydrocarbons - not food crops - as feedstock, the innovative Celanese TCX®process technology is built on our industry-leading acetyl platform and integrates new proprietary technologies.

•Productivity- Through ongoing productivity efforts in all of our businesses and functions, we continually pursue opportunities to increase value, improve our competitive cost structures and deliver sustainable productivity improvement. Sources of productivity include improving yields, reducing energy consumption and reducing fixed manufacturing and selling, general and administrative costs. Each year, we generate productivity from hundreds of projects across our global operations to strengthen our operating leverage advantage and deliver cost improvements to offset fixed cost inflation. Recent examples of successful projects include consolidation of our North American and European financial shared services functions, an energy reduction program at our facility in Clear Lake, Texas and a manufacturing optimization project at our Lanaken, Belgium facility. We have a relentless focus on operational excellence, and these efforts allow us to offset inflation, improve operating performance and reinvest in our business.














•Portfolio Enhancements- We continually pursue and execute value-creating portfolio enhancements that meet our investment criteria and strengthen our technology-focused and specialty materials businesses. During the last 10 years, we have executed acquisitions and divestitures to broaden our portfolio and access new technology, products and markets. These portfolio enhancements have led to the unique portfolio of leading global businesses we enjoy today. Recent portfolio enhancements include our acquisition of the LFT business of FACT GmbH (Future Advanced Composites Technology) (“FACT”), as well as the Zenite®LCP and Thermx®PCT product lines from DuPont Performance Polymers in 2009 and 2010, respectively, to support growth in our Advanced Engineered Materials business.  In 2010, we also announced our plans to invest in a new POM facility through our 25%-owned National Methanol Company (“Ibn Sina”) venture in Saudi Arabia to strengthen our specialty materials portfolio. In 2012, we acquired the Vinac®and Flexbond®product lines from Ashland Inc. which will support the strategic growth of our Industrial Specialties Emulsions business.

Delivering Strategic Results with an Advantaged Portfolio

We have created a unique portfolio of technology and specialty materials businesses that will enable Celanese to deliver strategic results.

Our strategic affiliates represent an important component of our strategy for accelerated growth and global expansion. We have a substantial portfolio of ventures in various regions, including Asia-Pacific, North America, the Middle East and Europe. These ventures, some of which date back as far as the 1960s, have sizeable operations and are significant within their industries.

Our strategic affiliates have similar growth patterns and business models as our core businesses. With shared characteristics such as products, applications, and manufacturing technology, these strategic affiliates complement and extend our technology and specialty materials portfolio. We have historically entered into these investments to gain access to local demand, minimize costs and accelerate growth in areas we believe have significant future business potential. Depending on the level of investment and other factors, we account for our strategic ventures using either the equity method or cost method of accounting.

Our strategic affiliates contribute substantial sales, earnings and cash flows. During the year endedDecember 31, 2011, our equity affiliates generated combined sales of$5 billion, resulting in Celanese recording$192 millionof equity in net earnings of affiliates in the accompanying financial statements for the year endedDecember 31, 2011.

National Methanol Company (Ibn Sina).Founded in 1981, National Methanol Company represents approximately 2% of the world's methanol production capacity and is one of the world's largest producers of methyl tertiary-butyl ether (MTBE), a gasoline additive. Its production facilities are located in Saudi Arabia. We indirectly own a 25% interest in Ibn Sina through CTE Petrochemicals Company, a 50%/50% joint venture with Texas Eastern Arabian Corporation Ltd. (which also indirectly owns a 25% interest). The remaining 50% interest in Ibn Sina is held by the Saudi Basic Industries Corporation (“SABIC”). SABIC is responsible for all product marketing. Because methanol is a key feedstock for POM production, we enjoy an advantaged position through our Ibn Sina venture that mitigates the impact of raw material and energy volatility.

In April 2010, we announced that the term of the Ibn Sina agreement was extended until 2032 and that the joint venture will construct a 50,000 ton POM production facility in Saudi Arabia. The new facility will supply POM to support Advanced Engineered Materials' accelerated future growth plans as well as our venture partners' regional business development. Upon successful startup of the POM facility, our indirect economic interest in Ibn Sina will increase from 25% to 32.5%. SABIC's economic interest will remain unchanged.












Korea Engineering Plastics Co., Ltd.Founded in 1987, KEPCO is the leading producer of POM in South Korea. KEPCO is a venture between Celanese's Ticona business (50%), Mitsubishi Gas Chemical Company, Inc. (40%) and Mitsubishi Corporation (10%). KEPCO has polyacetal production facilities in Ulsan, South Korea, compounding facilities for PBT and nylon in Pyongtaek, South Korea, and participates with Polyplastics and Mitsubishi Gas Chemical Company, Inc. in a world-scale POM facility in Nantong, China.

Polyplastics Co., Ltd.Polyplastics is a leading supplier of engineered plastics in the Asia-Pacific region and is a venture between Daicel Chemical Industries Ltd., Japan (55%), and Celanese's Ticona business (45%). Established in 1964, Polyplastics is a producer and marketer of POM and LCP in the Asia-Pacific region, with principal production facilities located in Japan, Taiwan, Malaysia and China.

Fortron Industries LLC.Fortron is a leading global producer of polyphenylene sulfide (“PPS”), sold under the Fortron®brand, which is used in a wide variety of automotive and other applications, especially those requiring heat and/or chemical resistance.  Established in 1992, Fortron is a limited liability company whose members are Ticona Fortron Inc. (50% ownership and a wholly-owned subsidiary of CNA Holdings, LLC) and Kureha Corporation (50% ownership and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Kureha Chemical Industry Co., Ltd. of Japan). Fortron's facility is located in Wilmington, North Carolina. This venture combines the sales, marketing, distribution, compounding and manufacturing expertise of Celanese with the PPS polymer technology expertise of Kureha.

China acetate strategic ventures.We hold an approximate 30% ownership interest in three separate acetate production ventures in China. These include the Nantong Cellulose Fibers Co. Ltd., Kunming Cellulose Fibers Co. Ltd. and Zhuhai Cellulose Fibers Co. Ltd. The China National Tobacco Corporation, the Chinese state-owned tobacco entity, controls the remaining ownership interest in each of these ventures.

With an estimated 30% share of the world's cigarette production and consumption, China is the world's largest and fastest growing area for acetate tow products according to the 2009 Stanford Research Institute International Chemical Economics Handbook. Combined, these ventures are a leader in Chinese domestic acetate production and are well positioned to supply Chinese cigarette producers.

In December 2009, we announced plans with China National Tobacco to expand our acetate flake and tow capacity at our venture's Nantong facility and we received formal approval for the expansions, each by 30,000 tons, during 2010. Since their inception in 1986, the China acetate ventures have completed 12 expansions, leading to earnings growth and increased dividends.

Our Chinese acetate ventures fund their operations using operating cash flow. During 2011, we made contributions of$8 millionrelated to the capacity expansions in Nantong and have committed contributions of$9 millionin 2012. In 2010, we made contributions of$12 million.

Our Chinese acetate ventures pay a dividend in the second quarter of each fiscal year, based on the ventures' performance for the preceding year. In2011,2010and2009, we received cash dividends of $78 million, $71 million and $56 million, respectively.

Although our ownership interest in each of our China acetate ventures exceeds 20%, we account for these investments using the cost method of accounting because we determined that we cannot exercise significant influence over these entities due to local government investment in and influence over these entities, limitations on our involvement in the day-to-day operations and the present inability of the entities to provide timely financial information prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“US GAAP”).

Raw Materials and Energy

We purchase a variety of raw materials and energy from sources in many countries for use in our production processes. We have a policy of maintaining, when available, multiple sources of supply for materials. However, some of our individual plants may have single sources of supply for some of their raw materials, such as carbon monoxide, steam and acetaldehyde. Although we have been able to obtain sufficient supplies of raw materials, there can be no assurance that unforeseen developments will not affect our raw material supply. Even if we have multiple sources of supply for a raw material, there can be no assurance that these sources can make up for the loss of a major supplier. There cannot be any guarantee that profitability will not be affected should we be required to qualify additional sources of supply to our specifications in the event of the loss of a sole supplier. In addition, the price of raw materials varies, often substantially, from year to year.

A substantial portion of our products and raw materials are commodities whose prices fluctuate as supply and demand fundamentals change. Our production facilities rely largely on fuel oil, natural gas, coal and electricity for energy. Most of the raw materials for our European operations are centrally purchased by one of our subsidiaries, which also buys raw materials on behalf of third parties. We manage our exposure to commodity risk primarily through the use of long-term supply agreements, multi-year purchasing and sales agreements and forward purchase contracts.

We also currently purchase and lease supplies of various precious metals, such as rhodium, used as catalysts for the manufacture of Acetyl Intermediates products. For precious metals, the leases are distributed among a minimum of three lessors per product.

Research and Development

Our businesses are innovation-oriented and conduct research and development activities to develop new, and optimize existing, production technologies, as well as to develop commercially viable new products and applications. We consider the amounts spent during each of the last three fiscal years on research and development activities to be sufficient to execute our current strategic initiatives.

Intellectual Property

We attach great importance to patents, trademarks, copyrights and product designs in order to protect our investment in research and development, manufacturing and marketing. Patents may cover processes, products, intermediate products and product uses. We also seek to register trademarks extensively as a means of protecting the brand names of our products. We protect our intellectual property vigorously against infringement and also seek to register design protection where appropriate.

Patents.In most industrial countries, patent protection exists for new substances and formulations, as well as for unique applications and production processes. However, we do business in regions of the world where intellectual property protection may be limited and difficult to enforce. We maintain strict information security policies and procedures wherever we do business. Such information security policies and procedures include data encryption, controls over the disclosure and safekeeping of confidential information, as well as employee awareness training. Moreover, we monitor competitive developments and vigorously defend against infringements on our intellectual property rights.

Backlog

We do not consider backlog to be a significant indicator of the level of future sales activity. In general, we do not manufacture our products against a backlog of orders. Production and inventory levels are based on the level of incoming orders as well as projections of future demand. Therefore, we believe that backlog information is not material to understanding our overall business and should not be considered a reliable indicator of our ability to achieve any particular level of revenue or financial performance.
