FUNDAMENTALS OF OUR BUSINESS

A Year In Review



OUR STRATEGY

We are in the midst of one of the most significant transformations in our corporate history. Over the last five years, we’ve made key investments and decisions to enter data-rich markets and deploy our IP and manufacturing technologies to redefine and expand our target market. We have evolved from a PC-centric company with a server business, to a data-centric company with an expanding portfolio of technology solutions that address customer needs across platform, storage, connectivity, and software. This transformation is evidenced by our 2018 revenue, of which roughly half was earned from data-centric businesses, and the expansion of our TAM, which we last estimated at more than $300 billion


.

Our customers are looking for solutions that can process, analyze, store, and transfer data—turning it into actionable insights, amazing experiences, and competitive advantages. The Intel

®

architecture platform provides the foundation for new solutions that take advantage of this growth of data.

INTELLECTUAL CAPITAL

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

Every year we make a significant investment in R&D, as it is a critical factor in achieving our strategic objectives to make the world's best semiconductors, lead the AI and autonomous revolution, and provide leading end-to-end platform solutions. Successful R&D efforts can lead to new products and technologies, or improvements to existing ones, which we seek to protect through our IP rights. We may augment our R&D initiatives by investing in or acquiring companies or entering into R&D agreements with other companies, as well as by directly purchasing or licensing technology.

We have increased our investments in R&D in each of the last five years and intensified our focus on key priorities in product technology while exiting non-core businesses, such as our divestiture of Wind River Systems, Inc. (Wind River) during 2018.

Architecture.

We are designing products for four major computing architectures—scalar (CPU products), vector (GPU products), matrix (AI accelerator products), and spatial (FPGA products)—as we move toward a model of providing multiple "xPU" compute platforms for a more diverse era of computing. In 2018, we announced "Sunny Cove," our next-generation CPU microarchitecture, with architectural extensions designed for special-purpose computing tasks such as AI and cryptography, among other features. We are also continuing development on our first discrete GPU.

Memory.

With our Intel

®

3D NAND and Intel

®

Optane™ technologies, we are developing products to disrupt the memory and storage hierarchy. We are shipping our Intel

®

Optane™ DC Persistent Memory, which combines memory-like performance with the larger capacity and persistence of storage, bringing more data closer to the CPU to help improve processing of big data sets like those used in AI and large databases. Our QLC 3D NAND technology allows users to move more data from hard disks to SSDs, giving them faster access to their data.

Interconnect.

We have a broad portfolio of interconnect solutions, ranging from silicon to the data center to wireless. Our silicon photonics technology integrates lasers into silicon to create high-speed optical connections that can help remove networking bottlenecks in the data center. We are driving the 5G transition by offering products that communications service providers use to transform their networks for 5G, as well as through development of 5G modems.

Security technologies.

W

e have made significant investments in security technologies, and built-in security features are integrated into our design process and roadmap. In the first half of 2018, we created the Intel Product Assurance and Security Group to serve as a center for security research across our products and businesses, not only to address the security issues of today, but also to monitor the evolving threat landscape and seek to continuously improve our product security in the years ahead.

Software.

Software plays a critical role in unlocking the performance potential of our hardware products. Our vision is to unify our software abstractions across all of our xPU platforms. We are developing a project called OneAPI to simplify programming for developers across our CPU, GPU, FPGA, AI and other accelerator products, providing a unified portfolio of developer tools for mapping software to the hardware that can best accelerate the code.

IP RIGHTS

We own and develop significant IP and related IP rights around the world that relate to our products, services, R&D, and other activities and assets. Our IP portfolio includes patents, copyrights, trade secrets, trademarks, maskwork, and other rights. We actively seek to protect our global IP rights and to deter unauthorized use of our IP and other assets. For a detailed discussion of our IP rights, see "Intellectual Property Rights and Licensing" within Other Key Information.

FUNDAMENTALS OF OUR BUSINESS

Our Capital



MANUFACTURED CAPITAL

We are an integrated device manufacturer (IDM). Unlike many other semiconductor companies, we primarily design and manufacture our products in our own manufacturing facilities. We see our in-house manufacturing as one of our most critical forms of capital and an important advantage.

MANUFACTURING PROCESS TECHNOLOGY

We continue to develop new generations of manufacturing process technology as we seek to realize the benefits from Moore’s Law, a law of economics predicted by Intel’s co-founder Gordon Moore more than 50 years ago. Realizing Moore’s Law results in economic benefits as we are able to either reduce a chip's cost as we shrink its size or increase functionality and performance of a chip while maintaining the same cost with higher density. This makes possible the innovation of new products with higher performance while balancing power efficiency, cost, and size to meet customers' needs.

As of the end of 2018, our platform products were manufactured on 300mm wafers, with the majority manufactured using our 14nm process node, and we are currently ramping our next-generation 10nm process node. We have lengthened our utilization of our 14nm process to meet an annual cadence of product introductions while developing 10nm process technology. Over the course of our 14nm process generation, we have achieved significant product performance improvement. We expect the same trend of utilizing a process node for multiple waves of products to continue as we ramp 10nm.

With our 10nm process technology, we are striving for an aggressive density improvement target, beyond the density scaling we delivered with 14nm. We have experienced challenges associated with 10nm development and implementation, and announced in 2018 that volume production on our 10nm products would be delayed from the second half of 2018 into 2019. We have made good progress on improving 10nm yields in 2018, and we continue to expect volume client systems on retail shelves for the 2019 holiday season, with data center products to follow in 2020.

FACTORY NETWORK AND SUPPLY CHAIN

The map marks our manufacturing facilities and their primary functions, as well as the countries where we have a significant R&D or sales and marketing presence.

Approximately half of our wafer manufacturing is conducted within the U.S. We incur factory start-up costs as we ramp our facilities for new process technologies. We continued to ramp the 10nm process node in our Oregon and Israel locations and to expand our memory fab, Fab 68. Memory investments represented approximately 20% of total capital spending for 2018.

Our manufacturing facilities are primarily used for silicon wafer manufacturing of our platform and memory products. These facilities are built following a “copy exactly” methodology, whereby new process technologies are transferred identically from a central development fab to each manufacturing facility. This enables fast ramp of the operation as well as better quality control. These wafer fabs operate in a network of manufacturing facilities integrated as one factory to provide the most flexible supply capacity, allowing us to better analyze our production costs and adapt to changes in capacity needs.

We use a multi-source strategy for our memory business to enable a robust and flexible supply chain. Throughout 2018, we increased the memory capacity in Fab 68, where we ramped 3D NAND production. In addition, we have a supplemental supply agreement with Micron Technology, Inc. (Micron), as well as capacity from our joint venture, IM Flash Technologies, LLC (IMFT) factory in Lehi, Utah. In

January 2019, Micron called our interest in IMFT. The IMFT agreement provides for supply for up to one year after the close of the transaction.

We use third-party foundries to manufacture wafers for certain components and leverage subcontractors to augment capacity to perform assembly and test in addition to our in-house manufacturing, primarily for chipsets and adjacent products.

MARKET AND BUSINESS OVERVIEW

Market trends and strategy

Data is a significant force in society today, and data is generated by intelligent and connected devices and infrastructures, such as phones and automated factories. Data is transmitted through network infrastructure, processed, and analyzed to become real-time information. This real-time information enables actionable insights and is the lifeblood for the future of technology innovation in areas such as AI.

Our thesis is that the massive growth of data worldwide will increase demand to process, analyze, store, and move data. We are one of the few companies that touches every part of the data revolution, and we've invested both organically and acquisitively to capitalize on these demands. We expect the growth momentum in DCG and the other data-centric businesses to continue in the long term.

DCG focuses on three market segments: cloud service providers, enterprise and government, and communication service providers. In 2018, cloud revenue grew as service providers continued to invest in infrastructure to meet the explosive demand for digital services, AI, and data analytics. Enterprise and government revenue was stable, driven by macro environment strength and increased deployment of hybrid cloud solutions and data-intensive workloads. Compared to 2017, where we saw workload migration as the main force of cloud growth, we now see new services as the primary drivers to public cloud demand while enterprise increased on-premises investments, including hybrid and private cloud deployments. In the communication service provider segment, we gained market segment share as customers chose to virtualize and transform their networks and prepare for the 5G transition using Intel

®

architecture.

Products and competitiveness

We offer a broad portfolio of platforms and technologies designed to provide workload-optimized performance across compute, storage, and network. These offerings span the full spectrum from the data center core to the network edge. In addition, DCG focuses on lowering the total cost of ownership and on other specific workload optimizations for the enterprise, cloud service provider, and communications service provider market segments, with hardware-enhanced performance, security features, and reliability. DCG's platform value can be extended through Intel adjacent products such as FPGAs and SSDs.

In 2018, we began shipping for revenue the second generation Intel Xeon Scalable processors, formerly code-named Cascade Lake, and they will launch in 2019. The new product delivers performance improvement over the prior generation on popular workloads, includes hardware-based mitigations for certain side-channel vulnerabilities, and introduces new capabilities with support for Intel Optane DC persistent memory. The combination of Intel Xeon processors and Intel Optane memory significantly boosted overall system performance and reduced total cost of ownership compared to the prior generation.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

We consider the following when assessing our liquidity and capital resources:

Cash generated by operations is our primary source of liquidity. We maintain a diverse investment portfolio that we continually analyze based on issuer, industry, and country. When assessing our sources of liquidity, we include investments as shown in the preceding table.

Substantially all

of our investments in debt instruments and financing receivables are in investment-grade securities.

Other potential sources of liquidity include our commercial paper program and our automatic shelf registration statement on file with the SEC, pursuant to which we may offer an unspecified amount of debt, equity, and other securities. Under our commercial paper program, we have an ongoing authorization from our Board of Directors to borrow up to

$10.0 billion

. As of

December 29, 2018

,

$480 million

of commercial paper remained outstanding. During


, we remarketed a total of

$423 million

aggregate principal amount of bonds issued by the Industrial Development Authority of the City of Chandler, Arizona and the State of Oregon Business Development Commission. We also repaid

$600 million

of our

2.50%

senior notes that matured in

November 2018

and paid

$2.4 billion

in cash to satisfy conversion requests for a portion of our

$2.0 billion

3.25%

junior subordinated convertible debentures due 2039.

The enactment of Tax Reform in December 2017 imposed a tax on all previously untaxed earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries of U.S. corporations. Future distributions of non-U.S. assets to the U.S. are no longer subject to U.S. taxation in most cases. As a result, in Q4 2017 we recognized a one-time provisional transition tax expense of

$6.1 billion

, which was adjusted to

$5.9 billion

in 2018. We expect to pay the tax in annual installments from 2019 through 2026. We believe that our current U.S. sources of cash and liquidity are sufficient to meet our tax liability.

During Q3 2017, we acquired

97.3%

of Mobileye's outstanding ordinary shares for $14.5 billion net cash. We funded the acquisition of shares with cash held by our non-U.S. subsidiaries. During Q2 2018, we acquired the remaining outstanding ordinary shares for $380 million.

We believe we have sufficient financial resources to meet our business requirements in the next 12 months, including capital expenditures for worldwide manufacturing and assembly and test; working capital requirements; and potential acquisitions, strategic investments, dividends, and common stock repurchases.

For


compared to


, the

$7.3 billion

increase

in cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to higher net income, offset by changes in working capital. Changes in working capital were driven by taxes and accounts receivables, offset by relatively flat inventory levels. Income taxes paid, net of refunds, in

, net of customer utilization, compared to

$1.1 billion

in


.

For


compared to


, the

$302 million

increase

in cash provided by operating activities was due to changes to working capital partially offset by adjustments for non-cash items and lower net income. Tax Reform did not have an impact on our 2017 cash provided by operating activities. The increase in cash provided by operating activities was driven by increased income before taxes and $1.1 billion receipts of customer deposits and prepaid supply agreements. These increases were partially offset by increased inventory and accounts receivable. Income taxes paid, net of refunds, in 2017 compared to 2016 were $2.9 billion higher due to higher income before taxes, taxable gains on sales of ASML, and taxes on the ISecG divestiture.

INVESTING ACTIVITIES

Investing cash flows consist primarily of capital expenditures; investment purchases, sales, maturities, and disposals; and proceeds from divestitures and cash used for acquisitions. Our capital expenditures were

$15.2 billion

in


(

$11.8 billion

in


and

$9.6 billion

in


).

The

decrease

in cash used for investing activities in


compared to


was primarily due to lower cash paid on acquisitions and increased cash from net trading asset activity. This was partially offset by increased capital expenditures, net available-for-sale debt investments activity, decreased proceeds from divestitures, and decreased sales of equity investments (substantially all from ASML sales).

The

decrease

in cash used for investing activities in


compared to


was primarily due to higher net activity of available-for-sale debt investments in 2017, proceeds from our divestiture of ISecG in 2017, and higher maturities and sales of trading assets in 2017. This activity was partially offset by higher capital expenditures in 2017.

FINANCING ACTIVITIES

Financing cash flows consist primarily of repurchases of common stock, payment of dividends to stockholders, issuance and repayment of short-term and long-term debt, and proceeds from the sale of shares of common stock through employee equity incentive plans.

The

increase

in cash used for financing activities in


compared to


was primarily due to decreased long-term debt issuance and increased repurchases of common stock. During


, we repurchased

$10.7 billion

of common stock under our authorized common stock repurchase program, compared to

$3.6 billion

in


. In 2018, the Board approved a

$15.0 billion

increase in our authorized stock repurchase program. As of

December 29, 2018

,

$17.3 billion

remained available for repurchasing common stock under the repurchase authorization limit. We base our level of common stock repurchases on internal cash management decisions, and this level may fluctuate. Our total dividend payments were

$5.5 billion

in


compared to

$5.1 billion

in


. We have paid a cash dividend in each of the past


quarters. In Q1 2019, the Board declared a quarterly cash dividend of

$0.315

per share of common stock, payable on March 1,


to stockholders of record on February 7,


.

The

increase

in cash used for financing activities in


compared to


was primarily due to net long-term debt activity, which was a use of cash in 2017 compared to a source of cash in 2016. Additionally, cash used for common stock repurchases was higher in 2017 compared to 2016.

Significant contractual obligations as of

December 29, 2018

were as follows:


Capital purchase obligations represent commitments for the construction or purchase of property, plant and equipment. They were not recorded as liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets as of

December 29, 2018

, as we had not yet received the related goods nor taken title to the property.


Other purchase obligations and commitments include payments due under various types of licenses and agreements to purchase goods or services, as well as payments due under non-contingent funding obligations.


Tax obligations represent the future cash payments related to Tax Reform enacted in 2017 for the one-time transition tax on our previously untaxed foreign earnings. For further information, see "

Note 9: Income Taxes

" within the Consolidated Financial Statements.


Amounts represent principal payments for all debt obligations and interest payments for fixed-rate debt obligations. Interest payments on floating-rate debt obligations, as well as the impact of fixed-rate to floating-rate debt swaps, are excluded. Debt obligations are

classified based on their stated maturity date, regardless of their classification on the consolidated balance sheet

s. Any future settlement of convertible debt would impact our cash payments.


Amounts represent future cash payments to satisfy other long-term liabilities recorded on our consolidated balance sheets, including the short-term portion of these long-term liabilities. Derivative instruments are excluded from the preceding table, as they do not represent the amounts that may ultimately be paid.


Total excludes contractual obligations already recorded on our consolidated balance sheets as current liabilities, except for the short-term portions of long-term debt obligations and other long-term liabilities.

The expected timing of payments of the obligations in the preceding table is estimated based on current information. Timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different, depending on the time of receipt of goods or services, or changes to agreed-upon amounts for some obligations.

Contractual obligations for purchases of goods or services included in "Other purchase obligations and commitments" in the preceding table include agreements that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum, or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. For obligations with cancellation provisions, the amounts included in the preceding table were limited to the non-cancelable portion of the agreement terms or the minimum cancellation fee.

For the purchase of raw materials, we have entered into certain agreements that specify minimum prices and quantities based on a percentage of the total available market or based on a percentage of our future purchasing requirements. Due to the uncertainty of the future market and our future purchasing requirements, as well as the non-binding nature of these agreements, obligations under these agreements have been excluded from the preceding table. Our purchase orders for other products are based on our current manufacturing needs and are fulfilled by our vendors within short time horizons. In addition, some of our purchase orders represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements.

Contractual obligations that are contingent upon the achievement of certain milestones have been excluded from the preceding table.

Most

of our milestone-based contracts are tooling related for the purchase of capital equipment. These arrangements are not considered contractual obligations until the milestone is met by the counterparty.

As of

December 29, 2018

, assuming that all future milestones are met, the additional required payments would be approximately

$688 million

.

For the majority of restricted stock units (RSUs) granted, the number of shares of common stock issued on the date the RSUs vest is net of the minimum statutory withholding requirements that we pay in cash to the appropriate taxing authorities on behalf of our employees. The obligation to pay the relevant taxing authority is excluded from the preceding table, as the amount is contingent upon continued employment. In addition, the amount of the obligation is unknown, as it is based in part on the market price of our common stock when the awards vest.

MD&A

Consolidated Results and Analysis



During 2014, we entered into a series of agreements with Tsinghua Unigroup Ltd. (Tsinghua Unigroup), an operating subsidiary of Tsinghua Holdings Co. Ltd., to, among other things, jointly develop Intel architecture and communications-based solutions for phones. Subject to regulatory approvals and other closing conditions, we have agreed to invest up to

$9.0 billion

Chinese yuan (approximately

$1.5 billion

as of the date of the agreement) for a minority stake of Beijing Unisoc Technology Ltd. (Unisoc), formally Beijing UniSpreadtrum Technology Ltd. During 2015, we invested

$966 million

to complete the first phase of the equity investment, and the second phase of the investment will require additional funding of approximately

$500 million

; however, as our obligation is contingent upon regulatory approvals and other closing conditions, it has been excluded from the preceding table.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

We are affected by changes in currency exchange and interest rates, as well as equity and commodity prices. Our risk management programs reduce, but may not entirely eliminate, the impacts of these risks. All of the following potential changes are based on sensitivity analyses performed on our financial positions as of

December 29, 2018

and

December 30, 2017

. Actual results may differ materially.

CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES

We are exposed to currency exchange risks of non-U.S.-dollar-denominated investments in debt instruments and loans receivable, and may economically hedge this risk with foreign currency contracts, such as currency forward contracts or currency interest rate swaps. Gains or losses on these non-U.S.-currency investments are generally offset by corresponding losses or gains on the related hedging instruments. We are exposed to currency exchange risks from our non-U.S.-dollar-denominated debt indebtedness and may use foreign currency contracts designated as cash flow hedges to manage this risk.

Substantially all

of our revenue is transacted in U.S. dollars. However, a

significant

portion of our operating expenditures and capital purchases are incurred in other currencies,

primarily the euro, the Japanese yen, the Israeli shekel, and the Chinese yuan

. We have established currency risk management programs to protect against currency exchange rate risks associated with non-U.S. dollar forecasted future cash flows and existing non-U.S. dollar monetary assets and liabilities. We may also hedge currency risk arising from funding of foreign currency-denominated future investments. We may utilize foreign currency contracts, such as currency forwards or option contracts in these hedging programs. We considered the historical trends in currency exchange rates and determined that it was reasonably possible that a weighted average adverse change of

20%

in currency exchange rates could be experienced in the near term. Such an adverse change, after taking into account balance sheet hedges only and offsetting recorded monetary asset and liability positions outstanding as of

December 29, 2018

and

December 30, 2017

, would result in an adverse impact on income before taxes of less than

$46 million

and less than

$95 million

, respectively.

INTEREST RATES

We are exposed to interest rate risk related to our fixed-rate investment portfolio and outstanding debt. The primary objective of our investment policy is to preserve principal and the financial flexibility to fund our business while maximizing yields, which generally track the U.S. dollar three-month LIBOR. We generally enter into interest rate contracts to convert the returns on our fixed-rate debt investment with remaining maturities longer than six months into U.S. dollar three-month LIBOR-based returns. We also enter into swaps to convert fixed-rate coupon payments into floating-rate coupon payments for our existing indebtedness. Gains or losses on these instruments are generally offset by corresponding losses or gains on the related hedging instruments.

A hypothetical increase in benchmark interest rates of up to

1.0%

, after taking into account investment hedges, would have resulted in a decrease in the fair value of our investment portfolio of approximately

$110 million

as of

December 29, 2018

(a hypothetical decrease of 1.0% would have resulted in an increase of approximately

$100 million

as of

December 30, 2017

).

Taking into account floating-rate debt, and fixed-rate debt that is swapped to floating-rate debt, a hypothetical increase in interest rates of up to

1.0%

would result in an increase in annual interest expense on our indebtedness of approximately

$215 million

from debt outstanding as of

December 29, 2018

(an increase of approximately

$140 million

from debt outstanding as of

December 30, 2017

). We have changed our presentation from the prior year to show the impact of interest rate changes on interest expense rather than on fair value of debt in order to present information that could hypothetically impact our net income and cash flows.

EQUITY PRICES

Our investments include marketable equity securities and equity derivative instruments. We typically do not attempt to reduce or eliminate our equity market exposure through hedging activities at the inception of our investments. In the event we do decide to enter into hedge arrangements, before doing so we evaluate legal, market, and economic factors, as well as the expected timing of disposal, to determine whether hedging is appropriate. Our equity market risk management program may include equity derivatives with or without hedge accounting designation that utilize warrants, equity options, or other equity derivatives.

We also utilize total return swaps to offset changes in liabilities related to the equity market risks of certain deferred compensation arrangements. Gains or losses from changes in fair value of these total return swaps are generally offset by the losses or gains on the related liabilities.

MD&A

Consolidated Results and Analysis



As of

December 29, 2018

, the fair value of our marketable equity investments and our equity derivative instruments, including hedging positions, was

$1.4 billion

(

$4.2 billion

as of

December 30, 2017

).

A substantial majority

of our marketable equity investments portfolio as of

December 29, 2018

was concentrated in our investment in ASML of

$1.1 billion

(

$3.6 billion

as of

December 30, 2017

). To determine reasonably possible decreases in the market value of our marketable equity investments, we have analyzed the historical market price sensitivity of our marketable equity investment portfolio. Assuming a decline of

40%

in market prices, and after reflecting the impact of hedges and offsetting positions, the aggregate value of our marketable equity investments could decrease by approximately

$0.6 billion

, based on the value as of

December 29, 2018

(a decrease in value of approximately

$1.1 billion

, based on the value as of

December 30, 2017

using an assumed decline of

25%

). Beginning in 2018, as explained in "

Note 3: Recent Accounting Standards

" within the Consolidated Financial Statements, changes in the fair value of our marketable equity securities will be measured and recorded at fair value with changes in fair value recorded through the income statement.

Many of the same factors that could result in an adverse movement of equity market prices affect our non-marketable equity investments, although we cannot always quantify the impacts directly. Financial markets are volatile, which could negatively affect the prospects of the companies we invest in, their ability to raise additional capital, and the likelihood of our ability to realize value in our investments through liquidity events such as initial public offerings, mergers, and private sales. These types of investments involve a great deal of risk, and there can be no assurance that any specific company will grow or become successful; consequently, we could lose all or part of our investment. Our non-marketable equity securities had a carrying amount of

$3.0 billion

as of

December 29, 2018

(

$2.6 billion

as of

December 30, 2017

) and included our investment in Unisoc of

$658 million

(

$658 million

for Unisoc as of

December 30, 2017

). The carrying amount of our equity method investments was

$1.6 billion

as of

December 29, 2018

(

$1.8 billion

as of

December 30, 2017

).

Substantially all

of our equity method investments balance as of

December 29, 2018

was concentrated in our IMFT investment of

$1.6 billion

(

$1.5 billion

for IMFT as of

December 30, 2017

).

COMMODITY PRICE RISK

Although we operate facilities that consume commodities, we are not directly affected by commodity price risk to a material degree. We have established forecasted transaction risk management programs to protect against fluctuations in commodity prices. We may use commodity derivatives contracts, such as commodity swaps, in these hedging programs. In addition, we have sourcing plans in place that mitigate the risk of a potential supplier concentration for our key commodities.

SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA


In Q1 2018, we adopted "Retirement Benefits - Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Cost" on a retrospective basis. As a result of the adoption of this standard, cost of sales, operating expenses, and interest and other, net for periods 2017 and 2016 in the preceding table have been restated.


In Q4 2017, we recognized a

$5.4 billion

higher income tax expense as a result of one-time impacts from Tax Reform. In 2018, our effective tax rate benefited from the reduction of the U.S. statutory federal tax rate.

OTHER KEY INFORMATION



SALES AND MARKETING

CUSTOMERS

We sell our products primarily to original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) and original design manufacturers (ODMs). ODMs provide design and manufacturing services to branded and unbranded private-label resellers. In addition, our customers include other manufacturers and service providers, such as industrial and communication equipment manufacturers and cloud service providers, who buy our products through distributor, reseller, retail, and OEM channels throughout the world. For more information about our customers, including customers who accounted for greater than 10% of our net consolidated revenue, see "

Note 4: Operating Segments

" within the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Our worldwide reseller sales channel consists of thousands of indirect customers—systems builders that purchase Intel

®

processors and other products from our distributors. We have incentive programs that allow distributors to sell our microprocessors and other products in small quantities to customers of systems builders. Our microprocessors and other products are also available in direct retail outlets.

SALES ARRANGEMENTS

Our products are sold through sales offices throughout the world. Sales of our products are frequently made via purchase order acknowledgments that contain standard terms and conditions covering matters such as pricing, payment terms, and warranties, as well as indemnities for issues specific to our products, such as patent and copyright indemnities. From time to time, we may enter into additional agreements with customers covering, for example, changes from our standard terms and conditions, new product development and marketing, and private-label branding. Our sales are routinely made using electronic and web-based processes that allow the customer to review inventory availability and track the progress of specific goods ordered. Pricing on particular products may vary based on volumes ordered and other factors. We also offer discounts, rebates, and other incentives to customers to increase acceptance of our products and technology.

In accordance with contract terms, revenue for product sales is recognized at the time of product shipment from our facilities or delivery to the customer location, as determined by the agreed-upon shipping terms

. Our standard terms and conditions of sale typically provide that payment is due at a later date, 30 days after shipment or delivery.

We assess credit risk through quantitative and qualitative analysis. From this analysis, we establish shipping and credit limits, and determine whether we will seek to use one or more credit support protection devices, such as obtaining a parent guarantee, standby letter of credit, or credit insurance.

Credit losses may still be incurred due to bankruptcy, fraud, or other failure of the customer to pay.

Our sales to distributors are typically made under agreements allowing for price protection on unsold merchandise and a right of return on stipulated quantities of unsold merchandise. Under the price protection program, we give distributors credits for the difference between the original price paid and the current price that we offer. Our products typically have no contractual limit on the amount of price protection, nor is there a limit on the time horizon under which price protection is granted. The right of return granted generally consists of a stock rotation program in which distributors are able to exchange certain products based on the number of qualified purchases made by the distributor.

DISTRIBUTION

Distributors typically handle a wide variety of products, including those that compete with our products, and fill orders for many customers. Customers may place orders directly with us or through distributors. We have several distribution warehouses that are located in proximity to key customers.

SEASONAL TRENDS

Historically, our net revenue has typically been higher in the second half of the year than in the first half of the year, accelerating in the third quarter and peaking in the fourth quarter.

MARKETING

Our global marketing objectives are to build a strong, well-known, differentiated, and meaningful Intel corporate brand that drives preference with businesses and consumers, and to offer a limited number of meaningful and valuable brands in our portfolio to aid businesses and consumers in making informed choices about technology purchases. The Intel Core processor family and the Intel

®

Quark™, Intel Atom

®

, Intel

®

Celeron

®

, Intel

®

Pentium

®

, Intel

®

Xeon

®

, Intel

®

Xeon Phi™, and Intel

®

Itanium

®

trademarks make up our processor brands.

We promote brand awareness and preference, and generate demand through our own direct marketing, as well as through co-marketing programs. Our direct marketing activities primarily include advertising through digital and social media and television, as well as consumer and trade events, industry and consumer communications, and press relations. We market to consumer and business audiences, and focus on building awareness and generating demand for our performance leadership products. Our key messaging focuses on increased performance, improved energy efficiency, and other capabilities such as connectivity and communications.

OTHER KEY INFORMATION



Certain customers participate in cooperative advertising and marketing programs such as the Intel Inside program. These cooperative advertising and marketing programs broaden the reach of our brands beyond the scope of our own direct marketing. Certain customers are licensed to place Intel

®

logos on computing devices containing our microprocessors and processor technologies, and to use our brands in their marketing activities. The program partially reimburses customers for marketing activities for products featuring Intel

®

brands, subject to customers meeting defined criteria. These marketing activities primarily include advertising through digital and social media and television, as well as press relations. We have also entered into joint marketing arrangements with certain customers.

COMPETITION

The computing industry is continuously evolving. New and existing technology providers regularly introduce new and enhanced technologies and products. The marketplace can change quickly in response to such technologies and products, as well as to changes in customer and end-user requirements, expectations, and preferences. As technologies evolve and new market segments emerge, the boundaries between the market segments that we compete in may also change. We face significant competition in the development and market acceptance of our products in this environment.

In addition, in connection with our strategic transformation to a data-centric company, we have pursued a broader market opportunity by entering new areas and introducing adjacent products. We face new sources of competition in these market segments, including from incumbent competitors with well-established technologies and customer bases, more industry experience, significant financial resources, and greater brand recognition.

COMPETITORS

Our broad product portfolio offers end-to-end solutions to help our customers process, analyze, store, and transfer data, including platform products that range from high-performance platforms for cloud computing workloads to low-power platforms for edge computing devices. We face intense competition across each part of this portfolio from other companies that offer platform products, such as Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD); accelerator products such as GPUs, including NVIDIA Corporation (NVIDIA), as well as accelerator products such as ASICs, application-specific standard products, and FPGAs; memory and storage products; or connectivity products such as cellular modems. Some of these competitors have developed or utilize competing computing architectures for specific market segments or applications, such as low-power applications or emerging AI workloads. We also compete with internally developed semiconductors from OEMs, cloud service providers, and others, including customers. These companies may choose to vertically integrate their own proprietary semiconductor designs with their software assets, to offer greater product differentiation or increase product margins, or to customize such designs for their specific computing workloads. We may also face new sources of competition as a result of changes in industry participants through, for example, acquisitions or business collaborations, as well as new entrants, which could have a significant impact on our competitive position.

•

CCG.

We are a leading provider of platforms for notebooks, 2-in-1 systems, and desktops, including high-end enthusiast PCs. We face existing and emerging competition in these product areas. Tablets, phones, and other mobile devices offered by numerous vendors are significant competitors to traditional PCs for many usages, and considerable blurring of system form factors currently exists in the marketplace. We face strong competition from AMD as well as from vendors who use applications processors that are based on the ARM* architecture, feature low-power or long battery-life operation, and are built in SoC formats that integrate numerous functions on one chip. We are competing with a number of large companies in the development of 5G cellular modems.

•

DCG.

We are a leading provider of data center platforms, and face competition from incumbent competitors such as AMD, providers of accelerator products such as NVIDIA, and companies using ARM architecture, as well as from new entrants developing products customized for specific data center workloads and from internally developed solutions by cloud service providers and others. We see cloud computing, storage, and networking as areas of significant opportunity in our DCG business, as we seek to help our customers process, analyze, store, and transfer increasing amounts of data in connection with AI, autonomous driving, and other applications. We face strong competition in these areas

.

•

IOTG.

We have a long-standing position as a supplier of components and software for embedded products. This marketplace continues to expand significantly, with increasing types and numbers of smart and connected devices for retail, industrial, and consumer uses, including smart video. As this market segment evolves, we face numerous large and small incumbent processor competitors, as well as new entrants that use ARM architecture and other operating systems and software. In addition, the Internet of Things requires a broad range of connectivity solutions and we face competition from companies providing traditional wireless solutions such as cellular, WiFi, and Bluetooth

®

, as well as several new entrants who are taking advantage of new focused communications protocols.

•

NSG.

We compete against other providers of NAND flash memory products. We focus our efforts primarily on incorporating NAND flash memory into solution products, such as SSDs supporting enterprise and consumer applications. Our innovative Intel Optane technology offers a unique combination of performance, density, power, non-volatility, and cost advantages that redefines the memory storage hierarchy between conventional DRAM memory and NAND. We believe that our memory offerings, including our Intel Optane technology, complement our product offerings in our other segments.

OTHER KEY INFORMATION



•

PSG.

We are a leading provider of programmable semiconductors and related products, including FPGAs and SoC FPGAs. We face competition from other programmable logic companies, as well as companies that make other types of semiconductor products, such as ASICs, application-specific standard products, GPUs, digital signal processors, and CPUs. Targeted growth areas for our programmable solutions include communications, data center, industrial, and military applications. The FPGA life cycle is long relative to other Intel products—from the time that a design win is secured, it generally takes three or more years before a customer starts volume production and we receive the associated revenue from such design win.

COMPETITIVE FACTORS

Our products primarily compete based on performance, energy efficiency, integration, ease-of-use, innovative design, features, price, quality, reliability, security features, software ecosystem and developer support, time-to-market, brand recognition, customer support and customization, and availability. The importance of these factors varies by the type of end system for the products. For example, performance might be among the most important factors for our products for data center servers, while energy efficiency and price, as well as density and non-volatility, might be among the most important factors for our memory products.

Our key competitive advantages include:

•

Well-positioned for growth in a new era of data-centric computing.

The proliferation of data from the cloud, to the network, and out to the edge; the impending transition to 5G; and the growth of AI and analytics have driven a profound shift in computing, creating massive amounts of largely untapped data and a significant opportunity. We believe we are one of the few companies with a product portfolio that spans this new data-centric world. With products to help our customers process, analyze, store, and transfer large amounts of data, we have the opportunity to be the leading end-to-end platform provider for our customers.

•

Combination of our network of manufacturing and assembly and test facilities with our global architecture design teams

.

We have made significant capital and R&D investments in our integrated manufacturing network, which enables us to have more direct control over our design, development, and manufacturing processes; quality control; product cost; production timing; performance; power consumption; and manufacturing yield. We also have the scale and expertise necessary to enable deep engagement with our customers on their product needs. The increased cost of constructing new fabrication facilities to support smaller transistor geometries and larger wafers has led to a reduced number of companies that can build and equip leading-edge manufacturing facilities. Most of our competitors rely on third-party foundries, such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, Ltd. or Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd., and subcontractors for manufacturing and assembly and test needs.

We also face competitive challenges associated with the development and implementation of our next-generation process technology. We announced earlier in 2018 that volume production on our 10nm process technology was being delayed from the second half of 2018 into 2019. We have made progress on improving 10nm yields during 2018, and we expect 10nm-based volume client systems on retail shelves for the 2019 holiday season. However, the delays in our transition to next-generation process technology may allow competitors to take advantage of potential improvements in performance, energy efficiency, cost and/or other features that may be offered by new process technologies developed by third-party foundries. While we believe we derive significant competitive advantages from being an integrated device manufacturer as discussed above, we are also subject to the inherent risks of next-generation process development.

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS AND LICENSING

Intel owns and develops significant IP and related IP rights around the world that relate to our products, services, R&D, and other activities and assets. Our IP portfolio includes patents, copyrights, trade secrets, trademarks, trade dress rights, and maskwork rights. We actively seek to protect our global IP rights and to deter unauthorized use of our IP and other assets. Such efforts can be difficult, however, particularly in countries that provide less protection to IP rights and in the absence of harmonized international IP standards. For a discussion of the risks related to IP and our IP rights, please see “We are subject to IP risks and risks associated with litigation and regulatory proceedings” in “Risk Factors” within Other Key Information. While our IP rights are important to our success, our business as a whole is not significantly dependent on any single patent, copyright, or other IP right.

We have obtained patents in the U.S. and other countries. Because of the fast pace of innovation and product development, and the comparative pace of governments’ patenting processes, our products are often obsolete before the patents related to them expire; in some cases, our products may be obsolete before the patents related to them are granted. As we expand our product offerings into new industries, we also seek to extend our patent development efforts to patent such products. In addition to developing patents based on our own R&D efforts, we may purchase or license patents from third parties. Established competitors in existing and new industries, as well as companies that purchase and enforce patents and other IP, may already have patents covering similar products. There is no assurance that we will be able to obtain patents covering our own products, or that we will be able to obtain licenses from other companies on favorable terms or at all.

The software that we distribute, including software embedded in our component-level and platform products, is entitled to copyright and other IP protection. To distinguish our products from our competitors’ products, we have obtained trademarks and trade names for our products, and we maintain cooperative advertising programs with customers to promote our brands and to identify products containing genuine Intel components. We also protect details about our processes, products, and strategies as trade secrets, keeping confidential the information that we believe provides us with a competitive advantage.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES

The methods, assumptions, and estimates that we use in applying our accounting policies may require us to apply judgments regarding matters that are inherently uncertain. We consider an accounting policy to be a critical estimate if: (1) we must make assumptions that were uncertain when the judgment was made, and (2) changes in the estimate assumptions, or selection of a different estimate methodology could have a significant impact on our financial position and the results that we report in our consolidated financial statements. While we believe that our estimates, assumptions, and judgments are reasonable, they are based on information available when the estimate was made.

Refer to "

Note 2: Accounting Policies

" within the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on our critical accounting estimates and policies, which are as follows:

•

Inventories

-

the transition of manufacturing costs to inventory, excluding factory excess capacity costs. Inventory reflected at the lower of cost or net realizable value considering future demand and market conditions;

•

Property, plant and equipment

- the useful life determination and the related timing of when depreciation begins;

•

Long-lived assets

- the valuation methods and assumptions used in assessing the impairment of property, plant and equipment, identified intangibles, and goodwill, including the determination of asset groupings and the identification and allocation of goodwill to reporting units;

•

Non-marketable equity investments

- the valuation estimates and assessment of impairment and observable price adjustments;

•

Business combinations

- the assumptions used to allocate the purchase price paid for assets acquired and liabilities assumed in connection with our acquisitions;

•

Income taxes

-

the identification and measurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities, and estimates associated with Tax Reform; and

•

Loss contingencies

- the estimation of when a loss is probable and reasonably estimable.
