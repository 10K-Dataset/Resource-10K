FUNDAMENTALS OF OUR BUSINESS

Our Strategy



Research AND development (R&D) and Manufacturing

We are committed to investing in R&D. Realizing the benefits from Moore’s Law provides flexibility in balancing production costs and the increased functionality of our products. In addition, intellectual property

that we have developed for our platforms reduces our costs, creates synergies across our businesses, and provides a higher return as we expand into new markets

.

We design and manufacture silicon technology products. Unlike many other semiconductor companies, we primarily manufacture our products in our own manufacturing facilities. We see our in-house manufacturing as one of our most critical assets and advantages. This advantage is now expanding to our adjacent businesses, for example, FPGA, modem, and memory, which are enabling our transformation to a data-centric company.

Moore's Law — a law of economics

Moore’s Law is not a law of physics, but instead a law of economics predicted by Intel's co-founder Gordon Moore 50 years ago. It is the keystone of our manufacturing advancement. We measure Moore's Law primarily using a quantitative transistor density metric (transistors per square millimeter). In addition, we are optimizing process technology within each node to enable an annual cadence of product improvements.

Realizing Moore’s Law results in economic benefits as we are able to either reduce a chip's cost as we shrink its size, or increase functionality and performance of a chip while maintaining the same cost. At Intel, we continue to develop new generations of manufacturing process technology and realize the benefits from Moore’s Law. This makes possible the innovation of new products with higher functionality while balancing power efficiency, cost, and size to meet customers' needs. As of the end of 2017, our platform products were manufactured on 300mm wafers, with the majority manufactured using our 14nm process node.

Research and Development

We focus our R&D activities on developing new microarchitectures, advancing our manufacturing process technology, delivering the next generation of products, ensuring our products and technologies are secure, and developing new solutions in emerging technologies, for example, artificial intelligence, 5G wireless connectivity, and autonomous vehicles.

In conjunction with our R&D efforts, we plan to introduce new microarchitectures for our various products on a regular cadence. We have lengthened the amount of time we are using our 14nm process node, further optimizing our technology and meeting the yearly market cadence for product introductions with multiple waves of product offerings. While we have lengthened our utilization of 14nm, we are accelerating transistor density improvement with hyper-scaling technology, resulting in the same density and cost improvements over time as predicted by Moore's Law. We expect the same trends to continue as we introduce our next-generation 10nm process node.

FUNDAMENTALS OF OUR BUSINESS

Research and Development (R&D) and Manufacturing



We centrally manage key cross-business group product initiatives to align and prioritize our R&D activities. In addition, we may augment our R&D initiatives by investing in companies or entering into agreements with companies that have similar R&D focus areas, as well as directly purchasing or licensing applicable technology. To drive innovation and gain efficiencies, we intend to utilize our investments in intellectual property and R&D across our platforms and businesses.

manufacturing footprint

In 2017, the majority of our wafer manufacturing was conducted within the U.S. We incur factory start-up costs as we ramp our facilities for new process technologies. In 2017 we continued to ramp the 10nm process node in our Oregon and Israel locations, began 10nm production in Oregon, and

restarted construction on one of our Arizona wafer fabs, which is

targeted for leading-edge process technologies. We ramped our first memory fab, Fab 68, with investments representing approximately 20% of total capital spending in 2017.

The map below marks our manufacturing facilities and their primary manufacturing functions as of the end of 2017, as well as the countries where we have a significant R&D or sales and marketing presence.

supply chain and factory network

Our manufacturing facilities are primarily used for silicon wafer manufacturing of our platform and memory products. These facilities are built following a “copy exactly” methodology, whereby new process technologies are transferred identically from a central development fab to each manufacturing facility. This enables fast ramp of the operation as well as better quality control. These wafer fabs operate in a network of manufacturing facilities integrated as one factory to provide the most flexible supply capacity, allowing us to better analyze our production costs and manage capacity.

We use third-party foundries to manufacture wafers for certain components, including communications, connectivity, networking, FPGA, and memory products. We also leverage subcontractors to augment capacity to perform assembly and test in addition to our in-house manufacturing, primarily for chipsets and adjacent products.

We use a multi-source strategy for our memory business to enable a robust and flexible supply chain. The ramping of Fab 68 in 2017 enabled us to maintain a cost-effective strategy to better serve our customers. We expect this expansion to continue to provide significant manufacturing capacity. As of the end of 2017, over half of the 3D NAND we supplied was manufactured in Fab 68. In addition to the memory we manufacture internally, we have a supplemental supply agreement with Micron Technology, Inc. (Micron), as well as capacity from our joint venture, IM Flash Technologies, LLC (IMFT) factory in Lehi, Utah.

of these savings were realized by the end of 2017. We reallocated these savings to our growth segments, such as the data center and Internet of Things, and continue to invest in areas that extend our leadership in Moore's Law and expand market opportunities in areas such as memory and autonomous driving.

OTHER CHARGES

Other charges consist primarily of expenses associated with the divestiture of ISecG that was completed in Q2 2017.

Provision for Taxes

Substantially all

of the

increase

in our effective tax rate in


compared to


was driven by the one-time provisional impacts from the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (Tax Reform) that was enacted in December 2017, the 2017 ISecG divestiture, and a higher proportion of our income in higher tax rate jurisdictions. In addition to the one-time impacts from Tax Reform, we expect the new legislation will significantly lower our effective tax rate starting in 2018.

For further information on Tax Reform and its impacts, see "

Note 8: Income Taxes

" within the Consolidated Financial Statements.

The majority of the

increase

in our effective tax rate in


compared to


was driven by

one-time items and our 2015 decision to indefinitely reinvest some of our prior years' non-U.S. earnings, partially offset by a higher proportion of our income in lower tax jurisdictions.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

We consider the following when assessing our liquidity and capital resources:

Cash generated by operations is our primary source of liquidity. We maintain a diverse investment portfolio that we continually analyze based on issuer, industry, and country. When assessing our sources of liquidity, we include investments as shown in the preceding table.

Substantially all

of our investments in debt instruments and financing receivables are in investment-grade securities.

Other potential sources of liquidity include our commercial paper program and our automatic shelf registration statement on file with the SEC, pursuant to which we may offer an unspecified amount of debt, equity, and other securities. Under our commercial paper program, we have an ongoing authorization from our Board of Directors to borrow up to

$10.0 billion

. This amount includes an increase of

$5.0 billion

in the authorization limit approved by our Board of Directors in April 2017.

No

commercial paper remained outstanding as of

December 30, 2017

. During 2017, we issued a total of

$7.7 billion

aggregate principal amount of senior notes. Additionally, we redeemed our

$1.0 billion

,

4.90%

senior notes due

August 2045

. We used the net proceeds from the offerings of the notes to finance a portion of the redemption price of our

4.90%

senior notes due

August 2045

and for general corporate purposes. During 2017, we repaid

$500 million

of our

1.75%

senior notes that matured in

May 2017

, and

$3.0 billion

of our

1.35%

senior notes that matured in

December 2017

. In Q4 2017, we paid

$2.8 billion

in cash to convert our

$1.6 billion

2.95%

junior subordinated convertible debentures due 2035.

The enactment of Tax Reform in December 2017, imposes a tax on all previously untaxed earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries of U.S. corporations. Future distributions of non-U.S. assets to the U.S. will no longer be subject to U.S. taxation. As a result, we recognized a one-time provisional transition tax expense of

$6.1 billion

. We expect to pay the tax over a period of eight years based on a defined payment schedule and believe that our current U.S. sources of cash and liquidity are sufficient to meet our tax liability.

As of

December 30, 2017

,

$8.4 billion

of our

$14.0 billion

of cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, and trading assets was held by our non-U.S. subsidiaries.

During Q3 2017, we acquired

97.3%

of Mobileye's outstanding ordinary shares for

$14.5 billion

net cash. We funded the acquisition of shares, and expect to fund the acquisition of the remaining shares, with cash held by our non-U.S. subsidiaries.

MD&A - RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Consolidated Results and Analysis



During Q2 2017, we completed the divestiture of our ISecG business for total consideration of

$4.2 billion

. The consideration included cash proceeds of

$924 million

and

$2.2 billion

in the form of promissory notes. During Q3 2017, McAfee and TPG VII Manta Holdings, L.P., now known as Manta Holdings, L.P. (TPG) repaid the

$2.2 billion

of promissory notes and McAfee paid us a

$735 million

dividend.

We believe we have sufficient financial resources to meet our business requirements in the next 12 months, including capital expenditures for worldwide manufacturing and assembly and test; working capital requirements; and potential dividends, common stock repurchases, acquisitions, and strategic investments.

SOURCES AND USES OF CASH

(In Millions)

MD&A - RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Consolidated Results and Analysis



In summary, our cash flows for each period were as follows:

OPERATING ACTIVITIES

Cash

provided by

operating activities is net income adjusted for certain non-cash items and changes in assets and liabilities.

For


compared to


, the

$302 million

increase

in cash provided by operating activities was due to changes to working capital partially offset by adjustments for non-cash items and lower net income. Tax Reform did not have an impact on our 2017 cash provided by operating activities. The increase in cash provided by operating activities was driven by increased income before taxes and

$1.0 billion

receipts of customer deposits. These increases were partially offset by increased inventory and accounts receivable. Income taxes paid, net of refunds, in


compared to


were

$2.9 billion

higher

due to higher income before taxes, taxable gains on sales of ASML, and taxes on the ISecG divestiture. We expect approximately $2.0 billion of additional customer deposits in 2018.

For


compared to


, the

$2.8 billion

increase

in cash provided by operating activities was due to adjustments for non-cash items and changes in working capital, partially offset by lower net income. The adjustments for non-cash items were higher in 2016 primarily due to restructuring and other charges and the change in deferred taxes, partially offset by lower depreciation.

INVESTING ACTIVITIES

Investing cash flows consist primarily of capital expenditures; investment purchases, sales, maturities, and disposals; and proceeds from divestitures and cash used for acquisitions. Our capital expenditures were

$11.8 billion

in


(

$9.6 billion

in


and

$7.3 billion

in


).

The

decrease

in cash used for investing activities in


compared to


was primarily due to higher net activity of available-for sale-investments in 2017, proceeds from our divestiture of ISecG in 2017, and higher maturities and sales of trading assets in 2017. This activity was partially offset by higher capital expenditures in 2017.

The

increase

in cash used for investing activities in


compared to


was primarily due to our completed acquisition of Altera, net purchases of trading assets in 2016 compared to net sales of trading assets in 2015, and higher capital expenditures in 2016. This increase was partially offset by lower investments in non-marketable equity investments.

FINANCING ACTIVITIES

Financing cash flows consist primarily of repurchases of common stock, payment of dividends to stockholders, issuance and repayment of short-term and long-term debt, and proceeds from the sale of shares of common stock through employee equity incentive plans.

The

increase

in cash used for financing activities in


compared to


was primarily due to net long-term debt activity, which was a use of cash in 2017 compared to a source of cash in 2016. During


, we repurchased

$3.6 billion

of common stock under our authorized common stock repurchase program, compared to

$2.6 billion

in


. As of

December 30, 2017

,

$13.2 billion

remained available for repurchasing common stock under the existing repurchase authorization limit. We base our level of common stock repurchases on internal cash management decisions, and this level may fluctuate. Proceeds from the sale of common stock through employee equity incentive plans totaled

$770 million

in


compared to

$1.1 billion

in


. Our total dividend payments were

$5.1 billion

in


compared to

$4.9 billion

in


. We have paid a cash dividend in each of the past


quarters. In January


, our Board of Directors approved an increase to our cash dividend to

$1.20

per share on an annual basis. The board has declared a quarterly cash dividend of

$0.30

per share of common stock for Q1


. The dividend is payable on March 1,


to stockholders of record on February 7,


.

Cash was used for financing activities in


compared to cash provided by financing activities in


, primarily due to fewer debt issuances and the repayment of debt in 2016. This activity was partially offset by repayment of commercial paper in 2015 and fewer common stock repurchases in 2016.

MD&A - RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Consolidated Results and Analysis



Contractual Obligations

Significant contractual obligations as of

December 30, 2017

were as follows:


Capital purchase obligations represent commitments for the construction or purchase of property, plant and equipment. They were not recorded as liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets as of

December 30, 2017

, as we had not yet received the related goods nor taken title to the property.


Other purchase obligations and commitments include payments due under various types of licenses and agreements to purchase goods or services, as well as payments due under non-contingent funding obligations.


Tax obligations represent the future cash payments related to

Tax Reform

enacted in 2017 for the one-time provisional transition tax on our previously untaxed foreign earnings. For further information, see "

Note 8: Income Taxes

" within the Consolidated Financial Statements.


Amounts represent principal and interest cash payments over the life of the debt obligations, including anticipated interest payments that are not recorded on our consolidated balance sheets. Debt obligations are

classified based on their stated maturity date, regardless of their classification on the consolidated balance sheet

s. Any future settlement of convertible debt would impact our cash payments.


Amounts represent future cash payments to satisfy other long-term liabilities recorded on our consolidated balance sheets, including the short-term portion of these long-term liabilities. Derivative instruments are excluded from the preceding table, as they do not represent the amounts that may ultimately be paid.


Total excludes contractual obligations already recorded on our consolidated balance sheets as current liabilities, except for the short-term portions of long-term debt obligations and other long-term liabilities.

The expected timing of payments of the obligations in the preceding table is estimated based on current information. Timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different, depending on the time of receipt of goods or services, or changes to agreed-upon amounts for some obligations.

Contractual obligations for purchases of goods or services included in "Other purchase obligations and commitments" in the preceding table include agreements that are enforceable and legally binding on Intel and that specify all significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum, or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. For obligations with cancellation provisions, the amounts included in the preceding table were limited to the non-cancelable portion of the agreement terms or the minimum cancellation fee.

For the purchase of raw materials, we have entered into certain agreements that specify minimum prices and quantities based on a percentage of the total available market or based on a percentage of our future purchasing requirements. Due to the uncertainty of the future market and our future purchasing requirements, as well as the non-binding nature of these agreements, obligations under these agreements have been excluded from the preceding table. Our purchase orders for other products are based on our current manufacturing needs and are fulfilled by our vendors within short time horizons. In addition, some of our purchase orders represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements.

Contractual obligations that are contingent upon the achievement of certain milestones have been excluded from the preceding table.

Most

of our milestone-based contracts are tooling related for the purchase of capital equipment. These arrangements are not considered contractual obligations until the milestone is met by the counterparty.

As of

December 30, 2017

, assuming that all future milestones are met, the additional required payments would be approximately

$2.0 billion

.

For the majority of restricted stock units (RSUs) granted, the number of shares of common stock issued on the date the RSUs vest is net of the minimum statutory withholding requirements that we pay in cash to the appropriate taxing authorities on behalf of our employees. The obligation to pay the relevant taxing authority is excluded from the preceding table, as the amount is contingent upon continued employment. In addition, the amount of the obligation is unknown, as it is based in part on the market price of our common stock when the awards vest.

MD&A - RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Consolidated Results and Analysis



During 2014, we entered into a series of agreements with Tsinghua Unigroup Ltd. (Tsinghua Unigroup), an operating subsidiary of Tsinghua Holdings Co. Ltd., to, among other things, jointly develop Intel architecture and communications-based solutions for phones. Subject to regulatory approvals and other closing conditions, we have agreed to invest up to

$9.0 billion

Chinese yuan (approximately

$1.5 billion

as of the date of the agreement) for a minority stake of approximately

20%

of Beijing UniSpreadtrum Technology Ltd. (UniSpreadtrum). During 2015, we invested

$966 million

to complete the first phase of the equity investment and the second phase of the investment will require additional funding of approximately

$500 million

; however, as our obligation is contingent upon regulatory approvals and other closing conditions, it has been excluded from the preceding table.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

We are affected by changes in currency exchange and interest rates, as well as equity and commodity prices. Our risk management programs reduce, but may not entirely eliminate, the impacts of these risks. All of the following potential changes are based on sensitivity analyses performed on our financial positions as of

December 30, 2017

and

December 31, 2016

. Actual results may differ materially.

CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES

We are exposed to currency exchange risks of non-U.S.-dollar-denominated investments in debt instruments and loans receivable, and may economically hedge this risk with foreign currency contracts, such as currency forward contracts or currency interest rate swaps. Gains or losses on these non-U.S.-currency investments are generally offset by corresponding losses or gains on the related hedging instruments. We are exposed to currency exchange risks from our non-U.S.-dollar-denominated debt indebtedness and may use foreign currency contracts designated as cash flow hedges to manage this risk.

Substantially all

of our revenue is transacted in U.S. dollars. However, a

significant

portion of our operating expenditures and capital purchases are incurred in other currencies,

primarily the euro, the Japanese yen, the Israeli shekel, and the Chinese yuan

. We have established currency risk management programs to protect against currency exchange rate risks associated with non-U.S. dollar forecasted future cash flows and existing non-U.S. dollar monetary assets and liabilities. We may also hedge currency risk arising from funding of foreign currency-denominated future investments. We may utilize foreign currency contracts, such as currency forwards or option contracts in these hedging programs. We considered the historical trends in currency exchange rates and determined that it was reasonably possible that a weighted average adverse change of

20%

in currency exchange rates could be experienced in the near term. Such an adverse change, after taking into account balance sheet hedges only and offsetting recorded monetary asset and liability positions, would have resulted in an adverse impact on income before taxes of less than

$95 million

as of

December 30, 2017

(less than

$80 million

as of

December 31, 2016

).

INTEREST RATES

We are exposed to interest rate risk related to our fixed-rate investment portfolio and outstanding debt. The primary objective of our investment policy is to preserve principal and the financial flexibility to fund our business while maximizing yields, which generally track the U.S. dollar three-month LIBOR. We generally enter into interest rate contracts to convert the returns on our fixed-rate debt investment with remaining maturities longer than six months into U.S. dollar three-month LIBOR-based returns. We may enter into swaps to convert fixed-rate coupon payments into floating-rate coupon payments for our existing indebtedness. Gains or losses on these instruments are generally offset by corresponding losses or gains on the related hedging instruments.

A hypothetical decrease in benchmark interest rates of up to

1.0%

, after taking into account investment hedges, would have resulted in an increase in the fair value of our investment portfolio of approximately

$100 million

as of

December 30, 2017

(an increase of approximately

$100 million

as of

December 31, 2016

). After taking into account interest rate and currency swaps, a hypothetical decrease in interest rates of up to

1.0%

would have resulted in an increase in the fair value of our indebtedness of approximately

$1.6 billion

as of

December 30, 2017

(an increase of approximately

$1.3 billion

as of

December 31, 2016

). The fluctuations in fair value of our investment portfolio and indebtedness reflect only the direct impact of the change in interest rates. Other economic variables, such as equity market fluctuations and changes in relative credit risk, could result in a significantly higher fluctuation in the fair value of our net investment position.

EQUITY PRICES

Our investments include marketable equity securities and equity derivative instruments. We typically do not attempt to reduce or eliminate our equity market exposure through hedging activities at the inception of our investments. In the event we do decide to enter into hedge arrangements, before doing so we evaluate legal, market, and economic factors, as well as the expected timing of disposal, to determine whether hedging is appropriate. Our equity market risk management program may include equity derivatives with or without hedge accounting designation that utilize warrants, equity options, or other equity derivatives.

We also utilize total return swaps to offset changes in liabilities related to the equity market risks of certain deferred compensation arrangements. Gains or losses from changes in fair value of these total return swaps are generally offset by the losses or gains on the related liabilities.

MD&A - RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Consolidated Results and Analysis



As of

December 30, 2017

, the fair value of our marketable equity investments and our equity derivative instruments, including hedging positions, was

$4.2 billion

(

$6.2 billion

as of

December 31, 2016

).

A substantial majority

of our marketable equity investments portfolio as of

December 30, 2017

was concentrated in our investment in ASML of

$3.6 billion

(

$6.1 billion

as of

December 31, 2016

). Our marketable equity method investments are excluded from our analysis, as the carrying value does not fluctuate based on market price changes unless an impairment is deemed necessary. To determine reasonably possible decreases in the market value of our marketable equity investments, we have analyzed the historical market price sensitivity of our marketable equity investment portfolio. Assuming a decline of

25%

in market prices, and after reflecting the impact of hedges and offsetting positions, the aggregate value of our marketable equity investments could decrease by approximately

$1.1 billion

, based on the value as of

December 30, 2017

(a decrease in value of approximately

$1.9 billion

, based on the value as of

December 31, 2016

using an assumed decline of

30%

). Beginning in 2018, as explained in "

Note 3: Recent Accounting Standards

" within the Consolidated Financial Statements, changes in the fair value of our marketable equity securities will be measured and recorded at fair value with changes in fair value recorded through the income statement.

Many of the same factors that could result in an adverse movement of equity market prices affect our non-marketable equity investments, although we cannot always quantify the impacts directly. Financial markets are volatile, which could negatively affect the prospects of the companies we invest in, their ability to raise additional capital, and the likelihood of our ability to realize value in our investments through liquidity events such as initial public offerings, mergers, and private sales. These types of investments involve a great deal of risk, and there can be no assurance that any specific company will grow or become successful; consequently, we could lose all or part of our investment. Our non-marketable cost method equity investments had a carrying amount of

$2.6 billion

as of

December 30, 2017

(

$3.1 billion

as of

December 31, 2016

) and included our investment in UniSpreadtrum of

$658 million

(

$966 million

for UniSpreadtrum as of

December 31, 2016

). The carrying amount of our non-marketable equity method investments was

$1.9 billion

as of

December 30, 2017

(

$1.3 billion

as of

December 31, 2016

).

A substantial majority

of our non-marketable equity method investments balance as of

December 30, 2017

was concentrated in our IMFT investment of

$1.5 billion

(

$849 million

for IMFT as of

December 31, 2016

).

COMMODITY PRICE RISK

Although we operate facilities that consume commodities, we are not directly affected by commodity price risk to a material degree. We have established forecasted transaction risk management programs to protect against fluctuations in commodity prices. We may use commodity derivatives contracts, such as commodity swaps, in these hedging programs. In addition, we have sourcing plans in place that mitigate the risk of a potential supplier concentration for our key commodities.

SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA


In Q4 2017, we recognized a

higher income tax expense as a result of one-time impacts from Tax Reform.

OTHER KEY INFORMATION



Sales and Marketing

CUSTOMERS

We sell our products primarily to original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) and original design manufacturers (ODMs). ODMs provide design and manufacturing services to branded and unbranded private-label resellers. In addition, our customers include other manufacturers and service providers, such as industrial and communication equipment manufacturers and cloud service providers, who buy our products through distributor, reseller, retail, and OEM channels throughout the world. For more information about our customers, including customers who accounted for greater than 10% of our net consolidated revenue, see "

Note 4: Operating Segments

" within the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Our worldwide reseller sales channel consists of thousands of indirect customers—systems builders that purchase Intel

®

processors and other products from our distributors. We have incentive programs that allow distributors to sell our microprocessors and other products in small quantities to customers of systems builders. Our microprocessors and other products are also available in direct retail outlets.

SALES ARRANGEMENTS

Our products are sold through sales offices throughout the world. Sales of our products are frequently made via purchase order acknowledgments that contain standard terms and conditions covering matters such as pricing, payment terms, and warranties, as well as indemnities for issues specific to our products, such as patent and copyright indemnities. From time to time, we may enter into additional agreements with customers covering, for example, changes from our standard terms and conditions, new product development and marketing, and private-label branding. Our sales are routinely made using electronic and web-based processes that allow the customer to review inventory availability and track the progress of specific goods ordered. Pricing on particular products may vary based on volumes ordered and other factors. We also offer discounts, rebates, and other incentives to customers to increase acceptance of our products and technology.

Our products are generally shipped under terms that transfer title to the customer, even in arrangements for which the recognition of revenue and related cost of sales is deferred. Our standard terms and conditions of sale typically provide that payment is due at a later date, 30 days after shipment or delivery.

We assess credit risk through quantitative and qualitative analysis. From this analysis, we establish shipping and credit limits, and determine whether we will seek to use one or more credit support protection devices, such as obtaining a parent guarantee, standby letter of credit, or credit insurance.

Credit losses may still be incurred due to bankruptcy, fraud, or other failure of the customer to pay.

Our sales to distributors are typically made under agreements allowing for price protection on unsold merchandise and a right of return on stipulated quantities of unsold merchandise. Under the price protection program, we give distributors credits for the difference between the original price paid and the current price that we offer. Our products typically have no contractual limit on the amount of price protection, nor is there a limit on the time horizon under which price protection is granted. The right of return granted generally consists of a stock rotation program in which distributors are able to exchange certain products based on the number of qualified purchases made by the distributor.

DISTRIBUTION

Distributors typically handle a wide variety of products, including those that compete with our products, and fill orders for many customers. Customers may place orders directly with us or through distributors. We have several distribution warehouses that are located in proximity to key customers.

BACKLOG

Our customers generally operate with lean-inventory or just-in-time operations rather than maintaining larger inventories of our products. As our customers continue to lower their inventories, our processes to fulfill their orders have evolved to meet their needs. As a result, our manufacturing production is based on estimates and advance non-binding commitments from customers as to future purchases. Our order backlog as of any particular date is a mix of these commitments and specific firm orders that are primarily made pursuant to standard purchase orders for delivery of products. Only a small portion of our orders are non-cancelable, and the dollar amount associated with the non-cancelable portion is not significant.

SEASONAL TRENDS

Historically, our net revenue has typically been higher in the second half of the year than in the first half of the year, accelerating in the third quarter and peaking in the fourth quarter.

OTHER KEY INFORMATION



MARKETING

Our global marketing objectives are to build a strong, well-known, differentiated, and meaningful Intel corporate brand that drives preference with businesses and consumers, and to offer a limited number of meaningful and valuable brands in our portfolio to aid businesses and consumers in making informed choices about technology purchases. The Intel Core processor family and the Intel

®

Quark™, Intel Atom®, Intel

®

Celeron

®

, Intel

®

Pentium

®

, Intel

®

Xeon

®

, Intel

®

Xeon Phi™, and Intel

®

Itanium

®

trademarks make up our processor brands.

We promote brand awareness and preference, and generate demand through our own direct marketing, as well as through co-marketing programs. Our direct marketing activities primarily include advertising through digital and social media and television, as well as consumer and trade events, industry and consumer communications, and press relations. We market to consumer and business audiences, and focus on building awareness and generating demand for new form factors such as all-in-one devices and 2 in 1 systems powered by Intel technologies. Our key messaging focuses on increased performance, improved energy efficiency, and other capabilities such as connectivity and communications.

Purchases by customers often allow them to participate in cooperative advertising and marketing programs such as the Intel Inside program. This program broadens the reach of our brands beyond the scope of our own direct marketing. Through the Intel Inside program, certain customers are licensed to place Intel

®

logos on computing devices containing our microprocessors and processor technologies, and to use our brands in their marketing activities. The program includes a market development component that accrues funds based on purchases and partially reimburses customers for marketing activities for products featuring Intel

®

brands, subject to customers meeting defined criteria. These marketing activities primarily include advertising through digital and social media and television, as well as press relations. We have also entered into joint marketing arrangements with certain customers.

Competition

The computing industry continuously evolves with new and enhanced technologies and products from existing and new providers. The marketplace can change quickly in response to the introduction of such technologies and products and other factors such as changes in customer and end-user requirements, expectations, and preferences. As technologies evolve and new market segments emerge, the boundaries between the market segments that we compete in are also subject to change.

Intel faces significant competition in the development and market acceptance of our products in this environment. Our platforms, based on Intel architecture, are positioned to compete across the compute continuum, from low-power devices to the most powerful data center servers. These platforms have integrated hardware and software and offer our customers benefits such as ease of use, savings in total cost of ownership, and the ability to scale systems to accommodate increased usage.

COMPETITORS

We compete against other companies that make and sell platforms, other silicon components, and software to businesses that build and sell computing and communications systems to end users. Our competitors also include companies that sell goods and services to businesses that use them for their internal and/or customer-facing processes (e.g., businesses running large data centers). In addition, we face competition from OEMs, ODMs, and other industrial and communications equipment manufacturers that, to some degree, choose to vertically integrate their own proprietary semiconductor and software assets. By doing so, these competitors may be attempting to offer greater differentiation in their products and to increase their share of the profits for each finished product they sell. Continuing changes in industry participants through, for example, acquisitions or business collaborations could also have a significant impact on our competitive position.

In the PC market segment, we are a leading provider of platforms for notebooks, 2 in 1 systems, and desktops (including all-in-ones and high-end enthusiast PCs). We face existing and emerging competition in these product areas. Tablets, phones, and other mobile devices offered by numerous vendors are significant competitors to traditional PCs for many usages, and considerable blurring of system form factors currently exists in the marketplace. We face strong competition from vendors who use applications processors that are based on the ARM* architecture, feature low-power or long battery-life operation, and are built in SoC formats that integrate numerous functions on one chip.

In the data center market segment, we are a leading provider of data center platforms, and face competition from companies using ARM architecture or other technologies. Internet cloud computing, storage, and networking are areas of significant targeted growth for us in the data center segment, including as a result of increasing amounts of data created by artificial intelligence, autonomous driving, and other applications.  We face strong competition in these market segments.

In the Internet of Things market segment, we have a long-standing position as a supplier of components and software for embedded products. This marketplace continues to expand significantly with increasing types and numbers of smart and connected devices for retail, automotive, industrial, and consumer uses, including smart video. As this market segment evolves, we face numerous large and small incumbent processor competitors, as well as new entrants that use ARM architecture and other operating systems and software. In addition, the Internet of Things requires a broad range of connectivity solutions and we face competition from companies providing traditional wireless solutions such as cellular, WiFi, and Bluetooth*, as well as several new entrants who are taking advantage of new focused communications protocols.

OTHER KEY INFORMATION



In the memory market segment, we compete against other providers of NAND flash memory products. We focus our efforts primarily on incorporating NAND flash memory into solution products, such as SSDs supporting enterprise and consumer applications. We believe that our memory offerings, including innovative developments such as Intel Optane technology, complement our product offerings in our other segments.

In the programmable solutions market segment, we are a leading provider of programmable semiconductors and related products, including FPGAs and SoC FPGAs. We face competition from other programmable logic companies, as well as companies that make other types of semiconductor products, such as application-specific integrated circuits, application-specific standard products, graphics processing units, digital signal processors, and CPUs. Targeted growth areas for our programmable solutions include communications, data center, and automotive applications. The FPGA life cycle is long relative to other Intel products—from the time that a design win is secured, it generally takes three or more years before a customer starts volume production and we receive the associated revenue from such design win.

Our products primarily compete based on performance, energy efficiency, integration, innovative design, features, price, quality, reliability, brand recognition, technical support, and availability. The importance of these factors varies by the type of end system for the products. For example, performance might be among the most important factors for our products for data center servers, while energy efficiency and price, as well as density and non-volatility, might be among the most important factors for our memory products.

COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGES

Our key competitive advantages include:

•

Well-positioned for growth in smart, connected world.

We offer solutions across every segment of the smart, connected world—from the cloud, to the network, to devices—and believe that we are well-positioned for growth through our strategy of the Virtuous Cycle of Growth. The expansion and proliferation of the cloud and data center, Internet of Things, memory, and FPGAs—all of which are connected—help grow our business. As more devices connect to the cloud, we have increased opportunities for growth.  We are uniquely positioned to meet customer needs with platform solutions that leverage our breadth of products. Our range of silicon products and associated software gives us an end-to-end capability supported by our manufacturing expertise and intellectual property.

•

Transitions to next-generation technologies.

We have a market lead in transitioning to the next-generation process technology and bringing products to market using such technology. In Q4 2017, we began to ship products utilizing our 10nm process technology and we are continuing to work on the development of our next-generation 7nm process technology. We believe that these advancements will offer significant improvements in one or more of the following areas: performance, new features, energy efficiency, and cost.

•

Combination of our network of manufacturing and assembly and test facilities with our global architecture design teams.

We have made significant capital and R&D investments into our integrated manufacturing network, which enables us to have more direct control over our design, development, and manufacturing processes; quality control; product cost; production timing; performance; power consumption; and manufacturing yield. The increased cost of constructing new fabrication facilities to support smaller transistor geometries and larger wafers has led to a reduced number of companies that can build and equip leading-edge manufacturing facilities. Most of our competitors rely on third-party foundries and subcontractors for manufacturing and assembly and test needs. We provide foundry services as an alternative to such foundries.

Intellectual Property Rights and Licensing

Intel owns and develops significant intellectual property (IP) and related IP rights around the world that relate to our products, services, R&D, and other activities and assets. Our IP portfolio includes patents, copyrights, trade secrets, trademarks, trade dress rights, and maskwork rights. We actively seek to protect our global IP rights and to deter unauthorized use of our IP and other assets. Such efforts can be difficult, however, particularly in countries that provide less protection to IP rights and in the absence of harmonized international IP standards. While our IP rights are important to our success, our business as a whole is not significantly dependent on any single patent, copyright, or other IP right.

We have obtained patents in the U.S. and other countries. Because of the fast pace of innovation and product development, and the comparative pace of governments’ patenting processes, our products are often obsolete before the patents related to them expire; in some cases, our products may be obsolete before the patents related to them are granted. As we expand our products into new industries, we also seek to extend our patent development efforts to patent such products. In addition to developing patents based on our own R&D efforts, we may purchase or license patents from third parties. Established competitors in existing and new industries, as well as companies that purchase and enforce patents and other IP, may already have patents covering similar products. There is no assurance that we will be able to obtain patents covering our own products, or that we will be able to obtain licenses from other companies on favorable terms or at all.

The software that we distribute, including software embedded in our component-level and platform products, is entitled to copyright and other IP protection. To distinguish our products from our competitors’ products, we have obtained trademarks and trade names for our products, and we maintain cooperative advertising programs with customers to promote our brands and to identify products containing genuine Intel components. We also protect details about our processes, products, and strategies as trade secrets, keeping confidential the information that we believe provides us with a competitive advantage.

Critical Accounting Estimates

The methods, assumptions, and estimates that we use in applying our accounting policies may require us to apply judgments regarding matters that are inherently uncertain. We consider an accounting policy to be a critical estimate if: (1) we must make assumptions that were uncertain when the judgment was made, and (2) changes in the estimate assumptions, or selection of a different estimate methodology could have a significant impact on our financial position and the results that we report in our consolidated financial statements. While we believe that our estimates, assumptions, and judgments are reasonable, they are based on information available when the estimate was made.

Refer to "

Note 2: Accounting Policies

" within the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on our critical accounting estimates and policies, which are as follows:

•

Inventories

-

the transition of manufacturing costs to inventory excluding factory excess capacity costs. Inventoried product reflected at the lower of cost or net realizable value considering future demand and market conditions;

•

Property, plant and equipment

- the useful life determination and the related timing of when depreciation begins;

•

Long-lived assets

- the valuation methods and assumptions used in assessing the impairment of property, plant and equipment, identified intangibles, and goodwill, including the determination of asset groupings and the identification and allocation of goodwill to reporting units;

•

Non-marketable equity investments

- the valuation estimates and assessment of other-than-temporary impairment;

•

Business combinations

- the assumptions used to allocate the purchase price paid for assets acquired and liabilities assumed in connection with our acquisitions;

•

Income taxes

-

the identification and measurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities and the provisional estimates associated with Tax Reform; and

•

Loss contingencies

- the estimation of when a loss is probable and reasonably estimable.
