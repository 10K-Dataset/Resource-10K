ITEM 1. Business.

For convenience, the terms “Discovery,” “DCI,” the “Company,” “we,” “us” or “our” are used in this Annual Report on Form 10-K to refer to both Discovery Communications, Inc. and collectively to Discovery Communications, Inc. and one or more of its consolidated subsidiaries, unless the context otherwise requires.

OVERVIEW

We are a global media company that provides content across multiple distribution platforms, including digital distribution arrangements, throughout the world.  We were formed on September 17, 2008 as a Delaware corporation in connection with Discovery Holding Company (“DHC”) and Advance/Newhouse Programming Partnership (“Advance/Newhouse”) combining their respective ownership interests in Discovery Communications Holding, LLC (“DCH”) and exchanging those interests with and into Discovery (the “Discovery Formation”). As a result of the Discovery Formation, DHC and DCH became wholly-owned subsidiaries of Discovery, with Discovery becoming the successor reporting entity to DHC.

As one of the world’s largest nonfiction media companies, we provide original and purchased content to more than1.9 billioncumulative subscribers worldwide through networks that we wholly or partially own. We distribute customized content in the U.S. and over200other countries and territories in over40languages. Our global portfolio of networks includes prominent television brands such as Discovery Channel, one of the first nonfiction networks and our most widely distributed global brand, TLC and Animal Planet. We also have a diversified portfolio of websites and develop and sell curriculum-based education products and services.

Our objectives are to invest in content for our networks to build viewership, optimize distribution revenue, capture advertising sales, and create or reposition additional branded channels and businesses that can sustain long-term growth and occupy a desired content niche with strong consumer appeal. Our strategy is to maximize the distribution, ratings and profit potential of each of our branded networks. In addition to growing distribution and advertising revenue for our branded networks, we are extending content distribution across new platforms, including brand-aligned websites, on-line streaming, mobile devices, video on demand (“VOD”) and broadband channels, which provide promotional platforms for our television content and serve as additional outlets for advertising and distribution revenue. Audience ratings are a key driver in generating advertising revenue and creating demand on the part of cable television operators, direct-to-home (“DTH”) satellite operators, and other content distributors who deliver our content to their customers.

Our content spans genres including science, exploration, survival, natural history, technology, docu-series, anthropology, paleontology, history, space, archeology, health and wellness, engineering, adventure, lifestyles, forensics, civilizations, current events and kids. We have an extensive library of content and own all or most rights to the majority of our content and footage, which enables us to exploit our library to launch brands and services into new markets quickly. Our content can be re-edited and updated in a cost-effective manner to provide topical versions of subject matter that can be utilized around the world. Substantially all of our content is produced in high definition (“HD”) format.

We classify our operations in three segments: U.S. Networks, consisting principally of domestic television networks, websites and digital distribution arrangements; International Networks, consisting primarily of international television networks and websites; and Education, consisting principally of curriculum-based product and service offerings. Financial information for our segments and geographical areas in which we do business is set forth in Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and Note 21 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Subscriber statistics set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10-K include both wholly-owned networks and networks operated by equity method investees. Domestic subscriber statistics are based on Nielsen Media Research. International subscriber statistics are derived from internal data coupled with external sources when available. As used herein, a “subscriber” is a single household that receives the applicable network from its cable television operator, DTH satellite operator, or other television provider, including those who receive our networks from pay-television providers without charge pursuant to various pricing plans that include free periods and/or free carriage. The term “cumulative subscribers” refers to the collective sum of the total number of subscribers to each of our networks or content services. By way of example, two households that each receive five of our networks from their television provider represent two subscribers, but 10 cumulative subscribers.

INTERNATIONAL NETWORKS

International Networks generated revenues of$1,637 millionduring2012, which represented37%of our total consolidated revenues. Our International Networks segment principally consists of national and pan-regional television networks. This segment generates revenue from operations in virtually every pay-television market in the world through an infrastructure that includes operational centers in London, Singapore and Miami. Discovery Channel, Animal Planet and TLC lead the International Networks’ portfolio of television networks. International Networks has one of the largest international distribution platforms of networks with as many asfourteennetworks in more than200countries and territories around the world. AtDecember 31, 2012, International Networks operated over180unique distribution feeds in over40languages with channel feeds customized according to language needs and advertising sales opportunities. International Networks also has free-to-air networks in the U.K., Germany, Italy and Spain and continues to pursue international expansion.

Our International Networks segment owns and operates the following television networks which reached the following number of subscribers as ofDecember 31, 2012:

On December 21, 2012, our International Networks segment acquired20%equity ownership interests in Eurosport, a European sports satellite and cable network, and a portfolio of pay television networks from TF1, a French media company, for$264 million, including transaction costs. We have a call right that enables us to purchase a controlling interest in Eurosport starting December 2014 and for one year thereafter. If we exercise our call right, TF1 will have the right to put its remaining interest to us for one year thereafter. The arrangement is intended to increase the growth of Eurosport, which focuses on niche but regionally popular sports such as tennis, skiing, cycling and skating, and enhance our pay television offerings in France. On December 28, 2012, we acquired Switchover Media, a group of five Italian  television channels with children's and entertainment programming. (See Note 3 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.)

EDUCATION

Education generated revenues of $105 millionduring2012, which represented2%of our total consolidated revenues. Education is comprised of curriculum-based product and service offerings. This segment generates revenues primarily from subscriptions charged to K-12 schools for access to an online suite of curriculum-based VOD tools, professional development services, digital textbooks and, to a lesser extent, student assessments and publication of hardcopy curriculum-based content. Our education business also participates in global brand and content licensing and engages in partnerships with leading non-profits, corporations, foundations and trade associations.

CONTENT DEVELOPMENT

Our content development strategy is designed to increase viewership, maintain innovation and quality leadership, and provide value for our network distributors and advertising customers. Our content is sourced from a wide range of third-party producers, which include some of the world’s leading nonfiction production companies as well as independent producers. Our production arrangements fall into three categories: produced, coproduced and licensed. Substantially all produced content includes content that we engage third parties to develop and produce, while we retain editorial control and own most or all of the rights, in exchange for paying all development and production costs. Coproduced content refers to program rights that we have collaborated with third parties to finance and develop because at times world-wide rights are not available for acquisition or we save costs by collaborating with third parties. Licensed content is comprised of films or series that have been previously produced by third parties.










International Networks maximizes the use of content from our U.S. Networks. Much of our content tends to be culturally neutral and maintains its relevance for an extended period of time. As a result, a significant amount of our content translates well across international borders and is made even more accessible through extensive use of dubbing and subtitles in local languages. Our content can be re-edited and updated in a cost-effective manner to provide topical versions of subject matter that can be utilized around the world. We also develop local content that is tailored to individual market preferences, which is typically produced through third-party production companies. International Networks executes a localization strategy by offering content from U.S. Networks, customized content and localized schedules via our distribution feeds. While our International Networks segment maximizes the use of content from U.S. Networks, we also develop local content that is tailored to individual market preferences.

Our largest single cost is content expense, which includes content amortization, content impairments and production costs. We amortize the cost of capitalized content rights based on the proportion that the current year's estimated revenues bear to the estimated remaining total lifetime revenues, which normally results in an accelerated amortization method over the estimated useful lives. Certain networks utilize a straight-line method of amortization over the estimated useful lives of the content.

REVENUES

We generate revenues principally from: (i) fees charged to operators who distribute our network content, which primarily include cable, DTH satellite and digital service providers, (ii) advertising sold on our networks and websites, and (iii) other transactions, including curriculum-based products and services, affiliate and advertising sales representation services, content licenses and the licensing of our brands for consumer products. During2012, distribution, advertising, and other revenues were49%,46%and5%, respectively, of consolidated revenue. No individual customer represented more than 10% of our total consolidated revenues for2012,2011or2010.

Distribution

Distribution revenue includes fees charged for the right to view Discovery network branded content made available to customers through a variety of distribution platforms and viewing devices. The largest component of distribution revenue is comprised of fees charged to cable, DTH satellite and telecommunication service providers for distribution rights to our television networks. We have contracts with distributors representing most cable and satellite service providers around the world, including the largest operators in the U.S. and major international distributors. Typically, our television networks are aired pursuant to multi-year carriage agreements that provide for the level of carriage that Discovery’s networks will receive, and, if applicable, for scheduled graduated annual rate increases. Carriage of our networks depends upon channel placement and package inclusion, such as whether networks are on the more widely distributed, broader packages or lesser-distributed, specialized packages. Distribution revenues are largely dependent on the rates negotiated in the agreements, the number of subscribers that receive our networks or content, and the market demand for the content that we provide. We have provided distributors launch incentives, in the form of cash payments or free periods, to carry our networks.

Distribution revenue also includes fees charged for bulk content arrangements and other subscription services for episodic content. Digital distribution agreements are impacted by the quantity, as well as the quality, of the content Discovery provides.

In the U.S., approximately90%of distribution revenues come from the top 10 distributors, with whom we have agreements that expire at various times from2013 through 2020. Outside of the U.S., approximately50%of distribution revenue comes from the top 10 distributors. Distribution fees are typically collected ratably throughout the year. International television markets vary in their stages of development. Some, notably the U.K., are more advanced digital multi-channel television markets, while others operate in the analog environment with varying degrees of investment from distributors in expanding channel capacity or converting to digital.

Advertising

Our advertising revenue consists of consumer advertising, which is sold primarily on a national basis in the U.S. and on a pan-regional or local-language feed basis outside the U.S. Advertising contracts generally have a term of one year or less.

In the U.S., we sell advertising time in the upfront and scatter markets. In the upfront market, advertisers buy advertising time for the upcoming season and by purchasing in advance often receive discounted rates. In the scatter market, advertisers buy advertising time close to the time when the commercials will be run and often pay a premium. The mix between the upfront and scatter markets is based upon a number of factors, such as pricing, demand for advertising time and economic conditions. Outside the U.S., advertisers buy advertising closer to the time when the commercials will be run. Advertising revenue is dependent upon a number of factors, including the stage of development of television markets, the popularity of free-to-air television, the number of subscribers to our channels, viewership demographics, the popularity of our content and our ability to sell commercial time over a group of channels. In developing pay television markets, we expect advertising revenue growth will result from subscriber growth,










our localization strategy, and the shift of advertising spending from broadcast to pay television. In  mature markets, such as the U.S. and Western Europe, high proportions of market penetration and distribution are unlikely to drive rapid revenue growth. Instead, growth in advertising sales comes from increasing viewership and pricing and launching new services, either in pay television or free-to-air television environments.

Revenue from advertising is subject to seasonality, market-based variations and general economic conditions. Advertising revenue is typically highest in the second and fourth quarters. In some cases, advertising sales are subject to ratings guarantees that require us to provide additional advertising time if the guaranteed audience levels are not achieved.

We also generate revenue from the sale of advertising on our websites on a stand-alone basis and as part of advertising packages with our television networks.

Other

We also generate income associated with providing affiliate and advertising sales representation and network services for equity method investee networks, curriculum-based products and services and the licensing of our brands for consumer products.

COMPETITION

Television network content is a highly competitive business worldwide. We experience competition for the development and acquisition of content, distribution of our content, selling of commercial time on our networks and viewership. Our networks compete with studios, television networks, and the internet for the acquisition of content and creative talent such as writers, producers and directors. Our ability to produce and acquire popular content is an important competitive factor for the distribution of our networks, attracting viewers and the sale of advertising. Our success in securing popular content and creative talent depends on various factors such as the number of competitors providing content that targets the same genre and audience, the distribution of our networks, viewership, and the production, marketing and advertising support we provide.

Our networks compete with other television networks, including broadcast, cable and local, for the distribution of our content and fees charged to cable television operators, DTH satellite service providers, and other distributors that carry our network content. Our ability to secure distribution agreements is necessary to ensure the retention of our audiences. Our contractual agreements with distributors are renewed or renegotiated from time to time in the ordinary course of business. Growth in the number of networks distributed, consolidation and other market conditions in the cable and satellite distribution industry, and increased popularity of other platforms may adversely affect our ability to obtain and maintain contractual terms for the distribution of our content that are as favorable as those currently in place. The ability to secure distribution agreements is dependent upon the production, acquisition and packaging of original content, viewership, the marketing and advertising support and incentives provided to distributors, the product offering across a series of networks within a region, and the prices charged for carriage.

Our networks and websites compete for the sale of advertising with other television networks, including broadcast, cable and local networks, online and mobile outlets, radio content and print media. Our success in selling advertising is a function of the size and demographics of our viewers, quantitative and qualitative characteristics of the audience of each network, the perceived quality of the network and of the particular content, the brand appeal of the network and ratings as determined by third-party research companies, prices charged for advertising and overall advertiser demand in the marketplace.

Our networks and websites also compete for their target audiences with all forms of content and other media provided to viewers, including broadcast, cable and local networks, pay-per-view and VOD services, DVDs, online activities and other forms of news, information and entertainment.

Our education business competes with other providers of curriculum-based products and services to schools.

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY

Our intellectual property assets include copyrights in television content, trademarks in brands, names and logos, websites, and licenses of intellectual property rights from third parties.

We are fundamentally a content company and the protection of our brands and content is of primary importance. To protect our intellectual property assets, we rely upon a combination of copyright, trademark, unfair competition, trade secret and Internet/domain name statutes and laws, and contract provisions. However, there can be no assurance of the degree to which these measures will be successful. Moreover, effective intellectual property protection may be either unavailable or limited in certain foreign territories. Policing unauthorized use of our products and services and related intellectual property is difficult and costly. We seek to limit unauthorized use of our intellectual property through a combination of approaches. However, the steps taken to prevent the infringement of our intellectual property by unauthorized third parties may not work.










Third parties may challenge the validity or scope of our intellectual property from time to time, and the success of any such challenges could result in the limitation or loss of intellectual property rights. Irrespective of their validity, such claims may result in substantial costs and diversion of resources which could have an adverse effect on our operations. In addition, piracy, which encompasses the theft of our signal, and unauthorized use of our content, in the digital environment continues to present a threat to revenues from products and services based on our intellectual property.

REGULATORY MATTERS

Our businesses are subject to and affected by regulations of U.S. federal, state and local government authorities, and our international operations are subject to laws and regulations of the countries and international bodies, such as the European Union, in which we operate. Content networks, such as those owned by us, are regulated by the Federal Communications Commission (“FCC”) in certain respects if they are affiliated with a cable television operator. Other FCC regulations, although imposed on cable television operators and direct broadcast satellite ("DBS") operators, affect content networks indirectly. The rules, regulations, policies and procedures affecting our businesses are constantly subject to change. These descriptions are summary in nature and do not purport to describe all present and proposed laws and regulations affecting our businesses.

Program Access

The FCC’s program access rules prevent a satellite or cable content vendor in which a cable operator has an “attributable” ownership interest from discriminating among competing multichannel video content distributors (“MVPDs”), such as cable and DBS operators, in the rates, terms and conditions for the sale or delivery of content. These rules also permit MVPDs to initiate complaints to the FCC against content networks if an MVPD claims it is unable to obtain rights to carry the content network on nondiscriminatory rates, terms or conditions. The FCC allowed a previous blanket prohibition on exclusive arrangements with cable operators to expire in October 2012, but will consider case-by-case complaints that exclusive contracts between cable operators and cable-affiliated programmers significantly hinder or prevent a competing MVPD from providing satellite or cable programming.

“Must-Carry”/Retransmission Consent

The Cable Television Consumer Protection and Competition Act of 1992 (the “Act”) imposes “must-carry” regulations on cable systems, requiring them to carry the signals of most local broadcast television stations in their market. DBS systems are also subject to their own must-carry rules. The FCC’s implementation of “must-carry” obligations requires cable operators and DBS providers to give broadcasters preferential access to channel space. This reduces the amount of channel space that is available for carriage of our networks by cable operators and DBS operators. The Act also established retransmission consent, which refers to a broadcaster’s right to require consent from MVPDs, such as cable and satellite operators, before distributing its signal to their subscribers. Broadcasters have traditionally used the resulting leverage from demand for their must-have broadcast content to obtain carriage for their affiliated networks. Increasingly, broadcasters are additionally seeking substantial monetary compensation for granting carriage rights for their must-have broadcast content. Such increased financial demands on distributors reduce the content funds available for independent programmers not affiliated with broadcasters, such as us.

Closed Captioning and Advertising Restrictions

Certain of our networks must provide closed-captioning of content for the hearing impaired. Additionally, our content and websites intended primarily for children 12 years of age and under must comply with certain limits on advertising, and commercials embedded in our networks’ content stream adhere to certain standards for ensuring that those commercials are not transmitted at louder volumes than our program material. The 21stCentury Communications and Video Accessibility Act of 2010 requires us to provide closed captioning on certain IP-delivered video content that we offer.

Obscenity Restrictions

Network distributors are prohibited from transmitting obscene content, and our affiliation agreements generally require us to refrain from including such content on our networks.

Violent Programming

In 2007, the FCC issued a report on violence in programing that recommended Congress prohibit the availability of violent programming, including cable programming, during hours when children are likely to be watching. Recent events have led to a renewed interest by some members of Congress in the alleged effects of violent programming, which could lead to a renewal of interest in limiting the availability of such programming or prohibiting it.










Regulation of the Internet

We operate several websites which we use to distribute information about our programs and to offer consumers the opportunity to purchase consumer products and services. Internet services are now subject to regulation in the U.S. relating to the privacy and security of personally identifiable user information and acquisition of personal information from children under 13, including the federal Children's Online Privacy Protection Act and the federal Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography and Marketing Act. In addition, a majority of states have enacted laws that impose data security and security breach obligations. Additional federal and state laws and regulations may be adopted with respect to the Internet or other on-line services, covering such issues as user privacy, child safety, data security, advertising, pricing, content, copyrights and trademarks, access by persons with disabilities, distribution, taxation and characteristics and quality of products and services. In addition, to the extent we offer products and services to on-line consumers outside the U.S., the laws and regulations of foreign jurisdictions, including, without limitation, consumer protection, privacy, advertising, data retention, intellectual property, and content limitations, may impose additional compliance obligations on us.

EMPLOYEES

As ofDecember 31, 2012, we had approximately4,500employees, including full-time and part-time employees of our wholly-owned subsidiaries and consolidated ventures.
