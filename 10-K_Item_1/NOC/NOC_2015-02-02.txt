SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA AND SEGMENT OPERATING RESULTS

For a more complete understanding of our business, see Selected Financial Data in Part II, Item6. For a more complete understanding of our segment financial information, see Segment Operating Results in Part II, Item7and Note3to the consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item8.

CUSTOMER CONCENTRATION

Our primary customer is the U.S. Government. Sales to the U.S. Government (which excludes foreign military sales - a method to sell U.S. defense equipment and services to foreign governments through the DoD) accounted for approximately85 percentof total sales in each of the years endedDecember 31, 2014,2013and2012. International sales (which include foreign military sales) accounted for$3.0 billion,$2.5 billionand$2.1 billion, or13 percent,10 percentand8 percent, of total sales for the years endedDecember 31, 2014,2013and2012, respectively.

COMPETITIVE CONDITIONS

We compete with many companies in the defense, intelligence and federal markets. BAE Systems, Boeing, Booz Allen Hamilton, Finmeccanica, General Dynamics, L-3 Communications, Lockheed Martin, Raytheon and Thales are some of our primary competitors. Key characteristics of our industry include long operating cycles and intense competition, which is evident through the number of bid protests (competitor protests of U.S. Government procurement awards) and the number of competitors bidding on program opportunities.

It is common in the defense industry for work on major programs to be shared among a number of companies. A company competing to be a prime contractor may, upon ultimate award of the contract to another competitor, become a subcontractor for the ultimate prime contracting company. It is not unusual to compete for a contract award with a peer company and, simultaneously, perform as a supplier to or a customer of that same competitor on other contracts, or vice versa.

SEASONALITY

No material portion of our business is considered to be seasonal.

BACKLOG

AtDecember 31, 2014, total backlog was$38.2 billion, compared with$37.0 billionat the end of2013. Of the backlog atDecember 31, 2014, approximately$19.3 billionis expected to be converted into sales in2015. For further information, see Backlog in Part II, Item 7.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

See Note1to the consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item8.

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY

We routinely apply for and own a number of U.S. and foreign patents related to the products and services we provide. We also develop and protect intellectual property as trade secrets. In addition to owning a large portfolio of proprietary intellectual property, we license some intellectual property rights to and from third parties. The U.S. Government typically holds licenses to patents developed in the performance of U.S. Government contracts and may use or authorize others to use the inventions covered by these patents for certain purposes. See Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A.

RAW MATERIALS

We have not experienced significant delays in the supply or availability of raw materials, nor have we experienced a significant price increase for raw materials. See Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A.

EMPLOYEE RELATIONS

We believe that we maintain good relations with our64,300employees, of which approximately2,800are covered by14collective agreements. We negotiated renewals oftwoof our collective agreements in2014and expect to negotiate renewals offiveof our collective agreements in2015. See Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A.

REGULATORY MATTERS

Government Contract Security Restrictions

Certain programs with the U.S. Government that are prohibited by the customer from being publicly discussed are generally referred to as “restricted” in this Form 10-K. The consolidated financial statements and financial information in this Form 10-K reflect the operating results of our entire company, including restricted programs, under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP).

Contracts

We generate the majority of our business from long-term contracts with the U.S. Government for development, production and support activities. Unless otherwise specified in a contract, allowable and allocable costs are billed to contracts with the U.S. Government under the requirements of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) and U.S. Government Cost Accounting Standards (CAS) regulations. Examples of costs incurred by us and not billed to the U.S. Government in accordance with the requirements of the FAR and CAS regulations include, but are not limited to, lobbying costs, certain legal costs, charitable donations, advertising costs, interest expense and unallowable employee compensation and benefit costs.

NORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION



Our long-term contracts typically fall into one of two broad categories:

Cost-type contracts– Cost-type contracts include cost plus fixed fee, award fee and incentive fee contracts. Cost-type contracts provide for reimbursement of the contractor’s allowable costs incurred plus a fee. Cost-type contracts generally require that the contractor use its best efforts to accomplish the scope of the work within some specified time and some stated dollar limitation. Fees on cost-type contracts can be fixed in terms of dollar value or percentage of costs. Award and incentive fees are based on performance criteria such as cost, schedule, quality and technical performance. Award fees are determined and earned based on customer evaluation of the company's performance against negotiated criteria, and are intended to provide motivation for excellence in contract performance. Incentive fees that are based on cost provide for an initially negotiated fee to be adjusted later, typically using a formula to measure performance against the associated criteria, based on the relationship of total allowable costs to total target costs. Award and incentive fees that can reasonably be estimated and are deemed reasonably assured are recorded over the performance period of the contract.

Fixed-price contracts– A firm fixed-price contract is a contract in which the specified scope of work is agreed to for a price that is a pre-determined, negotiated amount and not generally subject to adjustment regardless of costs incurred by the contractor, absent changes in scope by the customer. Certain fixed-price incentive fee contracts provide for reimbursement of the contractor’s allowable costs plus a fee up to a ceiling amount, typically through a cost-sharing ratio that affects profitability. These types of fixed-price incentive fee contracts effectively become firm fixed-price contracts once the cost-share ceiling is reached. Time-and-materials contracts are considered fixed-price contracts as they specify a fixed hourly rate for each labor hour charged.

See Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 and Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A.

The following table summarizes sales for the year endedDecember 31, 2014, recognized by contract type and customer:

(1)Other customer sales include foreign military sales.

Profit margins may vary materially depending on, among other things, negotiated contract fee arrangements, achievement of performance objectives and the stage of performance at which the right to receive fees, particularly under incentive and award fee contracts, is determined.

We monitor our policies and procedures with respect to our contracts on a regular basis to enhance consistent application under similar terms and conditions, as well as compliance with applicable government regulations and laws. In addition, costs incurred and allocated to contracts with the U.S. Government are routinely audited by the Defense Contract Audit Agency.

Environmental

Our manufacturing operations are subject to and affected by federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment. In 2010, we established goals for the reduction of water use and solid waste through implementation of best management practices; those goals were achieved as of December 31, 2014. In addition, after achieving the greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction goals established by the company in 2009, we announced in 2014 our commitment to reduce GHG emissions by 2020 from our 2010 GHG emissions level.

We have incurred and expect to continue to incur capital and operating costs to comply with applicable environmental laws and regulations and to achieve our environmental sustainability commitments. See Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A; Note1and Note11to the consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item8.
