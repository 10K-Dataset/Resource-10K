ITEM 1.    BUSINESS

General



We own, acquire, develop and operate data centers. Our portfolio consists of  high-quality, strategically located properties containing the physical and connectivity infrastructure that supports the applications and day-to-day operations of social networking, mobile communications, analytics, cloud and content providers, network providers, information technology services providers and corporate enterprise data center users, including financial services companies. Digital Realty Trust, L.P., a Maryland limited partnership, is the entity through which Digital Realty Trust, Inc., a Maryland corporation, conducts its business and owns its assets. Digital Realty Trust, Inc. operates as a REIT for federal income tax purpose.



On October 9, 2015, we acquired Telx Holdings, Inc., or Telx, a leading national provider of data center colocation, interconnection and cloud enablement solutions, for approximately $1.886 billion. We believe this transaction established us as a leading colocation and interconnection platform in the U.S., complementing our existing large-footprint business.

As ofDecember 31, 2015, our portfolio consisted of139operating properties, includingeightTelx properties (of which two are owned and six properties are leased from third parties) and14properties held as investments in unconsolidated joint ventures, of which110are located throughout North America,23are located in Europe,threeare located in Australia andthreeare located in Asia.

We are diversified in major metropolitan areas where corporate data center and technology tenants are concentrated, including the Atlanta, Boston, Chicago, Dallas, Los Angeles, New York, Northern Virginia, Phoenix, San Francisco, Seattle and Silicon Valley metropolitan areas in the United States, Amsterdam, Dublin, Frankfurt (land only), London and Paris metropolitan areas in Europe and Singapore, Sydney, Melbourne, Hong Kong  and Osaka (land only) metropolitan areas in the Asia Pacific region. Our properties contain a total of approximately

25.6 million

rentable square feet including approximately

1.3 million

square feet of space under active development, which includes current base building and data center projects in progress, as well as approximately

1.3 million

square feet of space held for future development, which includes space held for future data center development and excludes space under active development. The


properties held as investments in unconsolidated joint ventures have an aggregate of approximately

1.9 million

rentable square feet. The


parcels of developable land we own comprised approximately


acres. A significant component of our current and future internal growth is expected to be generated through the development of our existing space held for development and acquisition of new properties.  As of

December 31, 2015

, our portfolio, including the


properties held as investments in unconsolidated joint ventures and excluding space under active development and space held for future development, was approximately

91.4%

leased. The types of properties within our portfolio include:



•Corporate data centers, which provide secure, continuously available environments for the exchange, processing and storage of critical electronic information. Data centers are used for digital communication, disaster recovery purposes, transaction processing and housing corporate IT operations;

•Internet gateway data centers, which serve as hubs for Internet and data communications within and between major metropolitan areas; and

•Office and other non-data center space.



Unlike traditional office and flex/research and development space, the location of and improvements to our facilities, including network density, interconnection infrastructure and connectivity-centric customers in certain of our facilities, are generally essential to our businesses, which we believe results in high occupancy levels, longer average lease terms and customer relationships and lower turnover. In addition, many of our properties have tenant improvements that have been installed at our tenants’ expense. The tenant improvements in our facilities are generally readily adaptable for use by similar tenants.



Digital Realty Trust, Inc. was incorporated in the state of Maryland on March 9, 2004. Digital Realty Trust, L.P. was organized in the state of Maryland on July 21, 2004. Our principal executive offices are located at Four Embarcadero Center, Suite 3200, San Francisco, California 94111. Our telephone number at that location is (415) 738-6500. Our website is located at www.digitalrealty.com.

Recent Developments



On January 21, 2016, the operating partnership closed on the sale of 47700 Kato Road and 1055 Page Avenue, two adjacent non-data center properties totaling 199,000 square feet in Fremont, California for $37.5 million. The sale generated net proceeds of $35.8 million and we will recognize a gain on the sale of approximately $1.2 million in the first quarter of 2016. The properties were identified as held for sale as of December 31, 2015. 47700 Kato Road and 1055 Page Avenue were not a significant component of our U.S. portfolio nor does the sale represent a significant shift in our strategy.

On January 15, 2016, the operating partnership refinanced our global revolving credit facility and entered into a global senior credit agreement for a $2.0 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility, which we refer to as the 2016 global revolving credit facility, that replaced the $2.0 billion revolving credit facility executed on August 15, 2013, as amended. The 2016 global revolving credit facility provides for borrowings in Australian dollars, British pounds sterling, Canadian dollars, Euros, Hong Kong dollars, Japanese yen, Singapore dollars, and U.S. dollars, and includes the ability to add additional currencies in the future. The 2016 global revolving credit facility has an accordion feature that would enable us to increase the borrowing capacity of the credit facility up to $2.5 billion, subject to the receipt of lender commitments and other conditions precedent. The 2016 global revolving credit facility matures on January 15, 2020, with two six-month extension options available.

On January 15, 2016, the operating partnership refinanced the senior unsecured multi-currency term loan facility and entered into a Term Loan Agreement, which we refer to as the term loan agreement, which governs (i) a $1.25 billion 5-year senior unsecured term loan (the “5-Year Term Loan”) and (ii) a $300 million 7-year senior unsecured term loan (the “7-Year Term Loan”). The term loan agreement replaced the $1.0 billion term loan agreement executed on April 16, 2012, as amended. The term loan agreement provides for borrowings in Australian dollars, British pounds sterling, Canadian dollars, Euros, Hong Kong dollars, Japanese yen, Singapore dollars and U.S. dollars. The maturity date of the 5-Year Term Loan is January 15, 2021 and the maturity date of the 7-Year Term Loan is January 15, 2023. In addition, we have the ability from time to time to increase the aggregate size of lending under the Term Loan Agreement from $1.55 billion up to $1.8 billion, subject to receipt of lender commitments and other conditions precedent.

On February 17, 2016, we declared the following dividends per share. The operating partnership will make an equivalent distribution per unit.

Our Competitive Strengths



We believe we distinguish ourselves from other owners, acquirors and managers of technology-related real estate through our competitive strengths, which include:



•High-Quality Global Portfolio that is Difficult to Replicate.Our portfolio contains state-of-the-art data center facilities with extensive tenant improvements in 33 metropolitan areas across 10 countries. Our portfolio of data center facilities is equipped to meet the power and cooling requirements for customers with smaller footprints up to the most demanding corporate IT applications. Many of the properties in our portfolio are located on major aggregation points formed by the physical presence of multiple major telecommunications service providers, which reduces our customers’ costs and operational risks and enhances the attractiveness of our properties. In addition, our strategically located global data center campuses offer our customers a place to grow as their businesses grow, and we believe that expanding connectivity offerings in our campus facilities will also enhance the attractiveness of these facilities. Further, the network density, interconnection infrastructure and connectivity-centric customers in






Table of ContentsIndex to Financial Statements



certain of our facilities has led to the formation of densely connected ecosystems that are difficult to replicate and valuable to customers. We believe that a high-quality global portfolio like ours could not be easily replicated today on a cost-competitive basis.

•Presence in Key Metropolitan Areas.Our portfolio is located in 33 major metropolitan areas where corporate data center and technology tenants are concentrated, including the Atlanta, Boston, Chicago, Dallas, Los Angeles, New York, Northern Virginia, Phoenix, San Francisco and Silicon Valley metropolitan areas in the United States, the Amsterdam, Dublin, London and Paris metropolitan areas in Europe and the Singapore, Sydney, Melbourne and Hong Kong metropolitan areas in the Asia Pacific region.  Our portfolio is geographically diversified so that no one metropolitan area represented more than approximately12.5%of the aggregate annualized rent of our portfolio as ofDecember 31, 2015. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Overview—Revenue Base.”

•Proven Experience Attracting and Retaining Customers.We have considerable experience in identifying and attracting new and retaining existing customers. Our specialized data center sales force provides a robust pipeline of new clients, while existing customers continue to grow and expand with us. During the year endedDecember 31, 2015, we commenced new leases totaling approximately1.3 millionsquare feet, which represent approximately$157.5 millionin annualized GAAP rent. During the year endedDecember 31, 2015, we signed new leases totaling approximately0.8 millionsquare feet, which represent approximately$127.0 millionin annualized GAAP rent. These leases were comprised of Powered Base Buildings®, Turn-Key Flex®and colocation space, Custom Solutions product and space for ancillary office and other uses.

•Demonstrated Investment Acumen.We have developed detailed, standardized procedures for evaluating acquisitions, including income-producing properties as well as vacant buildings and land suitable for development, to ensure that they meet our strategic, financial, technical and other criteria. These procedures and our in-depth knowledge of the technology and data center industries as well as the real estate industry allow us to identify strategically located properties and evaluate investment opportunities efficiently and, as appropriate, commit and close quickly. Our broad network of contacts within a highly fragmented universe of sellers and brokers of technology-related real estate enables us to capitalize on acquisition opportunities. As a result, we acquired a substantial portion of our properties before they were broadly marketed by real estate brokers.

•Flexible Data Center Solutions.We provide flexible, customer-oriented solutions designed to meet the needs of domestic and international companies across multiple industry verticals. Our Turn-Key Flex®and colocation data centers are move-in ready, physically secure facilities with the power and cooling capabilities to support mission-critical IT enterprise applications. We believe our Turn-Key Flex®facilities are effective solutions for customers who may lack the bandwidth, capital budget, expertise or desire to provide their own extensive data center infrastructure, management and security. We also believe that our colocation and interconnection platform offers a number of options for customers looking for small to larger footprints and connectivity solutions. For customers who possess the ability to build and operate their own facility, our Powered Base Building®solution provides the physical location, required power and network access necessary to support a state-of-the-art data center. Our in-house engineering and design and construction professionals can also provide a Custom Solutions product to meet a customer’s unique specifications. Furthermore, our data center campuses offer our customers the opportunity to expand and grow in or near their existing deployments within a campus. Our Critical Facilities Management®services and team of technical engineers and data center operations experts provide 24/7 support for these mission-critical facilities.

•Leading Colocation and Interconnection Platform.We believe the acquisition of Telx, or the Telx Acquisition, has established us as a leading provider of colocation, interconnection and cloud-enablement services in the U.S. We believe interconnection is an attractive line of business that would be difficult to build organically and enhances the overall value proposition of our colocation and large-footprint data center product offerings. In addition to enhancing our presence in top-tier locations throughout the U.S and providing significant opportunities for additional growth, we believe the Telx Acquisition expanded our product mix to appeal to a broader spectrum of data center customers.

•Differentiating Development Advantages.Our extensive development activity, operating scale and process-based approach to data center design, construction and operations result in significant cost savings and added value for our customers. We have leveraged our purchasing power by securing global purchasing agreements and developing relationships with major equipment manufacturers, reducing costs and shortening delivery timeframes on key components, including major mechanical and electrical equipment. Utilizing our innovative modular data center design referred to as POD Architecture®, we deliver what we believe to be a technically superior data center environment at significant cost savings. In addition, by utilizing our POD Architecture®to develop new Turn-Key Flex®facilities in our existing Powered Base Building®facilities, on average we are able to deliver a fully commissioned facility in under 30 weeks. Finally, our access to capital allows us to provide data center solutions for customers who do not want to invest their own capital.

•Diverse Customer Base across a Wide Variety of Industry Sectors.We use our in-depth knowledge of the requirements and trends for social networking, mobile communications, analytics, cloud and content providers, network providers, information technology services providers and corporate enterprise data center users, including financial services companies, to market our properties to domestic and international customers with specific technology needs. AtDecember 31, 2015, we had over 1,750 customers across a variety of industry verticals, ranging from cloud and information technology services to financial services, manufacturing, energy, gaming, life sciences and consumer products. Our largest customer, IBM, accounted for approximately 7.5% of the aggregate annualized rent as ofDecember 31, 2015and no other single customer accounted for more than approximately 6.1% of the aggregate annualized rent of our portfolio.

•Experienced and Committed Management Team and Organization.Our senior management team has many years of experience in the technology or real estate industries, including experience as investors in, advisors to and founders of technology companies. We believe that our senior management team’s extensive knowledge of both the real estate and the technology industries provides us with a key competitive advantage. Further, a significant portion of compensation for our senior management team and directors is in the form of common equity interests in our company and we recently instituted minimum stock ownership requirements, further aligning their interests with those of external stockholders. We have also implemented an employee stock purchase plan, which allows our employees to increase their ownership in the company.

Business and Growth Strategies

Our primary business objective is maximize value creation on a per share and unit basis through achieving superior organic growth, prudently allocating capital and preserving the flexibility of our balance sheet.



•Achieve Superior Returns.We believe that achieving appropriate risk-adjusted returns on our business, including on our development pipeline and leasing transactions, will deliver superior stockholder returns. AtDecember 31, 2015, we had approximately1.3 millionsquare feet of space under active development for Turn-Key Flex®, Powered Base Building®and Custom Solutions products in three U.S. metropolitan areas, two European metropolitan areas, one Canadian metropolitan area and our Singapore metropolitan area, consisting of approximately0.7 millionsquare feet of base building construction and0.6 millionsquare feet of data center construction. We may continue to build out our development pipeline when justified by anticipated returns. We also believe that providing an even stronger value proposition to our customers, including through new and enhanced product offerings, as well as improving operational efficiencies, will further drive improved returns for our business.

•Provide Foundational Services to Enable Customers and Partners.We believe that our global infrastructure platform, through which we offer the foundational services of space, power and connectivity, will enable our customers and partners to serve their customers and grow their businesses. We believe our internet gateway facilities, individual data centers and data center campuses are attractive to a wide variety of customers and partners of all sizes. Furthermore, we believe our colocation and interconnection offerings, as well as the densely connected ecosystems that have developed within our facilities, are valuable and critical to our customers’ and partners’ supply chain.

•Prudently Allocate Capital.We believe that the accretive deployment of capital at sufficiently positive spreads above our cost of capital enables us to increase cash flow and create long-term stockholder value. Our relationships with corporate information technology groups, technology tenants and real estate brokers who are dedicated to serving these tenants provide us with ongoing access to potential investment opportunities and frequently enable us to avoid competitive bidding. In addition, the specialized nature of technology-related real estate makes it more difficult for traditional real estate investors to underwrite, resulting in reduced competition for investments relative to other property types. We believe this dynamic creates an opportunity for us to generate better risk-adjusted returns






Table of ContentsIndex to Financial Statements



on our capital. We employ a collaborative approach to deal analysis, risk management and asset allocation, focusing on key elements, such as market fundamentals, accessibility to fiber and power, and the local regulatory environment.

•Preserve the Flexibility of Our Balance Sheet.We are committed to maintaining a conservative capital structure. We target a debt-to-EBITDA ratio at or less than 5.5x, fixed charge coverage of greater than three times, and floating rate debt at less than 20% of total outstanding debt. In addition, we strive to maintain a well-laddered debt maturity schedule, and we seek to maximize the menu of our available sources of capital, while minimizing the cost. Since Digital Realty Trust, Inc.’s initial public offering in 2004, our company has raised approximately $15.8 billion of capital through common, preferred and convertible preferred equity offerings, exchangeable debt offerings, non-exchangeable bond offerings, our global revolving credit facility, our term loan facility, the Prudential shelf facility, secured mortgage financings and refinancings and sales of non-core assets. We endeavor to maintain financial flexibility while using our liquidity and access to capital to support operations, including our acquisition, leasing and development programs and global campus expansion, which are important sources of our growth.

•Maximize Property-Level Cash Flow.We aggressively manage our properties to maximize cash flow. We often acquire properties with substantial in-place cash flow and some vacancy, which enables us to create upside through lease-up. We control our costs by negotiating expense pass-through provisions in tenant leases for operating expenses, including power costs and certain capital expenditures. Leases covering approximately 71% of the leased net rentable square feet in our portfolio as ofDecember 31, 2015required tenants to pay all or a portion of increases in operating expenses, including real estate taxes, insurance, common area charges and other expenses. We also control costs by driving operating efficiencies, which include focusing on centralizing functions and optimizing operations as well as improving processes and technologies. We believe that expanding our global data center campuses will also contribute to operating efficiencies because we expect to achieve economies of scale on our campus environments.

•Leverage Strong Industry Relationships.We use our strong industry relationships with national and regional corporate enterprise information technology groups and technology-intensive companies to identify and comprehensively respond to their data center needs. Our sales professionals are real estate and technology industry specialists who can develop complex facility solutions for the most demanding corporate data center and other technology tenants.

No other foreign country comprised more than 10% of total investments in real estate as of each ofDecember 31, 2015,2014and2013. See “Risk Factors—Ownership of properties located outside of the United States subjects us to foreign currency and related risks which may adversely impact our ability to make distributions”, “—Our international activities are subject to unique risks different than those faced by us in the United States and we may not be able to effectively manage our international business” and “—We face risks with our international acquisitions associated with investing in unfamiliar metropolitan areas” for risks relating to our foreign operations.

Regulation

General

Our properties are subject to various laws, ordinances and regulations, including regulations relating to common areas. We believe that each of our properties as ofDecember 31, 2015has the necessary permits and approvals to operate.

Americans With Disabilities Act

Our properties must comply with Title III of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, or the ADA, to the extent that such properties are “public accommodations” as defined by the ADA. The ADA may require removal of structural barriers to access by persons with disabilities in certain public areas of our properties where such removal is readily achievable. We believe that our properties are in substantial compliance with the ADA and that we will not be required to make substantial capital expenditures to address the requirements of the ADA. However, noncompliance with the ADA could result in imposition of fines or an award of damages to private litigants. The obligation to make readily achievable accommodations is an ongoing one, and we will continue to assess our properties and to make alterations as appropriate in this respect.

Environmental Matters

Previous owners used some of our properties for industrial and retail purposes, and those properties may contain some level of environmental contamination. Independent environmental consultants have conducted Phase I or similar environmental site assessments on all of the properties in our portfolio. Site assessments are intended to discover and evaluate information regarding the environmental condition of the surveyed property and surrounding properties. These assessments do not generally include soil samplings, subsurface investigations or an asbestos survey and the assessments may have failed to reveal all material environmental conditions, liabilities or compliance concerns. In addition, material environmental conditions, liabilities or compliance concerns may have arisen after these reviews were completed or may arise in the future. We could be held jointly and severally liable under CERCLA and various state laws for the investigation and remediation of environmental contamination caused by previous owners or operators. Fuel storage tanks are present at most of our properties, and if releases were to occur, we may be liable for the costs of cleaning any resulting contamination. The presence of contamination or the failure to remediate contamination at our properties may expose us to third-party liability or materially adversely affect our ability to sell, lease or develop the real estate or to borrow using the real estate as collateral.






Table of ContentsIndex to Financial Statements



In addition, some of our tenants, particularly those in the biotechnology and life sciences industry and those in the technology manufacturing industry, routinely handle hazardous substances and wastes as part of their operations at our properties. Environmental laws and regulations subject our tenants, and potentially us, to liability resulting from these activities or from previous industrial or retail uses of those properties. We could be held jointly and severally liable under CERCLA and various state laws for the investigation and remediation of hazardous substances releases by our tenants. Environmental liabilities could also affect a tenant’s ability to make rental payments to us. We cannot assure you that costs of investigation and remediation of environmental matters will not affect our ability to pay dividends to Digital Realty Trust, Inc.’s stockholders and distributions to Digital Realty Trust, L.P.’s unitholders or that such costs or other remedial measures will not have a material adverse effect on our business, assets or results of operations or our competitive position.



Our properties and their uses often require permits from various government agencies, including permits related to zoning and land use, such as permits to operate data center facilities. Certain permits from state or local environmental regulatory agencies, including regulators of air quality, are usually required to install and operate diesel-powered generators, which provide emergency back-up power at most of our facilities. These permits often set emissions limits for certain air pollutants, including oxides of nitrogen. In addition, various federal, state, and local environmental, health and safety requirements, such as fire requirements and treated and storm water discharge requirements, apply to some of our properties. Changes to applicable regulations, such as air quality regulations, or the permit requirements for equipment at our facilities, could hinder or prevent our construction or operation of data center facilities.



The environmental laws and regulations to which our properties are subject may change in the future, and new laws and regulations may be created. Future laws, ordinances or regulations may impose additional material environmental liability. Such laws include those directly regulating our climate change impacts and those which regulate the climate change impacts of companies with which we do business, such as utilities providing our facilities with electricity. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Factors Which May Influence Future Results of Operations—Climate change legislation.” We do not know if or how the requirements will change, but changes may require that we make significant unanticipated expenditures, and such expenditures may materially adversely impact our financial condition, cash flow, results, cash available for distributions, common stock’s per share trading price, our competitive position and ability to satisfy our debt service obligations.

Insurance

We carry commercial general liability, property, and business interruption insurance, including rental income loss coverage, covering all of the properties in our portfolio under a blanket program. We select policy specifications and insured limits which we believe to be appropriate given the relative risk of loss, the cost of the coverage and industry practice and, in the opinion of our company’s management, the properties in our portfolio are currently adequately insured. We do not carry insurance for generally uninsured exposures such as loss from war or nuclear reaction. In addition, we carry earthquake insurance on our properties in an amount and with deductibles which we believe are commercially reasonable. We intend to partially fund the earthquake insurance deductibles through a captive insurance company we established in May 2014. Certain of the properties in our portfolio are located in areas known to be seismically active.   See “Risk Factors-Risks Related to Our Business and Operations-Potential losses may not be covered by insurance.”

Employees

As ofDecember 31, 2015, we had 1,295 employees. None of these employees are represented by a labor union.
