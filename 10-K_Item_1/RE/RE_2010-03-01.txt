ITEM 1.  BUSINESS



The
Company.

Group, a
Bermuda company, was established in 1999 as a wholly-owned subsidiary of
Holdings.  On February 24, 2000, a corporate restructuring was
completed and Group became the new parent holding company of
Holdings.  Holdings continues to be the holding company for the
Company’s U.S. based operations.  Holders of shares of common stock of
Holdings automatically became holders of the same number of common shares of
Group.  Prior to the restructuring, Group had no significant assets or
capitalization and had not engaged in any business or prior activities other
than in connection with the restructuring.



In
connection with the February 24, 2000 restructuring, Group established a
Bermuda-based reinsurance subsidiary, Everest Reinsurance (Bermuda), Ltd.
(“Bermuda Re”), which commenced business in the second half of
2000.  Group also formed Everest Global Services, Inc., a Delaware
subsidiary, to perform administrative functions for Group and its U.S. based and
non-U.S. based subsidiaries.



On
December 30, 2008, Group contributed Holdings to its recently established Irish
holding company, Holdings Ireland.  Holdings Ireland is a direct
subsidiary of Group and was established to serve as a holding company for the
U.S. and Irish reinsurance and insurance subsidiaries.



Holdings,
a Delaware corporation, was established in 1993 to serve as the parent holding
company of Everest Re, a Delaware property and casualty reinsurer formed in
1973.  Until October 6, 1995, Holdings was an indirect wholly-owned
subsidiary of The Prudential Insurance Company of America (“The
Prudential”).  On October 6, 1995, The Prudential sold its entire
interest in Holdings in an initial public offering.



The
Company’s principal business, conducted through its operating segments, is the
underwriting of reinsurance and insurance in the U.S., Bermuda and international
markets.  The Company had gross written premiums, in 2009, of $4.1
billion with approximately 80.0% representing reinsurance and 20.0% representing
insurance.  Shareholders’ equity at December 31, 2009 was $6.1
billion.  The Company underwrites reinsurance both through brokers and
directly with ceding companies, giving it the flexibility to pursue business
based on the ceding company’s preferred reinsurance purchasing
method.  The Company underwrites insurance principally through general
agent relationships, brokers and surplus lines brokers.  Group’s
active operating subsidiaries, excluding Mt. McKinley Insurance Company (“Mt.
McKinley”), which is in run-off, are each rated A+ (“Superior”) by A.M. Best
Company (“A.M. Best”), a leading provider of insurer ratings that assigns
financial strength ratings to insurance companies based on their ability to meet
their obligations to policyholders.

      portfolio transfer reinsurance agreement, whereby Mt. McKinley
      transferred, for arm’s-length consideration, all of its net insurance
      exposures and reserves to Bermuda
Re.



Reinsurance
Industry Overview.

Reinsurance
is an arrangement in which an insurance company, the reinsurer, agrees to
indemnify another insurance or reinsurance company, the ceding company, against
all or a portion of the insurance risks underwritten by the ceding company under
one or more insurance contracts.  Reinsurance can provide a ceding
company with several benefits, including a reduction in its net liability on
individual risks or classes of risks, catastrophe protection from large and/or
multiple losses and/or a reduction in operating leverage as measured by the
ratio of net premiums and reserves to capital.  Reinsurance also
provides a ceding company with additional underwriting capacity by permitting it
to accept larger risks and write more business than would be acceptable relative
to the ceding company’s financial resources.  Reinsurance does not
discharge the ceding company from its liability to policyholders; rather, it
reimburses the ceding company for covered losses.



There are
two basic types of reinsurance arrangements:  treaty and
facultative.  Treaty reinsurance obligates the ceding company to cede
and the reinsurer to assume a specified portion of a type or category of risks
insured by the ceding company.  Treaty reinsurers do not separately
evaluate each of the individual risks assumed under their treaties, instead, the
reinsurer relies upon the pricing and underwriting decisions made by the ceding
company.  In facultative reinsurance, the ceding company cedes and the
reinsurer assumes all or part of the risk under a single insurance contract.
Facultative reinsurance is negotiated separately for each insurance contract
that is reinsured.  Facultative reinsurance, when purchased by ceding
companies,





usually
is intended to cover individual risks not covered by their reinsurance treaties
because of the dollar limits involved or because the risk is
unusual.



Both
treaty and facultative reinsurance can be written on either a pro rata basis or
an excess of loss basis.  Under pro rata reinsurance, the ceding
company and the reinsurer share the premiums as well as the losses and expenses
in an agreed proportion.  Under excess of loss reinsurance, the
reinsurer indemnifies the ceding company against all or a specified portion of
losses and expenses in excess of a specified dollar amount, known as the ceding
company's retention or reinsurer's attachment point, generally subject to a
negotiated reinsurance contract limit.



In pro
rata reinsurance, the reinsurer generally pays the ceding company a ceding
commission.  The ceding commission generally is based on the ceding
company’s cost of acquiring the business being reinsured (commissions, premium
taxes, assessments and miscellaneous administrative expense and may contain
profit sharing provisions, whereby the ceding commission is adjusted based on
loss experience).  Premiums paid by the ceding company to a reinsurer
for excess of loss reinsurance are not directly proportional to the premiums
that the ceding company receives because the reinsurer does not assume a
proportionate risk.  There is usually no ceding commission on excess
of loss reinsurance.



Reinsurers
may purchase reinsurance to cover their own risk exposure. Reinsurance of a
reinsurer's business is called a retrocession.  Reinsurance companies
cede risks under retrocessional agreements to other reinsurers, known as
retrocessionaires, for reasons similar to those that cause insurers to purchase
reinsurance: to reduce net liability on individual or classes of risks, protect
against catastrophic losses, stabilize financial ratios and obtain additional
underwriting capacity.



Reinsurance
can be written through intermediaries, generally professional reinsurance
brokers, or directly with ceding companies.  From a ceding company's
perspective, the broker and the direct distribution channels have advantages and
disadvantages.  A ceding company's decision to select one distribution
channel over the other will be influenced by its perception of such advantages
and disadvantages relative to the reinsurance coverage being
placed.



Business
Strategy.

The
Company’s business strategy is to sustain its leadership position within
targeted reinsurance and insurance markets, provide effective management
throughout the property and casualty underwriting cycle and thereby achieve an
attractive return for its shareholders.  The Company’s underwriting
strategies seek to capitalize on its i) financial strength and capacity, ii)
global franchise, iii) stable and experienced management team, iv) diversified
product and distribution offerings, v) underwriting expertise and disciplined
approach, vi) efficient and low-cost operating structure and vii) effective
enterprise risk management practices.



The
Company offers treaty and facultative reinsurance and admitted and non-admitted
insurance. The Company’s products include the full range of property and
casualty reinsurance and insurance coverages, including marine, aviation,
surety, errors and omissions liability (“E&O”), directors’ and officers’
liability (“D&O”), medical malpractice, other specialty lines, accident and
health (“A&H”) and workers’ compensation.



The
Company’s underwriting strategies emphasizes underwriting profitability over
premium volume.  Key elements of this strategy include careful risk
selection, appropriate pricing through strict underwriting discipline and
adjustment of the Company’s business mix in response to changing market
conditions.  The Company focuses on reinsuring companies that
effectively manage the underwriting cycle through proper analysis and pricing of
underlying risks and whose underwriting guidelines and performance are
compatible with its objectives.







The
Company’s underwriting strategies emphasizes flexibility and responsiveness to
changing market conditions, such as increased demand or favorable pricing
trends.  The Company believes that its existing strengths, including
its broad underwriting expertise, global presence, strong financial ratings and
substantial capital, facilitate adjustments to its mix of business
geographically, by line of business and by type of coverage, allowing it to
participate in those market opportunities that provide the greatest potential
for underwriting profitability.  The Company’s insurance operations
complement these strategies by accessing business that is not available on a
reinsurance basis.  The Company carefully monitors its mix of business
across all operations to avoid unacceptable geographic or other risk
concentrations.



Marketing.

The
Company writes business on a worldwide basis for many different customers and
lines of business, thereby obtaining a broad spread of risk.  The
Company is not substantially dependent on any single customer, small group of
customers, line of business or geographic area.  For the 2009 calendar
year, no single customer (ceding company or insured) generated more than 5.1% of
the Company’s gross written premiums.  The Company believes that a
reduction of business from any one customer would not have a material adverse
effect on its future financial condition or results of operations.



Approximately
68%, 11% and 21% of the Company’s 2009 gross written premiums were written in
the broker reinsurance, direct reinsurance and insurance markets,
respectively.



The
broker reinsurance market consists of several substantial national and
international brokers and a number of smaller specialized
brokers.  Brokers do not have the authority to bind the Company with
respect to reinsurance agreements, nor does the Company commit in advance to
accept any portion of a broker’s submitted business.  Reinsurance
business from any ceding company, whether new or renewal, is subject to
acceptance by the Company.  Brokerage fees are generally paid by
reinsurers.  The Company’s ten largest brokers accounted for an
aggregate of approximately 62% of gross written premiums in 2009.  The
largest broker, Aon Benfield Re, accounts for approximately 22% of gross written
premiums.  The second largest broker, Marsh and McLennan, accounted
for approximately 17% of gross written premiums.  The Company believes
that a reduction of business assumed from any one broker would not have a
material adverse effect on the Company.



The
direct reinsurance market remains an important distribution channel for
reinsurance business written by the Company.  Direct placement of
reinsurance enables the Company to access clients who prefer to place their
reinsurance directly with reinsurers based upon the reinsurer’s in-depth
understanding of the ceding company’s needs.



The
Company’s insurance business is written principally through general agents,
brokers and surplus lines brokers.  In 2009, C.V. Starr & Company
accounted for approximately 6% of the Company’s gross written
premium.  No other single general agent generated more than 5% of the
Company’s gross written premiums.



The
Company continually evaluates each business relationship, including the
underwriting expertise and experience brought to bear through the involved
distribution channel, performs analyses to evaluate financial security, monitors
performance and adjusts underwriting decisions accordingly.







Segment
Results.

The
Company, through its subsidiaries, operates in five segments:  U.S.
Reinsurance, U.S. Insurance, Specialty Underwriting, International and
Bermuda.  The U.S. Reinsurance operation writes property and casualty
reinsurance, on both a treaty and facultative basis, through reinsurance
brokers, as well as directly with ceding companies within the
U.S.  The U.S. Insurance operation writes property and casualty
insurance primarily through general agents, brokers and surplus lines brokers
within the U.S.  The Specialty Underwriting operation writes A&H,
marine, aviation and surety business within the U.S. and worldwide through
brokers and directly with ceding companies.  The International
operation writes non-U.S. property and casualty reinsurance through Everest Re’s
branches in Canada and Singapore and offices in Miami and New Jersey. The
Bermuda operation provides reinsurance and insurance to worldwide property and
casualty markets and reinsurance to life insurers through brokers and directly
with ceding companies from its Bermuda office and reinsurance to the United
Kingdom and European markets through its UK branch.



These
segments are managed independently, but conform with corporate guidelines with
respect to pricing, risk management, control of aggregate catastrophe exposures,
capital, investments and support operations.  Management generally
monitors and evaluates the financial performance of these operating segments
based upon their underwriting results.



Underwriting
results include earned premium less losses and loss adjustment expenses (“LAE”)
incurred, commission and brokerage expenses and other underwriting
expenses.  Underwriting results are measured using ratios, in
particular loss, commission and brokerage and other underwriting expense ratios,
which, respectively, divide incurred losses, commissions and brokerage and other
underwriting expenses by premiums earned.  The Company utilizes
inter-affiliate reinsurance, although such reinsurance does not materially
impact segment results, as business is generally reported within the segment in
which the business was first produced.  For selected financial
information regarding these segments, see ITEM 8, “Financial Statements and
Supplementary Data” -  Note 20 of Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements and ITEM 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operation - Segment Results”.

U.S. Reinsurance
Segment.The Company’s U.S. Reinsurance segment writes
property and casualty reinsurance, both treaty and facultative, through
reinsurance brokers as well as directly with ceding companies within the
U.S.  The Company targets certain brokers and, through the broker
market, specialty companies and small to medium sized standard lines
companies.  The Company also targets companies that place their
business predominantly in the direct market, including small to medium sized
regional ceding companies, and seeks to develop long-term relationships with
those companies.  In addition, the U.S. Reinsurance segment writes
portions of reinsurance programs for large, national insurance
companies.



In 2009,
$709.7 million of gross written premiums were attributable to U.S. treaty
property business, of which 67.4% was written on a pro rata basis and 32.6% was
written on an excess of loss basis.  Included in gross written
premiums for U.S. treaty property business was $84.6 million related to the new
crop hail line of business.  The Company’s property underwriters
utilize sophisticated underwriting methods to analyze and price property
business. The Company manages its exposures to catastrophe and other large
losses by limiting exposures on individual contracts and limiting aggregate
exposures to catastrophes in any particular zone and across contiguous
zones.



U.S.
treaty casualty business accounted for $364.8 million of gross written premiums
in 2009, of which 48.2% was written on a pro rata basis and 51.8% was written on
an excess of loss basis.  The treaty casualty business consists of
professional liability, D&O liability, workers’ compensation, excess and
surplus lines and other liability coverages.  As a result of the
complex technical nature of most of these risks, the Company’s casualty
underwriters tend to specialize by line of business and work closely with the
Company’s pricing actuaries.



The
Company’s facultative unit conducts business both through brokers and directly
with ceding companies, and consists of four underwriting units representing
property, casualty, specialty and national brokerage lines of
business.  Business is written from a facultative headquarters office
in New York and satellite offices in Boston, Chicago and Oakland.  In
2009, $40.2 million, $41.7 million and $15.9 million of gross written premiums
were attributable to the property, casualty and national brokerage lines of
business, respectively.



In 2009,
93.7%, 5.5% and 0.8% of the U.S. Reinsurance segment’s gross written premiums
were written in the broker reinsurance, direct reinsurance and insurance
markets, respectively.



U.S. Insurance
Segment.In
2009, the Company’s U.S. Insurance segment wrote $842.6 million of gross written
premiums, of which 86.6% was casualty and 13.4% was property.  Of the
total business written, Everest National wrote $649.5 million and Everest Re
wrote $43.4 million, principally targeting commercial property and casualty
business written through general agents with program
administrators.  Workers’ compensation business accounted for $263.6
million, or 31.3%, of the total business written, including $204.8 million, or
77.7%, of workers’ compensation business written in
California.  Everest Indemnity wrote $128.6 million, principally
excess and surplus lines insurance business written through surplus lines
brokers.  Everest Security wrote $21.1 million, principally
non-standard auto insurance written through retail agents.  With
respect to insurance written through general agents and surplus lines brokers,
the Company supplements the initial underwriting process with periodic claims,
underwriting and operational reviews and ongoing monitoring.



Specialty Underwriting
Segment.The Company’s Specialty Underwriting segment writes
A&H, marine, aviation and surety reinsurance.  The A&H unit
primarily focuses on health reinsurance of traditional indemnity plans,
self-insured health plans, accident coverages and specialty medical
plans.  The marine and aviation unit focuses on ceding companies with
a particular expertise in marine and aviation business.  The marine
and aviation business is written primarily through brokers and contains a
significant international component written primarily through the London market.
Surety business consists mainly of reinsurance of contract surety
bonds.







In 2009,
gross written premiums of the A&H unit totaled $84.1 million, primarily
written through brokers.



The
marine and aviation unit’s 2009 gross written premiums totaled $107.8 million,
substantially all of which was written on a treaty basis and sourced through
reinsurance brokers.  Of the marine and aviation gross written
premiums in 2009, marine treaties represented 79.8% and consisted mainly of hull
and cargo coverage.  In 2009, the marine unit’s premiums were written
55.0% on a pro rata basis and 45.0% on an excess of loss basis.  Of
the marine and aviation gross written premiums in 2009, aviation premiums
accounted for 20.2% and included reinsurance of airline and general aviation
risks.  In 2009, the aviation unit's premiums were written 84.9% on a
pro rata basis and 15.1% on an excess of loss basis.



In 2009,
gross written premiums of the surety unit totaled $42.9 million, 99.3% of which
was written on a pro rata basis.  Most of the portfolio is reinsurance
of contract surety bonds written directly with ceding companies, with the
remainder being trade credit reinsurance, mostly in international
markets.



International
Segment.The Company’s International segment focuses on
opportunities in the international reinsurance markets.  The Company
targets several international markets, including: Canada, with a branch in
Toronto; Asia, with a branch in Singapore; and Latin America, Africa and the
Middle East, which business is serviced from Everest Re’s Miami and New Jersey
offices.  The Company also writes from New Jersey “home-foreign”
business, which provides reinsurance on the international portfolios of U.S.
insurers.  Of the Company’s 2009 international gross written premiums,
84.1% represented property business, while 15.9% represented casualty
business.  As with its U.S. operations, the Company’s International
segment focuses on financially sound companies that have strong management and
underwriting discipline and expertise.  Of the Company’s international
business, 70.3% was written through brokers, with 29.7% written directly with
ceding companies.



Gross
written premiums of the Company’s Canadian branch totaled $162.7 million in 2009
and consisted of 29.6% of pro rata property business, 28.6% of excess property
business, 9.5% of pro rata casualty business and 32.3% of excess casualty
business.  Of the Canadian gross written premiums, 79.7% consisted of
treaty reinsurance, while 20.3% was facultative reinsurance.



The
Company’s Singapore branch covers the Asian markets and accounted for $222.0
million of gross written premiums in 2009 and consisted of 61.5% of pro rata
property business, 31.7% of excess property business, 5.1% of pro rata casualty
business and 1.7% of excess casualty business.



International
business written out of Everest Re’s Miami and New Jersey offices accounted for
$699.6 million of gross written premiums in 2009 and consisted of 69.4% of pro
rata treaty property business, 9.6% of pro rata treaty casualty business, 14.3%
of excess treaty property business, 3.0% of excess treaty casualty business and
3.7% of facultative property and casualty business.  Of this
international business, 64.0% was sourced from Latin America, 21.3% was sourced
from the Middle East, 8.2% was sourced from Africa and 6.0% was home-foreign
business.



Bermuda
Segment.The Company’s Bermuda segment writes property and
casualty insurance and reinsurance through Bermuda Re and property and casualty
reinsurance through its UK branch.  In 2009, Bermuda Re had gross
written premiums of $290.4 million, virtually all of which was treaty
reinsurance.



In 2009,
the UK branch of Bermuda Re wrote $504.4 million of gross treaty reinsurance
premium consisting of 41.7% of pro rata property business, 22.6% of excess
property business, 14.5% of pro rata casualty business and 21.1% of excess
casualty business.



Geographic
Areas.The Company conducts its business in Bermuda, the U.S.
and a number of foreign countries.  For select financial information
about geographic areas, see ITEM 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary
Data” -  Note 20 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial
Statements.  Risks attendant to the foreign operations of the Company
parallel those attendant to the U.S. operations of the Company, with the primary
exception of foreign exchange risks.  For more information about the
risks, see ITEM 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
and Results of Operations – Safe Harbor Disclosure”.





Underwriting.

One of
the Company’s strategies is to "lead" as many of the reinsurance treaties it
underwrites as possible.  The Company leads on approximately
two-thirds of its treaty reinsurance business as measured by
premium.  The lead reinsurer on a treaty generally accepts one of the
largest percentage shares of the treaty and is in the strongest position to
negotiate price, terms and conditions.  Management believes this
strategy enables it to obtain more favorable terms and conditions on the
treaties on which it participates.  When the Company does not lead the
treaty, it may still suggest changes to any aspect of the treaty.  The
Company may decline to participate on a treaty based upon its assessment of all
relevant factors.



The
Company’s treaty underwriting process involves a team approach among the
Company’s underwriters, actuaries and claim staff.  Treaties are
reviewed for compliance with the Company’s general underwriting standards and
most larger treaties are subjected to detailed actuarial
analysis.  The actuarial models used in such analyses are tailored in
each case to the subject exposures and loss experience.  The Company
does not separately evaluate each of the individual risks assumed under its
treaties.  The Company does, however, evaluate the underwriting
guidelines of its ceding companies to determine their adequacy prior to entering
into a treaty.  The Company may also conduct underwriting, operational
and claim audits at the offices of ceding companies to monitor adherence to
underwriting guidelines.  Underwriting audits focus on the quality of
the underwriting staff, pricing and risk selection and rate monitoring over
time.  Claim audits may be performed in order to evaluate the client’s
claims handling abilities and practices.



The
Company’s facultative underwriters operate within guidelines specifying
acceptable types of risks, limits and maximum risk
exposures.  Specified classes of large premium U.S. risks are referred
to Everest Re’s New York facultative headquarters for specific review before
premium quotations are given to clients.  In addition, the Company’s
guidelines require certain types of risks to be submitted for review because of
their aggregate limits, complexity or volatility, regardless of premium amount
on the underlying contract.  Non-U.S. risks exhibiting similar
characteristics are reviewed by senior managers within the involved
operations.



The
Company’s insurance operations principally write casualty coverages for
homogeneous risks through select program managers.  These programs are
evaluated based upon actuarial analysis and the program manager’s
capabilities.  The Company’s rates, forms and underwriting guidelines
are tailored to specific risk types.  The Company’s underwriting,
actuarial, claim and financial functions work closely with its program managers
to establish appropriate underwriting and processing guidelines as well as
appropriate performance monitoring mechanisms.



Risk
Management of Underwriting and Retrocession Arrangements



Underwriting Risk and
Accumulation Controls.Each segment and
business unit manages its underwriting risk in accordance with established
guidelines. These guidelines place dollar limits on the amount of business that
can be written based on a variety of factors, including ceding company profile,
line of business, geographic location and risk hazards. In each case, the
guidelines permit limited exceptions, which must be authorized by the Company’s
senior management. Management regularly reviews and revises these guidelines in
response to changes in business unit market conditions, risk versus reward
analyses and the Company’s enterprise and underwriting risk management
processes.



The
operating results and financial condition of the Company can be adversely
affected by catastrophe and other large losses. The Company manages its exposure
to catastrophes and other large losses by:



·selective
      underwriting practices;



·diversifying
      its risk portfolio by geographic area and by types and classes of
      business;



·limiting
      its aggregate catastrophe loss exposure in any particular geographic zone
      and contiguous zones;



·purchasing
      reinsurance and/or retrocessional protection to the extent that such
      coverage can be secured cost-effectively. See “Reinsurance and
      Retrocession Arrangements”.





Like
other insurance and reinsurance companies, the Company is exposed to multiple
insured losses arising out of a single occurrence, whether a natural event, such
as a hurricane or an earthquake, or other catastrophe, such as an explosion at a
major factory.  A large catastrophic event can be expected to generate
insured losses to multiple reinsurance treaties, facultative certificates and
across lines of business.



The
Company focuses on potential losses that could result from any single event or
series of events as part of its evaluation and monitoring of its aggregate
exposures to catastrophic events. Accordingly, the Company employs various
techniques to estimate the amount of loss it could sustain from any single
catastrophic event in various geographic areas. These techniques range from
deterministic approaches, such as tracking aggregate limits exposed in
catastrophe-prone zones and applying historic damage factors, to modeled
approaches that attempt to scientifically measure catastrophe loss exposure
using sophisticated Monte Carlo simulation techniques that forecast frequency
and severity of expected losses on a probabilistic basis.



No single
computer model or group of models is currently capable of projecting the amount
and probability of loss in all global geographic regions in which the Company
conducts business. In addition, the form, quality and granularity of
underwriting exposure data furnished by ceding companies is not uniformly
compatible with the data requirements for the Company’s licensed models, which
adds to the inherent imprecision in the potential loss projections. Further, the
results from multiple models and analytical methods must be combined and
interpolated to estimate potential losses by and across business
units.  Also, while most models have been updated to better
incorporate factors that contributed to unprecedented industry storm losses in
2004 and 2005, such as flood, storm surge and demand surge, catastrophe model
projections are inherently imprecise.  In addition, uncertainties with
respect to future climatic patterns and cycles add to the already significant
uncertainty of loss projections from models using historic long term frequency
and severity data.



Nevertheless,
when combined with traditional risk management techniques and sound underwriting
judgment, catastrophe models are a useful tool for underwriters to price
catastrophe exposed risks and for providing management with quantitative
analyses with which to monitor and manage catastrophic risk exposures by zone
and across zones for individual and multiple events.



Projected
catastrophe losses are generally summarized in terms of the probable maximum
loss (“PML”).  The Company defines PML as its anticipated loss, taking
into account contract terms and limits, caused by a single catastrophe affecting
a broad contiguous geographic area, such as that caused by a hurricane or
earthquake.  The PML will vary depending upon the modeled simulated
losses and the make-up of the in force book of business.  The
projected severity levels are described in terms of “return periods”, such as
“100-year events” and “250-year events”.  For example, a 100-year PML
is the estimated loss from a single event which has a 1% probability of being
exceeded in a twelve month period.  Conversely, it corresponds to a
99% probability that the loss from a single event will fall below the indicated
PML.  It is important to note that PMLs are
estimates.  Modeled events are hypothetical events produced by a
stochastic model.  As a result, there can be no assurance that any
actual event will align with the modeled event or that actual losses from events
similar to the modeled events will not vary materially from the modeled event
PML.



From an
enterprise risk management perspective, management sets limits on the levels of
catastrophe loss exposure the Company may underwrite.  The limits are
revised periodically based on a variety of factors, including but not limited to
the Company’s financial resources and expected earnings and risk/reward analyses
of the business being underwritten.



Management
estimated that the projected economic loss from its largest 100-year event in a
given zone does not exceed 10% of its projected 2010 shareholders’
equity.  Economic loss is the gross PML reduced by estimated
reinstatement premiums to renew coverage and income taxes.  The impact
of income taxes on the PML depends on the distribution of the losses by
corporate entity, which is also affected by inter-affiliate
reinsurance.  Management also monitors and controls its largest PMLs
at multiple points along the loss distribution curve, such as loss amounts at
the 20, 50, 100, 250, 500 and 1,000 year return periods.  This process
enables management to identify and control exposure accumulations and to
integrate such exposures into enterprise risk, underwriting and capital
management decisions.





The
Company’s catastrophe loss projections, segmented by risk zones, are updated
quarterly and reviewed as part of a formal risk management review process. The
table below reflects the Company’s gross PMLs at various return times for its
top three zones/perils (as ranked by the largest 1 in 100 year events) based on
loss projection data as of January 1, 2010:

While the
Company considers purchasing corporate level retrocessional protection by
evaluating the underlying exposures in comparison to the availability of
cost-effective protection, there was no such retrocessional coverage in place at
January 1, 2010.  The Company continues to evaluate the availability
and cost of various retrocessional products and loss mitigation approaches in
the marketplace.



The
Company believes that its methods of monitoring, analyzing and managing
catastrophe exposures provide a credible risk management framework, which are
integrated with its enterprise risk management, underwriting and capital
management plans.  However, there is much uncertainty and imprecision
inherent in the catastrophe models and the catastrophe loss estimation process
generally.  As a result, there can be no assurance that the Company
will not experience losses from individual events that exceed the PML or other
return period projections, perhaps by a material amount.  Nor can
there be assurance that the Company will not experience events impacting
multiple zones, or multiple severe events that could, in the aggregate, exceed
the Company’s PML expectations by a significant amount.



Terrorism Risk.The
Company does not have significant exposure to losses from terrorism
risk.  While the Company writes some reinsurance contracts covering
events of terrorism, the Company’s risk management philosophy is to limit the
amount of coverage provided and specifically not provide terrorism coverage for
properties or in areas that may be considered a target for
terrorists.  Although providing terrorism coverage on reinsurance
contracts is negotiable, most insurance policies mandate inclusion of terrorism
coverage.  As a result, the Company is exposed to losses from
terrorism on its U.S. insurance book of business, particularly its workers’
compensation and property policies.  However, the Company generally
does not insure large corporations or corporate locations that represent large
concentrations of risk.



As a
result of its limited exposure, the Company does not believe the U.S. Terrorism
Risk Insurance Act of 2002 that was signed into law November 2002 and amended in
December 2005 and December 2007 has had or will have a significant impact on its
operations.







Reinsurance and Retrocession
Arrangements.The Company does not
typically purchase significant retrocessional coverage for specific reinsurance
business written, but it will do so when management deems it to be prudent
and/or cost-effective to reinsure a portion of the risks being
assumed.  The Company participates in “common account” retrocessional
arrangements for certain reinsurance treaties whereby a ceding company purchases
reinsurance for the benefit of itself and its reinsurers under one or more of
its reinsurance treaties.  Common account retrocessional arrangements
reduce the effect of individual or aggregate losses to all participating
companies, including the ceding company, with respect to the involved
treaties.



The
Company typically considers the purchase of reinsurance to cover insurance
program exposures written by the U.S. Insurance segment.  The type of
reinsurance coverage considered is dependent upon individual risk exposures,
individual program exposures, aggregate exposures by line of business, overall
segment and corporate wide exposures and the cost effectiveness of available
reinsurance.  The majority of reinsurance placed is with captives of
its general agents.  This arrangement is a mechanism designed to
enable general agents to share in the operating results of the placed
business.  Facultative reinsurance will typically be considered for
large individual exposures and quota share reinsurance will generally be
considered for entire programs of business.



The
Company also considers purchasing corporate level retrocessional protection
covering the potential accumulation of exposures.  Such consideration
includes balancing the underlying exposures against the availability of
cost-effective retrocessional protection.



All of
the Company’s reinsurance and retrocessional agreements transfer significant
reinsurance risk and therefore, are accounted for as reinsurance in accordance
with the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) guidance.





Claims.

Reinsurance
claims are managed by the Company’s professional claims staff whose
responsibilities include reviewing initial loss reports and coverage issues,
monitoring claims handling activities of ceding companies, establishing and
adjusting proper case reserves and approving payment of claims.  In
addition to claims assessment, processing and payment, the claims staff
selectively conducts comprehensive claim audits of both specific claims and
overall claim procedures at the offices of selected ceding
companies.  Insurance claims, except those relating to Mt. McKinley’s
business, are generally handled by third party claims service providers who have
limited authority and are subject to oversight by the Company’s professional
claims staff.







The
Company intensively manages its asbestos and environmental (“A&E”) exposures
through dedicated, centrally managed claim staffs for Mt. McKinley and Everest
Re. Both are staffed with experienced claim and legal professionals who
specialize in the handling of such exposures.  These units actively
manage each individual insured and reinsured account, responding to claim
developments with evaluations of the involved exposures and adjustment of
reserves as appropriate.  Specific or general claim developments that
may have material implications for the Company are regularly communicated to
senior management, actuarial, legal and financial areas.  Senior
management and claim management personnel meet at least quarterly to review the
Company’s overall reserve positions and make changes, if
appropriate.  The Company continually reviews its internal processing,
communications and analytics, seeking to enhance the management of its A&E
exposures, in particular in regard to changes in asbestos claims and
litigation.



Reserves
for Unpaid Property and Casualty Losses and LAE.

Significant
periods of time may elapse between the occurrence of an insured loss, the
reporting of the loss to the insurer and the reinsurer and the payment of that
loss by the insurer and subsequent payments to the insurer by the
reinsurer.  To recognize liabilities for unpaid losses and LAE,
insurers and reinsurers establish reserves, which are balance sheet liabilities
representing estimates of future amounts needed to pay reported and unreported
claims and related expenses for losses that have already
occurred.  Actual losses and LAE paid may deviate, perhaps
substantially, from such reserves.  To the extent reserves prove to be
insufficient to cover actual losses and LAE after taking into account available
reinsurance coverage, the Company would have to recognize such reserve
shortfalls and incur a charge to earnings, which could be material in the period
such recognition takes place.  See ITEM 7, “Management’s Discussion
and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Loss and LAE
Reserves”.



As part
of the reserving process, insurers and reinsurers evaluate historical data and
trends and make judgments as to the impact of various factors such as
legislative and judicial developments that may affect future claim amounts,
changes in social and political attitudes that may increase loss exposures and
inflationary and general economic trends. While the reserving process is
difficult and subjective for insurance companies, the inherent uncertainties of
estimating such reserves are even greater for the reinsurer, due primarily to
the longer time between the date of an occurrence and the reporting of any
attendant claims to the reinsurer, the diversity of development patterns among
different types of reinsurance treaties or facultative contracts, the necessary
reliance on the ceding companies for information regarding reported claims and
differing reserving practices among ceding companies. In addition, trends that
have affected development of liabilities in the past may not necessarily occur
or affect liability development in the same manner or to the same degree in the
future.  As a result, actual losses and LAE may deviate, perhaps
substantially, from estimates of reserves reflected in the Company's
consolidated financial statements.



Like many
other property and casualty insurance and reinsurance companies, the Company has
experienced adverse loss development for prior accident years, which has led to
increases in losses and LAE reserves and corresponding charges to income in the
periods in which the adjustments were made.  There can be no assurance
that adverse development from prior years will not continue in the future or
that such adverse development will not have a material adverse effect on net
income.



Changes
in Historical Reserves.

The
following table shows changes in historical loss reserves for the Company for
1999 and subsequent years.  The table is presented on a GAAP basis
except that the Company’s loss reserves for its Canadian branch operations are
presented in Canadian dollars, the impact of which is not
material.  The top line of the table shows the estimated reserves for
unpaid losses and LAE recorded at each year end date.  The upper
(paid) portion of the table presents the related cumulative amounts paid through
each subsequent year end.  The lower (liability re-estimated) portion
shows the re-estimated amount of the original reserves as of the end of each
succeeding year.  The reserve estimates have been revised as more
information became known about the actual claims for which the reserves were
carried.  The cumulative (deficiency)/redundancy line represents the
cumulative change in estimates since the initial reserve was
established.  It is equal to the initial reserve less the latest
estimate of the ultimate liability.







Since the
Company has international operations, some of its loss reserves are established
in foreign currencies and converted to U.S. dollars for financial
reporting.  Changes in conversion rates from period to period impact
the U.S. dollar value of carried reserves and correspondingly, the cumulative
deficiency line of the table.  However, unlike other reserve
development that affects net income, the impact of currency translation is a
component of other comprehensive income.  To differentiate these two
reserve development components, the translation impacts for each calendar year
are reflected in the table of Effects on Pre-tax Income Resulting from Reserve
Re-estimates.



Each
amount other than the original reserves in the top half of the table below
includes the effects of all changes in amounts for prior periods. For example,
if a loss settled in 2002 for $100,000, was first reserved in 1999 at $60,000
and remained unchanged until settlement, the $40,000 deficiency (actual loss
minus original estimate) would affect the cumulative deficiency for each of the
years in 1999 through 2001.  Conditions and trends that have affected
development of the ultimate liability in the past are not indicative of future
developments.  Accordingly, it is not appropriate to extrapolate
future redundancies or deficiencies based on this table.

Every
year in the above table, except 2007, reflects a cumulative deficiency, also
referred to as adverse development, with the largest indicated cumulative
deficiency in 2001.  Three classes of business were the principal
contributors to those deficiencies: 1) the run-off of asbestos claims for both
direct and reinsurance business has significantly contributed to the cumulative
deficiencies for all years presented except 2007; 2) professional liability
reinsurance, general casualty reinsurance and workers’ compensation insurance
contributed to the deficiencies for years 1999 through 2003; and 3) property
catastrophe adverse development contributed to the deficiency for
2005.



In 2007,
the Company completed a detailed study of its asbestos experience and its
cedants’ asbestos exposures and also considered industry trends.  The
Company’s Claims Department undertook a contract by contract analysis of its
direct business and projected those findings to its assumed reinsurance
business.  The Company’s actuaries utilized nine methodologies to
project its potential ultimate liabilities including projections based on
internal data and assessments, extrapolations of non-public and publicly
available data for the Company’s cedants and benchmarking against industry data
and experience.  As a result of the study, the Company increased its
gross reinsurance asbestos reserves by $250.0 million and increased its gross
direct asbestos reserves by $75.0 million.  These reserve increases,
as well as adverse development on asbestos in prior years, have a significant
impact on the cumulative deficiencies.  Subsequent to the study, the
Company’s loss activity has been in line with expectations per the reserves
established at December 31, 2007.  The Company’s A&E reserves
represent management’s best estimate of the ultimate liability, however, there
can be no assurance that ultimate loss payments will not exceed such reserves,
perhaps by a significant amount.  No additional gross reserve
strengthening was made in 2009 and 2008.



In the
professional liability reinsurance class, the late 1990s and early 2000s saw a
proliferation of claims relating to bankruptcies and other corporate, financial
and/or management improprieties.  This resulted in an increase in the
frequency and severity of claims under the professional liability policies
reinsured by the Company.  In the general casualty area, the Company
has experienced claim frequency and severity greater than expected in the
Company’s pricing and reserving assumptions, particularly for accident years
1999 and 2000.



In the
workers’ compensation insurance class, the majority of which was written in
California, the Company has experienced adverse development primarily for
accident years 2001 and 2002 due to higher than expected claim frequency and
severity.  As a result of significant growth in this book of business
in a challenging business environment, the Company’s writings in this class were
subject to more relative variability than in some of its established and/or
stable lines of business.  Although cumulative results through 2009
continue to be quite profitable for this book of business, there was some
deterioration in claim frequency and severity related to accident years 2001 and
2002.



The
adverse development on the 2008 outstanding reserves was primarily attributable
to foreign exchange rate movements resulting in an increase in the U.S. dollar
reserves.  In addition, the Company experienced adverse development on
liability exposures for sub-prime for accident years 2006-2008 and contractors
liability exposures for accident years 2001-2005.  The contractor
liability exposures are currently in run-off.  The Company also
experienced adverse development on property lines but was offset by favorable
development on other casualty lines.



The
Company’s loss and LAE reserves represent management’s best estimate of the
ultimate liability.  While there can be no assurance that these
reserves will not need to be increased in the future, management believes that
the Company’s existing reserves and reserving methodologies reduce the
likelihood that any such increases would have a material adverse effect on the
Company’s financial condition, results of operations or cash
flows.  These statements regarding the Company’s loss reserves are
forward looking statements within the meaning of the U.S. federal securities
laws and are intended to be covered by the safe harbor provisions contained
therein.  See ITEM 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Safe Harbor
Disclosure”.





The
following table is derived from the Ten Year GAAP Loss Development Table above
and summarizes the effect of reserve re-estimates, net of reinsurance, on
calendar year operations by accident year for the same ten year period ended
December 31, 2009.  Each column represents the amount of net reserve
re-estimates made in the indicated calendar year and shows the accident years to
which the re-estimates are applicable.  The amounts in the total
accident year column on the far right represent the cumulative reserve
re-estimates for the indicated accident years.



Since the
Company has operations in many countries, part of the Company’s loss and LAE
reserves are in foreign currencies and translated to U.S. dollars for each
reporting period.  Fluctuations in the exchange rates for the
currencies, period over period, affect the U.S. dollar amount of outstanding
reserves.  The translation adjustment line at the bottom of the table
eliminates the impact of the exchange fluctuations from the reserve
re-estimates.

The
reserve development by accident year reflected in the above table was generally
the result of the same factors described above that caused the deficiencies
shown in the Ten Year GAAP Loss Development Table. The unfavorable development
experienced in the 1999 and prior and 2000 accident years relates principally to
the previously discussed asbestos development.  Other business areas
contributing to adverse development were casualty reinsurance, including
professional liability classes and workers’ compensation insurance, where, in
retrospect, the Company’s initial estimates of losses were underestimated
principally as the result of unanticipated variability in the underlying
exposures.  The favorable development for accident years 2003 through
2004 relates primarily to favorable experience with respect to property
reinsurance business.  In addition, casualty reinsurance has reflected
favorable development for accident years 2003 to 2006.  The
unfavorable development experienced in the 2006 accident year was principally
due to reserve increases for one credit insurance program, which is in
run-off.







The
Company’s loss reserving methodologies continuously monitor the emergence of
loss and loss development trends, seeking, on a timely basis, to both adjust
reserves for the impact of trend shifts and to factor the impact of such shifts
into the Company’s underwriting and pricing on a prospective basis.



The
following table presents a reconciliation of beginning and ending reserve
balances for the periods indicated on a GAAP basis:

      amounts may not reconcile due to rounding.)



Prior
years’ reserves increased by $128.8 million, $34.9 million and $206.5 million
for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007,
respectively.  The increase for 2009 was attributable to a $59.0
million increase in the insurance business, primarily contractors’ liability
exposure, and $69.8 million in the reinsurance business, in both domestic and
international, as a result of increased reserves on sub-prime exposures and
property, partially offset by favorable development in casualty.



The
increase for 2008 was primarily due to $85.3 million of reserve development for
a run-off auto loan credit insurance program and a $32.6 million adverse
arbitration decision; partially offset by net favorable development on the
remainder of the Company’s reserves.



The 2007
prior years’ reserves increase of $206.5 million was attributable to $387.5
million of adverse development on A&E reserves, partially offset by
favorable development on attritional (non-catastrophe, non-A&E)
reserves.  The increase in the A&E reserves was primarily due to
an extensive in-house study conducted by the Company’s actuarial and claim
units.



Reserves
for Asbestos and Environmental Losses and LAE.

At
December 31, 2009, the Company’s gross reserves for A&E claims represented
7.1% of its total reserves.  The Company’s A&E liabilities stem
from Mt. McKinley’s direct insurance business and Everest Re’s assumed
reinsurance business.  There are significant uncertainties in
estimating the amount of the Company’s potential losses from A&E claims and
ultimate values cannot be estimated using traditional reserving
techniques.  See ITEM 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Asbestos and Environmental
Exposures” and Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” - Note 3 of
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.



Mt.
McKinley’s book of direct A&E exposed insurance policies is relatively small
and homogenous.  It arises from a limited period, from 1978 to
1984.  The book was principally excess liability, thereby limiting
exposure analysis to a limited number of policies and forms.  As a
result of this focused structure, the Company believes that it is able to
comprehensively analyze its exposures, allowing it to identify, analyze and
actively monitor those claims which have unusual exposure, including policies on
which it may be exposed to pay expenses in addition to policy limits or on which
non-products coverage may be contended.





The
Company endeavors to actively engage with every insured account posing
significant potential asbestos exposure to Mt. McKinley.  Such
engagement can take the form of pursuing a final settlement, negotiation,
litigation, or the monitoring of claim activity under Settlement in Place
(“SIP”) agreements.  SIP agreements generally condition an insurer’s
payment upon the actual claim experience of the insured and may have annual
payment caps or other measures to control the insurer’s payments.  The
Company’s Mt. McKinley operation is currently managing eight SIP agreements,
three of which were executed prior to the acquisition of Mt. McKinley in
2000.  The Company’s preference with respect to coverage settlements
is to execute settlements that call for a fixed schedule of payments, because
such settlements eliminate future uncertainty.



The
Company has significantly enhanced its classification of insureds by exposure
characteristics over time, as well as its analysis by insured for those it
considers to be more exposed or active.  Those insureds identified as
relatively less exposed or active are subject to less rigorous, but still active
management, with an emphasis on monitoring those characteristics, which may
indicate an increasing exposure or levels of activity.  The Company
continually focuses on further enhancement of the detailed estimation processes
used to evaluate potential exposure of policyholders, including those that may
not have reported significant A&E losses.



Everest
Re’s book of assumed A&E reinsurance is relatively concentrated within a
limited number of contracts and for a limited period, from 1977 to
1984.  Because the book of business is relatively concentrated and the
Company has been managing the A&E exposures for many years, its claim staff
is familiar with the ceding companies that have generated most of these
liabilities in the past and which are therefore most likely to generate future
liabilities.  The Company’s claim staff has developed familiarity both
with the nature of the business written by its ceding companies and the claims
handling and reserving practices of those companies.  This level of
familiarity enhances the quality of the Company’s analysis of its exposure
through those companies.  As a result, the Company believes that it
can identify those claims on which it has unusual exposure, such as non-products
asbestos claims, for concentrated attention.  However, in setting
reserves for its reinsurance liabilities, the Company relies on claims data
supplied, both formally and informally by its ceding companies and
brokers.  This furnished information is not always timely or accurate
and can impact the accuracy and timeliness of the Company’s ultimate loss
projections.



The
following table summarizes the composition of the Company’s total reserves for
A&E losses, gross and net of reinsurance, for the periods
indicated:

Additional
losses, including those relating to latent injuries and other exposures, which
are as yet unrecognized, the type or magnitude of which cannot be foreseen by
either the Company or the industry, may emerge in the future. Such future
emergence could have material adverse effects on the Company’s future financial
condition, results of operations and cash flows.





Future
Policy Benefit Reserves.

The
Company wrote a limited amount of life and annuity reinsurance in its Bermuda
segment.  Future policy benefit liabilities for annuities are reported
at the accumulated fund balance of these contracts.  Reserves for
those liabilities include mortality provisions with respect to life and annuity
claims, both reported and unreported.  Actual experience in a
particular period may be worse than assumed experience and, consequently,
may adversely affect the Company’s operating results for that period. See ITEM
8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” - Note 1F of Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements.

Investments.

The board
of directors of each of the Company’s operating subsidiaries is responsible for
establishing investment policy and guidelines and, together with senior
management, for overseeing their execution.



The
Company’s principal investment objectives are to ensure funds are available to
meet its insurance and reinsurance obligations and to maximize after-tax
investment income while maintaining a high quality diversified investment
portfolio.  Considering these objectives, the Company views its
investment portfolio as having two components; 1) the investments needed to
satisfy outstanding liabilities and 2) investments funded by the Company’s
shareholders’ equity.



For
outstanding liabilities, the Company invests in taxable and tax-preferenced
fixed income securities with an average credit quality of Aa2, as rated by
Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. (“Moody’s”).  The Company’s mix of
taxable and tax-preferenced investments is adjusted periodically, consistent
with the Company’s current and projected operating results, market conditions
and the Company’s tax position.  This fixed maturity portfolio is
externally managed by an independent, professional investment manager using
portfolio guidelines approved by the Company.



Over the
past few years, the Company has allocated a portion of its investment portfolio
to include: 1) publicly traded equity securities and 2) private equity limited
partnership investments.  The objective of this portfolio
diversification is to enhance the risk-adjusted total return of the investment
portfolio by allocating a prudent portion of the portfolio to higher return
asset classes.  The Company limits its allocation to these asset
classes because of 1) the potential for volatility in their values and 2) the
impact of these investments on regulatory and rating agency capital adequacy
models.  The Company adjusts its allocation to these investments based
upon market conditions.  As a result of the dramatic slowdown in the
global economy and the liquidity crisis affecting the financial markets, the
Company significantly reduced its exposure to public equities during the fourth
quarter of 2008 and has increased its exposure to equities in the latter part of
2009 as financial markets improved.   At December 31, 2009, the
market or fair value of investments in equity and limited partnership securities
approximated 15% of shareholders’ equity, a decrease of 1 point from 16% of
shareholders’ equity at December 31, 2008.





The
duration of an investment is based on the maturity of the security but also
reflects the payment of interest and the possibility of early
prepayments.  The Company’s fixed income investment guidelines include
a general duration guideline.  This investment duration guideline is
established and periodically revised by management, which considers economic and
business factors, as well as the Company’s average duration of potential
liabilities, which, at December 31, 2009, is estimated at approximately 4.1
years, based on the estimated payouts of underwriting liabilities using standard
duration calculations.



The
duration of the fixed income portfolio at December 31, 2009 was 3.8 years, down
slightly from 4.1 years at prior year end.  The Company shortened the
duration of its portfolio in response to very low available yields, particularly
on securities with longer maturities.  As a result, the Company has
focused on purchasing high quality, shorter duration investments and investments
with floating rate yields.  These investments will be less subject to
decline in market value if interest rates rise in the future, as forecasted by
most investment analysts.



For each
currency in which the Company has established substantial loss and LAE reserves,
the Company seeks to maintain invested assets denominated in such currency in an
amount approximately equal to the estimated
liabilities.  Approximately 27% of the Company’s consolidated reserves
for losses and LAE and unearned premiums represent amounts payable in foreign
currencies.



The
turmoil in the financial markets and decline in the global economy resulted in a
reduction in the Company’s net investment income to $547.8 million in 2009
compared with $565.9 million and $682.4 million for the years ended December 31,
2008 and 2007, respectively.  The decline was primarily attributable
to lower yields available for new money and short-term
investments.  In addition, the limited partnership investments
continue to have losses, although not as large in 2009 as compared to
2008.



In
addition to the reductions in investment income, the economic and financial
market declines resulted in net realized capital losses for 2009 of $2.3
million.  These net realized capital losses resulted from $29.3
million of losses from sales of securities, and $13.2 million from
other-than-temporary impairments, partially offset by $40.2 million from fair
value adjustments.  The Company recognized realized losses of $695.8
million for the year ended December 31, 2008.  These net realized
capital losses resulted from the fair value re-measurement adjustments and
realized losses on the Company’s equity securities portfolio of $508.2 million,
other-than-temporary impairment losses from the Company’s fixed maturity
portfolio of $176.5 million and realized capital losses and fair value
re-measurement adjustments from fixed maturity investments of $11.1
million.  In contrast, the Company recognized realized gains of $86.3
million for the year ended December 31, 2007.



The
Company’s cash and invested assets totaled $14.9 billion at December 31, 2009,
which consisted of 93.7% fixed maturities and cash, of which 97.6% were
investment grade; 2.7% equity securities and 3.6% other invested assets. The
average maturity of fixed maturity securities was 6.9 years at December 31,
2009, and their overall duration was 3.8 years.



As of
December 31, 2009, the Company did not have any direct investments in commercial
real estate or direct commercial mortgages or any material holdings of
derivative investments (other than equity index put option contracts as
discussed in ITEM 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” - Note 4 of
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements) or securities of issuers that are
experiencing cash flow difficulty to an extent that the Company’s management
believes could threaten the issuer’s ability to meet debt service payments,
except where other-than-temporary impairments have been recognized.



The
Company’s investment portfolio includes structured commercial mortgage-backed
securities (“CMBS”) with a book value of $475.2 million and a market value of
$442.6 million.  CMBS securities comprising more than 80% of the
December 31, 2009 market value, are rated AAA by Standard & Poor’s Financial
Services LLC (“Standard & Poor’s”).  Furthermore, securities
comprising more than 97% of the market value are rated investment grade by
Standard & Poor’s.







At
December 31, 2009, the Company’s fixed maturity portfolio included $5.9 million
in book value of asset-backed securities with sub-prime mortgage loan exposure
and the market value of these investments was $4.6 million.  Sub-prime
mortgage loans generally represent loans made to borrowers with limited or
blemished credit records.

Financial
Strength Ratings.

The
following table shows the current financial strength ratings of the Company’s
operating subsidiaries as reported by A.M. Best, Standard & Poor’s and
Moody’s.  These ratings are based upon factors of concern to
policyholders and should not be considered an indication of the degree or lack
of risk involved in a direct or indirect equity investment in an insurance or
reinsurance company.



All of
the below-mentioned ratings are continually monitored and revised, if necessary,
by each of the rating agencies.  The ratings presented in the
following table were in effect as of February 28, 2010.



The
Company believes that its ratings, in general, are important to its operations
because they provide the Company’s customers and investors with an independent
assessment of the Company’s underlying financial strength using a scale that
provides for relative comparisons.  Strong financial ratings are
particularly important for reinsurance companies.  Ceding companies
must rely on their reinsurers to pay covered losses well into the
future.  As a result, a highly rated reinsurer is generally
preferred.

A.M. Best
states that the “A+” (“Superior”) rating is assigned to those companies which,
in its opinion, have a superior ability to meet their ongoing obligations to
policyholders based on A.M. Best’s comprehensive quantitative and qualitative
evaluation of a company’s balance sheet strength, operating performance and
business profile.  Standard & Poor’s states that the “A+” rating
is assigned to those insurance companies which, in its opinion, have strong
financial security characteristics with respect to their ability to pay under
its insurance policies and contracts in accordance with their
terms.  Moody’s states that insurance companies rated “Aa” offer
excellent financial security.  Together with the Aaa rated companies,
Aa rated companies constitute what are generally known as high-grade companies,
with Aa rated companies generally having somewhat larger long-term
risks.



Subsidiaries
other than Everest Re and Bermuda Re may not be rated by some or any rating
agencies because such ratings are not considered essential by the individual
subsidiary’s customers or because of the limited nature of the subsidiary’s
operations.  In particular, Mt. McKinley is not rated because it is in
run-off status.



Debt
Ratings.

The
following table shows the debt ratings by A.M. Best, Standard & Poor’s and
Moody’s of the Holdings’ senior notes due March 15, 2010 and October 15, 2014
and long term notes due May 1, 2067 and Everest Re Capital Trust II’s (“Capital
Trust II”) trust preferred securities due March 29, 2034, all of which are
considered investment grade.  Debt ratings are the rating agencies’
current assessment of the credit worthiness of an obligor with respect to a
specific obligation.

A debt
rating of “a-” is assigned by A.M. Best where the issuer, in A.M. Best’s
opinion, has a strong ability to meet the terms of the
obligation.  A.M. Best assigns a debt rating in the “bbb” range where
the issuer, in A.M. Best’s opinion, has adequate ability to meet the terms of
the obligation.  Standard & Poor’s assigns a debt





rating in
the “BBB” range to issuers that exhibit adequate protection parameters although
adverse economic conditions or changing circumstances are more likely to lead to
a weakened capacity of the obligor to meet its financial commitment on the
obligation.  According to Moody’s, a debt rating of “A3” is assigned
to issues that are considered upper-medium-grade obligations and subject to low
credit risk.  Obligations rated “Baa1” are subject to moderate credit
risk and are considered medium-grade and as such may possess certain speculative
characteristics.



Competition.

The
worldwide reinsurance and insurance businesses are highly competitive, as well
as cyclical by product and market.  As such, financial results tend to
fluctuate with periods of constrained availability, high rates and strong
profits followed by periods of abundant capacity, low rates and constrained
profitability.  Competition in the types of reinsurance and insurance
business that we underwrite is based on many factors, including the perceived
overall financial strength of the reinsurer or insurer, ratings of the reinsurer
or insurer by A.M. Best and/or Standard & Poor’s, underwriting expertise,
the jurisdictions where the reinsurer or insurer is licensed or otherwise
authorized, capacity and coverages offered, premiums charged, other terms and
conditions of the reinsurance and insurance business offered, services offered,
speed of claims payment and reputation and experience in lines written.
Furthermore, the market impact from these competitive factors related to
reinsurance and insurance is generally not consistent across lines of business,
domestic and international geographical areas and distribution
channels.



We
compete in the U.S., Bermuda and international reinsurance and insurance markets
with numerous global competitors.  Our competitors include independent
reinsurance and insurance companies, subsidiaries or affiliates of established
worldwide insurance companies, reinsurance departments of certain insurance
companies and domestic and international underwriting operations, including
underwriting syndicates at Lloyd’s.  Some of these competitors have
greater financial resources than we do and have established long term and
continuing business relationships, which can be a significant competitive
advantage.  In addition, the lack of strong barriers to entry into the
reinsurance business and the potential for securitization of reinsurance and
insurance risks through capital markets provide additional sources of potential
reinsurance and insurance capacity and competition.









Worldwide
insurance and reinsurance market conditions continued to be very
competitive.  Generally, there was ample insurance and reinsurance
capacity relative to demand.  We noted, however, that in many markets
and lines during 2009, the rates of decline have slowed, pricing in some
segments was relatively flat and there was upward movement in some others,
particularly property catastrophe coverage.  Competition and its
effect on rates, terms and conditions vary widely by market and coverage yet
continues to be most prevalent in the U.S. casualty insurance and reinsurance
markets.  The U.S. insurance markets in which we participate were
extremely competitive as well, particularly in the workers’ compensation, public
entity and contractor sectors.



The
reinsurance industry has experienced a period of falling rates and volume,
particularly in the casualty lines of business.  Profit opportunities
have become generally less available over time; however, the unfavorable trends
appear to have abated somewhat.  We are now seeing smaller rate
declines, pockets of stability and some increases in some markets and for some
coverages.  Both the primary insurers and reinsurers incurred very
significant investment and catastrophe losses during 2008 resulting in capital
depletion and increased rating agency scrutiny.  Conversely in 2009,
the financial markets partially rebounded and catastrophe losses were low,
resulting in improved industry capital levels.  It is too early to
gauge the market impacts from these capital accumulations.



Rates in
the international markets have generally been more adequate than in the U.S.,
and we have seen some increases, particularly for catastrophe exposed
business.  We have grown our business in the Middle East, Latin
America and Asia.  We are expanding our international reach with the
opening of a new office in Brazil to capitalize on the recently expanded
opportunity for professional reinsurers in that market and on the economic
growth expected for Brazil in the future.



The 2009
renewal rates, particularly for property catastrophe and retrocessional covers
and in international markets, were generally firmer compared to a year
ago.



Overall,
we believe that current marketplace conditions offer profit opportunities for us
given our strong ratings, distribution system, reputation and
expertise.  We continue to employ our strategy of targeting business
that offers the greatest profit potential, while maintaining balance and
diversification in our overall portfolio.



Employees.

As of
February 1, 2010, the Company employed 863 persons.  Management
believes that employee relations are good.  None of the Company’s
employees are subject to collective bargaining agreements, and the Company is
not aware of any current efforts to implement such agreements.



Regulatory
Matters.

The
Company and its insurance subsidiaries are subject to regulation under the
insurance statutes of the various jurisdictions in which they conduct business,
including essentially all states of the U.S., Canada, Singapore, Brazil
(licensed in 2008), the United Kingdom, Ireland and Bermuda.  These
regulations vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and are generally designed to
protect ceding insurance companies and policyholders by regulating the Company’s
conduct of business, financial integrity and ability to meet its
obligations.  Many of these regulations require reporting of
information designed to allow insurance regulators to closely monitor the
Company’s performance.



Insurance Holding Company
Regulation.Under applicable U.S. laws and regulations, no
person, corporation or other entity may acquire a controlling interest in the
Company, unless such person, corporation or entity has obtained the prior
approval for such acquisition from the insurance commissioners of Delaware and
the other states in which the Company’s insurance subsidiaries are domiciled or
deemed domiciled, currently California and Georgia.  Under these laws,
“control” is presumed when any person acquires, directly or indirectly, 10% or
more of the voting securities of an insurance company.  To obtain the
approval of any change in control, the proposed acquirer must file an
application with the relevant insurance commissioner disclosing, among other
things, the background of the acquirer and that of its directors and officers,
the acquirer’s financial condition and its proposed changes in the management
and operations of the insurance company.  U.S. state regulators also
require prior notice or regulatory approval of material inter-affiliate
transactions within the holding company structure.





The
Insurance Companies Act of Canada requires prior approval by the Minister of
Finance of anyone acquiring a significant interest in an insurance company
authorized to do business in Canada.  In addition, the Company is
subject to regulation by the insurance regulators of other states and foreign
jurisdictions in which it is authorized to do business.  Certain of
these states and foreign jurisdictions impose regulations regulating the ability
of any person to acquire control of an insurance company authorized to do
business in that jurisdiction without appropriate regulatory approval similar to
those described above.



Dividends.Under Bermuda law,
Group is prohibited from declaring or paying a dividend if such payment would
reduce the realizable value of its assets to an amount less than the aggregate
value of its liabilities and its issued share capital and share premium
(additional paid-in capital) accounts.  Group’s ability to pay
dividends and its operating expenses is partially dependent upon dividends from
its subsidiaries.  The payment of dividends by insurance subsidiaries
is limited under Bermuda law as well as the laws of the various U.S. states in
which Group’s insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries are domiciled or deemed
domiciled.  The limitations are generally based upon net income and
compliance with applicable policyholders’ surplus or minimum solvency and
liquidity requirements as determined in accordance with the relevant statutory
accounting practices.  Under Irish corporate and regulatory law,
Holdings Ireland and its subsidiaries are limited as to the dividends they can
pay based on retained earnings and net income (loss) and/or capital and minimum
solvency requirements.  As Holdings has outstanding debt obligations,
it is dependent upon dividends and other permissible payments from its operating
subsidiaries to enable it to meet its debt and operating expense obligations and
to pay dividends.



Under
Bermuda law, Bermuda Re and Everest International are unable to declare or make
payment of a dividend if they fail to meet their minimum solvency margin or
minimum liquidity ratio.  As long term insurers, Bermuda Re and
Everest International are also unable to declare or pay a dividend to anyone who
is not a policyholder unless, after payment of the dividend, the value of the
assets in their long term business fund, as certified by their approved actuary,
exceeds their liabilities for long term business by at least the $250,000
minimum solvency margin.  Prior approval of the Bermuda Monetary
Authority is required if Bermuda Re’s or Everest International’s dividend
payments would reduce their prior year end total statutory capital by 15.0% or
more.  At December 31, 2009, Bermuda Re and Everest International
exceeded their solvency and liquidity requirements by a significant
margin.



The
payment of dividends to Holdings by Everest Re is subject to limitations imposed
by Delaware law.  Generally, Everest Re may only pay dividends out of
its statutory earned surplus, which was $2,789.7 million at December 31, 2009,
and only after it has given 10 days prior notice to the Delaware Insurance
Commissioner.  During this 10-day period, the Commissioner may, by
order, limit or disallow the payment of ordinary dividends if the Commissioner
finds the insurer to be presently or potentially in financial
distress.  Further, the maximum amount of dividends that may be paid
without the prior approval of the Delaware Insurance Commissioner in any twelve
month period is the greater of (1) 10% of the insurer’s statutory surplus as of
the end of the prior calendar year or (2) the insurer’s statutory net income,
not including realized capital gains, for the prior calendar
year.  Accordingly, the maximum amount that will be available for the
payment of dividends by Everest Re in 2010 without triggering the requirement
for prior approval of regulatory authorities in connection with a dividend is
$456.6 million.



Insurance Regulation.NeitherBermuda Re nor Everest
International is admitted to do business in any jurisdiction in the
U.S.  Both conduct their insurance business from their offices in
Bermuda, and in the case of Bermuda Re, its branch in the UK.  In
Bermuda, Bermuda Re and Everest International are regulated by the Insurance Act
1978 (as amended) and related regulations (the “Act”).  The Act
establishes solvency and liquidity standards and auditing and reporting
requirements and subjects Bermuda Re and Everest International to the
supervision, investigation and intervention powers of the Bermuda Monetary
Authority.  Under the Act, Bermuda Re and Everest International, as
Class 4 insurers, are each required to maintain a principal office in Bermuda,
to maintain a minimum of $100 million in statutory capital and surplus, to have
an independent auditor approved by the Bermuda Monetary Authority conduct an
annual audit and report on their respective statutory and U.S. GAAP financial
statements and filings and to have an appointed loss reserve specialist (also
approved by the Bermuda Monetary Authority) review and report on their
respective loss reserves annually.





Bermuda
Re and Everest International are also registered under the Act as long term
insurers and are thereby authorized to write life and annuity
business.  As long term insurers, Bermuda Re and Everest International
are required to maintain $250,000 in statutory capital separate from their Class
4 minimum statutory capital and surplus, to maintain long term business funds,
to separately account for this business and to have an approved actuary prepare
a certificate concerning their long term business assets and liabilities to be
filed annually.  Bermuda Re’s operations in the United Kingdom and
worldwide are subject to regulation by the Financial Services Authority (the
“FSA”).  The FSA imposes solvency, capital adequacy, audit, financial
reporting and other regulatory requirements on insurers transacting business in
the United Kingdom.  Bermuda Re presently meets or exceeds all of the
FSA’s solvency and capital requirements.



U.S.
domestic property and casualty insurers, including reinsurers, are subject to
regulation by their state of domicile and by those states in which they are
licensed.  The regulation of reinsurers is typically focused on
financial condition, investments, management and operation.  The rates
and policy terms of reinsurance agreements are generally not subject to direct
regulation by any governmental authority.



The
operations of Everest Re’s foreign branch offices in Canada and Singapore are
subject to regulation by the insurance regulatory officials of those
jurisdictions.  Management believes that the Company is in compliance
with applicable laws and regulations pertaining to its business and
operations.



Everest
Indemnity, Everest National, Everest Security and Mt. McKinley are subject to
regulations similar to the U.S. regulations applicable to Everest
Re.  In addition, Everest National and Everest Security must comply
with substantial regulatory requirements in each state where they conduct
business.  These additional requirements include, but are not limited
to, rate and policy form requirements, requirements with regard to licensing,
agent appointments, participation in residual markets and claim handling
procedures.  These regulations are primarily designed for the
protection of policyholders.



Licenses.Everest Re is a
licensed property and casualty insurer and/or reinsurer in all states, the
District of Columbia and Puerto Rico.  In New Hampshire and Puerto
Rico, Everest Re is licensed for reinsurance only.  Such licensing
enables U.S. domestic ceding company clients to take credit for uncollateralized
reinsurance receivables from Everest Re in their statutory financial
statements.



Everest
Re is licensed as a property and casualty reinsurer in Canada. It is also
authorized to conduct reinsurance business in Singapore and
Brazil.  Everest Re can also write reinsurance in other foreign
countries. Because some jurisdictions require a reinsurer to register in order
to be an acceptable market for local insurers, Everest Re is registered as a
foreign insurer and/or reinsurer in the following countries: Argentina, Bolivia,
Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico, Peru,
Venezuela and the Philippines. Everest National is licensed in 47 states and the
District of Columbia.  Everest Indemnity is licensed in Delaware and
is eligible to write insurance on a surplus lines basis in 49 states, the
District of Columbia and Puerto Rico.  Everest Security is licensed in
Georgia and Alabama.  Mt. McKinley is licensed in Delaware and
California.  Bermuda Re and Everest International are registered as
Class 4 and long term insurers in Bermuda.  Bermuda Re is also an
authorized reinsurer in the U.K.



Periodic
Examinations.Everest Re, Everest
National, Everest Indemnity, Everest Security and Mt. McKinley are subject to
periodic financial examination (usually every three years) of their affairs by
the insurance departments of the states in which they are licensed, authorized
or accredited.  Everest Re’s, Everest National’s, Everest Security’s,
Everest Indemnity’s and Mt. McKinley’s last examination reports were as of
December 31, 2006.  None of these reports contained any material
findings or recommendations.  In addition, U.S. insurance companies
are subject to examinations by the various state insurance departments where
they are licensed concerning compliance with applicable conduct of business
regulations.



NAIC Risk-Based Capital
Requirements.The U.S. National Association of Insurance
Commissioners (“NAIC”) has developed a formula to measure the amount of capital
appropriate for a property and casualty insurance company to support its overall
business operations in light of its size and risk profile.  The major
categories of a company’s risk profile are its asset risk, credit risk, and
underwriting risk.  The standards are an effort by the NAIC to prevent
insolvencies, to ward off other financial difficulties of insurance companies
and to establish uniform regulatory standards among state insurance
departments.





Under the
approved formula, a company’s statutory surplus is compared to its risk based
capital (“RBC”).  If this ratio is above a minimum threshold, no
action is necessary.  Below this threshold are four distinct action
levels at which an insurer’s domiciliary state regulator can intervene with
increasing degrees of authority over an insurer as the ratio of surplus to RBC
decreases.  The mildest intervention requires an insurer to submit a
plan of appropriate corrective actions.  The most severe action
requires an insurer to be rehabilitated or liquidated.



Based on
their financial positions at December 31, 2009, Everest Re, Everest National,
Everest Indemnity and Everest Security significantly exceed the minimum
thresholds.  Since Mt. McKinley ceased writing new and renewal
insurance in 1985, its domiciliary regulator, the Delaware Insurance
Commissioner, has exempted Mt. McKinley from complying with RBC
requirements.



Various
proposals to change the RBC formula arise from time to time.  The
Company is unable to predict whether any such proposal will be adopted, the form
in which any such proposals would be adopted or the effect, if any, the adoption
of any such proposal or change in the RBC calculations would have on the
Company.



Tax
Matters.

The
following summary of the taxation of the Company is based on current
law.  There can be no assurance that legislative, judicial, or
administrative changes will not be enacted that materially affect this
summary.



Bermuda.Under Bermuda law, no
income, withholding or capital gains taxes are imposed upon Group and its
Bermuda subsidiaries.  Group and its Bermuda subsidiaries have
received an undertaking from the Minister of Finance in Bermuda that, in the
event of any taxes being imposed, Group and its Bermuda subsidiaries will be
exempt from taxation in Bermuda until March 2016.  Non-Bermuda
branches of Bermuda subsidiaries are subject to local taxes in the jurisdictions
in which they operate.



United
States.Group’s U.S. subsidiaries conduct business in and are
subject to taxation in the U.S.  Non-U.S. branches of U.S.
subsidiaries are subject to local taxation in the jurisdictions in which they
operate.  Should the U.S. subsidiaries distribute current or
accumulated earnings and profits in the form of dividends or otherwise, the
Company would be subject to withholding taxes.  Group and its Bermuda
subsidiaries believe that they have operated and will continue to operate their
businesses in a manner that will not cause them to generate income treated as
effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business within the
U.S.  On this basis, Group does not expect that it and its Bermuda
subsidiaries will be required to pay U.S. corporate income taxes other than
withholding taxes on certain investment income and premium excise
taxes.  If Group or its Bermuda subsidiaries were to become subject to
U.S. income tax, there could be a material adverse effect on the Company’s
financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.



United
Kingdom.Bermuda Re’s UK branch conducts business in the UK
and is subject to taxation in the UK.  Bermuda Re believes that it has
operated and will continue to operate its Bermuda operation in a manner which
will not cause them to be subject to UK taxation.  If Bermuda Re’s
Bermuda operations were to become subject to UK income tax, there could be a
material adverse impact on the Company’s financial condition, results of
operations and cash flow.



Ireland.Holdings
Ireland and Ireland Re conduct business in Ireland and are subject to taxation
in Ireland.
