ITEM 1.  BUSINESS



The Company.

Group, a Bermuda company, was established in 1999 as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Holdings.  On February 24, 2000, a corporate restructuring was completed and Group became the new parent holding company of Holdings.  Holdings continues to be the holding company for the Company’s U.S. based operations.  Holders of shares of common stock of Holdings automatically became holders of the same number of common shares of Group.  Prior to the restructuring, Group had no significant assets or capitalization and had not engaged in any business or prior activities other than in connection with the restructuring.



In connection with the February 24, 2000 restructuring, Group established a Bermuda-based reinsurance subsidiary, Everest Reinsurance (Bermuda), Ltd. (“Bermuda Re”), which commenced business in the second half of 2000.  Group also formed Everest Global Services, Inc., a Delaware subsidiary, to perform administrative functions for Group and its U.S. based and non-U.S. based subsidiaries.



On December 30, 2008, Group contributed Holdings to its Irish holding company, Holdings Ireland.  Holdings Ireland is a direct subsidiary of Group and was established to serve as a holding company for the U.S. and Irish reinsurance and insurance subsidiaries.



Holdings, a Delaware corporation, was established in 1993 to serve as the parent holding company of Everest Re, a Delaware property and casualty reinsurer formed in 1973.  Until October 6, 1995, Holdings was an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of The Prudential Insurance Company of America (“The Prudential”).  On October 6, 1995, The Prudential sold its entire interest in Holdings in an initial public offering.



Effective February 27, 2013, the Company established a new subsidiary, Mt. Logan Re Ltd. (“Mt. Logan Re”) and effective July 1, 2013, Mt. Logan Re established separate segregated accounts and issued non-voting redeemable preferred shares to capitalize the segregated accounts.  Accordingly, the financial position and operating results for Mt. Logan Re are consolidated with the Company and the non-controlling interests in Mt. Logan Re’s operating results and equity are presented as separate captions in the Company’s financial statements.



The Company’s principal business, conducted through its operating segments, is the underwriting of reinsurance and insurance in the U.S., Bermuda and international markets.  The Company had gross written premiums, in 2013, of $5.2 billion with approximately 76% representing reinsurance and 24% representing insurance.  Shareholders’ equity at December 31, 2013 was $7.0 billion.  The Company underwrites reinsurance both through brokers and directly with ceding companies, giving it the flexibility to pursue business based on the ceding company’s preferred reinsurance purchasing method.  The Company underwrites insurance principally through general agent relationships, brokers and surplus lines brokers.  Group’s active operating subsidiaries, excluding Mt. Logan Re and Mt. McKinley Insurance Company (“Mt. McKinley”), which is in run-off, are each rated A+ (“Superior”) by A.M. Best Company (“A.M. Best”), a leading provider of insurer ratings that assigns financial strength ratings to insurance companies based on their ability to meet their obligations to policyholders.

Reinsurance Industry Overview.

Reinsurance is an arrangement in which an insurance company, the reinsurer, agrees to indemnify another insurance or reinsurance company, the ceding company, against all or a portion of the insurance risks underwritten by the ceding company under one or more insurance contracts.  Reinsurance can provide a ceding company with several benefits, including a reduction in its net liability on individual risks or classes of risks, catastrophe protection from large and/or multiple losses and/or a reduction in operating leverage as measured by the ratio of net premiums and reserves to capital.  Reinsurance also provides a ceding company with additional underwriting capacity by permitting it to accept larger risks and write more business than would be acceptable relative to the ceding company’s financial resources.  Reinsurance does not discharge the ceding company from its liability to policyholders; rather, it reimburses the ceding company for covered losses.



There are two basic types of reinsurance arrangements:  treaty and facultative.  Treaty reinsurance obligates the ceding company to cede and the reinsurer to assume a specified portion of a type or category of risks insured by the ceding company.  Treaty reinsurers do not separately evaluate each of the individual risks assumed under their treaties, instead, the reinsurer relies upon the pricing and underwriting decisions made by the ceding company.  In facultative reinsurance, the ceding company cedes and the reinsurer assumes all or part of the risk under a single insurance contract. Facultative reinsurance is negotiated separately for each insurance contract that is reinsured.  Facultative reinsurance, when purchased by ceding companies, usually is intended to cover individual risks not covered by their reinsurance treaties because of the dollar limits involved or because the risk is unusual.



Both treaty and facultative reinsurance can be written on either a pro rata basis or an excess of loss basis.  Under pro rata reinsurance, the ceding company and the reinsurer share the premiums as well as the losses and expenses in an agreed proportion.  Under excess of loss reinsurance, the reinsurer indemnifies the ceding company against all or a specified portion of losses and expenses in excess of a specified dollar amount, known as the ceding company's retention or reinsurer's attachment point, generally subject to a negotiated reinsurance contract limit.



In pro rata reinsurance, the reinsurer generally pays the ceding company a ceding commission.  The ceding commission generally is based on the ceding company’s cost of acquiring the business being reinsured (commissions, premium taxes, assessments and miscellaneous administrative expense and may contain profit sharing provisions, whereby the ceding commission is adjusted based on loss experience).  Premiums paid by the ceding company to a reinsurer for excess of loss reinsurance are not directly proportional to the premiums that the ceding company receives because the reinsurer does not assume a proportionate risk.  There is usually no ceding commission on excess of loss reinsurance.



Reinsurers may purchase reinsurance to cover their own risk exposure. Reinsurance of a reinsurer's business is called a retrocession.  Reinsurance companies cede risks under retrocessional agreements to other reinsurers, known as retrocessionaires, for reasons similar to those that cause insurers to purchase reinsurance: to reduce net liability on individual or classes of risks, protect against catastrophic losses, stabilize financial ratios and obtain additional underwriting capacity.



Reinsurance can be written through intermediaries, generally professional reinsurance brokers, or directly with ceding companies.  From a ceding company's perspective, the broker and the direct distribution channels have advantages and disadvantages.  A ceding company's decision to select one distribution channel over the other will be influenced by its perception of such advantages and disadvantages relative to the reinsurance coverage being placed.




Business Strategy.

The Company’s business strategy is to sustain its leadership position within targeted reinsurance and insurance markets, provide effective management throughout the property and casualty underwriting cycle and thereby achieve an attractive return for its shareholders.  The Company’s underwriting strategies seek to capitalize on its i) financial strength and capacity, ii) global franchise, iii) stable and experienced management team, iv) diversified product and distribution offerings, v) underwriting expertise and disciplined approach, vi) efficient and low-cost operating structure and vii) effective enterprise risk management practices.



The Company offers treaty and facultative reinsurance and admitted and non-admitted insurance. The Company’s products include the full range of property and casualty reinsurance and insurance coverages, including marine, aviation, surety, errors and omissions liability (“E&O”), directors’ and officers’ liability (“D&O”), medical malpractice, other specialty lines, accident and health (“A&H”) and workers’ compensation.



The Company’s underwriting strategies emphasizes underwriting profitability over premium volume.  Key elements of this strategy include careful risk selection, appropriate pricing through strict underwriting discipline and adjustment of the Company’s business mix in response to changing market conditions.  The Company focuses on reinsuring companies that effectively manage the underwriting cycle through proper analysis and pricing of underlying risks and whose underwriting guidelines and performance are compatible with its objectives.



The Company’s underwriting strategies emphasizes flexibility and responsiveness to changing market conditions, such as increased demand or favorable pricing trends.  The Company believes that its existing strengths, including its broad underwriting expertise, global presence, strong financial ratings and substantial capital, facilitate adjustments to its mix of business geographically, by line of business and by type of coverage, allowing it to participate in those market opportunities that provide the greatest potential for underwriting profitability.  The Company’s insurance operations complement these strategies by accessing business that is not available on a reinsurance basis.  The Company carefully monitors its mix of business across all operations to avoid unacceptable geographic or other risk concentrations.



Marketing.

The Company writes business on a worldwide basis for many different customers and lines of business, thereby obtaining a broad spread of risk.  The Company is not substantially dependent on any single customer, small group of customers, line of business or geographic area.  For the 2013 calendar year, no single customer (ceding company or insured) generated more than 4.9% of the Company’s gross written premiums.  The Company believes that a reduction of business from any one customer would not have a material adverse effect on its future financial condition or results of operations.



Approximately 65%, 24% and 11% of the Company’s 2013 gross written premiums were written in the broker reinsurance, insurance markets and direct reinsurance, respectively.



The broker reinsurance market consists of several substantial national and international brokers and a number of smaller specialized brokers.  Brokers do not have the authority to bind the Company with respect to reinsurance agreements, nor does the Company commit in advance to accept any portion of a broker’s submitted business.  Reinsurance business from any ceding company, whether new or renewal, is subject to acceptance by the Company.  Brokerage fees are generally paid by reinsurers.  The Company’s ten largest brokers accounted for an aggregate of approximately 59% of gross written premiums in 2013.  The largest broker, Marsh and McLennan, accounts for approximately 21% of gross written premiums.  The second largest broker, Aon Benfield Re, accounted for approximately 19% of gross written premiums.  The Company believes that a reduction of business assumed from any one broker would not have a material adverse effect on the Company.



The direct reinsurance market remains an important distribution channel for reinsurance business written by the Company.  Direct placement of reinsurance enables the Company to access clients who prefer to place their reinsurance directly with reinsurers based upon the reinsurer’s in-depth understanding of the ceding company’s needs.






The Company’s insurance business writes direct business targeting commercial, property and casualty.  It also writes business through general agents, brokers and surplus lines brokers.  In 2013, Arrowhead General Insurance Agency accounted for approximately 5% of the Company’s gross written premium.  No other single general agent generated more than 3% of the Company’s gross written premiums.



The Company continually evaluates each business relationship, including the underwriting expertise and experience brought to bear through the involved distribution channel, performs analyses to evaluate financial security, monitors performance and adjusts underwriting decisions accordingly.



Segment Results.

The U.S. Reinsurance operation writes property and casualty reinsurance and specialty lines of business, including Marine, Aviation, Surety and A&H business, on both a treaty and facultative basis, through reinsurance brokers, as well as directly with ceding companies primarily within the U.S.  The International operation writes foreign property and casualty reinsurance through Everest Re’s branches in Canada and Singapore and through offices in Brazil, Miami and New Jersey. The Bermuda operation provides reinsurance and insurance to worldwide property and casualty markets through brokers and directly with ceding companies from its Bermuda office and reinsurance to the United Kingdom and European markets through its UK branch and Ireland Re.  The Insurance operation writes property and casualty insurance, including medical stop loss insurance, directly and through general agents, brokers and surplus lines brokers within the U.S. and Canada.  The Mt. Logan Re segment represents business written for the segregated accounts of Mt. Logan Re, which were formed on July 1, 2013.  The Mt. Logan Re business represents a diversified set of catastrophe exposures, diversified by risk/peril and across different geographical regions globally.



These segments, with the exception of Mt. Logan Re, are managed independently, but conform with corporate guidelines with respect to pricing, risk management, control of aggregate catastrophe exposures, capital, investments and support operations.  Management generally monitors and evaluates the financial performance of these operating segments based upon their underwriting results.  The Mt. Logan Re segment is managed independently and seeks to write a diverse portfolio of catastrophe risks for each segregated account to achieve desired risk and return criteria.



Underwriting results include earned premium less losses and loss adjustment expenses (“LAE”) incurred, commission and brokerage expenses and other underwriting expenses.  We measure our underwriting results using ratios, in particular loss, commission and brokerage and other underwriting expense ratios, which, respectively, divide incurred losses, commissions and brokerage and other underwriting expenses by premiums earned.



Mt. Logan Re’s business is sourced through operating subsidiaries of the Company; however, the activity is only reflected in the Mt. Logan Re segment.  For other inter-affiliate reinsurance, business is generally reported within the segment in which the business was first produced, consistent with how the business is managed.



Except for Mt. Logan Re, the Company does not maintain separate balance sheet data for its operating segments.  Accordingly, the Company does not review and evaluate the financial results of its operating segments based upon balance sheet data.



Underwriting results include earned premium less losses and loss adjustment expenses (“LAE”) incurred, commission and brokerage expenses and other underwriting expenses.  Underwriting results are measured using ratios, in particular loss, commission and brokerage and other underwriting expense ratios, which, respectively, divide incurred losses, commissions and brokerage and other underwriting expenses by premiums earned.  The Company utilizes inter-affiliate reinsurance, although such reinsurance does not materially impact segment results, as business is generally reported within the segment in which the business was first produced.  For selected financial information regarding these segments, see ITEM 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” -  Note 20 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and ITEM 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation - Segment Results”.

The following five year table presents the distribution of the Company’s gross written premiums by its segments:  U.S. Reinsurance, International, Bermuda and Insurance.  The premiums for each segment are further split between property and casualty business and, for reinsurance business, between pro rata or excess of loss business:

U.S. Reinsurance Segment.The Company’s U.S. Reinsurance segment writes property and casualty reinsurance and specialty lines of business, including Marine, Aviation, Surety and A&H business, on both a treaty and facultative basis, through reinsurance brokers, as well as directly with ceding companies within the U.S.  The marine and aviation business is written primarily through brokers and contains a significant international component. Surety business consists mainly of reinsurance of contract surety bonds.  The Company targets certain brokers and, through the broker market, specialty companies and small to medium sized standard lines companies.  The Company also targets companies that place their business predominantly in the direct market, including small to medium sized regional ceding companies, and seeks to develop long-term relationships with those companies.  In addition, the U.S. Reinsurance segment writes portions of reinsurance programs for large, national insurance companies.



In 2013, $1,047.1 million of gross written premiums were attributable to U.S. treaty property business, of which 51.0% was written on an excess of loss basis and 49.0% was written on a pro rata basis.  The Company’s property underwriters utilize sophisticated underwriting methods to analyze and price property business. The Company manages its exposures to catastrophe and other large losses by limiting exposures on individual contracts and limiting aggregate exposures to catastrophes in any particular zone and across contiguous zones.



U.S. treaty casualty business accounted for $460.3 million of gross written premiums in 2013, of which 66.6% was written on a pro rata basis and 33.4% was written on an excess of loss basis.  The treaty casualty business consists of professional liability, D&O liability, workers’ compensation, excess and surplus lines and other liability coverages.  As a result of the complex technical nature of most of these risks, the Company’s casualty underwriters tend to specialize by line of business and work closely with the Company’s pricing actuaries.



The Company’s facultative unit conducts business both through brokers and directly with ceding companies, and consists of three underwriting units representing property, casualty, and national brokerage lines of business.  Business is written from a facultative headquarters office in New York and satellite offices in Chicago and Oakland.  In 2013, $41.2 million, $47.8 million and $15.2 million of gross written premiums were attributable to the property, casualty and national brokerage lines of business, respectively.



The marine and aviation unit’s 2013 gross written premiums totaled $117.1 million, substantially all of which was written on a treaty basis and sourced through reinsurance brokers.  Of the marine and aviation gross written premiums in 2013, marine treaties represented 66.9% and consisted mainly of hull and cargo coverage.  In 2013, the marine unit’s premiums were written 48.1% on an excess of loss basis and 51.9% on a pro rata basis.  Of the marine and aviation gross written premiums in 2013, aviation premiums accounted for 33.1% and included reinsurance of airline and general aviation risks.  In 2013, the aviation unit's premiums were written 92.7% on a pro rata basis and 7.3% on an excess of loss basis.



In 2013, gross written premiums of the surety unit totaled $46.9 million, 93.2% of which was written on a pro rata basis.  Most of the portfolio is reinsurance of contract surety bonds written directly with ceding companies, with the remainder being trade credit reinsurance, mostly in international markets.



In 2013, gross written premium of the A&H reinsurance unit totaled $34.1 million, primarily written through brokers.



In 2013, 94.5% and 5.5% of the U.S. Reinsurance segment’s gross written premiums were written in the broker reinsurance and direct reinsurance markets, respectively.



International Segment.The Company’s International segment focuses on opportunities in the international reinsurance markets.  The Company targets several international markets, including: Canada, with a branch in Toronto; Asia, with a branch in Singapore; and Latin America, Brazil, Africa and the Middle East, which business is serviced from Everest Re’s Miami and New Jersey offices.  The Company also writes from New Jersey “home-foreign” business, which provides reinsurance on the international portfolios of U.S. insurers.  Of the Company’s 2013 international gross written premiums, 81.7% represented property business, while 18.3% represented casualty business.  As with its U.S. operations, the Company’s International segment focuses on financially sound companies that have strong management and underwriting discipline and






expertise.  Of the Company’s international business, 70.1% was written through brokers, with 29.9% written directly with ceding companies.



Gross written premiums of the Company’s Canadian branch totaled $169.1 million in 2013 and consisted of 33.6% of excess casualty business, 40.5% of excess property business, 18.2% of pro rata casualty business and 7.7% of pro rata property business.  Of the Canadian gross written premiums, 86.1% consisted of treaty reinsurance, while 13.9% was facultative reinsurance.



The Company’s Singapore branch covers the Asian markets and accounted for $278.1 million of gross written premiums in 2013 and consisted of 47.8% of pro rata property business, 49.0% of excess property business, 2.4% of pro rata casualty business and 0.8% of excess casualty business.



International business written out of Everest Re’s Miami and New Jersey offices accounted for $898.5 million of gross written premiums in 2013 and consisted of 58.7% of pro rata treaty property business, 21.7% of excess treaty property business, 10.8% of pro rata treaty casualty business, 3.6% of excess treaty casualty business and 5.2% of facultative property and casualty business.  Of this international business, 73.3% was sourced from Latin America, 11.6% was sourced from the Middle East, 7.0% was sourced from Africa and 8.1% was home-foreign business.



Bermuda Segment.The Company’s Bermuda segment writes property and casualty reinsurance through Bermuda Re and property and casualty reinsurance through its UK branch as well as through Ireland Re.  In 2013, Bermuda Re had gross written premiums of $425.1 million, virtually all of which was treaty reinsurance.



In 2013, the UK branch of Bermuda Re wrote $232.1 million of gross treaty reinsurance premium consisting of 47.7% of excess casualty business, 20.2% of pro rata property business, 22.0% of excess property business and 10.1% of pro rata casualty business.



In 2013, Ireland Re wrote $117.1 million of gross treaty reinsurance premium consisting of 45.1% of pro rata property business, 36.6% of excess property business, 9.2% of excess casualty business and 9.1% of pro rata casualty business.



Insurance Segment.The Insurance segment writes property and casualty insurance, including medical stop loss insurance, directly and through general agents, brokers and surplus lines brokers within the U.S. and Canada.  In 2013, the Company’s Insurance segment wrote $1,268.7 million of gross written premiums, of which 57.0% was casualty and 43.0% was property, principally targeting commercial property and casualty business.  Business written through general agents with program administrators represented 40.9% of the premium with the remainder written directly through the Company’s offices. Workers’ compensation business accounted for $369.6 million, or 29.1% of the total business written, including $299.3 million, or 81.0%, of workers’ compensation business written in California.  In addition, crop insurance business written was $324.7 million; professional liability business written was $204.5 million; A&H insurance business written was $83.6 million; other short-tail/package business written was $119.6 million; other liability business written was $98.7 million; and non-standard auto insurance business written through retail agents was $68.0 million.  With respect to insurance written through general agents and surplus lines brokers, the Company supplements the initial underwriting process with periodic claims, underwriting and operational reviews and ongoing monitoring.



Mt. Logan Re Segment.The Mt. Logan Re segment represents business written for the segregated accounts of Mt. Logan Re, which were formed on July 1, 2013.  The Mt. Logan Re business represents a diversified set of catastrophe exposures, diversified by risk/peril and across different geographical regions globally.  Mt. Logan Re’s business is sourced through operating subsidiaries of the Company; however, the activity is only reflected in the Mt. Logan Re segment.  For other inter-affiliate reinsurance, business is generally reported within the segment in which the business was first produced, consistent with how the business is managed. Gross written premium for 2013 was $20.2 million.


Geographic Areas.The Company conducts its business in Bermuda, the U.S. and a number of foreign countries.  For select financial information about geographic areas, see ITEM 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” -  Note 20 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.  Risks attendant to the foreign operations of the Company parallel those attendant to the U.S. operations of the Company, with the primary exception of foreign exchange risks.  For more information about the risks, see ITEM 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Safe Harbor Disclosure”.



Underwriting.

One of the Company’s strategies is to "lead" as many of the reinsurance treaties it underwrites as possible.  The Company leads on approximately two-thirds of its treaty reinsurance business as measured by premium.  The lead reinsurer on a treaty generally accepts one of the largest percentage shares of the treaty and is in the strongest position to negotiate price, terms and conditions.  Management believes this strategy enables it to obtain more favorable terms and conditions on the treaties on which it participates.  When the Company does not lead the treaty, it may still suggest changes to any aspect of the treaty.  The Company may decline to participate on a treaty based upon its assessment of all relevant factors.



The Company’s treaty underwriting process involves a team approach among the Company’s underwriters, actuaries and claim staff.  Treaties are reviewed for compliance with the Company’s general underwriting standards and most larger treaties are subjected to detailed actuarial analysis.  The actuarial models used in such analyses are tailored in each case to the subject exposures and loss experience.  The Company does not separately evaluate each of the individual risks assumed under its treaties.  The Company does, however, evaluate the underwriting guidelines of its ceding companies to determine their adequacy prior to entering into a treaty.  The Company may also conduct underwriting, operational and claim audits at the offices of ceding companies to monitor adherence to underwriting guidelines.  Underwriting audits focus on the quality of the underwriting staff, pricing and risk selection and rate monitoring over time.  Claim audits may be performed in order to evaluate the client’s claims handling abilities and practices.



The Company’s facultative underwriters operate within guidelines specifying acceptable types of risks, limits and maximum risk exposures.  Specified classes of large premium U.S. risks are referred to Everest Re’s New York facultative headquarters for specific review before premium quotations are given to clients.  In addition, the Company’s guidelines require certain types of risks to be submitted for review because of their aggregate limits, complexity or volatility, regardless of premium amount on the underlying contract.  Non-U.S. risks exhibiting similar characteristics are reviewed by senior managers within the involved operations.



The Company’s insurance operations principally write casualty coverages for homogeneous risks through select program managers.  These programs are evaluated based upon actuarial analysis and the program manager’s capabilities.  The Company’s rates, forms and underwriting guidelines are tailored to specific risk types.  The Company’s underwriting, actuarial, claim and financial functions work closely with its program managers to establish appropriate underwriting and processing guidelines as well as appropriate performance monitoring mechanisms.



Risk Management of Underwriting and Retrocession Arrangements



Underwriting Risk and Accumulation Controls.Each segment and business unit manages its underwriting risk in accordance with established guidelines. These guidelines place dollar limits on the amount of business that can be written based on a variety of factors, including ceding company profile, line of business, geographic location and risk hazards. In each case, the guidelines permit limited exceptions, which must be authorized by the Company’s senior management. Management regularly reviews and revises these guidelines in response to changes in business unit market conditions, risk versus reward analyses and the Company’s enterprise and underwriting risk management processes.




The operating results and financial condition of the Company can be adversely affected by catastrophe and other large losses. The Company manages its exposure to catastrophes and other large losses by:



·selective underwriting practices;



·diversifying its risk portfolio by geographic area and by types and classes of business;



·limiting its aggregate catastrophe loss exposure in any particular geographic zone and contiguous zones;



·purchasing reinsurance and/or retrocessional protection to the extent that such coverage can be secured cost-effectively. See “Reinsurance and Retrocession Arrangements”.



Like other insurance and reinsurance companies, the Company is exposed to multiple insured losses arising out of a single occurrence, whether a natural event, such as a hurricane or an earthquake, or other catastrophe, such as an explosion at a major factory.  A large catastrophic event can be expected to generate insured losses to multiple reinsurance treaties, facultative certificates and across lines of business.



The Company focuses on potential losses that could result from any single event or series of events as part of its evaluation and monitoring of its aggregate exposures to catastrophic events. Accordingly, the Company employs various techniques to estimate the amount of loss it could sustain from any single catastrophic event or series of events in various geographic areas. These techniques range from deterministic approaches, such as tracking aggregate limits exposed in catastrophe-prone zones and applying reasonable damage factors, to modeled approaches that attempt to scientifically measure catastrophe loss exposure using sophisticated Monte Carlo simulation techniques that forecast frequency and severity of expected losses on a probabilistic basis.



No single computer model or group of models is currently capable of projecting the amount and probability of loss in all global geographic regions in which the Company conducts business. In addition, the form, quality and granularity of underwriting exposure data furnished by ceding companies is not uniformly compatible with the data requirements for the Company’s licensed models, which adds to the inherent imprecision in the potential loss projections. Further, the results from multiple models and analytical methods must be combined and interpolated to estimate potential losses by and across business units.  Also, while most models have been updated to incorporate claims information from recent catastrophic events, catastrophe model projections are still inherently imprecise.  In addition, uncertainties with respect to future climatic patterns and cycles add to the already significant uncertainty of loss projections from models using historic long term frequency and severity data.



Nevertheless, when combined with traditional risk management techniques and sound underwriting judgment, catastrophe models are a useful tool for underwriters to price catastrophe exposed risks and for providing management with quantitative analyses with which to monitor and manage catastrophic risk exposures by zone and across zones for individual and multiple events.



Projected catastrophe losses are generally summarized in terms of the probable maximum loss (“PML”).  The Company defines PML as its anticipated loss, taking into account contract terms and limits, caused by a single catastrophe affecting a broad contiguous geographic area, such as that caused by a hurricane or earthquake.  The PML will vary depending upon the modeled simulated losses and the make-up of the in force book of business.  The projected severity levels are described in terms of “return periods”, such as “100-year events” and “250-year events”.  For example, a 100-year PML is the estimated loss to the current in-force portfolio from a single event which has a 1% probability of being exceeded in a twelve month period.  In other words, it corresponds to a 99% probability that the loss from a single event will fall below the indicated PML.  It is important to note that PMLs are estimates.  Modeled events are hypothetical events produced by a stochastic model.  As a result, there can be no assurance that any actual event will align with the modeled event or that actual losses from events similar to the modeled events will not vary materially from the modeled event PML.




From an enterprise risk management perspective, management sets limits on the levels of catastrophe loss exposure the Company may underwrite.  The limits are revised periodically based on a variety of factors, including but not limited to the Company’s financial resources and expected earnings and risk/reward analyses of the business being underwritten.



The Company may purchase reinsurance to cover specific business written or the potential accumulation or aggregation of exposures across some or all of its operations.  Reinsurance purchasing decisions consider both the potential coverage and market conditions including the pricing, terms, conditions and availability of coverage, with the aim of securing cost effective protection.  The amount of reinsurance purchased has varied over time, reflecting the Company’s view of its exposures and the cost of reinsurance.



Management estimates that the projected net economic loss from its largest 100-year event in a given zone represents approximately 11% of its projected 2014 shareholders’ equity.  Economic loss is the PML exposure, net of third party reinsurance and the noncontrolling interests of Mt. Logan Re, reduced by estimated reinstatement premiums to renew coverage and estimated income taxes.  The impact of income taxes on the PML depends on the distribution of the losses by corporate entity, which is also affected by inter-affiliate reinsurance.  Management also monitors and controls its largest PMLs at multiple points along the loss distribution curve, such as loss amounts at the 20, 50, 100, 250, 500 and 1,000 year return periods.  This process enables management to identify and control exposure accumulations and to integrate such exposures into enterprise risk, underwriting and capital management decisions.



The Company’s catastrophe loss projections, segmented by risk zones, are updated quarterly and reviewed as part of a formal risk management review process. The table below reflects the Company’s PML exposure, net of third party reinsurance and the noncontrolling interests of Mt. Logan Re, at various return times for its top three zones/perils (as ranked by the largest 1 in 100 year events) based on loss projection data as of January 1, 2014:

The projected net economic losses for the top three zones/perils scheduled above are as follows:

The Company believes that its methods of monitoring, analyzing and managing catastrophe exposures provide a credible risk management framework, which are integrated with its enterprise risk management, underwriting and capital management plans.  However, there is much uncertainty and imprecision inherent in the catastrophe models and the catastrophe loss estimation process generally.  As a result, there can be no assurance that the Company will not experience losses from individual events that exceed the PML or other return period projections, perhaps by a material amount.  Nor can there be assurance that the Company will not experience events impacting multiple zones, or multiple severe events that could, in the aggregate, exceed the Company’s PML expectations by a significant amount.






Terrorism Risk.The Company has limited exposure to losses from terrorism risk.  While the Company writes some reinsurance contracts covering terrorism, the Company’s risk management philosophy is to limit the amount of exposure by geographic region, and to strictly manage coverage for properties in areas that may be considered a target for terrorists.  Although providing terrorism coverage on reinsurance contracts is negotiable, most insurance policies mandate inclusion of terrorism coverage. As a result, the Company is exposed to losses from terrorism on its Insurance book of business, particularly its workers’ compensation and property policies.  However, the Insurance book generally does not insure large corporations or corporate locations that represent large concentrations of risk.



Because of the limited nature of terrorism exposure, the U.S. Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002 and its amendments do not have a significant impact on company operations.



Reinsurance and Retrocession Arrangements.The Company does not typically purchase significant retrocessional coverage for specific reinsurance business written, but it will do so when management deems it to be prudent and/or cost-effective to reinsure a portion of the risks being assumed.  The Company participates in “common account” retrocessional arrangements for certain reinsurance treaties whereby a ceding company purchases reinsurance for the benefit of itself and its reinsurers under one or more of its reinsurance treaties.  Common account retrocessional arrangements reduce the effect of individual or aggregate losses to all participating companies, including the ceding company, with respect to the involved treaties.



The Company typically considers the purchase of reinsurance to cover insurance program exposures written by the Insurance segment.  The type of reinsurance coverage considered is dependent upon individual risk exposures, individual program exposures, aggregate exposures by line of business, overall segment and corporate wide exposures and the cost effectiveness of available reinsurance.  Facultative reinsurance will typically be considered for large individual exposures and quota share reinsurance will generally be considered for entire programs of business.



The Company also considers purchasing corporate level retrocessional protection covering the potential accumulation of exposures.  Such consideration includes balancing the underlying exposures against the availability of cost-effective retrocessional protection.



All of the Company’s reinsurance and retrocessional agreements transfer significant reinsurance risk and therefore, are accounted for as reinsurance in accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) guidance.



At December 31, 2013, the Company had $540.9 million in reinsurance receivables with respect to both paid and unpaid losses ceded.  Of this amount, $145.4 million, or 26.9%, was receivable from C.V. Starr (Bermuda) (“C.V. Starr”); $95.3 million, or 17.6% was receivable from Federal Crop Insurance Company (“FCIC”); $43.9 million, or 8.1%, was receivable from Transatlantic Reinsurance Company (“Transatlantic”); $37.7 million, or 7.0% was receivable from Berkley Insurance Company (“Berkley”); and $27.4 million, or 5.1%, was receivable from Munich Reinsurance America Inc. (“Munich Re”).  The receivable from C.V. Starr is fully collateralized by a trust agreement.  No other retrocessionaire accounted for more than 5% of the Company’s receivables. Although management carefully selects its reinsurers, the Company is subject to credit risk with respect to its reinsurance because the ceding of risk to reinsurers does not relieve the Company of its liability to insureds or ceding companies.  See ITEM 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Financial Condition”.




Claims.

Reinsurance claims are managed by the Company’s professional claims staff whose responsibilities include reviewing initial loss reports and coverage issues, monitoring claims handling activities of ceding companies, establishing and adjusting proper case reserves and approving payment of claims.  In addition to claims assessment, processing and payment, the claims staff selectively conducts comprehensive claim audits of both specific claims and overall claim procedures at the offices of selected ceding companies.  Insurance claims, except those relating to Mt. McKinley’s business, are generally handled by third party claims service providers who have limited authority and are subject to oversight by the Company’s professional claims staff.



The Company intensively manages its asbestos and environmental (“A&E”) exposures through dedicated, centrally managed claim staffs for Mt. McKinley and Everest Re. Both are staffed with experienced claim and legal professionals who specialize in the handling of such exposures.  These units actively manage each individual insured and reinsured account, responding to claim developments with evaluations of the involved exposures and adjustment of reserves as appropriate.  Specific or general claim developments that may have material implications for the Company are regularly communicated to senior management, actuarial, legal and financial areas.  Senior management and claim management personnel meet at least quarterly to review the Company’s overall reserve positions and make changes, if appropriate.  The Company continually reviews its internal processing, communications and analytics, seeking to enhance the management of its A&E exposures, in particular in regard to changes in asbestos claims and litigation.



Reserves for Unpaid Property and Casualty Losses and LAE.

Significant periods of time may elapse between the occurrence of an insured loss, the reporting of the loss to the insurer and the reinsurer and the payment of that loss by the insurer and subsequent payments to the insurer by the reinsurer.  To recognize liabilities for unpaid losses and LAE, insurers and reinsurers establish reserves, which are balance sheet liabilities representing estimates of future amounts needed to pay reported and unreported claims and related expenses for losses that have already occurred.  Actual losses and LAE paid may deviate, perhaps substantially, from such reserves.  To the extent reserves prove to be insufficient to cover actual losses and LAE after taking into account available reinsurance coverage, the Company would have to recognize such reserve shortfalls and incur a charge to earnings, which could be material in the period such recognition takes place.  See ITEM 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Loss and LAE Reserves”.



As part of the reserving process, insurers and reinsurers evaluate historical data and trends and make judgments as to the impact of various factors such as legislative and judicial developments that may affect future claim amounts, changes in social and political attitudes that may increase loss exposures and inflationary and general economic trends. While the reserving process is difficult and subjective for insurance companies, the inherent uncertainties of estimating such reserves are even greater for the reinsurer, due primarily to the longer time between the date of an occurrence and the reporting of any attendant claims to the reinsurer, the diversity of development patterns among different types of reinsurance treaties or facultative contracts, the necessary reliance on the ceding companies for information regarding reported claims and differing reserving practices among ceding companies. In addition, trends that have affected development of liabilities in the past may not necessarily occur or affect liability development in the same manner or to the same degree in the future.  As a result, actual losses and LAE may deviate, perhaps substantially, from estimates of reserves reflected in the Company's consolidated financial statements.



Like many other property and casualty insurance and reinsurance companies, the Company has experienced adverse loss development for prior accident years, which has led to increases in losses and LAE reserves and corresponding charges to income (loss) in the periods in which the adjustments were made.  There can be no assurance that adverse development from prior years will not continue in the future or that such adverse development will not have a material adverse effect on net income (loss).



Changes in Historical Reserves.

The following table shows changes in historical loss reserves for the Company for 2003 and subsequent years.  The table is presented on a GAAP basis except that the Company’s loss reserves for its Canadian branch operations are presented in Canadian dollars, the impact of which is not material.  The top line of the table shows the estimated reserves for unpaid losses and LAE recorded at each year end date.  The upper (paid) portion of the table presents the related cumulative amounts paid through each subsequent year end.  The lower (liability re-estimated) portion shows the re-estimated amount of the original reserves as of the end






of each succeeding year.  The reserve estimates have been revised as more information became known about the actual claims for which the reserves were carried.  The cumulative (deficiency)/redundancy line represents the cumulative change in estimates since the initial reserve was established.  It is equal to the initial reserve less the latest estimate of the ultimate liability.



Since the Company has international operations, some of its loss reserves are established in foreign currencies and converted to U.S. dollars for financial reporting.  Changes in conversion rates from period to period impact the U.S. dollar value of carried reserves and correspondingly, the cumulative deficiency line of the table.  However, unlike other reserve development that affects net income (loss), the impact of currency translation is a component of other comprehensive income (loss).  To differentiate these two reserve development components, the translation impacts for each calendar year are reflected in the table of Effects on Pre-tax Income Resulting from Reserve Re-estimates.



Each amount other than the original reserves in the top half of the table below includes the effects of all changes in amounts for prior periods. For example, if a loss settled in 2006 for $100,000, was first reserved in 2003 at $60,000 and remained unchanged until settlement, the $40,000 deficiency (actual loss minus original estimate) would affect the cumulative deficiency for each of the years in 2003 through 2005.  Conditions and trends that have affected development of the ultimate liability in the past are not indicative of future developments.  Accordingly, it is not appropriate to extrapolate future redundancies or deficiencies based on this table.

There has been minimal development in reserves since 2006.  Three classes of business were the principal contributors to the deficiencies through 2006: 1) the run-off of asbestos claims for both direct and reinsurance business has significantly contributed to the cumulative deficiencies for all years presented through 2006; 2) professional liability reinsurance, general casualty reinsurance and workers’ compensation insurance contributed to the deficiencies for year 2003; and 3) property catastrophe adverse development contributed to the deficiency for 2005.



In the professional liability reinsurance class, the early 2000s saw a proliferation of claims relating to bankruptcies and other corporate, financial and/or management improprieties.  This resulted in an increase in the frequency and severity of claims under the professional liability policies reinsured by the Company.  In the general casualty area, the Company has experienced claim frequency and severity greater than expected in the Company’s pricing and initial reserving assumptions.



In the workers’ compensation insurance class, the majority of which was written in California, the Company has experienced adverse development primarily for accident year 2002 due to higher than expected claim frequency and severity.  As a result of significant growth in this book of business in a challenging business environment, the Company’s writings in this class were subject to more relative variability than in some of its established and/or stable lines of business.  Although cumulative results through 2013 continue to be profitable for this book of business, there was some deterioration in claim frequency and severity related to older accident years.



The adverse development on the 2008 outstanding reserves was primarily attributable to foreign exchange rate movements resulting in an increase in the U.S. dollar reserves.  In addition, the Company experienced adverse development on liability exposures for sub-prime for accident years 2006-2008 and contractors’ liability exposures for accident years 2003-2005.  The contractor liability exposures are currently in run-off.  The Company also experienced adverse development on property lines but was offset by favorable development on other casualty lines.



The Company’s loss and LAE reserves represent management’s best estimate of the ultimate liability.  While there can be no assurance that these reserves will not need to be increased in the future, management believes that the Company’s existing reserves and reserving methodologies reduce the likelihood that any such increases would have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.  These statements regarding the Company’s loss reserves are forward looking statements within the meaning of the U.S. federal securities laws and are intended to be covered by the safe harbor provisions contained therein.  See ITEM 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Safe Harbor Disclosure”.




The following table is derived from the Ten Year GAAP Loss Development Table above and summarizes the effect of reserve re-estimates, net of reinsurance, on calendar year operations by accident year for the same ten year period ended December 31, 2013.  Each column represents the amount of net reserve re-estimates made in the indicated calendar year and shows the accident years to which the re-estimates are applicable.  The amounts in the total accident year column on the far right represent the cumulative reserve re-estimates for the indicated accident years.



Since the Company has operations in many countries, part of the Company’s loss and LAE reserves are in foreign currencies and translated to U.S. dollars for each reporting period.  Fluctuations in the exchange rates for the currencies, period over period, affect the U.S. dollar amount of outstanding reserves.  The translation adjustment line at the bottom of the table eliminates the impact of the exchange fluctuations from the reserve re-estimates.

The reserve development by accident year reflected in the above table was generally the result of the same factors described above that caused the deficiencies shown in the Ten Year GAAP Loss Development Table. The unfavorable development experienced in the 2003 and prior accident years relate principally to the previously discussed asbestos development.  Other business areas contributing to adverse development were casualty reinsurance, including professional liability classes, and workers’ compensation insurance, where, in retrospect, the Company’s initial estimates of losses were underestimated principally as the result of unanticipated variability in the underlying exposures.  The favorable development for accident year 2004 relates primarily to favorable experience with respect to property reinsurance business.  In addition, casualty reinsurance has reflected favorable development for accident years 2004 to 2006.



The Company’s loss reserving methodologies continuously monitor the emergence of loss and loss development trends, seeking, on a timely basis, to both adjust reserves for the impact of trend shifts and to factor the impact of such shifts into the Company’s underwriting and pricing on a prospective basis.




The following table presents a reconciliation of beginning and ending reserve balances for the periods indicated on a GAAP basis:



Years Ended December 31,(Dollars in millions)201320122011Gross reserves at beginning of period$10,069.1$10,123.2$9,340.2Incurred related to:Current year2,818.52,748.93,722.5Prior years(18.2)(3.7)3.7Total incurred losses2,800.32,745.33,726.2Paid related to:Current year664.7633.9810.5Prior years2,353.82,220.22,008.3Total paid losses3,018.52,854.12,818.8Foreign exchange/translation adjustment(48.6)32.9(15.9)Change in reinsurance receivables on unpaid losses and LAE(128.9)21.8(108.4)Gross reserves at end of period$9,673.2$10,069.1$10,123.2(Some amounts may not reconcile due to rounding.)



Incurred prior years’ reserves decreased by $18.2 million, decreased by $3.7 million and increased by $3.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively.  The decrease for 2013 was attributable to a $148.8 million decrease in reinsurance business, primarily related to favorable development on treaty property reserves, partially offset by a $130.5 million increase in insurance business primarily related to development on contractors’ liability, umbrella and workers compensation reserves.



The decrease for 2012 was attributable to a $57.2 million decrease in reinsurance business, primarily related to favorable development on treaty casualty reserves, partially offset by a $53.5 million increase in insurance business primarily related to development on contractors’ liability and workers compensation reserves.



The increase for 2011 was attributable to a $113.8 million increase in the insurance and US reinsurance business primarily related to development on contractors’ liability, excess casualty and California workers compensation reserves, partially offset by a $110.1 million decrease in non-US reinsurance business, primarily related to favorable development on non-catastrophe property reserves.



Reserves for Asbestos and Environmental Losses and LAE.

At December 31, 2013, the Company’s gross reserves for A&E claims represented 4.2% of its total reserves.  The Company’s A&E liabilities stem from Mt. McKinley’s direct insurance business and Everest Re’s assumed reinsurance business.  There are significant uncertainties in estimating the amount of the Company’s potential losses from A&E claims and ultimate values cannot be estimated using traditional reserving techniques.  See ITEM 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Asbestos and Environmental Exposures” and Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” - Note 3 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.



The following table summarizes the composition of the Company’s total reserves for A&E losses, gross and net of reinsurance, for the periods indicated:



Years Ended December 31,(Dollars in millions)201320122011Gross reserves$402.5$442.8$499.9Reinsurance receivable(15.8)(17.1)(19.8)Net reserves$386.7$425.7$480.2(Some amounts may not reconcile due to rounding.)17



Additional losses, including those relating to latent injuries and other exposures, which are as yet unrecognized, the type or magnitude of which cannot be foreseen by either the Company or the industry, may emerge in the future. Such future emergence could have material adverse effects on the Company’s future financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.



Future Policy Benefit Reserves.

The Company wrote a limited amount of life and annuity reinsurance in its Bermuda segment.  Future policy benefit liabilities for annuities are reported at the accumulated fund balance of these contracts.  Reserves for those liabilities include mortality provisions with respect to life and annuity claims, both reported and unreported.  Actual experience in a particular period may be worse than assumed experience and, consequently, may adversely affect the Company’s operating results for that period. See ITEM 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” - Note 1F of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Investments.

The board of directors of each of the Company’s operating subsidiaries is responsible for establishing investment policy and guidelines and, together with senior management, for overseeing their execution.



The Company’s principal investment objectives are to ensure funds are available to meet its insurance and reinsurance obligations and to maximize after-tax investment income while maintaining a high quality diversified investment portfolio.  Considering these objectives, the Company views its investment portfolio as having two components: 1) the investments needed to satisfy outstanding liabilities (its core fixed maturities portfolio) and 2) investments funded by the Company’s shareholders’ equity.



For the portion needed to satisfy global outstanding liabilities, the Company generally invests in taxable and tax-preferenced fixed income securities with an average credit quality of Aa3.  For the U.S. portion of this portfolio, our mix of taxable and tax-preferenced investments is adjusted periodically, consistent with the Company’s current and projected U.S. operating results, market conditions and our tax position.  This global fixed maturity securities portfolio is externally managed by an independent, professional investment manager using portfolio guidelines approved by the Company.



Over the past several years, the Company has expanded the allocation of its investments funded by shareholders’ equity to include:  1) a greater percentage of publicly traded equity securities, 2) emerging market fixed maturities through mutual fund structures, as well as individual holdings, 3) high yield fixed maturities, 4) bank loan securities and 5) private equity limited partnership investments.  The objective of this portfolio diversification is to enhance the risk-adjusted total return of the investment portfolio by allocating a prudent portion of the portfolio to higher return asset classes, which are also less subject to changes in value with movements in interest rates.  The Company limits its allocation to these asset classes because of 1) the potential for volatility in their values and 2) the impact of these investments on regulatory and rating agency capital adequacy models.  The Company uses investment managers experienced in these markets and adjusts its allocation to these investments based upon market conditions.  At December 31, 2013, the market value of investments in these investment market sectors, carried at both market and fair value, approximated 62% of shareholders’ equity.




The duration of an investment is based on the maturity of the security but also reflects the payment of interest and the possibility of early prepayments.  The Company’s fixed income investment guidelines include a general duration guideline.  This investment duration guideline is established and periodically revised by management, which considers economic and business factors, as well as the Company’s average duration of potential liabilities, which, at December 31, 2013, is estimated at approximately 3.7 years, based on the estimated payouts of underwriting liabilities using standard duration calculations.



The duration of the fixed income portfolio at December 31, 2013 and 2012 was 3.2 years and 3.0 years, respectively.  The Company has shortened the duration of its portfolio in recent years in response to very low available yields, particularly on securities with longer maturities.  As a result, the Company has focused on purchasing high quality, shorter duration investments and investments with floating rate yields.  These investments will be less subject to decline in market value if interest rates rise in the future, as forecasted by most investment analysts.



For each currency in which the Company has established substantial loss and LAE reserves, the Company seeks to maintain invested assets denominated in such currency in an amount approximately equal to the estimated liabilities.  Approximately 32% of the Company’s consolidated reserves for losses and LAE and unearned premiums represent amounts payable in foreign currencies.



The Company’s net investment income was $548.5 million, $600.2 million and $620.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively.  The decrease from 2012 to 2013 was primarily due to the decline in reported income from fixed maturity securities, primarily due to the effects of lower reinvestment rates over the past several years, from equity securities, due to the liquidation of some mutual funds and from limited partnership investments.



The Company had net realized capital gains for 2013 of $300.2 million.  In 2013, the Company recorded $258.9 million of gains due to fair value re-measurements on fixed maturity and equity securities and $42.4 million of net realized capital gains from sales of fixed maturity and equity securities, partially offset by $1.1 million of other-than-temporary impairments on fixed maturity securities.  In 2012, net realized capital gains were $164.4 million due to $118.1 million of gains due to fair value re-measurements on fixed maturity and equity securities and $56.3 million of net realized capital gains from sales of fixed maturity and equity securities, partially offset by $10.0 million of other-than-temporary impairments on fixed maturity securities.  In 2011, net realized capital gains were $6.9 million due to $27.5 million of net realized capital gains from sales of fixed maturity and equity securities, partially offset by $16.2 million of other-than-temporary impairments on fixed maturity securities and $4.4 million of losses due to fair value re-measurements on fixed maturity and equity securities.



The Company’s cash and invested assets totaled $16.6 billion at December 31, 2013, which consisted of 87.3% fixed maturities and cash, of which 89.5% were investment grade; 9.7% equity securities and 3.0% other invested assets. The average maturity of fixed maturity securities was 4.3 years at December 31, 2013, and their overall duration was 3.2 years.



As of December 31, 2013, the Company did not have any direct investments in commercial real estate or direct commercial mortgages or any material holdings of derivative investments (other than equity index put option contracts as discussed in ITEM 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” - Note 4 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements) or securities of issuers that are experiencing cash flow difficulty to an extent that the Company’s management believes could threaten the issuer’s ability to meet debt service payments, except where other-than-temporary impairments have been recognized.



The Company’s investment portfolio includes structured commercial mortgage-backed securities (“CMBS”) with a book value of $254.8 million and a market value of $270.4 million.  CMBS securities comprising more than 56% of the December 31, 2013 market value are rated AAA by Standard & Poor’s Financial Services LLC (“Standard & Poor’s”).  Furthermore, securities comprising more than 85% of the market value are rated investment grade by Standard & Poor’s.




At December 31, 2013, the Company’s fixed maturity portfolio included $1.4 million in book value of asset-backed securities with sub-prime mortgage loan exposure and the market value of these investments was $1.5 million.  Sub-prime mortgage loans generally represent loans made to borrowers with limited or blemished credit records.

Financial Strength Ratings.

The following table shows the current financial strength ratings of the Company’s operating subsidiaries as reported by A.M. Best, Standard & Poor’s and Moody’s.  These ratings are based upon factors of concern to policyholders and should not be considered an indication of the degree or lack of risk involved in a direct or indirect equity investment in an insurance or reinsurance company.



All of the below-mentioned ratings are continually monitored and revised, if necessary, by each of the rating agencies.  The ratings presented in the following table were in effect as of February 28, 2014.



The Company believes that its ratings, in general, are important to its operations because they provide the Company’s customers and investors with an independent assessment of the Company’s underlying financial strength using a scale that provides for relative comparisons.  Strong financial ratings are particularly important for reinsurance companies.  Ceding companies must rely on their reinsurers to pay covered losses well into the future.  As a result, a highly rated reinsurer is generally preferred.

BestStandard & Poor'sMoody'sEverest ReA+ (Superior)A+ (Strong)A1 (upper-medium)Bermuda ReA+ (Superior)A+ (Strong)A1 (upper-medium)Ireland ReA+ (Superior)A+ (Strong)Not RatedEverest InternationalA+ (Superior)Not RatedNot RatedEverest NationalA+ (Superior)A+ (Strong)Not RatedEverest IndemnityA+ (Superior)Not RatedNot RatedEverest SecurityA+ (Superior)Not RatedNot RatedEverest CanadaA+ (Superior)Not RatedNot RatedMt. McKinleyNot RatedNot RatedNot RatedMt. Logan ReNot RatedNot RatedNot Rated



A.M. Best states that the “A+” (“Superior”) rating is assigned to those companies which, in its opinion, have a superior ability to meet their ongoing insurance policy and contract obligations based on A.M. Best’s comprehensive quantitative and qualitative evaluation of a company’s balance sheet strength, operating performance and business profile.  A.M. Best affirmed these ratings on July 25, 2013.  Standard & Poor’s states that the “A+” rating is assigned to those insurance companies which, in its opinion, have strong financial security characteristics with respect to their ability to pay under its insurance policies and contracts in accordance with their terms.  Standard & Poor’s affirmed these ratings on May 23, 2013.  Moody’s states that an “A1” rating is assigned to companies that, in their opinion, offer upper-medium grade security and are subject to low credit risk.



Subsidiaries other than Everest Re and Bermuda Re may not be rated by some or any rating agencies because such ratings are not considered essential by the individual subsidiary’s customers or because of the limited nature of the subsidiary’s operations.  In particular, Mt. McKinley is not rated because it is in run-off status.



Debt Ratings.

The following table shows the debt ratings by A.M. Best, Standard & Poor’s and Moody’s of the Holdings’ senior notes due October 15, 2014 and long term notes due May 1, 2067 both of which are considered investment grade.  Debt ratings are the rating agencies’ current assessment of the credit worthiness of an obligor with respect to a specific obligation.



A.M. BestStandard & Poor'sMoody'sSenior Notesa-(Strong)A-(Strong)Baa1(Medium Grade)Long Term Notesbbb(Adequate)BBB(Adequate)Baa2(Medium Grade)



A debt rating of “a-” is assigned by A.M. Best where the issuer, in A.M. Best’s opinion, has a strong ability to meet the terms of the obligation.  A.M. Best assigns a debt rating in the “bbb” range where the issuer, in A.M. Best’s opinion, has adequate ability to meet the terms of the obligation.  Standard & Poor’s assigns a debt rating in the “A” range to issuers that exhibit strong capacity and willingness to meet its financial commitments on obligations as they come due.  A debt rating in the “BBB” range is assigned by Standard &






Poor’s where the obligation exhibits adequate protection parameters although adverse economic conditions or changing circumstances are more likely to lead to a weakened capacity of the obligor to meet its financial commitment on the obligation.  According to Moody’s, a debt rating of “Baa” is assigned to issues that are considered medium-grade obligations and subject to moderate credit risk and as such may possess certain speculative characteristics.



Competition.

The worldwide reinsurance and insurance businesses are highly competitive, as well as cyclical by product and market.  As such, financial results tend to fluctuate with periods of constrained availability, high rates and strong profits followed by periods of abundant capacity, low rates and constrained profitability.  Competition in the types of reinsurance and insurance business that the Company underwrites is based on many factors, including the perceived overall financial strength of the reinsurer or insurer, ratings of the reinsurer or insurer by A.M. Best and/or Standard & Poor’s, underwriting expertise, the jurisdictions where the reinsurer or insurer is licensed or otherwise authorized, capacity and coverages offered, premiums charged, other terms and conditions of the reinsurance and insurance business offered, services offered, speed of claims payment and reputation and experience in lines written.  Furthermore, the market impact from these competitive factors related to reinsurance and insurance is generally not consistent across lines of business, domestic and international geographical areas and distribution channels.



The Company competes in the U.S., Bermuda and international reinsurance and insurance markets with numerous global competitors.  The Company’s competitors include independent reinsurance and insurance companies, subsidiaries or affiliates of established worldwide insurance companies, reinsurance departments of certain insurance companies and domestic and international underwriting operations, including underwriting syndicates at Lloyd’s.  Some of these competitors have greater financial resources than the Company and have established long term and continuing business relationships, which can be a significant competitive advantage.  In addition, the lack of strong barriers to entry into the reinsurance business and the potential for securitization of reinsurance and insurance risks through capital markets provide additional sources of potential reinsurance and insurance capacity and competition.



Worldwide insurance and reinsurance market conditions continued to be very competitive, particularly in the casualty lines of business.  Generally, there was ample insurance and reinsurance capacity relative to demand.  Competition and its effect on rates, terms and conditions vary widely by market and coverage yet continued to be most prevalent in the U.S. casualty insurance and reinsurance markets and additional capacity from the capital markets is impacting worldwide catastrophe rates.



Catastrophe rates tend to fluctuate by global region, particularly areas recently impacted by large catastrophic events.  During the second and third quarters of 2013, Canada experienced historic flooding in Alberta and Toronto, which will likely result in higher future catastrophe rates.  Although there were flooding and wind storm events in Europe and Asia in the latter part of 2013, the overall 2013 catastrophe losses for the industry were lower than average.  This lower level of losses, combined with increased competition is putting downward pressure on rates in certain geographical areas.



Overall, the Company believes that current marketplace conditions, particularly for catastrophe coverages, provide profit opportunities for it given its strong ratings, distribution system, reputation and expertise.  The Company continues to employ its strategy of targeting business that offers the greatest profit potential, while maintaining balance and diversification in its overall portfolio.



Employees.

As of February 1, 2014, the Company employed 1,063 persons.  Management believes that employee relations are good.  None of the Company’s employees are subject to collective bargaining agreements, and the Company is not aware of any current efforts to implement such agreements.




Regulatory Matters.

The Company and its insurance subsidiaries are subject to regulation under the insurance statutes of the various jurisdictions in which they conduct business, including essentially all states of the U.S., Canada, Singapore, Brazil, the United Kingdom, Ireland and Bermuda.  These regulations vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and are generally designed to protect ceding insurance companies and policyholders by regulating the Company’s conduct of business, financial integrity and ability to meet its obligations.  Many of these regulations require reporting of information designed to allow insurance regulators to closely monitor the Company’s performance.



Insurance Holding Company Regulation.Under applicable U.S. laws and regulations, no person, corporation or other entity may acquire a controlling interest in the Company, unless such person, corporation or entity has obtained the prior approval for such acquisition from the insurance commissioners of Delaware and the other states in which the Company’s insurance subsidiaries are domiciled or deemed domiciled, currently California and Georgia.  Under these laws, “control” is presumed when any person acquires, directly or indirectly, 10% or more of the voting securities of an insurance company.  To obtain the approval of any change in control, the proposed acquirer must file an application with the relevant insurance commissioner disclosing, among other things, the background of the acquirer and that of its directors and officers, the acquirer’s financial condition and its proposed changes in the management and operations of the insurance company.  U.S. state regulators also require prior notice or regulatory approval of material inter-affiliate transactions within the holding company structure.



The Insurance Companies Act of Canada requires prior approval by the Minister of Finance of anyone acquiring a significant interest in an insurance company authorized to do business in Canada.  In addition, the Company is subject to regulation by the insurance regulators of other states and foreign jurisdictions in which it is authorized to do business.  Certain of these states and foreign jurisdictions impose regulations regulating the ability of any person to acquire control of an insurance company authorized to do business in that jurisdiction without appropriate regulatory approval similar to those described above.



Dividends.Under Bermuda law, Group is prohibited from declaring or paying a dividend if such payment would reduce the realizable value of its assets to an amount less than the aggregate value of its liabilities and its issued share capital and share premium (additional paid-in capital) accounts.  Group’s ability to pay dividends and its operating expenses is partially dependent upon dividends from its subsidiaries.  The payment of dividends by insurance subsidiaries is limited under Bermuda law as well as the laws of the various U.S. states in which Group’s insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries are domiciled or deemed domiciled.  The limitations are generally based upon net income (loss) and compliance with applicable policyholders’ surplus or minimum solvency and liquidity requirements as determined in accordance with the relevant statutory accounting practices.  Under Irish corporate and regulatory law, Holdings Ireland and its subsidiaries are limited as to the dividends they can pay based on retained earnings and net income (loss) and/or capital and minimum solvency requirements.  As Holdings has outstanding debt obligations, it is dependent upon dividends and other permissible payments from its operating subsidiaries to enable it to meet its debt and operating expense obligations and to pay dividends.



Under Bermuda law, Bermuda Re and Everest International are unable to declare or make payment of a dividend if they fail to meet their minimum solvency margin or minimum liquidity ratio.  As a long term insurer, Bermuda Re is also unable to declare or pay a dividend to anyone who is not a policyholder unless, after payment of the dividend, the value of the assets in their long term business fund, as certified by their approved actuary, exceeds their liabilities for long term business by at least the $250,000 minimum solvency margin.  Prior approval of the Bermuda Monetary Authority is required if Bermuda Re’s or Everest International’s dividend payments would exceed 25% of their prior year end statutory capital and surplus.  At December 31, 2013, Bermuda Re and Everest International exceeded their solvency and liquidity requirements by a significant margin.



The payment of dividends to Holdings by Everest Re is subject to limitations imposed by Delaware law.  Generally, Everest Re may only pay dividends out of its statutory earned surplus, which was $2,814.3 million at December 31, 2013, and only after it has given 10 days prior notice to the Delaware Insurance Commissioner.  During this 10-day period, the Commissioner may, by order, limit or disallow the payment of ordinary dividends if the Commissioner finds the insurer to be presently or potentially in financial distress.  Further, the maximum amount of dividends that may be paid without the prior approval of the Delaware






Insurance Commissioner in any twelve month period is the greater of (1) 10% of the insurer’s statutory surplus as of the end of the prior calendar year or (2) the insurer’s statutory net income (loss), not including realized capital gains (losses), for the prior calendar year.  Accordingly, the maximum amount that will be available for the payment of dividends by Everest Re in 2014 without triggering the requirement for prior approval of regulatory authorities in connection with a dividend is $538.2 million.



Insurance Regulation.Bermuda Re, Everest International and Mt. Logan Re  are not admitted to do business in any jurisdiction in the U.S.  These entities conduct their insurance business from their offices in Bermuda, and in the case of Bermuda Re, its branch in the UK.  In Bermuda, Bermuda Re, Everest International and Mt. Logan Re are regulated by the Insurance Act 1978 (as amended) and related regulations (the “Act”).  The Act establishes solvency and liquidity standards and auditing and reporting requirements and subjects Bermuda Re, Everest International and Mt. Logan Re to the supervision, investigation and intervention powers of the Bermuda Monetary Authority.  Under the Act, Bermuda Re and Everest International, as Class 4 insurers, are each required to maintain a principal office in Bermuda, to maintain a minimum of $100 million in statutory capital and surplus, to have an independent auditor approved by the Bermuda Monetary Authority conduct an annual audit and report on their respective statutory and U.S. GAAP financial statements and filings and to have an appointed loss reserve specialist (also approved by the Bermuda Monetary Authority) review and report on their respective loss reserves annually.  Under the Act and the Segregated Accounts Companies Act 2000, Mt. Logan Re is licensed as a Class 3 insurer and is deemed a segregated cell company.



Bermuda Re is also registered under the Act as long term insurer and is thereby authorized to write life and annuity business.  As a long term insurer, Bermuda Re is required to maintain $250,000 in statutory capital separate from their Class 4 minimum statutory capital and surplus, to maintain long term business funds, to separately account for this business and to have an approved actuary prepare a certificate concerning their long term business assets and liabilities to be filed annually.  Bermuda Re’s operations in the United Kingdom and worldwide are subject to regulation by the Financial Services Authority (the “FSA”).  The FSA imposes solvency, capital adequacy, audit, financial reporting and other regulatory requirements on insurers transacting business in the United Kingdom.  Bermuda Re presently meets or exceeds all of the FSA’s solvency and capital requirements.



U.S. domestic property and casualty insurers, including reinsurers, are subject to regulation by their state of domicile and by those states in which they are licensed.  The regulation of reinsurers is typically focused on financial condition, investments, management and operation.  The rates and policy terms of reinsurance agreements are generally not subject to direct regulation by any governmental authority.



The operations of Everest Re’s foreign branch offices in Canada and Singapore are subject to regulation by the insurance regulatory officials of those jurisdictions.  Management believes that the Company is in compliance with applicable laws and regulations pertaining to its business and operations.



Everest Indemnity, Everest National, Everest Security and Mt. McKinley are subject to regulations similar to the U.S. regulations applicable to Everest Re.  In addition, Everest National and Everest Security must comply with substantial regulatory requirements in each state where they conduct business.  These additional requirements include, but are not limited to, rate and policy form requirements, requirements with regard to licensing, agent appointments, participation in residual markets and claim handling procedures.  These regulations are primarily designed for the protection of policyholders.



Licenses.Everest Re is a licensed property and casualty insurer and/or reinsurer in all states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico.  In New Hampshire and Puerto Rico, Everest Re is licensed for reinsurance only.  Such licensing enables U.S. domestic ceding company clients to take credit for uncollateralized reinsurance receivables from Everest Re in their statutory financial statements.



Everest Re is licensed as a property and casualty reinsurer in Canada. It is also authorized to conduct reinsurance business in Singapore and Brazil.  Everest Re can also write reinsurance in other foreign countries. Because some jurisdictions require a reinsurer to register in order to be an acceptable market for local insurers, Everest Re is registered as a foreign insurer and/or reinsurer in the following countries: Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico, Peru, Venezuela and the Philippines. Everest National is licensed in 50 states and the District of Columbia.  Everest Indemnity






is licensed in Delaware and is eligible to write insurance on a surplus lines basis in 49 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico.  Everest Security is licensed in Georgia and Alabama.  Mt.

Bermuda Re and Everest International are registered as Class 4 insurers in Bermuda, and Bermuda Re is also registered as a long term insurer in Bermuda.

Periodic Examinations.Everest Re, Everest National, Everest Indemnity, Everest Security and Mt. McKinley are subject to periodic financial examination (usually every three to four years) of their affairs by the insurance departments of the states in which they are licensed, authorized or accredited.  Everest Re’s, Everest National’s, Everest Security’s, Everest Indemnity’s and Mt. McKinley’s last examination reports were as of December 31, 2010.  None of these reports contained any material findings or recommendations.  In addition, U.S. insurance companies are subject to examinations by the various state insurance departments where they are licensed concerning compliance with applicable conduct of business regulations.



NAIC Risk-Based Capital Requirements.The U.S. National Association of Insurance Commissioners (“NAIC”) has developed a formula to measure the amount of capital appropriate for a property and casualty insurance company to support its overall business operations in light of its size and risk profile.  The major categories of a company’s risk profile are its asset risk, credit risk, and underwriting risk.  The standards are an effort by the NAIC to prevent insolvencies, to ward off other financial difficulties of insurance companies and to establish uniform regulatory standards among state insurance departments.



Under the approved formula, a company’s statutory surplus is compared to its risk based capital (“RBC”).  If this ratio is above a minimum threshold, no action is necessary.  Below this threshold are four distinct action levels at which an insurer’s domiciliary state regulator can intervene with increasing degrees of authority over an insurer as the ratio of surplus to RBC decreases.  The mildest intervention requires an insurer to submit a plan of appropriate corrective actions.  The most severe action requires an insurer to be rehabilitated or liquidated.



Based on their financial positions at December 31, 2013, Everest Re, Everest National, Everest Indemnity and Everest Security significantly exceed the minimum thresholds.  Since Mt. McKinley ceased writing new and renewal insurance in 1985, its domiciliary regulator, the Delaware Insurance Commissioner, has exempted Mt. McKinley from complying with RBC requirements.



Various proposals to change the RBC formula arise from time to time.  The Company is unable to predict whether any such proposal will be adopted, the form in which any such proposals would be adopted or the effect, if any, the adoption of any such proposal or change in the RBC calculations would have on the Company.



Tax Matters.

The following summary of the taxation of the Company is based on current law.  There can be no assurance that legislative, judicial, or administrative changes will not be enacted that materially affect this summary.



Bermuda.Under Bermuda law, no income, withholding or capital gains taxes are imposed upon Group and its Bermuda subsidiaries.  Group and its Bermuda subsidiaries have received an undertaking from the Minister of Finance in Bermuda that, in the event of any taxes being imposed, Group and its Bermuda subsidiaries will be exempt from taxation in Bermuda until March 2035.  Non-Bermuda branches of Bermuda subsidiaries are subject to local taxes in the jurisdictions in which they operate.



United States.Group’s U.S. subsidiaries conduct business in and are subject to taxation in the U.S.  Non-U.S. branches of U.S. subsidiaries are subject to local taxation in the jurisdictions in which they operate.  Should the U.S. subsidiaries distribute current or accumulated earnings and profits in the form of dividends or otherwise, the Company would be subject to withholding taxes.  The cumulative amount that would be subject to withholding tax, if distributed, is not practicable to compute.  Group and its Bermuda subsidiaries believe that they have operated and will continue to operate their businesses in a manner that will not cause them to generate income treated as effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business within the U.S.  On this basis, Group does not expect that it and its Bermuda subsidiaries will be required to pay U.S.




corporate income taxes other than withholding taxes on certain investment income and premium excise taxes.  If Group or its Bermuda subsidiaries were to become subject to U.S. income tax, there could be a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

United Kingdom.Bermuda Re’s UK branch conducts business in the UK and is subject to taxation in the UK.  Bermuda Re believes that it has operated and will continue to operate its Bermuda operation in a manner which will not cause them to be subject to UK taxation.  If Bermuda Re’s Bermuda operations were to become subject to UK income tax, there could be a material adverse impact on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations and cash flow.



Ireland.Holdings Ireland and Ireland Re conduct business in Ireland and are subject to taxation in Ireland.
