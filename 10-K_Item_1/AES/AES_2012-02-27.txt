ITEM 1.BUSINESS

Overview

We are a global power company,
dedicated to improving lives by providing safe, reliable and sustainable energy solutions in every market we serve. We own a portfolio of electricity generation and distribution businesses on five continents in 27 countries, with total capacity of
approximately 44,200 Megawatts (“MW”) and distribution networks serving approximately 12 million customers as of December 31, 2011. In addition, we have approximately 2,400 MW under construction in eight countries. We were
incorporated in Delaware in 1981.

We own and operate two primary types of businesses. The first is our Generation business,
where we own and/or operate power plants to generate and sell power to wholesale customers such as utilities and other intermediaries. The second is our Utilities business, where we own and/or operate utilities to generate, distribute, transmit and
sell electricity to end-user customers in the residential, commercial, industrial and governmental sectors within a defined service area.

Our assets are diverse with respect to fuel source and type of market, which helps reduce certain types of operating risk. Our portfolio employs a broad range of fuels, including coal, diesel, fuel oil,
natural gas, biomass and renewable sources such as hydroelectric power, wind and solar, which reduces the risks associated with dependence on any one fuel source. Our portfolio combines a presence in stable markets in developed countries with faster
growing emerging markets. In addition, our Generation portfolio is largely contracted, which reduces the risk related to market prices of electricity and fuel. We also attempt to limit risk by matching the currency of most of our subsidiary debt to
the revenue of the underlying business and by hedging some of our interest rate and commodity risk. However, our business is still subject to these and other risks, which are further described in Item 1A.—Risk Factors of this
Form 10-K.

Our goal is to maximize value for our shareholders by growing cash flow and earnings per share and achieving
better returns on our investments. We will expand our platforms in our core markets, specifically Brazil, Chile, Colombia and the United States, and will work to develop growth platforms in key markets including Turkey, Poland and the United
Kingdom. Over time, by focusing our growth and exiting select non-strategic markets, we expect to narrow our geographic focus to achieve better results with fewer countries. Across our portfolio, we will work to optimize profitability, as well as
reduce our overhead and business development costs. Finally, we have announced our intent to initiate a dividend beginning in the third quarter of 2012, with the first payment expected to be made in the fourth quarter of 2012.

Key Lines of Business

AES’ primary sources of revenue and gross margin today are from Generation and Utilities. These businesses are distinguished by the nature of the customers, operational differences, cost structure,
regulatory environment and risk exposure. The breakout of revenue and gross margin between Generation and Utilities for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively, is shown below. Operating results for integrated utilities,
which have both Generation and Utilities, are reflected in the Utilities amounts below.







Revenue

($ in billions)





Gross Margin

($ in billions)







(1)Utilities gross margin includes the margin from generation businesses owned by the Company and from whom the utility purchases energy.

Generation

We currently own or operate a generation portfolio of approximately 33,800 MW, excluding the generation capabilities of our integrated utilities, consisting of 98 Generation facilities in 22
countries on five continents at our generation businesses. We also have approximately 2,100 MW of capacity currently under construction in four countries. We are a major power source in many countries, such as Chile, where AES Gener
(“Gener”) is the second largest electricity generation company in terms of capacity. Our Generation business uses a wide range of technologies and fuel types including coal, combined-cycle gas turbines, hydroelectric power and biomass.
Generation revenue was $7.8 billion, $6.9 billion and $5.5 billion for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.

Performance drivers for our Generation businesses include, among other factors, plant reliability, fuel costs, power prices, volume and fixed-cost management. Growth in the Generation business is largely
tied to securing new power purchase agreements (“PPAs”), expanding capacity in our existing facilities, reducing our fixed costs and building or acquiring new power plants.

The majority of the electricity produced by our Generation businesses is sold under long-term PPAs, to wholesale customers. In 2011,
approximately 71% of the contracted revenue from our Generation business was







from plants that operate under PPAs of three years or longer for 75% or more of their output capacity. These businesses often reduce their exposure to fuel supply risks by entering into long-term
fuel supply contracts or fuel tolling arrangements where the customer assumes full responsibility for purchasing and supplying the fuel to the power plant. These long-term contractual agreements help reduce the volatility of our cash flows and
earnings and also reduce exposure to volatility in the market price for electricity and fuel; however, the amount of earnings and cash flow predictability varies from business to business based on the degree to which its exposure is limited by the
contracts it has negotiated.

Our Generation businesses with long-term contracts face most of their competition from other
utilities and independent power producers (“IPPs”) prior to the execution of a power sales agreement during the development phase of a project or upon expiration of an existing agreement. Once a project is operational, we traditionally
have faced limited competition due to the long-term nature of the generation contracts. However, as our existing contracts expire, we may face increased competition to attract new customers and maintain our current customer base.

The balance of our Generation business sells power through competitive markets under short-term contracts, directly in the spot market
or, in some cases, at regulated prices. As a result, the cash flows and earnings associated with these businesses are more sensitive to fluctuations in the market price for electricity, natural gas, coal and other fuels. Competitive factors for
these facilities include price, reliability, operational cost and third-party credit requirements.

Utilities

AES utility businesses distribute power to over 12 million people in six countries on five continents and consist
primarily of 13 companies owned or operated under management agreements, each of which operates in defined service areas. These businesses also include 29 generation plants in two countries with generation capacity totaling approximately
8,500 MW. These businesses have a variety of structures ranging from pure distribution businesses to fully integrated utilities, which generate, transmit and distribute power. For instance, our wholly-owned subsidiary in the U.S., Indianapolis
Power & Light (“IPL”), has the exclusive right to provide retail services to approximately 470,000 customers in Indianapolis, Indiana. The Dayton Power and Light Company (“DP&L”) serves approximately 500,000
customers in West Central Ohio. Eletropaulo Metropolitana Electricidade de São Paulo S.A. (“AES Eletropaulo” or “Eletropaulo”), serving the São Paulo metropolitan region for over 100 years, has approximately
six million customers and is the largest electricity distribution company in Latin America in terms of revenue and electricity distributed. Utilities revenue was $9.5 billion, $8.9 billion and $7.6 billion for the years ended
December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.

Performance drivers for Utilities include, but are not limited to,
reliability of service, management of working capital, negotiation of tariff adjustments, compliance with extensive regulatory requirements, and in developing countries, reduction of commercial and technical losses. The results of operations of our
Utilities businesses are sensitive to changes in economic growth, regulations and variations in weather conditions in the areas in which they operate. In certain locations, our distribution businesses face increased competition as a result of
changes in laws and regulations which allow wholesale and retail services to be provided on a competitive basis.

The majority
of our utilities face relatively little direct competition due to significant barriers to entry, which are present in these markets. Competition is a factor in efforts to acquire existing businesses. In this arena, we compete against a number of
other market participants, some of which have greater financial resources, have been engaged in distribution related businesses for longer periods of time and/or have accumulated more significant portfolios. Relevant competitive factors for our
power distribution businesses include financial resources, governmental assistance, regulatory restrictions and access to non-recourse financing.

Renewables and Other Initiatives

In recent years, as demand for renewable
sources of energy has grown, we have developed projects in wind, solar and other renewable initiatives including energy storage. In 2005, we started a wind generation business







(“Wind Generation”), which currently has 21 plants in operation in five countries totaling approximately 1,800 MW in generation capacity and is one of the largest producers of wind
power in the U.S. In addition, 205 MW are under construction in four countries. In March 2008, we formed AES Solar Energy LLC (“AES Solar”), a joint venture with Riverstone Holdings, LLC (“Riverstone”), a private
equity firm, which has since commenced commercial operations of 26 plants totaling 151 MW of solar projects in Bulgaria, France, Greece, Italy and Spain. We also have a line of business to develop and implement utility scale energy storage
systems (such as batteries), which store and release power when needed. None of these initiatives are currently material to our operations, however, there are risks associated with these initiatives, which are further described in
Item 1A.—Risk Factors of this Form 10-K.

Risks

We routinely encounter and address risks, some of which may cause our future results to be different, sometimes materially different, than
we presently anticipate. The categories of risk we have identified in Item 1A.—Risk Factors of this Form 10-K include the following:



•risks related to our high level of indebtedness;



•risks associated with our ability to raise needed capital;



•external risks associated with revenue and earnings volatility;



•risks associated with our operations;



•risks associated with governmental regulation and laws; and



•risks associated with our disclosure controls and internal controls over financial reporting.

The categories of risk identified above are discussed in greater detail in Item 1A.—Risk Factors of this Form 10-K. These
risk factors should be read in conjunction with Item 7.—Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, and the Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes included elsewhere in this
report.

Our Organization and Segments

We believe our broad geographic footprint allows us to focus development in targeted markets with opportunities for new investment, and
provides stability through our presence in more developed regions. In addition, our presence in each region affords us important relationships and helps us identify local markets with attractive opportunities for new investment. In October 2011, the
Company announced a plan to redefine its operational management and organizational structure. The planned reporting structure will remain organized along two lines of business—Generation and Utilities, each led by a Chief Operating Officer
(“COO”), who in turn reports to our Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”). Our CEO and COOs are based in Arlington, Virginia.

We are continuing to evaluate both the timing and impact, if any, that the new operational and management and organizational structure will have on our reportable segments. For the year ended 2011, the
Company’s segment reporting structure is organized along our two lines of business (Generation and Utilities) and three regions: (1) Latin America & Africa; (2) North America; and (3) Europe, Middle East & Asia
(collectively, “EMEA”), which reflects how we manage the business internally. Additionally, Wind Generation is managed within our North America region. For financial reporting purposes, the Company has six reportable segments which
include:



•Latin America—Generation;



•Latin America—Utilities;



•North America—Generation;



•North America—Utilities;







•Europe—Generation;



•Asia—Generation.

Corporate and Other—The Company’s Europe Utilities, Africa Utilities, Africa Generation and Wind Generation businesses as well as the Company’s renewables initiatives are reported
within “Corporate and Other” because they do not require separate disclosure under segment reporting accounting guidance. See Item 7.—Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for
further discussion of the Company’s segment structure used for financial reporting purposes.

The following describes our
businesses as they are aligned in our segment reporting structure for financial reporting purposes.

Latin America

Our Latin America operations accounted for 65%, 65% and 66% of consolidated AES revenue in 2011, 2010 and 2009,

North America Utilities.AES has two integrated utilities in North America, IPL, which it owns
through IPALCO Enterprises, Inc. (“IPALCO”), the parent holding company of IPL and The Dayton Power and Light







Company (“DP&L”), which it owns through DPL Inc. (“DPL”), the parent company of DP&L. IPL generates, transmits, distributes and sells electricity to approximately
470,000 customers in the city of Indianapolis and neighboring areas within the state of Indiana. IPL owns and operates four generating stations. Two of the generating stations are primarily coal-fired stations. The third station has a combination of
units that use coal (base load capacity) and natural gas and/or oil (peaking capacity) for fuel to produce electricity. The fourth station is a small peaking station that uses gas-fired combustion turbine technology for the production of
electricity. IPL’s gross electric generation capacity is 3,699 MW. Approximately 45% of IPL’s coal is provided by one supplier with which IPL has long-term contracts. A key driver for the business is tariff recovery for environmental
projects through the rate adjustment process. IPL’s customers include residential, industrial, commercial and all other which made up 33%, 13%, 36% and 6%, respectively, of North America Utilities revenue for 2011. The remaining 12% of North
America Utilities revenue is from DPL.

DP&L generates, transmits, distributes and sells electricity to more than 500,000
customers in a 6,000 square mile area of West Central Ohio. DP&L, with certain other Ohio utilities and their affiliates, commonly owns seven coal-fired electric generating facilities and numerous transmission facilities. DP&L also has one
wholly-owned coal-fired plant. DP&L is affiliated with DPL Energy, LLC (“DPLE”) which owns peaking generation units located in Ohio and Indiana. DP&L’s wholly-owned plants and share of the capacity of its jointly-owned plants
and DPLE’s wholly-owned peaking units aggregates to approximately 3,817 MW. During the period November 28, 2011 through December 31, 2011, approximately 80% of DP&L’s coal was provided by four suppliers and DP&L has long-term
contracts with three of them. DP&L’s customers include residential, commercial, industrial and governmental, which make up 67%, 21% and 12%, respectively, of DP&L’s revenue for the period after acquisition in November 2011.

Regulatory Matters

Overview

In each country where we conduct business, we are subject to
extensive and complex governmental regulations that affect most aspects of our business, such as regulations governing the generation and distribution of electricity and environmental regulations. These regulations affect the operation, development,
growth and ownership of our businesses. Regulations differ on a country-by-country basis and are based upon the type of business we operate in a particular country.

Regulation of our Generation Businesses

Our Generation businesses operate
in two different types of regulatory environments: Market Environments and Other Environments.

Market Environments. In
market environments, sales of electricity may be made directly on the spot market, under negotiated bilateral contracts, or pursuant to PPAs. The spot markets are typically administered by a central dispatch or system operator that seeks to optimize
the use of the generation resources throughout an interconnected system. The spot price is usually set at the marginal cost of energy (the cost of the least expensive next-generation plant required to meet system demand) or based on bid prices. In
addition, many of these wholesale markets include markets for ancillary services to support the reliable operation of the transmission system, such as regulation (a service that corrects for short-term changes in electricity use that could impact
the stability of the power system). Most of our businesses in Europe, Latin America and the United States operate in these types of liberalized markets.

Other Environments. We operate Generation assets in certain countries that do not have a spot market. In these environments, electricity is sold only through PPAs with state-owned entities and/or
industrial clients as the offtaker. Examples of countries where we operate in this type of environment include Jordan, Nigeria, Puerto Rico and Sri Lanka.

Regulation of our Distribution Businesses

In general, our distribution
companies sell electricity directly to end-users such as homes and businesses and bill customers directly. The amount that our distribution companies can charge customers for electricity is governed by a regulated tariff. The tariff, in turn, is
generally based upon a certain usage level that includes a pass-through to the customer of costs that are not controlled by the distribution company, including the costs of fuel (in the case of integrated utilities) and/or the costs of purchased
energy, plus a margin for the value added by the distributor, which is usually calculated as a fair return on the fair value of the company’s assets. This regulated tariff is periodically reviewed and reset by the applicable regulatory agency.
Components of the tariff that are directly passed through to the customer are usually adjusted through an automated process. In many instances, the tariffs can be adjusted between scheduled regulatory resets pursuant to an inflation adjustment or
another index. Customers with demand above a certain level are often unregulated and can choose to contract with generation companies directly and pay a wheeling fee, which is a fee to the distribution company for use of the distribution system.
Most of our utilities operate as monopolies within exclusive geographic areas set by the regulatory agency and face limited competition from other distributors.







Set forth below is a discussion of certain regulations under which we operate in the
countries where we do business. In each country, the regulatory environment can pose material risks to our business, operations or financial condition. For further discussion of those risks, see the Item 1A.—Risk Factors of this Form 10-K.

Latin America and Africa

Argentina

Structure of Electricity Market. The Argentine
electricity market is divided into three separate lines of business: generation, transmission and distribution. AES Argentina operates 11% of the installed capacity of the Wholesale Electricity Market (“WEM”). The law recognizes a category
of large users made up of industrial companies and other consumers with substantial electricity supply needs.

The WEM is
comprised of:



•A Term Contracts Market, with contracts freely agreed amongst producers and consumers;



•A Spot Market, with prices sanctioned on an hourly basis considering the economic cost of production represented by the short-term marginal cost (spot
prices); and



•A Stabilization System on a quarterly basis of the prices forecasted for the spot market, created for the purchase of the distributors (seasonal
prices).

Principal Regulators. The National Electricity Regulating Agency (“ENRE”) is
responsible for ensuring that transmission and distribution companies comply with the concessions granted by the Argentine government and approving distribution tariffs. The WEM is managed by Compañía Administradora del Mercado
Mayorista Eléctrico, Sociedad Anónima (“CAMMESA”), the independent system operator. CAMMESA also acts as the dispatch entity, or OED (Organismo Encargado de Desapacho), and manages the organization, dispatch and operations of
the WEM at large according to the policies established by the Energy Secretariat, under the Ministry of Federal Planning, Public Investment and Services. In this capacity, CAMMESA is empowered to interpret the rules relating to the organization,
dispatch and energy agreements in the WEM. In addition to these duties, CAMMESA manages the information on supply and demand in the WEM, which is used by the Energy Secretariat to fix the seasonal prices and the market’s operational rules.
CAMMESA’s operating costs are borne by the WEM’s participants and agents.

Principal Regulations. The
electricity sector activities are regulated by the Electricity Act. Law 24.065 and Law 11.796 regulate the activities of generation, transmission and distribution of electric energy in the territory of the Province of Buenos Aires, determining that
the activities of transmission and distribution of energy are public services, while the generation is an activity of general interest.

Currently, the price of electric energy is determined assuming all generating units in Argentina are operating with natural gas, even though the generators may be using more expensive, alternative fuels.
In the case of generators using alternative fuels, CAMMESA pays the total variable cost of production, which may exceed the established spot price. Additionally, in the spot market, generators are also remunerated for their capacity to generate
electricity in excess of supply agreements or private contracts executed by them.

The Argentine government has adopted many
new economic measures since 2002, by means of the “Emergency Law” 25561, as amended and extended by various supplemental laws and regulations. These laws and regulations effectively terminated the use of the United States Dollar as the
functional currency of the Argentine electricity sector.

Environmental Regulations. All electricity facilities are
regulated by federal and local laws and regulations. The main federal acts are the following: the General Environmental Act 25.675, the Industrial Disposals Act: 25.612, the Standards for handling and elimination of PCBs 25670, and the Harmful
Wastes Act, 24051. Within







the Province of Buenos Aires, the principal acts are: the General Environmental Law 13.516 and the Industrial and Special Wastes Act 13.515. These main laws are complemented by several federal
and local decrees and resolutions. The main authorities responsible for environmental regulation related to our businesses are: the National and Provincial Ministers of Public Health and Environment, the Federal and the Provincial Secretaries of
Environment and Sustainable Development; and the National Electricity Regulatory Commission.

Material Regulatory
Actions. During 2004, the Energy Secretariat reached agreements with natural gas and electricity producers to reform the energy markets. In the electricity sector, the Energy Secretariat passed Resolution 826/2004, inviting generators to
contribute a percentage of their sales margins to fund the development and construction of two new combined cycle power plants to be installed by 2008/2009 (“FONINVEMEM I & II”). The time period for the funding was set from January
2004 through December 2006 and was subsequently extended through December 2007. During 2008, both power plants started operation of the gas turbines, and since March 2010, the plants started operations in combined cycle mode after receiving
commercial habilitation. In exchange, the Argentine government committed to reform market regulation to match more favorable regulations that existed prior to 2001. Additionally, participating generators will receive a pro rata ownership share in
the new generation plants for ten years. Since March 2010, our participating generation companies are collecting their sales margin contributed for the construction of the facilities in monthly installments.

A general agreement with the rest of the Generators operating in Argentina and the government was signed on November 25, 2010 to
address a nation-wide problem of overdue accounts receivable in the generation market. The agreement established the guidelines for the detailed documentation that will allow the execution of the FONINVEMEM III project agreement and some additional
cash revenues. Under the agreement, accounts receivable accrued for Alicura (our subsidiary) from July 2009 to December 2011, for an amount of approximately $170 million, will be converted into a generation asset to be built under the FONINVEMEM III
project. The government will provide the funds necessary to finance the project. The plant will have a PPA with CAMMESA for ten years, calculated to recover 100% of the receivables invested plus a margin of LIBOR + 5%. Payments will be made once the
project begins operations. We expect the existing FONINVEMEM I & II documents will be taken as a basis for the future contracts; assuming this, the collection of the 120 payments will not be tied to the availability of the plant. Availability
risk will be assumed by the operator through a Long-Term Service Agreement (“LTSA”). Some penalties may apply to the generating companies, but only in those cases where the unavailability is caused by their operating decisions not
considered in the LTSA. The yearly penalty would be capped at 10% of the yearly amount required under the PPA.

As a result of
the above mentioned agreement, AES incorporated a new controlled company (“Central Termoelectrica Guillermo Brown S.A.”) that will manage the construction of a new 300MW power plant to be located in the south of the Province of Buenos
Aires. During 2012, the execution of an EPC agreement with the selected bidder is expected to complete the construction of the new plant by 2013 and to start commercial operations by October 2013.

Brazil

Structure of Electricity Market. In Brazil, there are two contracting environments that regulate PPAs: the Regulated Contracting Environment (“ACR”), for the Generation and Distribution
of Electric Power Agents, and the Free Contracting Environment (“ACL”), for the Generation, Commercialization, Importers and Exporters of Energy Power Agents as well as consumers.

This model establishes a number of requirements to be followed by the participants in the industry, such as the obligation for
distributors to contract for their market growth years in advance only through regulated auctions; hydro and thermal energy contracting conditions to ensure better balance between supply cost and system stability; and a permanent supply monitoring
structure to detect possible imbalances between supply and demand.







Principal Regulators. In Brazil, there are a number of institutions that govern the
electricity sector including the Brazilian Electricity Regulatory Agency (“ANEEL”), the National System Operator (“ONS”) and the Electrical Energy Commercialization Chamber (“CCEE”).

ANEEL’s responsibilities are to regulate and inspect production, transmission, distribution and commercialization of electricity in
order to assure quality of provided services and universal access. ANEEL is also responsible for the establishment of tariffs for end consumers, in a way that the economic and financial feasibility of power sector participants as Generation,
Transmission and Distribution companies and the industry as a whole is preserved. The changes brought about in 2004 by the new model made ANEEL responsible for promoting, directly or indirectly, auctions for the Distribution companies to purchase
energy through long-term contracts within the National Interconnected System (Sistema Interligado Nacional) (“SIN”).

The paramount obligations of the CCEE (formerly, the Wholesale Energy Market) include: the determination of the Differences’ Price
Settlement (Preço de Liquidação de Diferenças) (“PLD”), or Spot Price, used to value short-term market transactions; the execution of the energy accounting process, identifying who and how much electricity is
involved in multilateral short-term market transactions; the financial settlement of the amounts calculated in the energy accounting process; and preparation and execution of energy auctions within the ACR by ANEEL’s delegation process.

Principal Regulations.

Distribution Companies. AES has two distribution businesses in Brazil: AES Eletropaulo and AES Sul. Under the power sector model, distribution companies have to purchase electricity at the
regulated market through auctions. Every distribution utility is obligated to contract to meet 100% of its energy needs in the ACR. Self-dealing is no longer allowed; however, existing bilateral contracts are being honored but cannot be renewed. The
tariff charged by distribution companies to captive customers is composed of a nonmanageable cost component (“Parcel A”), which includes energy purchase costs and charges related to the use of transmission and distribution systems and is
for the most part directly passed through to customers, and a manageable cost component (“Parcel B”), which includes operation and maintenance costs defined by ANEEL, recovery of assets and a component for the value added by the
distributor (calculated as the net asset base multiplied by the pre-tax weighted average cost of capital). Parcel B is reset every four years for AES Eletropaulo and every five years for AES Sul. There is an annual tariff adjustment to pass through
Parcel A costs to customers and to adjust the Parcel B costs by inflation, less an efficiency factor. Distribution companies could also be entitled to extraordinary tariff revisions in the event of significant changes to their cost structure.

In the first half of 2010, all distribution companies signed amendments to the Concession Contracts, capturing market
variance effects over sector charges. AES Eletropaulo signed its amendment on May 3, while AES Sul signed it on April 12.

Generation Companies. AES has two generation businesses in Brazil: AES Tietê and AES Uruguaiana. Under the power sector model, the Ministry of Mines and Energy (“MME”) determines
the maximum amount of energy to be sold through contracts by each plant known as “assured energy” or the amount of energy representing the long-term average of the expected energy production of the plant defined by ANEEL.

AES Tietê must provide physical coverage, i.e. its assured energy from its own power generation or purchase contracts to cover 100%
of its sales contracts. The failure to provide the required physical coverage and/or present purchase contracts, which is subject to monthly verification, exposes the generation company to the payment of penalties, which could be material. At this
time, all of AES Tiete’s assured energy has been sold to AES Eletropaulo. The PPA entered into with AES Eletropaulo, which expires on December 31, 2015, and requires that the price of energy sold be adjusted annually based on the Brazilian
inflation variation. Before the end of the PPA in 2015, AES Tietê must seek alternatives to the immediate recontracting of its assured energy from 2016 onwards. Existing legislation allows AES Tietê to allocate its energy to the
regulated auctions of existing energy, or through bilateral contracts for private clients.







In addition, the State of São Paulo established some conditions to privatize the
generation sector in São Paulo state including an obligation for the winners of the bid to increase their generation capacity by 15%, originally to be accomplished by the end of 2007. AES Tietê, as well as other concessionaire
generators, was not able to meet this requirement due to regulatory, environmental, hydrological and fuel constraints. Although AES Tietê has addressed the issue with the State of São Paulo in order to make the obligation viable under
the new business, regulatory, and sectional reality, in August 2011, the State of São Paulo filed a lawsuit seeking to compel AES Tietê to expand its generation capacity by 15% or pay unspecified damages. In that case, the State of
São Paulo sought and received an injunction from the first instance court requiring AES Tietê to present its plan on how it intended to fulfill its obligation to expand its capacity. AES Tietê has appealed the injunction and the
matter is ongoing. AES Tietê has developed a 550 MW gas-fired thermal power project called Termo São Paulo in order to meet this obligation of 398 MW in its installed capacity. AES Tietê is also analyzing other wind, thermo and
hydro projects in order to expand its generation. Compliance with these rules could have a material impact on the Company.

Environmental Regulations. Electric sector companies are subject to strict federal, state and municipal environmental legislation
and regulations, relating to atmospheric emissions and specially protected areas. Such companies depend on permits and authorizations from government bodies in order to conduct their activities. In the event of a violation or noncompliance with such
laws, regulations, permits and authorizations, the company may suffer administrative sanctions such as fines, shutdown of activities, as well as revocations or invalidations of its permits and authorizations. In addition, the Public
Prosecutor’s Office may initiate both civil and criminal investigations and lawsuits against a company and its agents that are not in compliance with such laws, regulations, permits and authorizations, which may result in indemnities and
penalties. In addition, government agencies and other public authorities may delay the issuance of permits and necessary authorizations for the development of power companies causing project implementation delays and, consequently, unfavorable
effects in the companies’ businesses and results. Any such action by the government agencies may negatively affect businesses in the power sector and have adverse effects on the business and results of the companies, including our subsidiaries
in Brazil.

In 2011, a new Forestry Code bill was submitted to the Brazilian Congress for approval. The Forestry Code bill
provides for new rules regarding the use of the land and forests, such as the maximum extension of specially protected areas and the dismissal to reserve a specific area to be permanently preserved for generation companies. The impact of the new
rule on the energy sector depends on the final drafting of the bill which is currently under discussion.

Material
Regulatory Actions. On May 16, 2002, ANEEL issued Order #288, a regulation that established the retroactive denial of the choice of not participating in the “exposition relief mechanism,” a mechanism that allowed the sale of
energy from Itaipu Generating Co. in the spot market. Due to its negative impact, AES Sul filed a lawsuit seeking the annulment of Order #288. For a further discussion of this dispute see Item 3.—Legal Proceedings in this Form 10-K.

Potential or Proposed Regulations. AES Sul’s third tariff reset process will occur in 2013. AES
Eletropaulo’s tariff reset contractual date was originally in July 2011, but due to ANEEL’s delay in defining third cycle methodology, the process was postponed to 2012. AES Eletropaulo’s new tariffs, arising from the tariff reset
process, will produce retroactive effects on revenues as of July 4, 2011. Based on the best available information currently available, AES Eletropaulo has recorded a regulatory liability of $190 million related to effects from July 2011 to
December 2011. However, the ultimate impact on AES Eletropaulo’s results will not be determined until the methodology regarding the third cycle of tariff reset is fully defined, disclosed and applied to AES Eletropaulo and the regulatory asset
base for AES Eletropaulo is approved by ANEEL. It is possible that the final methodology may be less favorable than we anticipate, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.







Cameroon

Structure of Electricity Market. Our subsidiaries in Cameroon are involved in the generation, transmission, distribution and sale
of electricity through AES SONEL, Dibamba Power Development Company (“DPDC”) and Kribi Power Development Company (“KPDC”). AES SONEL is an integrated utility that operates approximately 930 MW of generation capacity, two
interconnected transmission networks and distributes electricity to approximately 700,000 customers under a 20-year concession agreement that was signed in July 2001. AES SONEL has the exclusive distribution rights to all medium voltage and low
voltage customers, except for customers with an installed capacity of more than 1 MW (“Major Customers”) who are free to negotiate bilateral agreements. Generation in Cameroon is open to competition and our subsidiary, DPDC, developed,
built and is currently operating an 86 MW heavy fuel oil power plant near Douala as an IPP, which provides power to AES SONEL under a tolling agreement. In order to meet increasing demand for power, the government is developing the Lom Pangar Dam
project on the Sanaga River, which will increase the flow of the Sanaga River and increase the generation capacity of the two major hydroelectric power plants currently operated by AES SONEL. The Lom Pangar Dam will also generate 50 MW. Another AES
subsidiary, KPDC, is currently building a 216 MW gas-fired power plant in Kribi as another IPP, which will provide power to AES SONEL under a power purchase agreement.

Under its Concession Agreement, AES SONEL operates the two interconnected transmission networks in the country: the Southern Grid with a length of 1550 km and the Northern Grid with a length of 665 km.
Major customers, distributors, or vendors can access the grid subject to paying a fee. Sales to low voltage and medium voltage customers are subject to tariff levels agreed to between AES SONEL and the regulator based on the framework established in
the AES SONEL Concession Agreement. Management of energy flow on the transmission network is currently undertaken by AES SONEL. Under the concession requirements, AES SONEL will be required to create a separate legal entity under which the
transmission system will operate. Under the current regulation, such entity is deemed to be a wholly-owned subsidiary of AES SONEL whose share capital will be opened up to other operators in the sector in accordance with procedures to be approved by
the regulator.

Principal Regulators. Cameroon’s electricity regulatory agency, ARSEL, has functional and
decision-making autonomy, and is run by a Board of Directors and a General Manager assisted by a Deputy General Manager. Its financing is provided by the state budget and fees collected from revenues generated from activities carried out by
operators of the sectors concerned. ARSEL’s decisions are highly influenced by the government via the Ministry of Power, the Prime Minister’s Office and the General Secretariat of the Presidency of the Republic. The Ministry of Energy and
Water is the Ministry mandated to issue specific regulations relating to the electricity sector and to issue the concessions, licenses and authorizations to be granted to the operators in the sector.

Principal Regulations. The principal legislative instrument governing the power sector is Law No. 2011/022 of
December 14, 2011, which sets out a new institutional framework for the Power Sector and lays the foundation for competition in the power market in Cameroon. It is supplemented by the following instruments:



•Decree No. 2000/464/PM of June 30, 2000, governing the activities of the power sector;



•Decree No. 2001/021/PM of January 29, 2001, setting out the rates and methods of calculation, collection and distribution of the fees payable
by operators involved in the power sector;



•Ministerial Order No. 061/CAB/MINMEE of January 30, 2001, setting out the documents and fees required in applying for concessions, licenses,
authorizations and declarations for the generation, transmission, distribution, export and sale of power;



•Ministerial Order No. 000013/MINMEE of January 26, 2009, approving the regulation of the public distribution of electricity in Cameroon; and



•Concession Agreements and licenses agreements between the Republic of Cameroon and AES SONEL signed on July 18, 2001 and amended in 2006.







Material Regulatory Issues. A tariff compensation agreement between AES Sonel and the
Republic of Cameroon was signed in November 2010. Abiding by the agreement, approximately $36 million of compensation was owed by the Republic of Cameroon to AES Sonel in December 2011 and an initial payment of approximately $11 million was paid at
that time. Further payments are scheduled for the first quarter of 2012. Agreement with the Regulator on the tariff mechanism for 2012 was reached in December 2011. The tariff reset is expected to be finalized by the end of January 2012.

The new Electricity Law promulgated in December 2011 established a Transmission Network Organization in the form of a Public Liability
Company. The law indicates that this organization’s “missions, organization and functioning shall be laid down by decree of the President of the Republic.” It is not yet clear when the Presidential Decree will be issued. It is also
unclear whether the new entity will operate the system, or operate, maintain and develop the system. In either case, this entity could possibly take responsibility for transmission activity and management of the transmission grid away from AES
SONEL. The impact on AES is not known at this time; however, it could be material to our results of operations.

Environmental Regulations. The principal environmental regulation is derived from Law No. 96/12 of August 5, 1996 and
various implementing decrees and ministerial orders. This regulation applies to all sectors but there are some specific requirements relating to the electricity sector. The main requirement of this regulation for our subsidiaries in Cameroon is the
obligation to conduct an environmental impact analysis for the planned construction of new generation installations, new transmission lines or substations.

Potential or Proposed Regulations. There are other generation projects whose regulatory specifications have yet to be clearly determined. The regulatory framework relating to the development of
this new capacity and to the future contractual relationship between these new projects and AES SONEL is still unclear. However, the tariff compensation agreement referred to above provides that additional costs imposed on AES SONEL with regard to
these projects shall be fully passed through in tariffs charged to end-users.

Chile

Structure of Electricity Market. In Chile, except for the small isolated systems of Aysén and Punta Arenas, generation
activities are principally in two electric grids: the Central Interconnected Grid (“SIC”), which supplies approximately 92% of the country’s population; and the Northern Interconnected Grid (“SING”), in which the principal
users are mining and industrial companies. Power generation is based primarily on long-term contracts between generation companies and their customers specifying the volume, price and conditions for the sale of energy and capacity. The law
recognizes two types of customers for generation companies: unregulated customers and regulated customers. Unregulated customers are principally consumers whose connected capacity is higher than 2 MW and consumers whose connected capacity is between
500 kW and 2 MW who have selected the unregulated pricing mechanism for a period of four years. These customers are not subject to price regulation and are able to freely negotiate prices and conditions for electricity supply with generation and
distribution companies. Regulated customers are those whose connected capacity is less than or equal to 500 kW and those with connected capacity between 500 kW and 2 MW who have selected, also for four years, the regulated pricing system.

Electricity generation in each of the SIC and the SING is coordinated by the respective independent Economic Load Dispatch
Center (“CDEC”) in order to minimize operational costs and ensure the highest economic efficiency of the system, while fulfilling all quality of service and reliability requirements established by current regulations. In order to satisfy
demand at the lowest possible cost at all times, each CDEC orders the dispatch of generation plants based strictly on variable generation costs, starting with the lowest variable cost, and does so independently of the contracts held by each
generation company. Thus, while the generation companies are free to enter into supply contracts with their customers and are obligated to comply with such contracts, the energy needed to satisfy demand is always produced by the CDEC members whose
variable production costs are lower than the system’s marginal cost at the time of dispatch. For this reason, in each hour a







given generator is either a net supplier to the system or a net buyer. Net buyers pay net suppliers for energy at the system’s marginal cost. In addition, the Chilean market is designed to
include payments for capacity (or firm capacity), which are explicitly paid to generation companies for contributing to the system’s sufficiency. The cost of investment and operation of transmission systems is paid for by generation companies
and consumers (regulated tolls) in proportion to their use.

Principal Regulators. The Chilean Ministry of Energy,
created in 2010, grants concessions for the provision of the public service of electric distribution and the National Commission for the Environment administers the system for evaluating the environmental impact of projects. Thermoelectric plants do
not require electrical concession agreements from the government in order to be built or to operate. The Ministry of Energy works with several agencies related to energy issues, such as the National Energy Commission (“NEC”), the
Electricity and Fuels Superintendent, Energy Efficiency Agency and the Chilean Nuclear Commission, among others, in order to coordinate energy affairs. The NEC establishes, regulates and coordinates energy policy. The Superintendent of Electricity
and Fuels oversees compliance with service quality and safety regulations. The General Water Authority issues the rights to use water for hydroelectric generation plants. The Chilean electrical system includes a Panel of Experts—an independent
technical agency whose purpose is to analyze and resolve in a timely fashion conflicts arising between companies within the electric sector and among one or more of these companies and the energy regulators. In addition, the Ministry of Environment
is responsible for the development and implementation of environmental regulations, protection of the environment, environmental education and pollution control, among others.

Principal Regulations. The distinct electricity sector activities are regulated by the General Electricity Services Law. Sector activities are also governed by the corresponding technical
regulations and standards. The keystones of electricity regulation include: (i) the regulated compulsory marginal cost dispatch based on audited variable costs; (ii) the contract-based wholesale generation market; (iii) an open-access
regime for transmission with benchmark regulation for existing transmission lines and auctions for new transmission facilities; (iv) benchmark regulation for the distribution grid; and (v) electricity retailing by distribution companies in
their exclusive concession areas.

In accordance with the law, new contracts assigned by distribution companies for energy
consumption must be awarded to generation companies based on the lowest supply price offered in public bid processes. These prices, called “long-term node prices,” include indexation formulas and are valid for the entire term of the
contract, up to a maximum of 15 years. More precisely, the long-term energy node price for a particular contract is the lowest energy price offered by the generation companies participating in each respective bid process, while the long-term
capacity node price is that set in the node price decree in effect at the time of the bid.

In August 2011, President
Sebástian Piñera’s administration extended the energy decree that enables the government to take preventive measures to reduce the risk of future energy shortages in the SIC. At present, Chile is experiencing a significant drought
that has diminished the country’s reservoir levels and hydroelectric power capacity in the SIC. The decree will remain in force until April 2012 and includes three main actions: (i) diminishing available voltage by 10%-12.5%;
(ii) saving reservoir capacity for up to 500 GWh; and (iii) offering incentives for consumers to save electricity. The decree is not expected to have a material impact on AES Gener’s results.

Environmental Regulations. Law 20,257, enacted in April 2008, promotes nonconventional renewable energy sources, such as solar,
wind, small hydroelectric and biomass energy sources. This law requires every electricity generator to supply a certain portion of its total contractual obligations to supply electricity with nonconventional renewable energy (“NCRE”). The
required amount is determined based on contract agreements executed after August 31, 2007. The NCRE requirement is equal to 5% for the period from 2010 through 2014, and thereafter the required percentage increases by 0.5% each year, to a
maximum of 10% by 2024. The obligation to supply a required percentage is currently required through 2034. Generation companies are able to meet this requirement by developing their own NCRE generation capacity (wind, solar, biomass, geothermal and







small hydroelectric technology), or purchasing their NCRE supply from qualified generators, purchasing from other generators that generated NCREs in excess of their own requirements during the
previous year or by paying the applicable fines for noncompliance.

Our businesses in Chile currently fulfill our NCRE
requirements by utilizing our own biomass power plants and by purchasing NCREs generated by other generation companies. To date, we have sold certain water rights to companies that are developing small hydroelectric projects, entering into power
purchase agreements with these companies in order to promote development of these projects, while at the same time meeting our own NCRE requirements.

On June 23, 2011, a new regulation on air emission standards for thermoelectric power plants became effective. This regulation provides for stringent limits on emission of particulate matter and
gases produced by the combustion of solid and liquid fuels, particularly coal. For existing plants, including those currently under construction, the new limits for particulate matter emission will go into effect by the end of 2013 and the new
limits for SO2, NOXand mercury emission will begin to apply in June 2015. In order to
comply with the new emission standards, we estimate that AES Gener will have to invest approximately $280 million between 2012 and 2015, including its proportional investment in an equity-method investee, Guacolda. AES Gener is currently in the
process of requesting equipment offers in order to determine the exact investment amounts and the timing of each investment.

Potential or Proposed Regulations. A proposed law that would provide new NCRE incentives is under discussion in the Congress. The
proposed law increases the requirements of NCRE beginning 2015, such requirements reaching 20% as a percentage of customer demand in 2020. The new requirements would need to be fulfilled with NCRE coming from the same grid (the SIC or the SING) as
the electricity it offsets. The NCRE would have to be accredited by the NEC, which may impose fines for noncompliance. The impact to AES Gener is under analysis; however, it will depend on the new size limit of small run-of-river hydroelectric units
and if the new requirement is applied to existing power supply contracts, which only include the 10% NCRE component required by the current law. The proposed law, if passed, could result in increased costs or otherwise have a material impact on our
results of operations.

In September 2010, the NEC proposed new Ancillary Services (“AS”) standards designed to
regulate AS transactions among generators for frequency regulation, spinning reserve, nonoperating reserve and automatic load shedding. AES Gener submitted comments on the proposed standards. AES Gener is assessing the potential impact of this
regulation, although an estimate of the impact can only be established when the final regulation is issued. However, if passed, the regulations could result in required investments or other increased costs which could have a material and adverse
impact on our results of operations.

In May 2011, the government created a Commission on Electric Power Development
(“CADE”), formed by independent specialists in the sector. The administration requested that the CADE review the current problems in the electricity sector. This commission presented its final report in November 2011 with suggestions for
distinct electric regulations including: energy policy and institutional framework, penetration of renewables, transmission system expansions, and competition in generation and generation planning. AES Gener expects the government to adopt certain
proposals based on the CADE’s recommendations.

Colombia

Structure of Electricity Market. Colombia has one main national interconnected system (the “SIN”). The wholesale market
is organized around both bilateral contracts and a mandatory pool and spot market for all generation units larger than 20 MW.

In the spot market, each unit bids its availability and a set price for a 24-hour period. The dispatch is arranged from lowest to highest
bid price and the spot price is set by the marginal price. There are two types of customers: unregulated customers and regulated customers. Unregulated customers are consumers whose







maximum capacity consumption is higher than 0.1 MW, or whose energy demand is greater than 55 MWh/month. These customers are not subject to price regulation; therefore, generators or trader
companies are able to freely negotiate prices and conditions for electricity supply with them. Regulated customers have their prices determined by means of public tenders.

Electricity generation in the Colombian system is coordinated by the market administrator whose goal is to minimize operational costs while fulfilling all quality-of-service and reliability requirements
established by current regulations. In order to satisfy demand at the lowest possible cost at all times, market administrator orders the dispatch of generation plants based on offer price (variable cost plus reliability charge) by merit, starting
with the lowest offer price, and does so independent of the contracts held by each generation company. For this reason, in each hour a given generator is either a net supplier to the system or a net buyer. Net buyers pay net suppliers the
system’s spot price. In addition, the Colombian market is designed to include reliability payments, which are paid to generation companies for contributing to the system’s sufficiency. The costs of investment and operation of transmission
systems are borne by the consumers in proportion to their use.

Principal Regulators. The Ministry of Mines and Energy
(“MME”) establishes the energy policies and the Regulatory Commission of Electricity and Gas (“CREG”) was created to foster the efficient supply of energy through regulation of the wholesale market, the natural monopolies of
transmission, and distribution, and by setting limits for horizontal and vertical integration. The Ministry of the Environment (“MMA”) establishes the environmental policies.

The Public Services Superintendence supervises the correct provision of utilities and the Industry and Commerce Superintendence is in
charge of sanctioning any anticompetitive practice. Other entities that have an impact on the electric system include the Energy Planning Unit (“UPME”), in charge of planning the electricity and gas system, and the National Development
Planning Office (“DNP”), whose main role is to develop a general development plan for the government.

Principal
Regulations. The laws of Domiciliary Public Services and the Electricity Law set the institutional arrangement and the general regulatory framework for the electricity sector. The keystones of the electricity regulation are: (i) the
dispatch is based on an offer price that represents the variable cost of the plants; (ii) a contract-based wholesale generation market; (iii) an open access regime for transmission with revenue regulated for existent transmission lines and
open bids for new lines; (iv) revenue regulated for the distribution grid; and (v) electricity retail can be performed by distribution and/or traders.

The spot market started in July 1995, and in 1996 a capacity payment was introduced for a term of ten years. In December 2006, a regulation was enacted that replaced the capacity charge with the
reliability charge and established two implementation periods. The first period consists of a transition period from December 2006 to November 2012 during which the price is equal to $13.045 per MWh and volume is determined based on each
plant’s firm energy which is prorated so that the total firm energy level does not exceed system demand. During the second period, which begins on December 2012, the reliability charge will be determined based on the energy price and the volume
of offers submitted by market participants bidding for new capacity for the system. The first reliability charge auction was held in May 2008 with the following results: (i) the reliability charge for existing plants for the period between
December 2012 and November 2013 will be $13.998 per MWh; (ii) for new plants that won the auction, the charge will be paid for twenty years starting December 2012; and (iii) three new projects won the auction for a total capacity of 430 MW
starting in 2012. The new methodology established in 2006 recognized the reliability provide by Chivor’s system and favored the company by increasing the reliability charge by approximately 120%, moving from $18 million in 2006 to almost $40
million in 2007 and is expected to remain at the same amount per year until 2015.

Environmental Regulations. In
Colombia, Law 99 created the MMA (Ministry of the Environment) in 1993. This law requires projects that affect the land or impact the environment to obtain a license from the MMA. While regional environmental authorities can issue licenses for
generation projects with capacity of less than







100 MW, only the MMA has the authority to issue licenses for the construction of large-scale generation or transmission projects with 100 MW capacity or greater. Chivor initiated operations in
1977 through a water concession, the only environmental requirement at that time. In August 1995, the MMA began requiring hydroelectric plants, including Chivor, to fulfill the requirements of an “Environmental Management Plan,” which
serves as an environmental operating permit. Each year, Chivor has to demonstrate to the environmental authorities that the obligations included in such plan are being fulfilled. Additionally, hydroelectric plants must contribute 6% of their gross
generation and thermal plants 4% of their gross generation to the area of influence valued at a special tariff defined by CREG. In 2008, MMA issued Resolution 909 that regulates the emission of thermal power plants. This resolution is not expected
to affect Chivor because it is a hydroelectric plant, but could affect AES if we decide to acquire or build a thermal plant in Colombia.

Potential or Proposed Regulations. CREG (Regulatory Commission of Electricity and Gas) issued a proposal to create the Organized Regulated Market (“MOR”). The MOR will replace the current
bilateral contracts markets (between traders/utilities and generators) by putting in place a centralized auction in which the market administrator buys energy for all regulated customers served by the traders/utilities. The main provisions contained
in the proposal are: (i) it is mandatory for all traders/utilities to buy energy at the auction price and it is voluntary for sellers (generators and trade companies) to offer energy in each auction; (ii) there is one single price for the
energy sales in the auction; (iii) the auctions are held one year before the actual dispatch and the commitment period of the auction is one year; and (iv) four auctions are to be established per year. Bilateral contracts executed before
the beginning of the MOR’s operation will not suffer any change and will remain valid. A definitive resolution will be issued in the first half of 2011.

As a part of CREG regulatory agenda for 2011, the regulator is planning to review the lessons learned from the dry conditions brought by the 2009-10 “El Niño” phenomenon and issue
regulations for these extreme events, permitting players to know in advance the additional reliability measures that the regulator may take under those circumstances. Also, CREG is planning to issue regulations that will strengthen the energy market
by improving the spot market guarantees plan, and establish measures to control market power from pivotal agents (agents needed at any cost to fulfill the demand requirements). This last initiative may affect spot prices which could impact our sales
not covered by contracts.

Dominican Republic

Structure of Electricity Market. The Dominican Republic has one main interconnected system with approximately 3,000 MW of installed
capacity, composed primarily of thermal generation (85%) and hydroelectric power plants. AES Dominicana has 28% share of this capacity (849 MW) and supplies approximately 40% of energy demand through 3 power generators. The regulatory framework
in the Dominican Republic consists of: decentralized industry; unbundled generation, transmission and distribution; regulated







prices in monopolistic segments (transmission and distribution); and a competitive wholesale generation market. In accordance with this regulatory structure, all agents and electric generation,
transmission and distribution companies must conduct their operations to provide the best service at minimum cost and comply with standards of quality, safety, continuity of services and conservation of the environment.

The wholesale market is composed of the long-term Power Purchase Agreements and the spot market. The wholesale market is based on a
marginal market divided in capacity, energy and ancillaries services (frequency regulation, compensation, and reactive power).

The energy market is based on a centralized economic dispatch. The Organismo Coordinador (“OC”) is in charge of planning and
supervision of operations through the “Centro del Control del SENI,” which is in charge of real-time dispatch. The dispatch of the thermal units is based on auditable declared variable costs and, for the hydroelectric units, the variable
cost is equal to zero, meaning that these units are the first for dispatch and reflect optimal system costs. The spot market relies on competitive bidding based on each generator’s variable costs as a means of providing a merit order for
dispatch. Variable cost information is submitted weekly by the generators to the OC, which then determines the merit order for dispatch based on this information.

The capacity market is based on the availability of a power plant to cover the maximum demand during the year with a price that financially covers the fixed cost of a 50 MW gas turbine generation
installed in Dominican Republic with a 10% of reserve.

For the sale of electricity under long-term contracts, the regulatory
framework establishes that the sale of electricity of a generating company to a distribution company will be done at prices resulting from the competitive procedures of public bidding. These bids are governed by the conditions established by the
Superintendency of Electricity (“SIE”) which supervises the bidding and awarding process. With the objective of ensuring that generation prices represent reasonable values in the market, the SIE ensures that the sale of electricity through
contracts is not greater than 80% of interconnected electric energy demand, and that the spot market represents a minimum of 20% of the total national consumption of the interconnected system annually. AES Dominicana has 90% of its capacity under
long term contracts and is the main generator that provides frequency regulation services.

The electricity tariff applicable
to regulated customers is subject to regulation within the concessions of the distribution companies. Electricity end-users are considered customers of public services according to regulations, hence the tariff is set by resolution of the SIE. For
clients with demand above 1.2 MW who are classified as unregulated customers, tariffs are unregulated.

Principal
Regulators. In order to regulate the electric sector and implement the provisions contained in the General Electricity Law No. 125-01 and its by-law, two regulators are responsible for monitoring and ensuring compliance with the law: the
National Energy Commission (“CNE”) and the SIE. All electric companies (generators, transmission and distributors), are subject to and regulated by the General Electricity Law, whether they are of national and/or foreign capital, private
and/or public.

In general, CNE’s main responsibilities are to draft and coordinate the legal framework and regulatory
legislation; propose and adopt policies and procedures to assure best practices; draft plans to ensure the proper functioning and development of the energy sector and propose them to the Executive Branch; ensure compliance with the law; promote
investment decisions in accordance with these plans; and advise the Executive Branch on all matters related to the energy sector. The SIE’s main responsibilities are to develop, ensure compliance with and analyze the structure and level of
prices of electricity and to set the rates and tolls subject to regulation. SIE also reviews electricity rate levels requested by companies, monitors and supervises compliance with legal provisions and rules and monitors compliance with the
technical procedures governing generation, transmission, distribution and commercialization of electricity. In addition, SIE supervises electric market behavior in order to avoid monopolistic practices and applies penalties and fines in the cases of
noncompliance with the laws and regulations.







Principal Regulations. The energy sector regulatory framework in the Dominican
Republic is governed primarily by:



•General Electricity Law 125-01, its by-law and its amendment by Law 186-07 constitute the legal framework that regulates all phases related to the
production, transmission, distribution and commercialization of electricity, as well as the functions of state agencies created by this law and related to these matters. The regulatory framework in the Dominican electricity market establishes a
methodology for calculating the firm capacity for each power generation unit.



•Renewable Energy Incentives Law 57-07 establishes incentives for renewable energy, mainly income tax exemption, import taxes reduction, as well as
special operational, technical and commercial treatment. The law applies to hydroelectric generation with a capacity equal to or below 5 MW, wind generation with a capacity less than 50 MW, biomass generation with a capacity less than 80 MW,
photovoltaic generation, and thermo-solar generation with a capacity less than 120 MW.



•Hydrocarbons Law 112-00 establishes a tax on consumption of fossil fuels. All fossil fuels including natural gas used to produce electricity have a tax
exemption under the law and any change in this regulation does not affect AES Dominicana as a natural gas provider. All agents that use any fossil fuel to produce electricity must file a request to the CNE and the Industry and Commerce Ministry to
apply for this exemption.



•Industry and Commerce Ministry periodic resolutions for technical and price regulations for vehicular natural gas use (transportation).

In addition, the Dominican government has directly exercised varying degrees of regulation over the
electricity market and AES Dominicana’s businesses in the past, such as involvement in the renegotiation of the existing PPAs, oversight responsibilities of the SENI and environmental controls. No assurance can be given that the Dominican
government will not alter regulations in the future in a way that will negatively affect AES Dominicana’s businesses, financial conditions or results of operations.

Environmental Regulations. The main environmental regulations are the General Law on Environment and Natural Resources 64-00 and the Regulation and Licensing Systems Environmental Permits by-law.
These regulations provide for centralized environmental planning by the state through the integration of environmental protection and economic development plans in a common approach and policy throughout the sector. Environmental regulation takes
the form of permits or environmental licenses, environmental quality standards and environmental reporting. The main regulatory institutions are:



•The Ministry for the Environment and Natural Resources, which is responsible for implementing and designing the policy for the conservation and
protection of the environment and natural resources in the Dominican Republic;



•National Council of Environment and Natural Resources, which is the link between the various Ministries of State in charge of evaluating the impact of
environmental policies; and



•Deputy Attorney General for the Defense of the Environment and Natural Resources, which is responsible for performing the actions by the State
Environmental conflicts environment.

Despite extensive compliance plans in place by each of the entities,
it is possible AES Dominicana generating units could fall out of compliance with such environmental standards. Such non-compliance, and resulting penalties or bad publicity might negatively affect the financial results of AES Dominicana. One such
penalty could be a requirement that AES Dominicana operates its offending unit below its rated capacity, and such unavailability might affect compliance with obligations under its PPAs. In such a scenario, AES Dominicana might need to make
significant investments in environmental-related infrastructure. In addition, the environmental laws and regulations may become more stringent and AES Dominicana might be forced to make certain investments to be compliant with the new standards.







Potential or Proposed Regulations. During the last quarter of 2011 the regulatory
agencies, CNE, SIE and OC set up a task force to review some elements of current regulations. The three regulatory proposals being discussed would: (1) modify the spot price cap with a 5% increase; (2) provide compensation to generation
companies in situations where variable costs exceed the spot price (making production of electricity uneconomical) to help meet demand and ensure energy security; and (3) modify the regulations related to frequency regulation, under which
(a) generators may have to contribute a percentage of available power as frequency margin which may or may not be paid and plants unable to provide the margin will be required to purchase it or (b) higher variable cost units will provide
the margin with compensation.

El Salvador

Structure of Electricity Market. The Salvadorean electricity market is composed of a single interconnected system. Under the
General Electricity Law (“GEL”), competition was introduced in generation and trading; additional regulations were implemented related to price and quality of service in non-competitive segments such as distribution, transmission, system
operation and administration.

The wholesale electricity market is based on a contract market and a spot market. The contract
market is further classified into bilateral contracts, which are freely negotiated by electricity generators, distributors, and trading companies, and regulated contracts, which are the product of regulated public bids carried out by the
distribution companies under the supervision of the Regulator, Superintendencia General de Electricidad y Telecomunicaciones (“SIGET”). The Spot Market operates on the basis of bids and prices corresponding to increases or decreases of the
quantities of electricity established in a scheduled dispatch.

Starting in February 2012, the distribution companies are
required to acquire 70% of their forecasted demand through regulated bids. The spot market is structured as a day-ahead market, and transactions are settled on a monthly basis. The Transmission System and Wholesale Market Operating Rules have been
amended to convert the wholesale market price-setting mechanism from a competitive bidding process into audited variable production costs and the amendments became effective on August 1, 2011.

Distribution companies are regulated under an incentive system, specifically a Revenue Cap system, whereby the maximum tariff to be
charged to the end-users is subject to the approval of SIGET. The components of the electricity tariff are (i) charges for the use of the distribution network (the “Distribution Charge”), (ii) customer service costs (the
“Service Charge”) and (iii) average energy price (the “Energy Charge”). Both the Distribution Charge and Service Charge are based on average capital costs as well as operation and maintenance costs of an efficient
distribution company. The Distribution Charge and Service Charge are approved by SIGET every five years and have two adjustments: (i) an annual adjustment considering the inflation variation and (ii) an automatic adjustment in April, July
and October, provided that the change in inflation is greater than 10%.

Competition is encouraged by the GEL and it provides
the end user with the option to acquire its electricity from a distribution company or an electricity trader. The distribution and transmission companies are mandated by the GEL to allow the use of the distribution grid to traders in order to
deliver electricity to their customers. The grid access terms, including tariffs, are detailed in a “distribution contract” registered and regulated by SIGET.

Principal Regulators. SIGET is the independent regulatory authority established through the GEL. SIGET’s principal responsibilities and attributions are the approval of Distribution Value
Added Charges (“DVA”), enforcement of sector regulation, dispute resolution among market participants, granting concessions for hydroelectric and geothermal projects, among others.

In addition, the National Energy Council (Consejo Nacional de Energia or CNE), formed in 2007, is the policy-making entity, whose board
of directors is composed of the Secretaries of Treasury, Economy, Public Works, Environmental and Natural Resources and the Consumer Protection Agency.







Principal Regulations. The electricity sector is governed by the General Electricity
Act, the General Electricity Act Regulations, the Transmission System & Wholesale Market Operating Regulations and the general and specific orders issued by SIGET, under its statutory attributions.

Environmental Regulations. The Environment and Natural Resources Act (“ENRA”), enacted in 1998, and the regulation
promulgated therein, enacted in 2000, set forth environmental requirements in El Salvador. These statutes empower the Environment and Natural Resources Secretary to set environmental policy, and ENRA establishes a duty of care to the environment and
orders the sustainable use of natural resources. Additionally, ENRA sets forth environmental permitting requirements for the handling of certain potentially hazardous or risky materials or performing certain activities in the environment, such as
the construction and operation of power plants (except fuel oil) and transmission lines.

Material
Regulatory Actions. The Energy Charge has been, under current methodology, adjusted every six months to reflect the spot market price for electricity during the previous six months. However, starting on January 12, 2011, the energy charge
has been adjusted quarterly. Presidential Decree 160 was published on December 23, 2010 and went into effect on January 1, 2011. This decree shortens the Energy Charge reset period from six months to three months; the new Energy Charge
reset dates will be January 12th, April 12th, July 12th and October 12theach year. The reduction of the Energy Charge reset period reduces the distribution companies’ cash flow exposure before any significant spike in energy prices since the lag between energy revenues
and costs has been reduced by half.

Potential or Proposed Regulations. The Regulator, jointly with the Distribution
Companies of El Salvador (AES El Salvador and Del Sur) are in the process of reviewing and changing the methodology of the tariffs calculation, and this process will take place during the first quarter of 2012. The outcome of the new methodology
will be used to calculate the new tariffs to be applied for the period from 2013 to 2017.

Currently the calculation of the
distribution and commercialization charges are carried out by the evaluation/comparison against a model company, which will be replaced by the utilization of a real company (using actual costs instead of modeled costs). The impact of a change in
methodology is not known, but it could be material.

Nigeria

Structure of Electricity Market. In Nigeria, the state-owned entity, Power Holding Company of Nigeria (“PHCN”), holds
approximately 80% of the electricity market share. Private power generating companies account for the remaining 20%. The private power generating companies, one of which is AES Nigeria Barge Ltd. (“AESNB”), maintain long-term
contracts with PHCN, the sole off taker.

All power transmission operations are currently carried out by PHCN. Under new
political initiatives and reforms, as provided under the Roadmap for Power Sector Reforms (“the Power Roadmap”), there are indications that 11 distribution companies and six generation companies would be fully privatized while the
Transmission Company of Nigeria (“TCN”) would continue to be owned by the government, but managed by the private sector. Currently, all electricity generation is from either gas-fired or hydro power plants. Most assets are owned by
state-owned companies, though some private investors have been able to establish IPPs following recent reforms. In addition, the government is developing approximately 4,800 MW of installed capacity intended to be completed by 2013, known as the
National Integrated Power Plants (“NIPPs”). The Presidential Task Force on Power has announced its intention to privatize the NIPPs in future rounds of privatization, following completion of construction.

Principal Regulators. The Nigerian Electricity Regulatory Commission (“NERC”) is an independent regulatory agency that
was established under the 2005 Reform Act to undertake both the technical and economic regulation of the Nigerian electricity sector. It is responsible for general oversight functions, including the licensing of operators, setting of tariffs and
establishing industry standards for future electricity sector development.







Two of the NERC’s key regulatory functions are licensing and tariff regulation. Since
AESNB operates under a long-term bilateral agreement with PHCN, it is not subject to the tariff setting process. On the basis of the current reforms embodied in the Power Roadmap, a number of new regulatory and/or other governing bodies will be
established to regulate the industry.

Principal Regulations. In March 2005, the Nigerian President signed the Electric
Power Sector Reform Bill into law, enabling private companies to participate in transmission and distribution, in addition to electricity generation that had previously been legalized. The government has since separated PHCN into eleven distribution
firms, six generating companies, and a transmission company, in preparation for privatization.

Several events, including
union opposition, have delayed the privatization indefinitely; however, the current government has put significant emphasis on completing the privatization of the eighteen successor companies of the PHCN in 2012. There are clauses in the AESNB PPA
that, upon the effective date of a privatization, require the business to use all reasonable endeavors to obtain and acquire all fuel necessary for the operation of the plant. Additionally, the off-taker will be transferred from PHCN to Lagos State
as also stated in the PPA. However, the government has recently set up the Nigerian Bulk Electricity Trader (“NBET”), an entity that is intended to be the off-taker between the generation and distribution companies backed by World Bank
Partial Risk Guarantees (“PRGs”). The NEBT is expected to take over the off taker function from PHCN once it becomes fully privatized. No material impact to our operations is expected at this time because of this reform.

The 2005 Reform Act and NERC regulations provides for a generation license to have duration of 10 years, renewable for a further five
years. This is in line with a current proposal for a uniform tariff for the power sector, MYTO, which is derived from a building blocks approach that anticipates a cost-reflective outcome, including a capacity and an energy component; financing
costs and other key costs (operating costs, depreciation) and key fluctuating costs (fuel costs, foreign exchange, inflation). A total license and uniform tariff duration of 15 years may present challenges to potential investors given that 15 years
may be shorter than the useful life of assets and shorter than the tenor of potential long-term debt financing. A new proposal to increase the license duration to 20 years has been proposed, but this issue has not been resolved. Potential inadequate
gas supply and transmission constraints, which may pose a risk to continuous generation in the numerous proposed gas generation plants, may be viewed as additional risks by investors.

Panama

Structure of Electricity Market

Empresas Publicas de Medellin

Gas Natural Fenosa

Principal Regulators. The National Secretary
of Energy (“SNE”) was created by Law 52 on July 30, 2008 and reorganized by Law 43 of April 2011 (in which SNE became a Ministry); and has the responsibilities of







planning, investigating, directing, supervising and controlling policies of the energy sector within Panama. With these responsibilities, the Secretariat has defined strategies and policies for
the Republic of Panama, which include promoting energy security for the benefit of the population and the country’s development, and proposing laws and regulations to the executive agency that promote the procurement of electrical energy,
hydrocarbons and alternative energy in the best conditions for the country.

The regulator of public services, known as the
National Authority of Public Services (“ASEP”), was created by Law 26 on January 29, 1996. ASEP is an autonomous agency of the government, with legal responsibility and self-patrimony. ASEP is responsible for the control and oversight
of public services, such as potable water, sewerage, electricity, telecommunications and radio and television systems, as well as the transmission and distribution of natural gas utilities and the companies that provide such services. ASEP’s
mission is to ensure the efficient provision of the public services, as well as national, technical, commercial, and environmental quality standards.

Principal Regulations. In the Republic of Panama, the electricity sector is regulated by Law No. 6 issued in February 1997 which was subsequently amended several times. The most recent
amendment was Law 58 on May 30, 2011. Some notable amendments by Law 58 were: (i) creation of the Rural Electrification Fund, which will be administered by the government to provide service to rural and poor areas of the country; and
(ii) obligation of all market participants to contribute up to 1% of their net income before income tax to the Fund. A compilation of Law 6, including all amendments, was issued on September 14, 2011.

Environmental Regulations. ASEP issued Resolution AN No. 3932-Elec on October 22, 2010 related to the security of dams
in the electricity sector. The Law became effective on November 9, 2011 but provided for a two month grace period for compliance. This legislation set a number of protocols for modifications of the dam structure, dam operations and reservoirs
monitoring during floods, among others. In order to comply with such regulations, our subsidiaries in Panama have conducted an internal review of emergency procedures during flood events and reviewed dam safety requirements, processes and
procedures. These requirements, processes and procedures have been submitted to external consultants in order to verify full compliance with the regulations and to advise and update any of our processes and procedures as necessary.

Material Regulatory Actions. By virtue of Resolutions No. 4493 and 4494 of June 7, 2011 ASEP cancelled the Concession
Rights for the CHAN 140 project and administratively terminated the CHAN 220 Concession (both Concessions were to become the Changuinola II Project). AES subsidiaries filed two reconsideration actions before the regulator but both were denied.
Following the judicial alternatives provided by the Panamanian legal framework, our subsidiaries filed actions for the protection of constitutional guarantees and claims before the Third Chamber of the Supreme Court against both resolutions.

ASEP has started a sanctioning process against certain of our subsidiaries in Panama due to the late payment of the market
settlement for the month of August 2011. AES paid the settlement on October 20, 2011 (approximately 15 days late) once it received the over cost payment (due to the previously disclosed Esti tunnel collapse) from the government. The regulator
has the legal capacity to issue fines up to $20 million.

Potential or Proposed Regulations. ASEP has
made a proposal to modify the regulatory criteria for the design of bids for Financial Rights of Access to Interconnection Capacity (“DFACI”) between Panama and Colombia, which were approved by Resolution 4507 of June 2011. This proposal
includes restrictions on generators’ ability to acquire DFACI if their capability to generate exceeds the maximum percentage of electric consumption that the local laws allow them to provide, which could adversely affect our ability to bid for
interconnection capacity in the market.







North America

Mexico

Structure of Electricity Market. Mexico has a single national electricity grid (referred to as the “National Interconnected System”), covering nearly all of Mexico’s territory. The
only exception is the Baja California peninsula which has its own separate electricity system. Article 27 of the Mexican Constitution reserves the generation, transmission, transformation, distribution and supply of electric power exclusively
to the Mexican State for the purpose of providing a “public service.”

Since 1995 the power sector legal framework
partially opened to private entities under the following schemes: cogeneration; self supply; IPP exports; and imports for self consumption. Private investments are allowed today in the sectors: transport, storage, and distribution. The Energy
Regulatory Commission (“CRE”) is in charge of issuing the permits related to the activities from the power and natural gas sectors that were open to private investment since 1995.

Principal Regulators. The Federal Electricity Commission (“CFE”), by virtue of Article 1 of the Energy Law, is
granted sole and exclusive responsibility for providing this public service as it relates to the supply, transmission and distribution of electric power.

Principal Regulations. In 1992, the Energy Law was amended to allow private parties to invest in certain activities in Mexico’s electrical power market, under the assumption that
“self-supply” generation of electric power is not considered a public service. These reforms allowed private parties to obtain permits from the Ministry of Energy for (i) generating power for self-supply; (ii) generating power
through co-generation processes; (iii) generating power through independent production; (iv) small-scale production; and (v) importing and exporting electrical power. Beneficiaries holding any of the permits contemplated under the
Energy Law are required to enter into PPAs with the CFE with regard to all surplus power produced. It is under this basis that AES’ Mérida and TEG/TEP facilities operate. Mérida provides power exclusively to CFE under a long-term
contract. TEG/TEP provides the majority of its output to two offtakers under long-term contracts, and can sell any excess or surplus energy produced to CFE at a predetermined day-ahead price.

Environmental Impact. Projects or activities that may disrupt the ecological balance or exceed the limits and conditions
established in the applicable laws or the regulations are subject to the conditions established by regulatory authorities to minimize the negative effects on the environment. Our businesses in Mexico must obtain authorization for matters with
environmental impacts from the regulatory authorities.

High risk activities are also regulated, even though there is no
specific definition for “high risk.” The Mexican Department of the Interior issued two lists defining high risk substances. The criteria used to determine whether an activity is of high risk is based on the characteristics or volume of the
substance used. If, in the event of a spill or release of a substance, it is possible to cause an explosion or significantly affect the environment, people or property, such substance will be considered “high risk.” Further, if a project
contemplates the use of a compound included in the lists issued by the regulator, in the necessary volumes, the responsible party must present a risk evaluation before the regulator.

Environmental Sanctions. The Attorney General’s Office for the Protection of the Environment is in charge of enforcing
environmental legal provisions in Mexico. The sanctions depend on the environmental obligations violated by individuals or corporations, and vary from fines that range from 50 to 50,000 days of minimum wage pay. Additional sanctions may also be
imposed, including the annulment of environmental permits and authorizations, partial or total closures of a facility, and administrative arrest.

Mexican Legislation provides that the energy sector is integrated by the electrical and petroleum sectors. Federation is the only one entitled to extract and process fossil fuels, as well as to generate
electricity; however, certain exceptions apply.







Renewable Energy. On October 25, 2008, the Renewable Energies and Financing of
the Energy Transition Law was approved by the Energy Committee of the Mexican House of Representatives. The law encourages generation and transportation of energy generated by renewable sources, giving certainty and lower costs to provide incentives
to participate in the private sector of this field.

In addition, the Federal government’s broad Special Program on
Climate Change (“SPECC”) was formally approved. The SPECC provides a program to reduce the effects of climate change. The principal actions proposed to achieve competitive levels, include the gradual substitution of oil for natural gas,
stimulating the implementation of cogeneration and other efficiency saving technologies and strongly stimulating the development of renewable energies.

Priority will be given to electricity generation from wind (up to 507 MW installed by 2012), geothermal energy (up to 153 MW installed by 2012), hydroelectric and solar power. The SPECC proposes a joint
program between public bodies and private investors in order to increase the amount of electricity generation capacity from renewable sources up to 1,957 MW by 2012.

The SPECC makes it clear that many of its objectives will be achieved through the following normative, economic and market instruments: accessible financing mechanisms; simplification procedures for
permitting; facilitation of electrical grid interconnection and transmission contracts; and stimulus for private investment in energy infrastructure. Our businesses in Mexico are still reviewing the impact of these developments on their operations;
however, they could be material to the business and results of operations.

United States

Structure of Electricity Market. The United States wholesale electricity market consists of multiple distinct regional markets that
are subject to both federal regulation, as implemented by the U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (“FERC”), and regional regulation as defined by rules designed and implemented by the Regional Transmission Organizations
(“RTOs”), non-profit corporations that operate the regional transmission grid and maintain organized markets for electricity. These rules for the most part govern such items as the determination of the market mechanism for setting the
system marginal price for energy and the establishment of guidelines and incentives for the addition of new capacity. The current regulatory framework in the United States is the result of a series of regulatory actions that have taken place over
the past several decades, as well as numerous policies adopted by both the federal government and the individual states that encourage competition in wholesale and retail electricity markets.

Principal Regulators. The federal government, through regulations promulgated by FERC, has primary jurisdiction over wholesale
electricity markets and transmission services. While there have been numerous federal statutes enacted during the past 34 years, including the Public Utility Regulatory Policy Act of 1978 (“PURPA”), the Energy Policy Act of 1992
(“EPAct 1992”) and the Energy Policy Act of 2005 (“EPAct 2005”), there are two fundamental regulatory initiatives implemented by FERC during that time frame that directly impact our United States businesses:



•FERC approval of market-based rate authority beginning in 1986 for many providers of wholesale generation; and



•FERC issuance of Order #888 in 1996 mandating the functional separation of generation and transmission operations and requiring utilities to provide
open access to their transmission systems.

FERC has civil penalty authority over violations of any
provision of Part II of the Federal Power Act (“FPA”) which concerns wholesale generation or transmission, as well as any rule or order issued thereunder. FERC is authorized to assess a maximum civil penalty of $1 million per violation for
each day that the violation continues. The FPA also provides for the assessment of criminal fines and imprisonment for violations under Part II of the FPA. This penalty authority was enhanced in EPAct 2005. With this expanded enforcement authority,
violations of the FPA and FERC’s regulations could potentially have more serious consequences than in the past.







Pursuant to EPAct 2005, the North America Reliability Corporation (“NERC”) has
been certified by FERC as the Electric Reliability Organization (“ERO”) to develop mandatory and enforceable electric system reliability standards applicable throughout the United States to improve the overall reliability of the electric
grid. These standards are subject to FERC review and approval. Once approved, the reliability standards may be enforced by FERC independently, or, alternatively, by the ERO and regional reliability organizations with responsibility for auditing,
investigating and otherwise ensuring compliance with reliability standards, subject to FERC oversight. Monetary penalties of up to $1 million per day per violation may be assessed for violations of the reliability standards.

Principal Regulations for Generation Businesses. Several of our generation businesses in the United States currently operate as
Qualifying Facilities (“QFs”) as defined under PURPA. These businesses entered into long-term contracts with electric utilities that had a mandatory obligation at that time, as specified under PURPA, to purchase power from QFs at the
utility’s avoided cost (i.e., the likely costs for both energy and capital investment that would have been incurred by the purchasing utility if that utility had to provide its own generating capacity or purchase it from another source). EPAct
2005 later amended PURPA to provide for the elimination of the mandatory purchase obligation in certain markets, but did so only on a prospective basis. Cogeneration facilities and small power production facilities that meet certain criteria can be
QFs. To be a QF, a cogeneration facility must produce electricity and useful thermal energy for an industrial or commercial process or heating or cooling applications in certain proportions to the facility’s total energy output, and must meet
certain efficiency standards. To be a QF, a small power production facility must generally use a renewable resource as its energy input and meet certain size criteria.

Principal Regulations for Traditional Utility Business. In addition to our generation businesses, we also own IPL, a vertically
integrated utility located in Indiana and DP&L, a vertically integrated utility located in Ohio.

A description of the
regulatory environment under which each operates is provided below:

Indianapolis Power & Light Company
(“IPL”)

As a regulated electric utility, IPL is subject to regulation by the FERC and the Indiana Utility
Regulatory Commission (“IURC”). As indicated below, the financial performance of IPL is directly impacted by the outcome of various regulatory proceedings before the IURC and FERC.

IPL is subject to regulation by the IURC with respect to the following: its services and facilities; the valuation of property; the
construction, purchase or lease of electric generating facilities; the classification of accounts; rates of depreciation; retail rates and charges; the issuance of securities (other than evidences of indebtedness payable less than twelve months
after the date of issue); the acquisition and sale of some public utility properties or securities; and certain other matters.







IPL’s tariff rates for electric service to retail customers (basic rates and charges)
are set and approved by the IURC after public hearings (“general rate cases”). General rate cases, which have occurred at irregular intervals, involve IPL, consumer advocacy groups, and other interested stakeholders. The last general rate
case for IPL was completed in 1995. In addition, pursuant to statute, the IURC is to conduct a periodic review of the basic rates and charges of all Indiana utilities at least once every four years, but the IURC has the authority to review the rates
of any Indiana utility at any time it chooses. Such reviews have not been subject to public hearings.

The majority of IPL
customers are served pursuant to retail tariffs that provide for the monthly billing or crediting to customers of increases or decreases, respectively, in the actual costs of fuel (including purchased power costs) consumed from estimated fuel costs
embedded in basic rates, subject to certain restrictions on the level of operating income. These billing or crediting mechanisms are referred to as “trackers.” This is significant because fuel and purchased power costs represent a large
and volatile portion of IPL’s total costs. In addition, IPL’s rate authority provides for a return on IPL’s investment and recovery of the depreciation and operation and maintenance expenses associated with certain IURC-approved
environmental investments. The trackers allow IPL to recover the cost of qualifying investments, including a return on investment, without the need for a general rate case.

IPL may apply to the IURC for a change in its fuel charge every three months to recover its estimated fuel costs, including the energy portion of purchased power costs, which may be above or below the
levels included in its basic rates and charges. IPL must present evidence in each fuel adjustment charge (“FAC”) proceeding that it has made every reasonable effort to acquire fuel and generate or purchase power, or both, so as to provide
electricity to its retail customers at the lowest cost reasonably possible.

Independent of the IURC’s ability to review
basic rates and charges, Indiana law requires electric utilities under the jurisdiction of the IURC to meet operating expense and income test requirements as a condition for approval of requested changes in the FAC. Additionally, customer refunds
may result if IPL’s rolling twelve-month operating income, determined at quarterly measurement dates, exceeds IPL’s authorized annual jurisdictional net operating income and there are no sufficient applicable cumulative net operating
income deficiencies against which the excess rolling twelve-month jurisdictional net operating income can be offset.

In
IPL’s fourteen most recently approved FAC filings (FAC 81 through 94), the IURC found that IPL’s rolling annual jurisdictional retail electric net operating income was lower than the authorized annual jurisdictional net operating income.
FAC 94 includes the twelve months ended October 31, 2011. In IPL’s FAC 76 through 80 filings, the IURC found that IPL’s rolling annual jurisdictional retail electric net operating income was greater than the authorized annual
jurisdictional net operating income. Because IPL has a cumulative net operating income deficiency, IPL has not been required to make customer refunds in its FAC proceedings. However, IPL has previously offered voluntary credits to its customers to
allay concerns raised by the IURC regarding IPL’s level of earnings.

IPL may apply to the IURC for approval of a rate
adjustment known as the Environmental Compliance Cost Recovery Adjustment (“ECCRA”) every six months to recover costs to install and/or upgrade Clean Coal Technology (“CCT”) equipment. The total amount of IPL’s CCT equipment
approved for ECCRA recovery as of December 31, 2011 was $615 million. The jurisdictional revenue requirement that was approved by the IURC to be included in IPL’s rates for the six month period from September 2011 through February 2012 was
$49 million.

In February 2009, an IPL customer filed a complaint claiming IPL’s tree trimming practices were
unreasonable and expressed concerns with language contained in IPL’s tariff that addressed IPL’s tree trimming and tree removal rights. Subsequently, the IURC initiated a generic investigation into electric utility tree trimming practices
and tariffs in Indiana. In November 2010, the IURC issued an order in the investigation, which imposed additional requirements on the conduct of tree trimming. The order included requirements on utilities to provide advance customer notice and
obtain customer consent or additional easements if existing







easements and rights of way are insufficient to permit pruning in accordance with the required industry standards or in the event that a tree would need to have more than 25% of its canopy
removed. The order also directed that a rulemaking would be initiated to further address vegetation management practices.

On
July 7, 2011, the IURC issued an additional tree trimming order which did not provide the relief IPL was seeking, but clarified utility customer notice requirements and the relationship of the order to property rights and tariff requirements.
It also clarified that in cases of emergency or public safety, utilities may, without customer consent, remove more than 25% of a tree or trim beyond existing easement or right of way boundaries to remedy the situation. The IURC is currently in the
process of promulgating formal rules to implement the order. IPL and other interested parties are participating in this rulemaking process. It is not possible to predict the outcome of the rulemaking process, but this could adversely impact
IPL’s distribution reliability and significantly increase IPL’s vegetation management costs and the costs of defending IPL’s vegetation management program in litigation, which could have a material impact on IPL’s consolidated
financial statements.

IPL is a member of the Midwest Independent System Operator, Inc. (“MISO”). The MISO serves as
the third-party operator of IPL’s transmission system and runs the day-ahead and real-time energy and ancillary services markets (“ASM”) for its members.

IPL previously transferred functional control of its transmission facilities to the MISO and IPL’s transmission operations were integrated with those of the MISO. IPL’s participation and
authority to sell wholesale power at market-based rates are subject to the FERC jurisdiction. Transmission service over IPL’s facilities is now provided through the Midwest ISO’s tariff.

As a member of the MISO, IPL offers its generation and bids its demand into the market on a day ahead basis and settles differences in
real-time. The MISO settles energy hourly offers and bids based on locational marginal prices, which is pricing for energy at a given location based on a market clearing price that takes into account physical limitations, generation and demand
throughout the MISO region. The MISO evaluates the market participants’ energy offers and demand bids optimizing for energy and ancillary services products to economically and reliably dispatch the entire MISO system. The IURC has authorized
IPL to recover the fuel portion of its costs from the MISO, including all specifically identifiable ASM costs, through FAC proceedings, and to defer certain operational, administrative and other costs from the MISO and seek recovery in IPL’s
next basic rate case proceeding. Total MISO costs deferred by IPL as long-term regulatory assets were $80.4 million and $71.0 million as of December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010, respectively.

Beginning in 2007, MISO transmission owners including IPL began to share the costs of transmission expansion projects with other
transmission owners after such projects were approved by the MISO board of directors. Upon approval by the MISO board of directors the transmission owners must make a good faith effort to build and/or pay for the projects. Costs allocated to IPL for
the projects of other transmission owners are collected by the MISO per their tariff.

On July 21, 2011, the FERC issued
Order 1000, amending the transmission planning and cost allocation requirements established in Order No. 890. Through Order 1000, the FERC:



(1)requires public utility transmission providers to participate in a regional transmission planning process and produce a regional transmission plan;



(2)requires public utility transmission providers to amend their open access transmission tariffs to describe how public policy requirements will be considered in local
and regional transmission planning processes;



(3)removes the federal right of first refusal for certain transmission facilities; and



(4)seeks to improve coordination between neighboring transmission planning regions for interregional facilities.







The MISO’s approved tariff in part already complies with Order 1000. However, Order
1000 will result in changes to transmission expansion costs charged to IPL by the MISO. Such changes relate to public policy requirements for transmission expansion within the MISO footprint, such as to comply with renewable mandates of other states
within the footprint. These charges are difficult to estimate, but are expected to be material to IPL within a few years; however, it is probable, but not certain, that these costs will be recoverable, subject to IURC approval. Through
December 31, 2011, IPL has deferred as a regulatory asset $2.3 million of MISO transmission expansion costs.

In 2004,
the IURC initiated an investigation to examine the overall effectiveness of Demand Side Management (“DSM”) programs throughout the State of Indiana and to consider any alternatives to improve DSM performance statewide. On December 9,
2009, the IURC issued a Generic DSM Order that found that electric utilities subject to its jurisdiction must meet an overall goal of annual cost-effective DSM programs that reduce retail kWh sales (as compared to what sales would have been
excluding the DSM programs) of 2% per year by 2019 (beginning in 2010 at 0.3% and growing to 2.0% in 2019, and subject to certain adjustments). The IURC also found that all jurisdictional electric utilities have to participate in five initial,
statewide core DSM programs, which will be administered by a third party administrator. Consequently, IPL’s DSM spending, both capital and operating, will increase significantly going forward, which will likely reduce IPL’s retail
energy sales and the associated revenues.

Prior to the issuance of the Generic DSM Order, IPL filed a petition seeking relief
for substantive DSM programs. IPL proposed a DSM plan to be considered in two phases. The first phase (Phase I) sought recovery for traditional-type DSM programs such as residential home weatherization and energy efficiency education programs. The
IURC issued an Order in February 2010 that approved the programs included in IPL’s Phase I request. In addition to IPL’s recovery of the direct costs of the DSM program, the Order also included an opportunity for IPL to receive performance
based incentives. The second phase (Phase II) sought recovery for “Advanced” DSM programs and was coincident with IPL’s application for a smart grid funding grant from the Department of Energy. The Advanced DSM programs included an
Advanced Metering Infrastructure communication backbone as well as two-way meters and home area network devices for certain of IPL’s customers. In February 2010, the IURC issued an Order that approved IPL’s Phase II program, but denied
IPL’s request to timely recover its expenditures. Instead, IPL would need to seek recovery of the costs incurred under its Phase II program during its next basic rate case proceeding.

In October 2010, IPL filed a petition with the IURC for approval of its plan to comply with the IURC’s Generic DSM Order. In
November 2011, IPL received approval from the IURC for a new three-year DSM budget totaling $63.1 million that includes the opportunity for performance based incentives.

In 2010, IPL was awarded a smart grid investment grant for $20 million as part of its $48.9 million Smart Energy Project (including smart grid technology), which will provide its customers with tools to
help them more efficiently use electricity and upgrade IPL’s electric delivery system infrastructure. Under the grant, the U.S. Department of Energy is providing nontaxable reimbursements to IPL for up to $20 million of capitalized costs
associated with IPL’s Smart Energy Project. These reimbursements are being accounted for as a reduction of the capitalized Smart Energy Project costs. Through December 31, 2011, IPL has received total grant reimbursements of $13.0 million
since the 2010 project inception.

The Dayton Power and Light Company (“DP&L”)

As a regulated electric utility, DP&L is subject to regulation by the FERC and the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio
(“PUCO”). Additionally, construction of large generation facilities and high voltage transmission facilities is subject to regulation by the Ohio Power Siting Board. As indicated below, the financial performance of DP&L is directly
impacted by the outcome of various regulatory proceedings before the PUCO and FERC.







DP&L is subject to regulation by the PUCO with respect to the following: its
distribution services and facilities; the valuation of distribution property; the sale or abandonment of electric generating facilities; the classification of accounts; rates of depreciation on distribution plant; retail rates and charges;
reliability of service, compliance with renewable energy portfolio and energy efficiency program requirements, the issuance of securities (other than evidences of indebtedness payable less than twelve months after the date of issue), and certain
other matters. The PUCO also has the authority to consider and approve individually negotiated contracts with customers who meet certain criteria such as job creation, peak demand reduction or energy efficiency programs, or net-metering programs.

DP&L’s historic tariff rates for electric service to retail customers (basic rates and charges) were traditionally
set and approved by the PUCO after public hearings (“general rate cases”) that include the participation of consumer advocacy groups and certain customers. The last general rate case for DP&L was decided in 1991 with rates being
phased-in over a three year period (1992-1994). Since that time, DP&L has operated under a variety of regulatory arrangements including PUCO-approved stipulations that had the effect of freezing certain components of its rates for specified
periods of time while allowing other components to be reset periodically or added. The PUCO has typically permitted stipulations to operate for whatever period is specified within the stipulation, but it retains the authority to review the rates of
any Ohio utility at any time it chooses.

Since January 2001, electric customers within Ohio have been permitted to
choose to purchase power under a contract with a Competitive Retail Electric Service Provider (“CRES Provider”) or continue to purchase power from their local utility under Standard Service Offer (“SSO”) rates established by
tariff. DP&L and other Ohio utilities continue to have the exclusive right to provide delivery service in their state certified territories and DP&L has the obligation to supply retail generation service to customers that do not choose
an alternative supplier. The PUCO maintains jurisdiction over DP&L’s delivery of electricity, SSO and other retail electric services. For customers that choose a CRES Provider, the local utility may issue a joint bill and divides the
collected revenue between itself and the CRES Provider based on PUCO rules. The PUCO has issued extensive rules on how and when a customer can switch generation suppliers, how the local utility will interact with CRES Providers and customers,
including for billing and collection purposes, and which elements of a utility’s rates are “bypassable” (i.e., avoided by a customer that elects a CRES Provider) and which elements are “non-bypassable” (i.e., charged to all
customers receiving a distribution service irrespective of what entity provides the retail generation service).

Overall power
market prices, as well as government aggregation initiatives within DP&L’s service territory, have led or may lead to the entrance of additional competitors in its service territory. During the year ended December 31, 2011,
approximately 13% of customers representing 47% of 2011’s overall energy usage (kWh) within DP&L’s service area had elected to obtain their supply service from CRES Providers. DPL Energy Resources, Inc. (“DPLER”), an
affiliated company that is a CRES Provider, has been marketing transmission and generation services to DP&L customers. During 2011, DPLER accounted for approximately 5,731 million kWh and other CRES Providers accounted for about
862 million kWh of the total 6,594 million kWh supplied by CRES Providers within DP&L’s service territory. The volume supplied by DPLER represents 41% of DP&L’s total distribution volume during 2011. The reduction to
gross margin in 2011 as a result of customers switching to DPLER and other CRES Providers was approximately $35.4 million and $22.8 million respectively for DPL. DPL currently cannot determine the extent to which customer switching to CRES
Providers will occur in the future and the impact this will have on its operations, but any additional switching could have a significant adverse effect on its future results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

Several communities in DP&L’s service area have passed ordinances allowing the communities to become government aggregators for
the purpose of offering retail generation service to their residence. As of February 1, 2012, two communities have filed at the PUCO to implement opt out government aggregation programs.

Substitute SB 221, an Ohio energy bill, went into effect July 31, 2008. This law required that all Ohio distribution utilities
file either an Electric Security Plan (“ESP”) or a Market Rate Offer (“MRO”). An ESP







typically involves establishing a rate structure for SSO that remains relatively fixed for some period of time, but may include trackers or other mechanisms to adjust rates for certain cost
changes. Under the MRO, a periodic competitive bid process will set the retail generation price after the utility demonstrates that it can meet certain market criteria and bid requirements. Also, under this option, utilities that still owned
generation in the state as of July 2008 are required to phase-in the MRO over a period of not less than six years. Both the MRO and ESP option involve a significantly excessive earnings test (“SEET”) based on the earnings of
comparable companies with similar business and financial risks. The PUCO has issued extensive regulations under SB 221 addressing the information that must be included in an ESP as well as a MRO, the SEET requirements, corporate separation
revisions, rules relating to the recovery of transmission related costs, electric service and safety standards dealing with reliability standards and a statewide line extension policy, and rules relating to advanced energy portfolio
standards, renewable energy, peak demand reduction and energy efficiency standards.

In October 2008, DP&L filed an ESP
proceeding that was ultimately resolved by stipulation among DP&L, the PUCO Staff, and most interveners (the “ESP Stipulation”). The ESP Stipulation was approved by the PUCO in June 2009. Among other aspects, the ESP Stipulation
(i) established rate mechanisms to be in effect from January 1, 2010 until December 31, 2012, including a fuel rider to recover the actual, prudently incurred costs of procuring purchased power and fuel for generation,
(ii) continued certain riders including a rate stabilization charge, and an environmental investment charge and (iii) implemented or permitted future filings to implement riders to recover costs associated with its membership in PJM
Interconnection, LLC, and for compliance with certain SB 221 requirements such as procurement costs of renewable energy and the implementation of peak demand reduction and energy efficiency programs. The ESP Stipulation clarified that
DP&L’s earning will be reviewed under the SEET in 2013 based on 2012 earnings results.

Pursuant to the ESP
Stipulation, a fuel rider was implemented that tracks the cost of fuel and purchased power costs for supplying retail generation service to SSO customers. These costs are subject to quarterly adjustments to true up costs against revenues collected.
On an annual basis, an outside auditor selected by the PUCO audits DP&L and issues a report regarding DP&L’s contracting practices to acquire fuel and purchased power and its accounting practices that assign the appropriate portion of
costs to SSO customers. In the most recent report for calendar year 2010, the outside auditor recommended and DP&L agreed to implement certain changes in operational and accounting practices, removing certain costs from being included in the
rate. The current fuel cost tracking mechanism is set to expire at the end of 2012, at the time when the new ESP or MRO regulatory structure is expected to become effective. An audit of calendar year 2011 will occur in 2012. The outcome of that
audit cannot be predicted at this time.

Certain PJM-related costs are recovered through riders that assign costs and revenues
from PJM monthly bills to SSO customers based on the ratio of SSO customer load and sales volumes to total retail load and total retail and wholesale volumes. Customer switching to CRES Providers decreases DP&L’s SSO customer load and sales
volumes and costs. Therefore, increases in customer switching cause more of these PJM-related costs to be excluded from SSO rate recovery. The net charges incurred from PJM that are reflected in SSO rates are trued-up annually.

The ESP Stipulation also provided for recovery of compliance costs for the SB 221 targets relating to advanced energy portfolio
standards, renewable energy, peak demand reduction and energy efficiency standards. If any of the SB 221 targets are not met, compliance penalties will apply unless the PUCO makes certain findings that would excuse performance. A partial
waiver of the Ohio solar requirement was granted in 2009, and made up in 2010. DP&L fully complied with these requirements in 2010 and expects to be found in full compliance for 2011 when the PUCO reviews DP&L’s compliance in early
2012. Over time, the targets gradually increase for advanced energy portfolio standards, renewable energy, demand reduction and energy efficiency standards. DP&L is unable to predict the ultimate future costs of compliance for these
requirements.

In 2012, DP&L is required to propose either a new ESP or an MRO to be effective January 1, 2013. It is
expected that there will be a docketed proceeding in which intervener groups will participate along with the







PUCO Staff and the Office of the Ohio Consumers’ Counsel. Under either regulatory structure, SSO rates will be reset and other retail rates may also be reset. DP&L is unable to predict
at the present time what approach may be ultimately approved or the specific mechanisms that may be put into effect under either approach. Depending on those mechanisms, market and economic conditions, and other factors outside DP&L’s
control, the outcome of this proceeding could be material.

DP&L is a member of the PJM Interconnection, LLC
(“PJM”). PJM is a RTO that operates the transmission systems owned by utilities operating in all or parts of Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Maryland, Delaware, D.C., Virginia, Ohio, West Virginia, Kentucky, North Carolina, Tennessee, Indiana
and Illinois. Collectively, these utilities serve approximately 58 million people. PJM has an integrated planning process to identify potential needs for additional transmission to be built to avoid future reliability problems. PJM also runs
the day-ahead and real-time energy markets, ancillary services market, and forward capacity market for its members. As a member of PJM, DP&L is also subject to charges and costs associated with PJM operations as approved by the FERC.

DP&L transferred functional control of its transmission facilities to PJM in 2004, and transmission service over DP&L’s
facilities is now provided through the PJM Open Access Transmission Tariff (“OATT”).

As a member of PJM, DP&L
offers its generation and bids its energy needs into the markets operated by PJM on an hourly basis. DP&L is eligible to sell power to PJM and elsewhere at market-based rates, subject to FERC jurisdiction. PJM settles energy hourly offers and
bids based on locational marginal prices, which is pricing for energy at a given location based on a market-clearing price that takes into account physical limitations, generation and demand throughout the PJM region. PJM evaluates the market
participants’ energy offers and demand bids optimizing for energy products to economically and reliably dispatch the entire PJM system.

PJM operates an organized forward capacity market known as the Reliability Pricing Model (“RPM”). Utilities and other load serving entities are required to demonstrate that they have sufficient
generation capacity to serve their retail customers or to purchase such capacity in the periodic RPM auctions. The PJM RPM capacity base residual auction for the 2014/2015 period cleared at a per megawatt price of $126/day for the RTO area
encompassing DP&L. The per megawatt prices for the periods 2013/2014, 2012/2013, 2011/2012 and 2010/2011 were $28/day, $16/day, $110/day and $174/day, respectively, based on previous auctions. Future RPM auction results will be
dependent not only on the overall supply and demand of generation and load, but may also be affected by congestion as well as by PJM’s business rules relating to bidding for demand response and energy efficiency resources in the RPM
capacity auctions. Increases in customer switching may cause more of the RPM capacity costs and revenues to be excluded from the RPM retail rate rider calculation. DP&L cannot predict the outcome of future auctions or customer
switching. Additionally, while the most recent auction price has increased, it still is low relative to the actual costs that would be incurred to construct new generation or invest in substantial amounts of capital for environmental compliance.
Future RPM auction results could have a material impact on DP&L’s future results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

Future costs associated with the construction of large transmission facilities within PJM could be significant. DP&L among other interested parties successfully appealed decisions by FERC on how costs
of such new facilities would be allocated across PJM. The 7th Circuit rejected FERC’s rationale for allocation and remanded to the FERC for further proceedings. The FERC has not yet issued a final order on remand, and DP&L is unable to
predict the ultimate outcome of the proceeding. While the amount of costs assigned to DP&L may vary substantially depending on the final allocation method adopted, the effects are not likely to be material for DP&L financially because the
costs are being recovered through a transmission cost recovery rider.

In connection with DP&L and other utilities joining
PJM, the FERC ordered utilities to justify transitional charges and payments, known as SECA, effective December 1, 2004 through March 31, 2006, subject to refund. Through this proceeding, DP&L was obligated to pay SECA charges to other
utilities, but received a net benefit from these transitional payments from other utilities and market participants. A hearing was held, and an initial







decision was issued in August 2006. A final FERC order on this issue was issued on May 21, 2010, that substantially supports DP&L’s and other utilities’ position that
SECA obligations should be paid by parties that used the transmission system during the time frame stated above. DP&L, along with other transmission owners in PJM and the MISO made a compliance filing at FERC on August 19, 2010, that
fully demonstrated all payment obligations to and from all parties within PJM and the MISO. Certain aspects of the compliance filing are still under review by the FERC, while others have already been appealed for court
review.DP&L has entered into bilateral settlement agreements with all parties except one to resolve the matter, which by design will be unaffected by the final outcome of these proceedings. The only unsettled claim is a claim
of about $18 million that DP&L has against another entity. It is not known how much of that claim will actually be collected or the timing of any such collection. The results of this proceeding are not expected to have a material effect on the
results of operations.

NERC is a FERC-certified electric reliability organization responsible for developing and enforcing
mandatory reliability standards, including Critical Infrastructure Protection (“CIP”) reliability standards, across eight reliability regions. An audit of DP&L in 2009 covering the period June 18, 2007, to June 25, 2009,
identified five Possible Alleged Violations (“PAVs”) associated with five NERC reliability requirements of various standards. A mitigation plan and settlement was negotiated, including a non-material payment, which was approved on
January 21, 2011 by the FERC. In 2010, DP&L self-reported a single CIP violation, for which a mitigation plan and settlement was negotiated and approved by the FERC in 2011, including a nonmaterial payment. DP&L’s next scheduled
audit is in December 2012.

Environmental Regulations. See “Environmental and Land Use Regulations” below for
a description of the United States Environmental Regulations.

Europe, Middle East & Asia

European Union

Structure of Electricity Market. All European Union (“EU”) member states are required to implement EU legislation, although there is a degree of disparity as to how such legislation is
implemented and the pace of implementation in the respective member states. EU legislation covers a range of topics which impact the energy sector, including market liberalization and environmental legislation.

The Company has subsidiaries that operate existing generation businesses in a number of countries which are member states of the EU,
including the Czech Republic, Hungary, the Netherlands, Spain and the United Kingdom. The Company also has subsidiaries that are in the process of commissioning a generation plant in Bulgaria. Bulgaria became a member state of the EU as of
January 1, 2007.

Principal Regulations. The principles of market liberalization in the EU electricity and gas
markets were introduced under the 2003 Electricity and Gas Directives. In 2005, the European Commission (the “Commission”) launched a sector-wide inquiry into the European gas and electricity markets. To tackle the issues identified in the
inquiry and to further improve the regulatory framework for energy liberalization, the Commission launched the Third Energy Package in 2007. In the context of the electricity market, the inquiry has to date focused on identifying issues related to
price formation in the electricity wholesale markets and the role of long-term agreements as a possible barrier to entry with a view to improving the competitive situation. In January 2007, the Commission published a proposal for a new common energy
policy for Europe. In November 2008, the Commission published a nonbinding second Strategic Energy Review aimed at developing the concept of a common European energy policy. It focused mainly on security of supply and infrastructure development. The
Strategic Energy Review proposed reviews of the Gas Storage Directive in 2010 and an update of the Oil Stocks Directives.

In
October 2008, the Energy Ministers reached political agreement on the “Third Liberalization Package,” which includes five pieces of legislation, Electricity and Gas Directives, Electricity and Gas Regulations and a







Regulation creating a new Agency for the Coordination of Energy Regulators, which will have limited powers to deal with cross-border interconnectors and related issues. This legislation was
formally adopted in August 2009 and required implementation on a national level by March 2011.

Environmental
Regulations. See “Environmental and Land Use Regulations—International” below for a description of these directives.

Bulgaria

Structure of Electricity Market. The Bulgarian
energy sector model allows for trading at regulated prices, at freely negotiated prices between parties or on the organized market. Since an organized market has not evolved yet despite the availability of adequate legislative framework for it, the
primary means for wholesale trading is the regulated market, the bilateral transactions market and the Electricity Balancing Mechanism. These arrangements are also supplemented by an imbalance settlement regime.

The Bulgarian power market has evolved from a system where the National Electricity Company (“NEK”), established in November
1991 as a fully state-owned vertically integrated utility, was responsible for the entire cycle of generation, transmission and distribution. After a decade of functioning in this role, NEK was vertically unbundled with a resulting legal separation
of generation, transmission and distribution assets into different operating entities. While these structural reforms greatly helped create a competitive electricity sector, there are no actual trading rules to enable the market to operate freely.
To ensure accessible customer prices and support to renewable energy supply (“RES”) producers and the highly efficient cogeneration assets, NEK is still acting as single buyer, purchasing the majority of power generated in Bulgaria and
then selling the power to distribution companies and to some of the transmission network-connected consumers. NEK also owns the biggest hydro-electric and pump storage generation facilities in Bulgaria.

While the transmission system in Bulgaria remains under NEK’s formal ownership, to comply fully with EU legislation, NEK has spunoff
transmission operations (i.e., system operation, balancing market administration and systems’ operation and maintenance) to the Electricity System Operator. The system also allows for regulated third-party access.

Principal Regulators. The State Energy and Water Regulatory Commission (“SEWRC”) established in 1999 is the independent
regulator for both the energy and water markets. SEWRC’s key responsibilities are:



•Licensing activities in the electricity, heat and natural gas sectors;



•Regulating electricity, heat and natural gas prices (including those from RES and CHP power sources);



•Regulating interconnection to distribution and transmission networks; and



•Issuing of certificates of origin and green certificates for the electricity produced from RES and co-generation.

Principal Regulations. Bulgaria is at a juncture of adopting legislative packages that cover three key European policy
goals—energy independence (Directive 2009/28/EC), environmental sustainability through GHG emission control (Directive 2009/29/EC) and market liberalization (Directive 2009/72/EC). In line with these EU-mandated goals, the government of
Bulgaria has set the following key priorities: a 20% reduction of the energy intensity of GDP by 2013 and a 50% reduction by 2020; increased renewables’ share of the total energy consumption to 12% by 2013 and to a minimum of 16% by 2020; and
competitive energy market through promoting new generation entry, security of supply, and sustainable development. A key milestone would be a 30% increase of bilateral contracts in the electricity market by 2013.

A key law that sets the stage for the above priorities is the Bulgarian Energy Act developed in 2004 (the “BEA”) with a view to
a transparent and predictable regulatory environment to promote further liberalization







through an independent regulatory authority. The BEA creates a framework for viable commercial companies in the sector through more investment, greater autonomy of SERWC and more effective
commercial restructuring. The BEA is structured so that the market can shift away from the single-buyer model into a more market-oriented third-party network access model that allows for trading at regulated or freely negotiated prices, as well as
at a free market exchange. To be in full compliance with the EU Third Energy Package, the BEA is being amended in order for the electricity market to be fully liberalized under clear regulatory rules and sustainable market mechanisms. Recent
amendments to the BEA are making clear the commitment of the government to honoring long-term contracts for power purchasing with generators whose investments have helped upgrade the national asset base.

To help further develop the energy market, the SERWC developed new Trading Rules, adopted in 2010, where generators, consumers and grid
operators are organized in balancing groups for the most cost-effective balance between energy supply and consumption. An underlying principle of the Trading Rules will be the presence of a “Day-ahead” market (a departure from the existing
practice of weekly notification schedules). Importantly, the Trading Rules will also establish the principles for the Bulgarian power exchange, all in line with the EU’s Third Energy Liberalization legislation.

Environmental Regulations. The main environmental regulations reflect the implementation of EU environmental
directives. In January 2007, Bulgaria introduced EU Emissions Trading Scheme (“ETS”) as the main mechanism for meeting Kyoto Protocol GHG reduction commitments. The Bulgarian Environmental Protection Act, amended on September 27,
2005, and all secondary legislation promulgated pursuant to it, have incorporated all EU and Kyoto emission reduction commitments. The Bulgarian National Allocation Plan (“NAP”) allows a total of 42.3 million tonnes of CO2for the entire volume of fossil fuel-based generation in the country.
The AES Galabovo coal-based power plant is permitted by the NAP to generate 80% of its projected generation for 2011 and 2012. The portion of CO2generation that is not covered by NAP will be billed directly to NEK.

AES-3C Maritza East 1 EOOD (“AES-3C”) expects to receive, in accordance with the NAP its allocation of free emission quota
which AES-3C was assured to receive by the Bulgarian Government in 2011. To date, AES-3C has not yet received its free allocations for the emitted volumes. AES-3C believes it is entitled to the allocation or that costs for the allocations if not
provided would be borne by contractual third parties. However, if AES-3C does not receive such allocations within its reporting deadline of March 31, 2012, AES-3C may be held responsible for compliance costs in the form of penalties, in addition to
the responsibility to purchase, on a free market basis, European Union Allowances for the said volumes, which may be material to the results of its operation. AES-3C is continuing to work with the relevant Bulgarian authorities towards opening its
account at the National Registry of Carbon Quota and having free allocations deposited into it.

Bulgaria
is also subject to the Large Combustion Plant Directive (2001/80/EC) (“LCPD”), which aims to reduce particulate emission by controlling SO2, NOXand dust from large combustion plants. The LCPD allows for existing plants to opt for exemption from the emission level
values, as long as the operator undertakes not to operate for more than 20,000 hours starting from January 1, 2008 and ending no later than December 31, 2015. Major rehabilitation work has been taking place across units of various
Bulgarian thermal power plants in the last decade. The rehabilitated Maritza East 2 complex is now fitted with electrical filters for capturing dust and Flue Gas Desulphurisation (“FGD”) units (more than 94% efficiency). The AES Galabovo
power plant is equipped with a state-of-the-art wet FGD system that ensures up to 98% of SO2removal.

Bulgaria is dependent on foreign imports for 70% of its primary fuel
sources, which makes exploration of renewable energy sources of paramount importance for the country’s achievement of energy independence and environmental objectives. Bulgaria’s EU-mandated renewable targets have been met mostly by
hydroelectric power plants with limited contribution to the fuel mix by wind energy and even less from biomass. The main goal of the Renewable and Alternative Energy Sources and Biofuels Act of 2007 is to encourage generation from and grid
interconnection of installations utilizing renewable energy sources.







Material Regulatory Actions

Potential or Proposed Regulations. The AESB Act referred to above is currently being amended in order to better incorporate the EU
principles set forth in Directive 2009/29/EC. Recent draft amendments to the AESB Act ensure predictability for off-take tariffs for wind project investments that have been undertaken in the last several years (including the AES-owned Saint Nikola
Wind Farm) as well as create new development opportunities for solar power, including the new solar power projects in the Bulgaria pipeline of AES Solar.

Hungary

Structure of Electricity Market. The Hungarian
market has one main interconnected system. The state-owned electricity wholesaler, MVM, is the dominant exporter, importer and wholesaler of electricity. MVM’s affiliated company, MAVIR, is the Hungarian transmission system operator. Currently,
Hungary is dependent on energy imports (mainly from Russia) since domestic production only partially covers consumption. The wholesale market is legally liberalized, although it remains dominated by MVM owing to MVM’s access to and control over
a significant portion of the Hungarian generating facilities. The spot market is relatively illiquid with trading dominated by over-the-counter or bilateral contracts. Relative to more western parts of Europe, the volumes traded are smaller and
typically for shorter durations, although contracts with a duration that is greater than one year are available.

Principal
regulators. Magyar Energia Hivatal (“MEH”) is the government entity responsible for regulation of the electricity industry in Hungary. The Ministry of National Development oversees the activities of the MEH.

Principal Regulations. The main regulations in Hungary are those being implemented under EU directives; the adoption of the
Hungarian Electricity Act in 2007, which became effective January 1, 2008, was the final legislative step to implement a fully liberalized electricity market. By virtue of the Hungarian Electricity Act, all customers are eligible to choose
their electricity supplier. In the competitive market, generators sell capacity to wholesale traders, distribution companies, other generators, electricity traders and eligible customers at an unregulated price.

Environmental Regulations. The main environmental permitting regulation is the Integrated Pollution Prevention Control
(“IPPC”). The IPPC Directive is based on several principles, namely (i) an integrated approach to permitting, (ii) Best Available Techniques (“BAT”), (iii) flexibility and (iv) public participation. The
integrated approach requires permits to take into account the whole environmental performance of the plant, including, emission to air, water and land, generation of waste, use of raw materials, energy efficiency, noise, prevention of accidents and
restoration of the site upon closure. The purpose of the IPPC Directive is to ensure a high level of protection of the environment taken as a whole. The permit conditions including emission limit values must be based on BAT as defined in the IPPC
IPPC Directive. To assist the licensing authorities and







companies to determine BAT, the Commission organizes an exchange of information between experts from the EU Member States, industry and environmental organizations. This work is coordinated by
the European IPPC Bureau of the Institute for Prospective Technology Studies at the EU Joint Research Centre in Seville, Spain. This results in the adoption and publication by the Commission of the BAT Reference Documents (the “BREFs”).
The IPPC Directive contains elements of flexibility by allowing the licensing authorities, in determining permit conditions, to take into account the technical characteristics of the installation, its geographical location and the local
environmental conditions. Finally, the Directive ensures that the public has a right to participate in the decision-making process, and to be informed of its consequences, by giving the public access to permit applications in order to provide their
opinions, permits, results of the monitoring of releases and the European Pollutant Release and Transfer Register (“E-PRTR”). E-PRTR provides emission data reported by Member States accessible in a public register, which is intended to
provide environmental information on major industrial activities. E-PRTR has replaced the previous EU-wide pollutant inventory, the so-called European Pollutant Emission Register.

Material Regulatory Actions. Shortly before its accession to the EU, the Hungarian government notified the Commission of
arrangements concerning compensation to the state-owned electricity wholesaler MVM. The Commission decided to open a formal investigation in 2005 to determine whether any government subsidies were provided by MVM to its suppliers which were
incompatible with the EU’s market. In June 2008, the Commission reached its decision that these PPAs, including AES Tisza’s PPA, contain elements of illegal state aid. The decision required MVM to terminate the PPAs within six months of
the June 2008 decision, and to recover the alleged illegal state aid from the generators by April 2009. AES Tisza is challenging the Commission’s decision in the Court of First Instance of the European Communities. Referring to the
Commission’s decision, Hungary adopted act number LXX of 2008 which terminates all long-term PPAs in Hungary, including AES Tisza’s PPA, as of December 31, 2008, and requires generators to repay the alleged illegal state aid that was
allegedly received by the generators through the PPAs, and provides for the possibility to offset the generators stranded costs from the repayable state aid. The MEH issued its Resolution No. 342/2010 pursuant to which it stated AES Tisza did
not receive illegal state aid.

At the end of 2006 and for all of 2007, the Hungarian government reintroduced administrative
pricing for all electricity generators, overriding PPA pricing, including the pricing in AES Tisza’s PPA. In January 2007, AES Summit Generation Limited (“AES Summit”), a holding company associated with AES Tisza’s operations in
Hungary, and AES Tisza notified the Hungarian government of a dispute concerning its acts and omissions related to AES’ substantial investments in Hungary in connection with the reintroduction of the administrative pricing for Hungarian
electricity generators. In conjunction with this, AES Summit and AES Tisza have commenced International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (“ICSID”) arbitration proceedings against Hungary under the Energy Charter Treaty in
connection with Hungary’s reintroduction of the administrative pricing for Hungarian electricity generators. In the meantime, pursuant to the new Electricity Act in force from January 1, 2008, administrative pricing for electricity
generators was subsequently abolished. The ICSID arbitration panel issued the final determination on September 23, 2010, pursuant to which AES’ claim was dismissed. AES challenged the panel’s decision and requested the annulment
thereof.

In 2008, Hungary introduced a special tax to be levied on energy companies including companies such as AES Tisza.
The rate of the special tax was 8% and, in 2010, was extended until 2013. Hungary also introduced a further tax on certain industries, including energy companies (the “Crisis Tax”). The rate of the Crisis Tax for energy companies is 1.05%
of the net sales revenues.

Kazakhstan

Structure of Electricity Market. In Kazakhstan, the electricity sector is divided into wholesale and retail markets. The wholesale electricity market of Kazakhstan is based on bilateral contracts
conducted through an over-the-counter market and KOREM’s centralized trading system. In the retail market, the power distribution and supply functions are unbundled and retail customers with consumption of one MW or more have a right to buy the
electricity directly from power plants or retail supply companies.







Principal Regulators. The government of Kazakhstan approves subordinate acts in the
power sector (licensing requirement, technical regulations, market rules, tariff methodologies for natural monopolies, etc.) and determines the level of price caps for groups of power plants.

The Ministry of Industry and New Technologies (the “Ministry”) is the central executive body responsible for developing state
policy in the power sector and conducting technical regulation. As a part of price cap regulation, the Ministry is responsible for determining groups of power companies for each price cap, annual adjustments of price caps and signing agreements on
investment obligations with power plants.

The Agency for Regulation of Natural Monopolies (the “Regulator”) acts as
a regulator of industries considered to be “natural monopolies” (transmission and distribution of oil, gas, electricity and heat, railroads, airports, etc.). In the power industry, the Regulator is responsible for the approval of tariffs
for heat generation, distribution and supply, electricity transmission and distribution, as well as end-user tariffs for dominant companies in the retail power market. The Regulator grants different licenses in the power sector such as licenses for
generation, distribution and retail activities.

The Agency for Protection of Competition (the “AZK”) monitors power
market participants to determine entities with a dominant position and detect violations of antimonopoly legislation.

The
Ministry of Environmental Protection (the “Environmental Ministry”) is responsible for environmental policy, grants emission permits and evaluates the environmental impact of new projects.

JSC KEGOC is a state-owned electricity transmission company, which also acts as the system operator with a central dispatch management
function and as the operator of the balancing market.

Principal Regulations. The following major laws and regulations
govern the electricity industry:



•Law “On the Power Industry” (the “Kazakhstan Electricity law”);



•Law “On Natural Monopolies and Regulated Markets”;



•Law “On Competition”;



•Law “On Supporting the Use of Renewable Energy Sources”;



•Environmental Code;



•Law “On Licensing”;



•Resolution of the Government of the Republic of Kazakhstan “On Approval of the Price Caps”; and



•The state program of power industry development in 2010-2014.

Continuous changes in the law and regulations result in contradictions between different laws and regulations. This in turn results in an
uncertain regulatory environment in the power sector.

The key elements of price cap regulation of power plants are as
follows: (i) the Ministry has determined the power plant grouping based on the plant type, equipment, fuel and distance from coal mines (thirteen groups of power plants were defined); (ii) the Ministry has proposed to the government the
price cap for each group based on actual prices in 2008 and the level of investment required, and the government has approved price caps for each group of power plants for the seven-year period from 2009-2015; (iii) the Ministry may propose to
the government additional annual adjustments to price caps to reflect inflation and investment requirements within any group or a power plant may apply for an individual investment tariff to the Ministry and the Regulator; (iv) a power plant
determines its investment obligations at its own discretion and signs an agreement with the Ministry on investment obligations; and (v) the price cap and individual investment tariff regime do not constitute a price guarantee and power plants
should sell to consumers at the competitive market price but not higher than their group price cap or an individual investment tariff. Only exports of power and sale of ten percent of generation







through a centralized trading system are exempt from this restriction. Power trading activities are restricted and power plants are allowed to conduct trading activities to provide electricity
supply to their consumers during emergency shutdowns.

The Regulator approves and regulates all tariffs for heat generation,
transmission and supply, as well as electricity transmission and distribution tariffs on a cost-based methodology. Power trading companies, which the AZK considers dominant entities, must notify the Regulator of any proposed increase in their
tariffs and the Regulator has the right to veto such proposed tariff increases. Furthermore, the Regulator has the right to request a decrease in the applicable tariffs.

The AZK determines the borders of electricity markets at its own discretion, which does not correspond with the provisions of the Kazakhstan Electricity Law, and designates entities with dominant market
power. The AZK may consider the tariff of a power plant which is in compliance with price cap regulation to be an excessive monopolistic price of a dominant entity and impose sanctions, as happens from time to time to AES’ generating companies.

Environmental regulations. The Environmental Ministry is responsible for environmental policy and environmental
regulations. The Environmental Ministry issues environmental permits, sets emission limits and organizes ecological control in the forms of state environmental impact assessments and independent ecological audits. The Environmental Ministry reviews
permit applications for power plants and, after conducting the environmental impact assessment, grants environmental permits for industrial waste, air and water discharges for a period of not more than three years. In December 2011, Kazakhstan
adopted amendments to the Ecological Code to introduce carbon regulation starting in 2013 to comply with the Kyoto Protocol, which was ratified by Kazakhstan. Carbon regulation will likely impose allocation of carbon quotas and a carbon trading
system. In addition, a violation of environmental requirements may lead to criminal liability and fines.

Material
Regulatory Actions. In December 2010, the Environmental Ministry refused to sign agreements on investment obligations with AES UK HPP and AES UK CHP for 2011 and has requested to amend the existing agreement on investment obligation from AES
Shulbinsk HPP in 2011. The Environmental Ministry has demanded that AES power plants in Kazakhstan undertake an additional obligation to spend all profits in new investment projects. The financial police have started criminal investigations against
AES employees on alleged violations of competition law for the use of price caps in the first part of 2009 and during 2011 without signed agreements on investment obligations.

In December 2011, the Environmental Ministry refused to sign agreements on investment obligations for 2012 with AES UK HPP, AES UK CHP and AES Shulbinsk HPP. In addition, the Environmental Ministry
proposed to all Kazakhstan power plants and coal mines to consider freezing prices during the first quarter of 2012 due to the upcoming parliament elections. The use of 2012 price caps without signed agreements on investment obligations may lead to
further sanctions by the AZK and other state authorities against our businesses.

In November 2011, AES sent notification to
the Kazakhstan government regarding the early termination of the management agreement for the power distribution company EK Disco and its affiliate retail company Shygysenergotrade. Transfer of management rights to the Kazakhstan government should
be completed within 180 days. AREM has refused to grant the necessary tariff increase to EK Disco and Shygysenergotrade for 2012 owing to the parliamentary election. Both of these companies are major customers of AES power plants, and the change of
management control and AREM refusal on tariffs may have a negative effect on our financial results.

The AZK has designated
all AES power plants in Kazakhstan as dominant entities in the eastern Kazakhstan and Pavlodar regions. Shygysenergotrade LLP has also been designated by the AZK as a dominant entity in the eastern Kazakhstan retail market. AES has challenged these
designations but so far has been unsuccessful in having the designations overturned. The AZK is conducting other investigations into alleged violations by AES businesses in Kazakhstan of antimonopoly legislation such as excessive monopolistic prices
and ungrounded refusal to supply







power to certain customers. AES believes that the investigations per se and allegations made by the AZK in the course of investigations are without merits, and AES is vigorously challenging the
unfounded actions of the AZK. However, if AES Kazakhstan does not prevail in these proceedings, there could be a material impact on these businesses and our results of operations in 2012. AES has started an arbitration case in the ISCID against
Kazakhstan, where fines and sanctions imposed on AES businesses by AZK in previous years are challenged.

Potential or
Proposed Regulations. The Ministry plans to introduce a capacity market starting in 2015 to support new investments in generating assets and the draft of the law is under review by the Kazakhstan parliament. The capacity market should replace
price cap regulation. The details of the capacity market regulations will be determined by government subordinate acts and may have a material impact on our financial results.

The Ministry and the Regulator have drafted amendments to the Kazakhstan Electricity Law to increase sanctions for any failure to implement the investment program or comply with the price cap regulation.
The absence of a signed agreement on investment obligations will limit a power plant’s right to apply tariffs up to the price cap, such that the electricity tariff of a power plant cannot not exceed its 2008 level. It is expected that this
regulation will come into force in January 2012. As a result, we may be required to make significant capital investments and to incur other expenses in order to obtain the benefits of the price caps and avoid sanctions.

Turkey

Structure of Electricity Market

Principal Regulators. The transmission network is owned and controlled by TEIAS, the State Transmission Company. TETAS, the
Wholesale Trading Company, sets wholesale prices based on average procurement costs from EUAS, auto-producers and Build Operate/Build Operate Transfer/Transfer of Operating Rights producers. This wholesale price represents the buying price for 21
distribution companies under the current Transition Period Contracts (“TPC”) which are expected to expire by 2013. Under TEDAS, there were 20 regional distribution companies. In 2006, four of them were privatized and transferred to the new
owners in 2008. Another five of them were privatized in 2009 and transferred to the new owners in 2010. In 2010, the remaining ones were tendered and three of them were transferred to new owners in 2011, while the remaining distribution companies
are awaiting approval for handover. In 2010, the Turkish Privatization Administration finished the bidding process of all regional distribution companies. Retail electricity prices are calculated and proposed by the distribution companies and then
approved by the electricity market regulatory authority, EMRA.

Principal Regulations. Turkish Electricity Market is
governed by the following laws: Electricity Market Law—EML (2001), Renewable Energy Law—REL (2005), Energy Efficiency Law—EEL (2007), Nuclear Power Plant Law—NPPL (2007), and Geothermal Law—GL (2007).







Environmental Regulations. Turkey is listed in Annex-I to the United Nations
Framework Convention on Climate Change (“UNFCCC”) with special circumstances that place Turkey in a position that is different from other Annex-I Parties. On February 16, 2009, the Turkish President ratified the law concerning
Turkey’s accession to the Kyoto Protocol. In parallel to the EU accession process, Turkey enacted Large Combustion Plants Directive in June 2010 which is similar to the EU legislation.

Ukraine

Structure of Electricity Market. The electricity sector in Ukraine is regulated by the National Energy Regulatory Commission (“NERC”). Electricity costs to end-users in Ukraine consist of
three main components: (1) the wholesale market tariff is the price at which the distributor purchases energy on the wholesale market, (2) the distribution tariff covers the cost of transporting electricity over the distribution network,
and (3) the supply tariff covers the cost of supplying electricity to an end-user. The total cost permitted by the regulator under the distribution and supply tariff each year is referred to as the DVA. The distribution and supply tariffs for
all distribution companies in Ukraine are established by the NERC on an annual basis, at which time DVA and electricity distribution volumes in the tariff are adjusted. A change in the DVA methodology was effected at the end of 2007 with respect to
the treatment of wages and salaries such that the adjustment for inflation was replaced by an allowance based on the average industrial wage in the country and normative quantity of personnel.

Principal Regulations. In 2006, NERC authorized two 25% increases in end-user tariffs for residential customers. From 2006 through
2011 there have been no further changes in residential end-user tariffs and the tariff covered approximately 30% of real energy costs. In 2011 there were two tariff increases for residential customers with the introduction of two tariff blocks based
on consumption level, resulting in 28-30% of real energy cost coverage by residential customers. The wholesale electricity market price increased by 49% in 2008, by 8.5% in 2009, by 18% in 2010, and by 23% in 2011. In the course of 2010-2011, a
simultaneous increase in wholesale market price and pressure on the nonresidential end-user tariff growth resulted in the debt to distribution companies by NERC on compensation of losses for supplying energy to residential customers at privileged
tariffs.

A comprehensive review of the distribution tariff methodology addressing issues of revaluation of the rate base,
operational expenses coverage on tariffs, the rate of return and introduction of regulatory incentives to increase the quality of service was initially expected to take place at the end of 2008. However, since late 2008 and then on an annual basis,
NERC has been introducing minimal changes into the tariff methodology to be valid for just one year, including for 2011, setting the rate of return on initial investment at the level of 15% after tax, wages and salaries treatment remaining as per
the mechanism introduced in 2007, and material operational expenses subject to indexation by inflation. A similar extension of provisions for 2012 is expected to be approved. Development and approval of a comprehensive methodology are expected to
take place during 2012 to be introduced in 2013.

In 2010, the President of Ukraine announced the list of reforms for
implementation up through 2014 in all sectors of the economy, including the electric industry. According to such reforms, there are plans to (i) develop new tariff methodology in 2011; (ii) increase tariffs for residential customers;
(iii) commence elimination of cross subsidies; (iv) make changes to legislation to improve customers’ payment discipline; (v) privatize state-owned distribution companies and generation companies; and (vi) introduce a new
market structure based on bilateral agreements and balancing market, etc. The declared plan of reforms is delayed in implementation.

In 2009, the Supreme Court of Ukraine took a preliminary position affecting distribution companies in the Ukraine, including AES Kievoblenergo and AES Rivneoblenergo, where under it required that certain
network commercial losses of power that were previously treated as tax deductible could no longer be treated as such. This position, if maintained, may have a material effect on AES Kievoblenergo and AES Rivneoblenergo. The Company expects that the
Supreme Court of Ukraine may clarify its position in the future, and the proceedings in respect to AES Kievoblenergo and AES Rivneoblenergo are not likely to be finally resolved for another several years.







United Kingdom

Structure of Electricity Market. On March 21, 2007, the Electricity (Single Wholesale Market) (Northern Ireland) Order 2007
was enacted, which provided for the introduction and regulation of a single wholesale electricity market (the “SEM”) for Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland that began operation in November of 2007. Revenue from the SEM includes a
regulated capacity and an energy payment based on the system marginal price. Bidding principles insist bids are cost-reflective and are based on short run marginal cost. Total annual capacity payments are calculated as the product of the annualized
fixed cost of a best new entrant peaking plant multiplied by the capacity required to meet the security standard. This accumulated capacity is then distributed on the basis of plant availability throughout the year on a per trading period basis.

Certain generating units (Kilroot GTs 1 and 2 and Ballylumford units 4, CCGT units 10 & 20 and GTs 1 and 2) are
contracted under long-term PPAs to NIE Energy Limited terminating on various dates. The CCGT units are subject to extension by NIEE between March 2012 and 2024. All of the PPAs can be cancelled under direction from NIAUR from November 1, 2010
with six months’ notice other than the Ballylumford 10 and 20 units which can be cancelled from April 1, 2012. All other units (Kilroot units K1 and K2 whose PPAs terminated in November 2010, GTs 3 and 4 and Ballylumford units 5 and 6)
participate as merchant units in the SEM as described above.

The effect of this on the Northern Ireland units operated as
merchant plants in the SEM depends largely on the relative costs of coal and gas. The relevant units receive capacity payments under the SEM.

For the units with PPAs in place, Kilroot and Ballylumford are neutral with respect to the cost of fuel as this is passed through to its PPA counterparty as an element of the payments made to the
respective units based on their availability.

Principal Regulators. Kilroot and Ballylumford are located in Northern
Ireland, which is part of the United Kingdom, and are subject to regulation by the Northern Ireland Authority for Utility Regulation (“NIAUR”).

Principal Regulations. The principal legislation is The Electricity (Northern Ireland) Order 1992 under which the Generation Licenses of Kilroot and Ballylumford are granted.

Environmental Regulations. The Kilroot and Ballylumford plants operate under permits granted under the Pollution Prevention
Control Regulations (NI) 2003.

The Industrial Emissions Directive was approved by the European Parliament
on July 7, 2010 and is expected to become law by 2014. This Directive sets stricter limits on the emissions of pollutants such as NOX, SO2and particulate matter and requires further reductions in such emissions by January 2016. The combined package of the
Industrial Emission Directive, National Emissions Ceiling Directive and Best Available Technique requirements forms a Regulatory Framework for all electricity generation from Large Combustion Plants for the period from 2016 onwards, principally
comprising coal-fired, gas-fired, oil-fired and biomass-fired plants. The following steps may be required in respect of Kilroot: (i) fit selective catalytic reduction and comply with the new limits by 2023, at which time there may be another
review; (ii) opt out and run under a limited life derogation for a maximum of 17,500 hours; and (iii) opt into a Transitional National Plan which shall apply from January 1, 2016 until June 30, 2020, after which point there will
be an option to comply with Emission Limit Values or Closure or run for 1500 hours per year.

Currently, the Ballylumford
units 4, 5 and 6 (the B Station) are scheduled to close by the end of 2015 under the Large Combustion Plant Directive; however, there is the possibility that these units may be adapted to be compliant under the Industrial Emissions Directive. The
exact details will not be known until the Industrial Emissions Directive is implemented.







With regard to the C Station at Ballylumford, gas turbines using light
oils and middle distillates as liquid fuels are subject to an emission limit value for NOXof 90mg/Nm3. GT10 (part of the CCGT plant) is currently permitted to 120mg/m3 on distillate. This could mean that possible modifications are required to be able to continue to run distillate as a dual
fuel.

There are transitionary arrangements within the Industrial Emissions Directive to allow plants to manage the
introduction of the new limits; large combustion plants may have until July 2020 to meet the requirements. Such arrangements appear attractive to AES and would allow the units to operate without substantial capital investment on a restricted load
factor until the end of 2020. After 2020, AES would be required to comply with the new emissions limits in order to continue operations.

The Environmental Liability Directive came into force in Northern Ireland on June 24, 2009 and is aimed at the prevention and remedying of environmental damage. An operator will be held financially
liable if it carries out certain activities which cause environmental damage, or where there is an imminent threat of such damage, regardless of whether it intended to cause the damage or was negligent. This includes IPPC permitted installations. In
practice there should be no change to AES’ operations as a result of the coming into force of the Environmental Liability Directive.

Material Regulatory Actions. NIAUR published two consultation papers in 2011 regarding the cancellation of Generating Unit Agreements (“GUAs”) in place between PPB and certain generators
which could impact various long-term PPAs in Northern Ireland including those at Kilroot and Ballylumford The recommendation from these consultation papers was that NIAUR would not cancel any of the remaining GUAs but keep them under review.

Potential or Proposed Regulations. In November 2010, the Council of the EU approved a revised
directive on industrial emissions so as to reduce emissions of pollutants that are harmful to the environment and associated with cancer, asthma and acid rain. The industrial emissions directive seeks to prevent and control air, water and soil
pollution by industrial installations. It regulates emissions of a wide range of pollutants, including sulfur and nitrogen compounds, dust particles, asbestos and heavy metals. The directive is aimed at improving local air, water and soil quality,
not at mitigating the global warming effects of some of these substances. The review integrates seven directives into a single legal framework and provides for a more harmonized and rigorous implementation of emissions limits associated with the
best available technology, so-called BAT. Deviations from this standard are only permitted where local and technical characteristics would make compliance disproportionately costly. The recast also tightens emission limits for NO

X

, SO


and dust from power plants and large combustion installations in oil refineries and the metal industry. New plants must
apply the BAT beginning in 2012, four years earlier than initially proposed. Existing plants have to comply with this standard from 2016, though a transition period is foreseen. Until June 30, 2020, member states may define transitional plans
with declining annual caps for NO

X

, SO


or dust emissions. Where installations are already scheduled to close by
the end of 2023 or operate less than 17,500 hours after 2016, they may not need to upgrade. Member States have two years to explain this Directive.

Middle East & Asia

China

In 2005, the National Development and Reform Commission (“NDRC”) released interim regulations governing on-grid tariffs, along
with two other regulations governing transmission and retail tariffs. The On-Grid Tariff Measures specify different rules for the determination of on-grid tariffs before and after the implementation of competitive pricing. Before the implementation
of competitive pricing, the on-grid tariffs shall be appraised and ratified by the pricing authorities by reference to the economic life of power generation projects and determined in accordance with the principle of allowing power generators to
cover reasonable costs and to obtain reasonable returns. Such costs were defined to be the average costs in the industry and reasonable returns







will be calculated on the basis of the interest rate of China’s long-term Treasury bond plus certain percentage points. After the establishment of competitive regional power markets, the
on-grid tariffs of electricity generation companies which participate in the competitive market shall principally consist of two components: the capacity charge, which is to be determined by the tariff regulatory authority, and the energy charge,
which is to be determined by market competition. However, no implementation rules have been issued to introduce the competitive pricing which is still pending as of now. The Retail Tariff Measures aim to reform the various classes of tariff for
end-users into three categories: residential electricity, electricity used in agricultural production and electricity used in industry, commerce or for other purposes. The tariff for each category is fixed per voltage class. The tariffs shall be
determined with consideration to the fair sharing of the burden, the efficient adjustment of the demand for electricity and the public policy objectives.

In addition to the foregoing tariff-setting mechanism, China’s central government also issued a tariff adjustment policy allowing the on-grid tariffs to be pegged to the fuel price in the case of
significant fluctuations in fuel price. Seventy percent of the increase in fuel costs may be passed through in the tariff. The tariffs of coal-fired facilities in China were increased in 2005, 2006, 2008, 2009 and 2011 pursuant to this policy to
alleviate the escalation of fuel price; however, such adjustments were obtained from the regulatory authorities only after a time lag and fell short of compensating all businesses for coal price increases in recent years. There was no catch-up
tariff adjustment in 2010 pursuant to the foregoing policy.







MW coal-fired with CFB boiler) to our local Chinese party at a price of RMB 5.5 million and such transaction financially closed in June 2011.

On July 20, 2009, NDRC issued the “Circular on Refining the Policy for On-Grid Pricing of Wind Power” (“NDRC Price
2009 No. 1906”), which introduces a benchmark system for on-grid tariffs for wind power replacing the existing public bidding and concession model for wind projects. The circular provides that on-grid tariffs for onshore wind power
projects approved from August 1, 2009, onward are fixed using a centrally controlled price determination mechanism, while on-grid tariffs for offshore wind projects will be determined separately. Under the circular, China’s onshore area is
divided into four different types of wind-power resource regions, and different prices are set for each of these regions ranging from 0.51 yuan/kWh (US cent 7.5/kWh) for wind power in regions with the best wind resources, such as Inner Mongolia, to
0.61 yuan/kWh (US cent 8.9/kWh) for regions with the worst wind resources. According to NDRC, the legislation’s intent is to standardize the wind power price regulation and promote healthy and sustainable development of the wind-power industry.
Currently, we do not expect that this newly issued circular will have a material adverse impact on our wind power businesses in China.

India

Structure of Electricity Market. Pursuant to
electricity reforms by the Government of India, including enactment of the Electricity Act of India (“EAI”), the electricity market in India is moving toward a multi-buyer, multi-seller system as opposed to the past structure which
permitted a single buyer to purchase power from power generators. This legal and regulatory framework provides flexibility in granting electricity regulatory commissions freedom in determining tariffs as well as encouraging competition in the
electricity market, albeit with regulatory intervention. Transmission, distribution and trade of electricity remain regulated activities which require licenses from an electricity regulatory commission, unless exempted. Through the new EAI,
generation of electricity has been de-licensed to invite more private participation. The Central Government, through the Ministry of Power, is involved in the power sector planning, policy formulation and appointment of central regulators. State
governments also have powers to appoint or remove members of the State Regulatory Commissions, in addition to formulation of policy guidelines applicable to state power sector entities. The state governments set up and notify the state load dispatch
center, which controls the physical operation of the grid constituents. Under the EAI, the state governments are required to unbundle the State Electricity Boards into separate generation, distribution and transmission companies.

Principal Regulators. India’s power sector is regulated by a two-level regulatory system: at the national level, the Central
Electricity Regulatory Commission (“CERC”); and at the state level, the State Electricity Regulatory Commissions (“SERC”) (together the “Regulatory Commissions”). CERC regulates tariffs of generating stations owned by
the central government, or those involved in generating in more than one state, and regulating interstate transmission of electricity. SERC regulates intra-state transmission and supply of electricity within each state. While discharging functions
under the EAI, regulatory commissions are guided by the National Electricity Policy, the Tariff Policy and the National Electricity Plan and directions on any policy involving public interest issued by the Central Government or state government from
time to time. Regulatory Commissions are quasi-judicial authorities entrusted with various functions including determining tariffs, granting licensees and settling disputes between the generating companies and the licensees, and between licensees.
An Appellate Tribunal has been set up for appeal against orders of Regulatory Commissions. The Appellate Tribunal has quasi-judicial powers to summon, enforce attendance, require discovery, receive evidence and review decisions. The orders of the
Appellate Tribunal are executable as decrees of a civil court and can be challenged in the Supreme Court.

Principal
Regulations. In 2003, the government of India enacted the EAI to establish a framework for a multi-seller/multi-buyer model for the electricity industry, introducing significant changes to India’s electricity sector. The EAI is a central
unified legislation relating to generation, transmission, distribution, trading and use of electricity that replaced multiple legislations. Pursuant to the EAI, the government of India ratified the







National Electricity Policy in 2005 and the National Tariff Policy in 2006. The policies established deadlines to implement different provisions of the EAI. However, the pace of actual
implementation of the reform process is contingent on the respective state governments and SERCs, as electricity is a “concurrent” subject in India’s constitution which has both central and state jurisdictions. There is no license
required to set up generation plants under the EAI (except hydroelectric power plants), and generators are allowed to sell to state distribution utilities, traders and open-access consumers. The access to consumers is subject to regulatory
provisions on transmission corridor availability and payment of cross-subsidy surcharge.

The EAI specifies trading in electricity as a distinct and licensed activity. The license for electricity trading is required to be obtained from the relevant regulatory commission. In 2009, CERC issued
regulations for the grant of trading licenses to regulate the interstate trading of electricity. Trading license regulations set out qualifications for the grant of the license including technical and professional qualifications and net worth
requirements. Licensees are subject to conditions specifying, among other things, the extent of trading margin, maintenance of records and a requirement to pay a license fee, as specified by CERC. The State Regulatory Commissions have the right to
fix a ceiling on trading margins in intrastate trading. Two power exchanges have received licenses from CERC and have started operations. The volume of power trading on the power exchanges is growing but is low as the bulk of power is still traded
through long-term bilateral contracts.

Environmental Regulations. Compliance with relevant environmental laws is the
responsibility of the occupier or operator of subject facilities. Principal regulations include the “Environment (Protection) Act, 1986” (“EPAct”), an umbrella law under which environmental protection laws are promulgated. The
EPAct vests the Government of India with the power to take measures it deems necessary for protecting and improving the quality of the environment and preventing and controlling environmental pollution. This includes rules for the quality of the
environment, standards for emission or discharge of environmental pollutants from various sources and inspection of any premises, plant, equipment, machinery, and materials likely to cause pollution. Penalties for violation of the EPAct include
fines or imprisonment. “Environment Impact Assessment Notification S.O. 1533(E), 2006” issued under the EPAct and the Environment (Protection) Rules, 1986, mandate prior approval by the Ministry of Environment & Forests or State
Environment Impact Assessment Authority for establishing a new project or expansion or modernization of existing projects. Projects that require preparation of an








Material Regulatory Actions. The
Electricity Regulatory Commission (“ERC”) is empowered to determine tariffs for supply of electricity by a generating company to a distribution licensee, transmission of electricity, wheeling of electricity and retail sale of electricity.
In case of a shortage of supply of electricity, the ERC may fix the minimum and maximum tariff ceiling for sale or purchase of electricity for a period not exceeding one year to ensure reasonable prices of electricity. While determining tariffs, the
ERC follows principles and methodologies specified by the CERC for determination of tariffs, including the principle that generation, transmission, distribution and supply of electricity should be conducted on commercial principles and takes into
account factors which encourage competition, efficiency and economical use of resources.

The EAI provides that the ERC will
adopt such tariffs determined through a transparent process of bidding in accordance with guidelines issued by the Central Government. The Central Government, through the Ministry of Power, has issued guidelines for competitive bidding and draft
documentation (Standard PPAs) for competitively bid projects. Utilities have to obtain approval from regulatory commissions for the quantum of electricity to be procured competitively and for any deviation in the standard documents before initiating
the bidding process. The determination of tariffs for a power project depends on the mode of participation in the project. Tariffs may be determined in two ways: (i) based on tariff principles prescribed by CERC, i.e., cost-plus basis
consisting of a capacity charge, an energy charge, an unscheduled interchange charge and incentive payments; or (ii) a competitive bidding process where the tariff is purely market based.







constitute the fuel cost for the electricity generated. Both the capacity and energy parameters can be bid with non-scalable components. The escalation factors are notified by CERC from time to
time. Bidding guidelines include a two-step process—pre-qualification and final bid. Bidders are required to submit a technical and financial bid at the RFP stage. Power purchase and distribution licenses are increasing through the competitive
bid route. The Tariff Policy requires all procurement of power after January 6, 2006 (except for PPAs approved or submitted for approval before January 6, 2006 or projects which have obtained financing prior to January 6, 2006) by
distribution licensees to be through competitive bidding. However a subsequent notification by the Ministry of Power has extended this deadline up to January 6, 2011. Some state regulators have ratified the purchase of power under memorandums
of understanding, on the ground that the tariff policy discussed above is merely indicative and not binding.

Philippines

Structure of Electricity Market. From a vertically integrated industry, the Philippines has unbundled its power sector into generation, transmission, distribution and supply. The enabling law for
this restructuring is Republic Act No. 9136, otherwise known as the Electric Power Industry Reform Act of 2001 (“EPIRA”). The EPIRA primarily aims to increase private sector participation in the power sector and to privatize the
Government’s generation and transmission assets. Generation and supply are open and competitive sectors, while transmission and distribution are regulated sectors. Sale of power is done primarily thorough medium-term contracts between
generation companies and customers specifying the volume, price and conditions for the sale of energy and capacity. The Energy Regulatory Commission (“ERC”) approves the said contracts for supply of energy. Power is also traded in the
Wholesale Electricity Spot Market (“WESM”) from which at least 10% of the distribution companies or electricity cooperatives power requirement must be sourced.

A market optimization model determines the price and dispatch by processing the bids from trading participants and the system condition from the system operator. The market operator then comes out with a
schedule of both price and energy which maximizes economic gains for participants subject to certain constraints. The dispatch schedule is then coordinated with the system operator for implementation. The market is operating under a gross pool, net
settlement system, whereby each generator submits energy offers regardless of their contracted energy. However, the generator should declare their contracted quantities, since the market will not include contracted energy in its settlement.

New contracts assigned by distribution companies for consumption after expiration are awarded to generation companies either
through the lowest supply price offered in public bid processes or through a negotiated contract. The ERC then approves the said contract benchmarked against, among others, the prices of the best new entrant generation company.

AES Masinloc has secured a seven year Power Supply Agreement (“PSA”) contract with MERALCO, with a three-year option to extend,
MERALCO is the largest distribution company in the Philippines. The contract with MERALCO requires approval by the ERC.

The
existing supply contract with MERALCO, under the NPC Transition Supply Contract, was extended for another year and will cease by December 25, 2012. The extension will automatically terminate once the PSA is approved by the ERC or three months
after commencement of the Retail Competition and Open Access expected by fourth quarter of 2012.

Except one, the other supply
contracts with the Electric Cooperatives were renegotiated and extended for another ten years. The Contract for Supply of Electric Energy (“CSEE”) extensions was already filed with the ERC for approval.

Principal Regulators. The ERC, created under the EPIRA, is mandated to protect long-term consumer interest in terms of quality,
reliability and reasonable pricing of sustainable supply of electricity. It is a quasi-judicial body that promulgates and enforces rules, regulations, guidelines and policies. The Department of







Energy is mandated to prepare, integrate, coordinate, supervise and control all plans, programs, projects and activities of the government relative to energy exploration, development,
utilization, distribution and conservation. The DOE endorses new or existing generators. The Department of Environment and Natural Resources administers the system for evaluating the environmental impact of new or existing generating plants.

Principal Regulations. The distinct electricity sector activities are regulated by the EPIRA. Sector activities are
also governed by the corresponding technical regulations and standards, namely, the Philippine Grid Code, Philippine Distribution Code, Open Access Transmission Service Rules, WESM Rules, and Distribution System Open Access Rules
(“DSOAR”).The keystones of the electricity regulation are: (i) performance based on revenue cap and non-discriminatory access to transmission lines; (ii) a contract-based supply and spot electricity trading for generation;
(iii) performance based on maximum average price and non-discriminatory access for DUs and ECs under the performance base rate regime; and (iv) electricity supply by distribution companies in their respective franchise areas.

Section 31 of EPIRA establishes the Retail Competition and Open Access (“RC&OA”) under which Retail Electricity
Suppliers, who are duly licensed by the ERC, may supply directly to Contestable Customers (end-users with an average demand of at least 1,000 kW) with DUs and ECs providing non-discriminatory wires services. ERC concluded that the pre-conditions for
RC&OA had already been satisfied and declared December 26, 2011 as the commencement date under ERC Resolution No. 10 on June 6, 2011. MERALCO, Private Electric Power Operators Association and Philippine Rural Electric Cooperatives
Association, Inc., petitioned the ERC to postpone the RC&OA implementation because systems required for RC&OA such as B2B and Accounting, Billing and Settlement will take a longer time to complete. As a result, ERC deferred the
implementation of the RC&OA. The new target commencement date is the fourth quarter of 2012.

Environmental
Regulations. The Renewable Energy Act of 2008 (“R.A. 9513”) was enacted in December 2008 to promote non-conventional renewable energy sources, such as solar, wind, small hydroelectric and biomass energies. The law requires electric
power participants to initially source 10% of their supply from eligible renewable energy resources. The initial requirement of 10% is preliminary, as the National Renewable Energy Board (“NREB”) has not set the final figure. It is unknown
at this time if the definition of electric power participant applies to entities that are power producers or to power consumers. If and once the regulations are implemented, our businesses in the Philippines could be adversely impacted by
requirements to source a portion of their generation from renewable energy resources to supply its customers’ contracts, which could in turn affect our results of operations. Under Section 6 R.A. 9513, consumers are also given a green
energy option which provides end-users the option to choose renewable energy sources as their sources of energy.

Water rights
are given by the National Water Resources Board under the Department of Environment and Natural Resource for extraction and discharge of water used in the operation of the Masinloc Plant.

Material Regulatory Actions. Final approval of power contracts signed with MERALCO and the Electric Cooperatives is pending and
expected by 2012.

Potential or Proposed Regulations. Section 72 of the EPIRA requires a mandated rate reduction
from NPC rates. With the assignment of the Transition Supply Contracts to successor generating companies, such as AES Masinloc, NPC’s position is that the mandated rate reduction shall be for the account of the successor generating companies.
AES Masinloc filed a petition with ERC to initiate rule making and clarify the MRR implementation in light of the ongoing privatization of NPC plants. In its decision, the ERC ruled in favor of AES Masinloc, saying that the EPIRA mandated rate
reduction shall be implemented by the successor generating company subject to the execution of a written instrument between NPC and the new generator specifically containing the assumption by the latter of such obligation. The ERC ruled in favor of
AES Masinloc since there was no such written instrument. NPC filed a petition for review with the Court asking for a reversal of the said ERC decision. The case is pending with the Court of Appeals. If AES Masinloc loses this matter on appeal, it
may be subject to the rate reduction described above, which could have a material impact on its business and our results of operations.







A similar mandated rate reduction case is pending with the ERC. MERALCO alleges that AES
Masinloc failed to account for the rate reduction in MERALCO’s favor amounting to Php179,611,458.98 ($4.1 million). It is assumed that the ERC will wait for the decision of the first matter described in the preceding paragraph before ruling on
the MERALCO case since the latter is particularly dependent on the outcome of the pending petition with the Court of Appeals.

Environmental and Land Use Regulations

Overview.The Company faces certain risks and uncertainties related to numerous environmental laws and
regulations, including existing and potential greenhouse gas (“GHG”) legislation or regulations, and actual or potential laws and regulations pertaining to water discharges, waste management (including disposal of coal combustion
byproducts), and certain air emissions, such as SO2,
NOX, particulate matter, mercury and other hazardous air
pollutants. Such risks and uncertainties could result in increased capital expenditures or other compliance costs which could have a material adverse effect on certain of our United States or international subsidiaries, and our consolidated results
of operations. For further information about these risks, see Item 1A.—Risk Factors, “Our businesses are subject to stringent environmental laws and regulations,” “Our businesses are subject to enforcement
initiatives from environmental regulatory agencies,” and “Regulators, politicians, non-governmental organizations and other private parties have expressed concern about greenhouse gas, or GHG, emissions and the potential risks
associated with climate change and are taking actions which could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations, financial condition and cash flows” in this Form 10-K.

Many of the countries in which the Company does business also have laws and regulations relating to the siting, construction, permitting,
ownership, operation, modification, repair and decommissioning of, and power sales from electric power generation or distribution assets. In addition, international projects funded by the International Finance Corporation, the private sector lending
arm of the World Bank, or many other international lenders are subject to World Bank environmental standards or similar standards, which tend to be more stringent than local country standards. The Company often has used advanced environmental
technologies in order to minimize environmental impacts, including circulating fluidized bed (“CFB”) coal technologies, flue gas desulphurization technologies, selective catalytic reduction technologies and advanced gas turbines.

Environmental laws and regulations affecting electric power generation and distribution facilities are complex, change
frequently and have become more stringent over time. The Company has incurred and will continue to incur capital costs and other expenditures to comply with these environmental laws and regulations. See Item 7.—Management’s Discussion
and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Capital Expendituresin this Form 10-K for more detail. The Company and its subsidiaries may be required to make significant capital or other expenditures to comply with
these regulations. There can be no assurance that the businesses operated by the subsidiaries of the Company will be able to recover any of these compliance costs from their counterparties or customers such that the Company’s consolidated
results of operations, financial condition and cash flows would not be materially affected.

Various licenses, permits and
approvals are required for our operations. Failure to comply with permits or approvals, or with environmental laws, can result in fines, penalties, capital expenditures, interruptions or changes to our operations. Certain subsidiaries of the Company
are subject to litigation or regulatory action relating to environmental permits or approvals. See Item 3.—Legal Proceedings in this Form 10-K for more detail with respect to environmental litigation and regulatory action, including a
Notice of Violation (“NOV”) issued by the United States Environmental Protection Agency against IPL concerning new source review and prevention of significant deterioration issues under the United States Clean Air Act.

Greenhouse Gas Laws, Protocols and Regulations.In 2011, the Company’s subsidiaries operated electric
power generation businesses which had total approximate direct CO2emissions of 74 million metric tonnes, approximately 37.5 million metric tonnes of which were emitted in the United States (both figures ownership







adjusted). The Company uses CO2emission estimation methodologies supported by the “The Greenhouse Gas Protocol” reporting standard on GHG emissions. For existing power generation plants, CO2emissions are either obtained directly from plant continuous emission
monitoring systems or calculated from actual fuel heat inputs and fuel type CO2emission factors. The following is an overview of both the regulations and laws that currently apply to our businesses and those that may be imposed over the next few years. Such regulations and laws
could have a material effect on the electric power generation and distribution businesses of the Company’s subsidiaries and on the Company’s consolidated results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

International

On February 16, 2005, the Kyoto Protocol became effective. The Kyoto Protocol requires the industrialized countries that have ratified it to significantly reduce their GHG emissions, including
CO


In July 2003, the European Community “Directive 2003/87/EC on Greenhouse Gas Emission Allowance Trading”
was created, which requires Member States to limit emissions of CO2from large industrial sources within their countries. During the first and second trading periods of EU ETS, which commenced in January 2005 and terminates at the end of 2012, Member States were required
to implement EC-approved national allocation plans (“NAPs”). Under the NAPs, Member States were responsible for allocating limited CO2allowances within their borders through 2012. Directive 2003/87/EC did not dictate how these allocations were to be made,
and the NAPs that were submitted varied in their allocation methodologies. The current NAPs in each Member State will apply until the end of 2012.

Pursuant to “Directive 2009/29/EC amending European Directive 2003/87/EC so as to improve and extend the greenhouse gas emission allowance trading scheme of the Community,” (the “2009
Amending Directive”), the European Union has announced that it intends to keep the EU ETS in place through the third trading period, which ends in 2020, even if the Kyoto Protocol is not replaced by another agreement. NAPs were required during
the first and second trading periods. However, for the third trading period, which begins in 2013, there will no longer be any national allocation plans. Instead, the allocations will be determined directly by the EU.

The Company’s subsidiaries operate seven electric power generation facilities within five member states which have adopted NAPs to
implement Directive 2003/87/EC. During the first and second trading periods, achieving and maintaining compliance with the NAPs did not have a material impact on consolidated operations or results of the Company.

The risk and benefit associated with achieving compliance with applicable NAPs at several facilities of the Company’s subsidiaries
are not the responsibility of the Company’s subsidiaries, as they are subject to







contractual provisions that transfer the costs associated with compliance to contract counterparties. In connection with any potential dispute that might arise with contract counterparties over
these provisions, there can be no assurance that the Company and/or the relevant subsidiary would prevail, or that the failure to prevail in any such dispute will not have a material effect on the Company and its financial condition or consolidated
results of operations. Certain of the Company’s subsidiaries will bear some or all of the risk and benefit associated with compliance with applicable NAPs at certain facilities.

The 2009 Amending Directive was adopted by the EU in April 2009 as part of the EU’s “Climate Change Package,” which also
included a Carbon Capture & Storage Directive and a revised Renewables Directive. The 2009 Amending Directive provides for the third trading period of the EU ETS, which will apply from the beginning of 2013 until 2020. The key
characteristics of the third trading period relevant to the Company are as follows:



•The EU is aiming to reduce EU-wide CO2emissions by 21% from 2005 levels by 2020.



•A single, EU-wide cap on annual CO2allowances will be imposed by the European Commission, rather than Member States. This cap will decrease annually.



•Significantly fewer free
CO2allowances will be allocated than during the first and
second trading periods, with an increasing number being made available for purchase by auction (50% of all allowances will be auctioned in 2013, compared to 3% in the second trading period).



•Free allocations will be set using a benchmark based on the most efficient installations for each type of product, with very limited allocations for
electricity production. In 2013, each installation will receive free allowances equivalent to 80 percent of the benchmark, with the proportion decreasing each year, to 0% by 2027.



•NAPs will be replaced by National Implementing Measures (“NIMs”), which set out the levels of free allocation of allowances to installations
in accordance with harmonized EU rules. Member States are required to submit proposed NIMs to the EU, and they will be assessed and approved during 2012.

In addition to the 2009 Amending Directive for the EU ETS, the Renewables Directive was also adopted by the EU in April 2009, and will enter into force in each individual EU Member State upon the adoption
by each country of implementing legislation or regulations. The key requirement of the Renewables Directive is a minimum target of 20 percent of all energy generation in the EU to be from renewable sources by 2020.

AES generation businesses in each Member State will be required to comply with the relevant measures taken to implement the directives,
including each of the relevant NIMs.

Even though the 2009 Amending Directive means that the EU ETS will remain in place even
if the Kyoto Protocol expires at the end of 2012 without any successor commitment period or agreement or other international commitment on GHG emissions reductions, there remains significant uncertainty with respect to the third trading period and
the implementation of NIMs post-2012. Although many Member States have submitted draft NIMs to the EU for approval, these NIMs could undergo changes and there is no certainty as to their final form. At this time, the Company cannot determine whether
achieving and maintaining compliance with the EU allocation plan for the third trading period, to which its subsidiaries are subject, will have a material impact on its consolidated operations or financial results.

Countries in Latin America, Asia and Africa in which subsidiaries of the Company operate may also choose to adopt
regulations that directly or indirectly regulate GHG emissions from power plants. For a discussion of regulations in individual countries where our subsidiaries operate, see Item 1. Business—Regulatory Matters in this Form 10-K. Although
the Company does not currently believe that the laws and regulations pertaining to GHG emissions that have been adopted to date in countries in Latin America, Asia and Africa in which subsidiaries of the Company operate will have a material impact
on the Company, the Company cannot predict with any certainty if future laws and regulations in these countries regarding
CO2emissions will have a material effect on the
Company’s consolidated financial condition or results of operations.







United States—Federal Legislation and Regulation

Currently, in the United States there is no Federal legislation establishing mandatory GHG emissions reduction
programs (including for CO2) affecting the electric power
generation facilities of the Company’s subsidiaries. There are numerous state programs regulating GHG emissions from electric power generation facilities and there is a possibility that federal GHG legislation will be enacted within the next
several years. Further, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) has adopted regulations pertaining to GHG emissions and has announced its intention to propose new regulations for electric generating units under
Section 111 of the United States Clean Air Act (“CAA”).

Potential United States Federal GHG
Legislation. Federal legislation passed the United States House of Representatives in 2009 that, if adopted, would have imposed a nationwide cap-and-trade program to reduce GHG emissions. This legislation was never signed into law, and is no
longer under consideration. In the U.S. Senate, several different draft bills pertaining to GHG legislation have been considered, including comprehensive GHG legislation similar to the legislation that passed the U.S. House of Representatives and
more limited legislation focusing only on the utility and electric generation industry. Although it is unlikely that any legislation pertaining to GHG emissions will be voted on and passed by the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives in 2012, it
is uncertain if any such legislation will be voted on and passed by the U.S. Congress in subsequent years. If any such legislation is enacted into law, the impact could be material to the Company.

EPA GHG Regulation. The EPA made a finding that GHG emissions from mobile sources represent an “endangerment” to human
health and the environment (the “Endangerment Finding”) following the Supreme Court’s decision in Massachusetts v. EPA, that the EPA has the authority under the CAA to regulate GHG emissions. The EPA then subsequently promulgated
regulations governing GHG emissions from automobiles under the CAA (“Motor Vehicle Rule”). The effect of the EPA’s regulation of GHG emissions from mobile sources is that certain provisions of the CAA will also apply to GHG emissions
from existing stationary sources, including many United States power plants. In particular, since January 2, 2011, owners or operators who plan construction of new stationary sources and/or modifications to existing stationary sources,
which would result in increased GHG emissions, are required to obtain prevention of significant deterioration (“PSD”) permits prior to commencement of construction. In addition, major sources of GHG emissions may be required to amend,
or obtain new, Title V air permits under the CAA to reflect any new applicable GHG emissions requirements for new construction or for modifications to existing facilities.

In December 2010, the EPA entered into a settlement agreement with several states and environmental groups to resolve a petition for
review challenging the EPA’s new source performance standards (“NSPS”)







rulemaking for electric utility steam generating units (“EUSGUs”) based on the NSPS’s failure to address GHG emissions. Under the settlement agreement, the EPA committed to propose
GHG emissions standards for EUSGUs by July 26, 2011. The EPA subsequently announced that it was delaying the proposal further, without specifying a deadline for the proposal but has committed to finalize GHG NSPS for EUSGUs by May 26,
2012. The NSPS is expected to establish GHG emission standards for newly constructed and reconstructed EUSGUs. The NSPS also may establish guidelines regarding the best system for achieving further GHG emissions reductions from existing EUSGUs.
Based on such guidelines, individual states will be required to develop regulations establishing GHG performance standards for existing EUSGUs within their state. It is impossible to estimate the impact and compliance cost associated with any future
NSPS applicable to EUSGUs until such regulations are finalized. However, the compliance costs could have a material impact on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations.

A consortium of industry petitioners has challenged the Endangerment Finding, Tailoring Rule and the Motor Vehicle Rule in the United
States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. These challenges have been consolidated, briefed and set for oral argument on February 28 and 29, 2012. We cannot predict the outcome of this litigation.

United States—State Legislation and Regulation

Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative. The primary regulation of GHG emissions affecting the United States plants
of the Company’s subsidiaries has previously been through the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (“RGGI”). Under RGGI, ten Northeastern States have coordinated to establish rules that require reductions in CO


emissions from power plant operations within those states through a
cap-and-trade program. Maryland is now the only state currently participating in RGGI in which our subsidiaries have a relevant generating facility. Under RGGI, power plants must acquire one carbon allowance through auction or in the emission
trading markets for each ton of CO


emitted. We have
estimated the costs to the Company of compliance with RGGI could be approximately $2.8 million for 2012, and this represents a significant reduction in estimated compliance costs from prior years largely due to the deconsolidation of subsidiaries
that owned plants in Connecticut and New York and filed for bankruptcy in 2011. The initial three-year compliance period for RGGI expired at the end of 2011. Under the subsequent three-year compliance period (2012 through 2014), the cap on aggregate
CO


emissions per year for RGGI states is 165 million
short tons of CO


, and the affected states are conducting a
program wide review that could result in changes to the 2012 through 2014 compliance period, including a lower emissions cap. While these estimated compliance costs are not material to the Company, changes in the regulations or price of allowances
under RGGI could have a material impact on our operations and financial performance.

The Company’s
Warrior Run business is located in Maryland. In April 2006, the Maryland General Assembly passed the Maryland Healthy Air Act which, among other things, required the State of Maryland to join RGGI. The Maryland Department of Environment
(“MDE”) adopted regulations that require 100% of the allowances the State receives to be auctioned except for several small allowance set-aside accounts. The MDE regulations include a safety valve to control the economic impact of the
CO2cap-and-trade program. If the auction closing price
reaches $7, up to 50% of a year’s allowances will be reserved for purchase by electric power generation facilities located within Maryland at $7 per allowance, regardless of auction prices. Warrior Run continues to secure its allowance
requirements through the RGGI allowance auction.

In 2011, of the approximately 37.5 million metric
tonnes of CO2emitted in the United States by the businesses
operated by our subsidiaries (ownership adjusted), approximately 8.3 million metric tonnes were emitted in states participating in RGGI. Over the past three years, such emissions have averaged approximately 9.8 million metric tonnes. The
reduction in aggregate emissions by subsidiaries operating in RGGI states from prior years is largely due to lower dispatch at AES Thames and Eastern Energy. While CO2emissions from businesses operated by subsidiaries of the Company are calculated globally in metric tonnes, RGGI
allowances are denominated in short tons. (1 metric tonne equals 2,200 pounds and 1 short ton equals 2,000 pounds.) For







forecasting purposes, the Company has modeled the impact of
CO2compliance based on a three-year average of CO2emissions for its businesses that are subject to RGGI and that may not
be able to pass through compliance costs. The model includes a conversion from metric tonnes to short tons, as well as the impact of some market recovery by merchant plants and contractual and regulatory provisions. The model also utilizes a price
of $1.89 per allowance under RGGI. The source of this allowance price estimate was the clearing price in the most recent RGGI allowance auction held in December 2011. Based on these assumptions, the Company estimates that the RGGI compliance costs
could be approximately $2.8 million for 2012. Given the fact that the assumptions utilized in the model may prove to be incorrect, there is a risk that our actual compliance costs under RGGI will differ from our estimates and that our model
could underestimate our costs of compliance.

California.The Company’s Southland business is
located in California. On September 27, 2006, the Governor of California signed the Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006, also called Assembly Bill 32 (“A.B. 32”). A.B. 32 directs the California Air Resources Board (“CARB”)
to promulgate regulations that will require the reduction of
CO


Midwestern Greenhouse Gas Reduction Accord (MGGRA). The Company owns the utility IPL,
located in Indiana, and the utility DP&L, located in Ohio. On November 15, 2007, six Midwestern state governors and the premier of Manitoba signed the Midwestern Greenhouse Gas Reduction Accord (“MGGRA”), committing the
participating states and province to reduce GHG emissions through the implementation of a cap-and-trade program. Three states (including Indiana and Ohio) and the province of Ontario have signed as observers. In May







of 2010, the MGGRA Advisory Group finalized a set of recommendations for the establishment of targets for emissions reductions in the region and for the design of a regional cap-and-trade
program. These include a recommended reduction in GHG emissions of 20% below 2005 emission levels by 2025. The recommendations are from the advisory group only, and have not been endorsed or approved by individual governors, including the Governors
of Indiana and Ohio. Though MGGRA has not been formally suspended, participating states are no longer pursuing it. If Indiana or Ohio were to implement the recommended reduction targets, the impact on the Company’s consolidated results of
operations, financial condition, and cash flows could be material.

Hawaii. The Company owns a power generation
facility in Hawaii. On June 30, 2007, the Governor of Hawaii signed Act 234 which sets a goal of reducing GHG emissions to at or below 1990 levels by January 1, 2020. Act 234 also established the Greenhouse Gas Emissions Reduction Task
Force, which is tasked with developing measures to meet Hawaii’s GHG emissions reduction goal. The Task Force filed a report to the Hawaii Legislature on December 30, 2009, strongly supporting the Hawaii Clean Energy Initiative, which
calls for additional renewable energy development, increased energy efficiency, and incorporates already-enacted renewable portfolio standards. The Task Force also evaluated other mechanisms and concluded that a state-level cap-and-trade program is
inappropriate due to the small size of Hawaii’s economy.

At this time, other than the estimated
impact of CO2compliance noted above for certain of its
businesses that are subject to RGGI, the Company has not estimated the costs of compliance with other potential United States federal, state or regional CO2emissions reduction legislation or initiatives, such as A.B. 32, WCI, MGGRA and potential Hawaii regulations, due to the
fact that most of these proposals are not being actively pursued or are in the early stages of development and any final regulations or laws, if adopted, could vary drastically from current proposals, or, in the case of A.B. 32, due to the fact that
we anticipate such costs to be passed through to our offtakers under the terms of existing tolling agreements. Although complete specific implementation measures for any federal regulations, WCI, MGGRA and the Hawaiian regulations have yet to be
finalized, if these GHG-related initiatives are finalized they may affect a number of the Company’s United States subsidiaries unless they are preempted by federal GHG legislation. Any federal, state or regional legislation or regulations
adopted in the United States that would require the reduction of GHG emissions could have a material effect on the Company’s consolidated results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

The possible impact of any future federal GHG legislation or regulations or any regional or state proposal will depend on various
factors, including but not limited to:



•the geographic scope of legislation and/or regulation (e.g., federal, regional, state), which entities are subject to the legislation and/or
regulation (e.g., electricity generators, load-serving entities, electricity deliverers, etc.), the enactment date of the legislation and/or regulation and the compliance deadlines set forth therein;



•the level of reductions of
CO2being sought by the regulation and/or legislation
(e.g., 10%, 20%, 50%, etc.) and the year selected as a baseline for determining the amount or percentage of mandated
CO2reduction (e.g., 10% reduction from 1990 CO2emission levels, 20% reduction from 2000 CO2emission levels, etc.);



•the legislative and/or regulatory structure (e.g., a CO2cap-and-trade program, a carbon tax, CO2emission limits, etc.);



•in any cap-and-trade program, the mechanism used to determine the price of emission allowances or offsets to be auctioned by designated governmental
authorities or representatives;



•the price of offsets and emission allowances in the secondary market, including any price floors or price caps on the costs of offsets and emission
allowances;



•the operation of and emissions from regulated units;



•the permissibility of using offsets to meet reduction requirements and the requirements of such offsets (e.g., type of offset projects allowed,
the amount of offsets that can be used for compliance purposes,







any geographic limitations regarding the origin or location of creditable offset projects), as well as the methods required to determine whether the offsets have resulted in reductions in GHG
emissions and that those reductions are permanent (i.e., the verification method);



•whether the use of proceeds of any auction conducted by responsible governmental authorities is reinvested in developing new energy technologies, is
used to offset any cost impact on certain energy consumers or is used to address issues unrelated to power;



•how the price of electricity is determined at the affected businesses, including whether the price includes any costs resulting from any new CO2legislation and the potential to transfer compliance costs pursuant to
legislation, market or contract, to other parties;



•any impact on fuel demand and volatility that may affect the market clearing price for power;



•the effects of any legislation or regulation on the operation of power generation facilities that may in turn affect reliability;



•the availability and cost of carbon control technology;



•the extent to which existing contractual arrangements transfer compliance costs to power offtakers or other contractual counterparties of our
subsidiaries;



•whether legislation regulating GHG emissions will preclude the EPA from regulating GHG emissions under the Clean Air Act or preempt private nuisance
suits or other litigation by third parties; and



•any opportunities to change the use of fuel at the generation facilities of our subsidiaries or opportunities to increase efficiency.

Other United States Air Emissions Regulations and Legislation.In the United
States the CAA and various state laws and regulations regulate emissions of air pollutants, including SO2, NOX,
particulate matter (“PM”), mercury and other hazardous air pollutants (“HAPs”). The applicable rules and the steps taken by the Company to comply with the rules are discussed in further detail below.

The EPA promulgated the “Clean Air Interstate Rule” (“CAIR”) on March 10, 2005, which
required allowance surrender for SO2and NOXemissions from existing power plants located in 28 eastern states and
the District of Columbia. CAIR contemplated two implementation phases. The first phase was to begin in 2009 and 2010 for
NOXand SO2, respectively. A second phase with additional allowance surrender
obligations for both air emissions was to begin in 2015. To implement the required emission reductions for this rule, the states were to establish emission allowance based “cap-and-trade” programs. CAIR was subsequently challenged in
federal court, and on July 11, 2008, the United States Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit issued an opinion striking down much of CAIR and remanding it to the EPA.

In response to the D.C. Circuit’s opinion, on July 7, 2011, the EPA issued a final rule titled
“Federal Implementation Plans to Reduce Interstate Transport of Fine Particulate Matter and Ozone in 27 States,” which is now referred to as the Cross-State Air Pollution Rule (“CSAPR”). Starting in 2012, the CSAPR requires
significant reductions in SO2and NOXemissions from covered sources, such as power plants, in many states in
which subsidiaries of the Company operate. Once fully implemented in 2014, the rule requires additional SO2emission reductions of 73% and additional NOXreductions of 54% from 2005 levels. The CSAPR will be implemented, in part, through a market-based program under which compliance may be achievable through the acquisition and use of new emissions
allowances that the EPA will create. The CSAPR contemplates limited interstate and intra-state trading of emissions allowances by covered sources. Initially, at least through 2012, the EPA will issue emissions allowances to affected power plants
based on state emissions budgets established by the EPA under the CSAPR. The future availability of and cost to purchase allowances to meet the emission reduction requirements is uncertain at this time. The CSAPR was published in the Federal
Register on August 8, 2011, and on October 6, 2011, the EPA proposed some technical revisions to the CSAPR, including allowing for additional allowances for certain states.














New Source Review

The new source review (“NSR”) requirements under the CAA impose certain requirements on major emission sources, such as electric
generating stations, if changes are made to the sources that result in a significant increase in air emissions. Certain projects, including power plant modifications, are excluded from these NSR requirements, if they meet the routine maintenance,
repair and replacement (“RMRR”) exclusion of the CAA. There is ongoing uncertainty, and significant litigation, regarding which projects fall within the RMRR exclusion. The EPA has pursued a coordinated compliance and enforcement strategy
to address NSR compliance issues at the nation’s coal-fired power plants. The strategy has included both the filing of suits against power plant owners and the issuance of Notices of Violation (“NOVs”) to a number of power plant
owners alleging NSR violations. See Item 3.—Legal Proceedings in this Form 10-K for more detail with respect to environmental litigation and regulatory action, including a NOV issued by the EPA against IPL concerning NSR and
prevention of significant deterioration issues under the United States Clean Air Act.

During the last decade, DP&L’s
Stuart Station and Hutching Station have received NOVs from the EPA alleging that certain activities undertaken in the past are outside the scope of the RMRR exclusion. Additionally, generation units partially owned by DP&L but operated by other
utilities have received such NOVs relating to equipment repairs or replacements alleged to be outside the RMRR exclusion. The NOVs issued to DP&L-operated plants have not been pursued through litigation by the EPA.

If NSR requirements were imposed on any of the power plants owned by subsidiaries of the Company, the results could have a material
impact on the Company’s business, financial condition and results of operations. In connection with the imposition of any such NSR requirements on our U.S. utilities, DP&L and IPL, the utilities would seek recovery of any operating or
capital expenditures related to air pollution control technology to reduce regulated air emissions; however, there can be no assurances that they would be successful in that regard.

Regional Haze Rule

Other International Air Emissions Regulations and Legislation.In Europe,
the Company is, and will continue to be, required to reduce air emissions from our facilities to comply with applicable EUC Directives, including Directive 2001/80/EC on the limitation of emissions of certain pollutants into the air from large
combustion plants (the “LCPD”), which sets emission limit values for NOX, SO2and
particulate matter for large-scale industrial combustion plants for all Member States. Until June 2004, existing coal, gas and oil plants could “opt-in” or “opt-out” of the LCPD emissions standards. Those plants that opted out
will be required to cease all operations by 2015 and may not operate for more than 20,000 hours after 2008. Those that opted-in, like







the Company’s Kilroot facility in the United Kingdom, must invest in abatement technology to achieve specific SO2reductions. Kilroot installed a new flue gas desulphurization system in the second quarter of 2009 in order to satisfy
SO2reduction requirements. The Company’s other coal
plants in Europe are either exempt from the Directive due to their size or have opted-in but will not require any additional abatement technology to comply with the LCPD, or, in the case of AES Ballylumford ‘B Station,’ have opted out of
the LCPD and will have to retire from operations by 2015.

Over the next four years, the Company’s obligations under the
LCPD with respect to our existing facilities will be replaced by obligations under Directive 2010/75/EU on industrial emissions (integrated pollution prevention and control) (the “IED”), which came into force on January 6, 2011 and
has to be transposed into national legislation by Member States by January 7, 2013. Progress in implementation of the directive referred to above varies from Member State to Member State. The scope of the IED is wider than the LCPD. It aims to
reduce emissions of pollutants that are alleged to be harmful to the environment and associated with cancer, asthma and acid rain, and it seeks to prevent and control air, water and soil pollution by industrial installations. It regulates emissions
of a wide range of pollutants, including sulfur and nitrogen compounds, dust particles, asbestos and heavy metals.

The IED
provides for a more harmonized and rigorous implementation of permit requirements for large industrial plants, seeking to optimize environmental performance by requiring adoption of the cleanest available technology, so-called Best Available
Techniques (“BAT”). Guidance as to BATs applicable to various types of installations will be set out in BAT reference documents (“BREFs”), which the EU will publish based on information and emerging practices from across the EU.
Regulators in all Member States will be required to take the BREFs into consideration when assessing permit requirements at each facility. Deviations from these standards will only be permitted where local and technical characteristics would make it
disproportionately costly to comply.

In addition to general BAT requirements, the IED also imposes
tighter, prescribed minimum emission limits for NOX,
SO2and dust from power plants. Some of these limits are
significantly lower than under the LCPD. Existing power plants have to comply with these standards from January 1, 2016 subject to the provisions of “Transitional National Plans,” which Member States may adopt to allow for existing
plants to emit above the prescribed limits, in accordance with declining annual caps on NOX, SO2and/or
dust emissions. The annual caps for NOX, SO2and/or dust emissions must align with the prescribed limits by
June 30, 2020. These transitional arrangements are only available to plants which:



•received their first permit (or submitted a permit application) before November 27, 2002; and



•started operating before November 27, 2003.

Where installations are already scheduled to close by the end of 2023 or operate less than 17,500 hours after 2016, they may be permitted to operate without an upgrade, provided that they are not already
exempt, pursuant to a “lifetime derogation plan,” and must be agreed to by 2016 by the relevant regulator. AES generation businesses in each Member State will be required to comply with the relevant measures taken to implement the
directives. At this time, the Company cannot yet determine the costs associated with the implementation of the IED in Member States that regulate the Company’s subsidiaries, but it could have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated
operations or results.

On January 18, 2011, the President of Chile approved a new air emissions
regulation submitted to him by the national environmental regulatory agency (“CONAMA”). The new regulation establishes limits on emissions of NOX, SO2, metals and particulate matter for both existing and new thermal power plants, with more stringent limitations on new
facilities. The regulation became effective on June 23, 2011. The regulation will require AES Gener, the Company’s Chilean subsidiary, to install emissions reduction equipment at its existing thermal plants. For further information see
Item 1.Business—Regulatory Matters—Chile—Environmental Regulationsin this Form 10-K.







Water Discharges.The Company’s facilities are subject to a variety of rules
governing water discharges. In particular, the Company’s U.S. facilities are subject to the U.S. Clean Water Act Section 316(b) rule issued by the EPA which seeks to protect fish and other aquatic organisms by requiring existing steam
electric generating facilities to utilize the “Best Technology Available” (“BTA”) for cooling water intake structures. The EPA published a proposed rule establishing requirements under 316(b) regulations on April 20, 2011.
The proposal, based on Section 316(b) of the U.S. Clean Water Act, establishes BTA requirements regarding impingement standards with respect to aquatic organisms for all facilities that withdraw above 2 million gallons per day of water
from certain bodies of water and utilize at least 25% of the withdrawn water for cooling purposes. To meet these BTA requirements, as currently proposed, cooling water intake structures associated with once through cooling processes will need
modifications of existing traveling screens that protect aquatic organisms and will need to add a fish return and handling system for each cooling system. Existing closed cycle cooling facilities may require upgrades to water intake structure
systems. The proposal would also require comprehensive site-specific studies during the permitting process and may require closed-cycle cooling systems in order to meet BTA entrainment standards.

DP&L is in ongoing negotiations with the EPA and Ohio EPA regarding a National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System permit (the
Permit) for J.M. Stuart Station. The primary issue involves the thermal discharges from the Station including the applicability of water quality standards measured either at the point of discharge into a canal that is downstream of Little Three
Mile Creek or measured at the point at which the canal discharges into the Ohio River. The EPA is taking the position that the canal is a part of Little Three Mile Creek and that water quality standards should be complied with at the point of
discharge into the canal. Two public hearings have been held, one by the EPA in 2011 as part of their review process for draft permits prepared by the Ohio EPA, and one by Ohio EPA in February 2012. The timing of an issuance of a final
Permit is uncertain but could occur within 2012 and could impose a future deadline for compliance and compliance requirements could have a material financial effect on DP&L in the future. DP&L is attempting to resolve this issue with
both the EPA and Ohio EPA.

Waste Management.In the course of operations, the Company’s facilities generate solid
and liquid waste materials requiring eventual disposal or processing. With the exception of coal combustion byproducts (“CCB”), the wastes are not usually physically disposed of on our property, but are shipped off site for final disposal,
treatment or recycling. CCB, which consists of bottom ash, fly ash and air pollution control wastes, is disposed of







Although the public comment
period for this proposed regulation has expired, the EPA issued a Notice of Data Availability (“NODA”) on October 12, 2011, which allowed the public to submit additional information until November 14, 2011, which the EPA is
considering prior to promulgating a final rule. The EPA is also conducting a coal ash reuse risk analysis that the EPA has stated it will complete before issuing a final rule in late 2012. The EPA is likely to retain its five-year deadline for
meeting the final rule’s surface impoundment requirements. While the exact impact and compliance cost associated with future regulations of CCB cannot be established until such regulations are finalized, there can be no assurance that the
Company’s businesses, financial condition or results of operations would not be materially and adversely affected by such regulations.

Senate Bill 251

In May 2011, Senate Bill 251 became a law in the State of
Indiana. Senate Bill 251 is a comprehensive bill which, among other things, provides Indiana utilities, including IPL, with a means for recovering 80% of costs incurred to comply with federal mandates through a periodic retail rate adjustment
mechanism. This includes costs to comply with regulations from the EPA, FERC, NERC, Department of Energy, etc., including capital intensive requirements and/or proposals described herein, such as cooling water intake regulations, waste management
and coal combustion byproducts, wastewater effluent, MISO transmission expansion costs and polychlorinated biphenyls. It does not change existing legislation that allows for 100% recovery of clean coal technology designed to reduce air pollutants
(“Indiana Senate Bill 29”).

Some of the most important features of Senate Bill 251 to IPL are as follows. Any
energy utility in Indiana seeking to recover federally mandated costs incurred in connection with a compliance project shall apply to the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission (“IURC”) for a certificate of public convenience and necessity
(“CPCN”) for the compliance project. It sets forth certain factors that the IURC must consider in determining whether to grant a CPCN. It further specifies that if the IURC approves a proposed compliance project and the projected federally
mandated costs associated with the project, the following apply: (i) 80% of the approved costs shall be recovered by the energy utility through a periodic retail rate adjustment mechanism, (ii) 20% of the approved costs shall be deferred
and recovered by the energy utility as part of the next general rate case filed by the energy utility with the IURC, and (iii) actual costs exceeding the projected federally mandated costs of the approved compliance project by more than 25%
shall require specific justification and approval before being authorized in the energy utility’s next general rate case. Senate Bill 251 also requires the IURC to adopt rules to establish a voluntary clean energy portfolio standard program.
Such program will provide incentives to participating







electricity suppliers to obtain specified percentages of electricity from clean energy sources in accordance with clean portfolio standard goals, including requiring at least 50% of the clean
energy to originate from Indiana suppliers. The goals can also be met by purchasing clean energy credits.

CERCLA. The
Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 (“CERCLA” aka “Superfund”) may be the source of claims against certain of the Company’s U.S. subsidiaries from time to time. There is ongoing
litigation at a site known as the South Dayton Landfill where a group of companies already recognized as Potentially Responsible Parties (“PRP”) have sued DP&L and other unrelated entities seeking a contribution towards the costs of
assessment and remediation. DP&L is actively opposing such claims. In 2003, DP&L received notice that the EPA considers DP&L to be a PRP at the Tremont City landfill Superfund site. No actions have taken place since 2003
regarding the Tremont City landfill. The Company is unable to determine whether there will be any liability, or the size of any liability that may ultimately be assessed against DP&L at these two sites, but any such liability could be
material to DP&L.
