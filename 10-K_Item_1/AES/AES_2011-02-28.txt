ITEM 1.BUSINESS

Overview

We are a global power company. We own a portfolio of electricity generation and distribution businesses
on five continents in 28 countries, with total capacity of approximately 40,500 Megawatts (“MW”) and distribution networks serving over 12 million people as of December 31, 2010. In addition, we have more than 2,000 MW under
construction in six countries. Our global workforce of approximately 29,000 people helps provide electricity to people in diverse markets ranging from urban centers in the United States to remote villages in India. We were incorporated in Delaware
in 1981 and for three decades we have been committed to providing safe and reliable energy.

We own and operate two primary
types of businesses. The first is our Generation business, where we own and/or operate power plants to generate and sell power to wholesale customers such as utilities and other intermediaries. The second is our Utilities business, where we own
and/or operate utilities to distribute, transmit and sell electricity to end-user customers in the residential, commercial, industrial and governmental sectors within a defined service area.

Our assets are diverse with respect to fuel source and type of market, which helps reduce certain types of operating risk. Our portfolio
employs a broad range of fuels, including coal, gas, fuel oil, biomass and renewable sources such as hydroelectric power, wind and solar, which reduces the risks associated with dependence on any one fuel source. Our presence in mature markets helps
reduce the volatility associated with our businesses in faster-growing emerging markets. In addition, our Generation portfolio is largely contracted, which reduces the risk related to market prices of electricity and fuel. We also attempt to limit
risk by hedging some of our interest rate and commodity risk, and by matching the currency of most of our subsidiary debt to the revenue of the underlying business. However, our business is still subject to these and other risks, which are further
described in Item 1A.—Risk Factors of this Form 10-K.

Our goal is to maximize value for our shareholders
through continued focus on increasing the profitability of our existing portfolio and increasing cash flow while managing our risk and employing rigorous capital allocation. We will continue to seek prudent expansion of our traditional Generation
and Utilities lines of business, along with expansion of wind, solar and energy storage, through acquisitions or greenfield developments. Portfolio management remains an area of focus through which we have sold and expect to continue to sell or
monetize a portion of certain businesses or assets when market values appear attractive. Furthermore, we will continue to focus on improving our business operations and management processes, including our internal controls over financial reporting.

Key Lines of Business

AES’ primary sources of revenue and gross margin today are from Generation and Utilities. These businesses are distinguished by the nature of the customers, operational differences, cost structure,
regulatory environment and risk exposure. The breakout of revenue and gross margin between Generation and Utilities for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively, is shown below. Operating results for integrated utilities,
which have both Generation and Utilities, are reflected in the Utilities amounts below.







Revenue

($ in billions)



Gross Margin

($ in billions)





(1)Utilities gross margin includes the margin from generation businesses owned by the Company and from whom the utility purchases energy.

Generation

We currently own or operate a generation portfolio of approximately 34,100 MW, excluding the generation capabilities of our integrated utilities, consisting of 100 Generation facilities in 25
countries on five continents at our generation businesses. We also have approximately 1,700 MW of capacity currently under construction in four countries. We are a major power source in many countries, such as Panama where we are the largest
generator of electricity, and Chile, where AES Gener (“Gener”) is the second largest electricity generation company in terms of capacity. Our Generation business uses a wide range of technologies and fuel types including coal,
combined-cycle gas turbines, hydroelectric power and biomass. Generation revenue was $7.5 billion, $6.1 billion and $7.4 billion for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.

Performance drivers for our Generation businesses include, among other factors, plant reliability, fuel costs, power prices, volume and
fixed-cost management. Growth in the Generation business is largely tied to securing new power purchase agreements (“PPAs”), expanding capacity in our existing facilities and building or acquiring new power plants.







The majority of the electricity produced by our Generation businesses is sold under
long-term PPAs, to wholesale customers. In 2010, approximately 64% of the revenue from our Generation business was from plants that operate under PPAs of three years or longer for 75% or more of their output capacity. These businesses often reduce
their exposure to fuel supply risks by entering into long-term fuel supply contracts or fuel tolling arrangements where the customer assumes full responsibility for purchasing and supplying the fuel to the power plant. These long-term contractual
agreements help reduce the volatility of our cash flows and earnings and also reduce exposure to volatility in the market price for electricity and fuel; however, the amount of earnings and cash flow predictability varies from business to business
based on the degree to which its exposure is limited by the contracts it has negotiated.

Our Generation businesses with
long-term contracts face most of their competition from other utilities and independent power producers (“IPPs”) prior to the execution of a power sales agreement during the development phase of a project or upon expiration of an existing
agreement. Once a project is operational, we traditionally have faced limited competition due to the long-term nature of the generation contracts. However, as our existing contracts expire, the introduction of new power markets has increased
competition to attract new customers and maintain our current customer base.

The balance of our Generation business sells
power through competitive markets under short-term contracts, directly in the spot market or, in some cases, at regulated prices. As a result, the cash flows and earnings associated with these businesses are more sensitive to fluctuations in the
market price for electricity, natural gas, coal and other fuels. Competitive factors for these facilities include price, reliability, operational cost and third-party credit requirements.

Utilities

AES utility businesses distribute power to over 12 million people in seven countries on five continents and consist primarily of 14
companies owned or operated under management agreements, each of which operate in defined service areas. These businesses also include 15 generation plants in two countries with generation capacity totaling approximately 4,600 MW. These
businesses have a variety of structures ranging from pure distribution businesses to fully integrated utilities, which generate, transmit and distribute power. For instance, our wholly owned subsidiary in the U.S., Indianapolis Power &
Light (“IPL”), has the exclusive right to provide retail services to approximately 470,000 customers in Indianapolis, Indiana. Eletropaulo Metropolitana Electricidad de São Paulo S.A (“AES Eletropaulo” or
“Eletropaulo”), serving the São Paulo metropolitan region for over 100 years, has approximately six million customers and is the largest electricity distribution company in Brazil in terms of revenue and electricity
distributed. In Cameroon, we are the primary generator and distributor of electricity and in El Salvador we provide distribution services to serve more than 77% of the country’s electricity customers. Utilities revenue was $9.1 billion,
$7.8 billion and $7.8 billion for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.

Performance
drivers for Utilities include, but are not limited to, reliability of service, management of working capital, negotiation of tariff adjustments, compliance with extensive regulatory requirements, and in developing countries, reduction of commercial
and technical losses. The results of operations of our Utilities businesses are sensitive to changes in economic growth, regulations and variations in weather conditions in the areas in which they operate.

Utilities face relatively little direct competition due to significant barriers to entry which are present in these markets. In certain
locations, our distribution businesses face increased competition as a result of changes in laws and regulations which allow wholesale and retail services to be provided on a competitive basis. Competition is a factor in efforts to acquire existing
businesses. In this arena, we compete against a number of other market participants, some of which have greater financial resources, have been engaged in distribution related businesses for longer periods of time and/or have accumulated more
significant portfolios. Relevant competitive factors for our power distribution businesses include financial resources, governmental assistance, regulatory restrictions and access to non-recourse financing.







Renewables and Other Initiatives

Risks

We routinely encounter and address risks, some of which may cause our future results to be different, sometimes materially different, than we presently anticipate. The categories of risk we have
identified in Item 1A.—Risk Factors of this Form 10-K include the following:



•risks associated with our disclosure controls and internal controls over financial reporting;



•risks related to our high level of indebtedness;



•risks associated with our ability to raise needed capital;



•external risks associated with revenue and earnings volatility;



•risks associated with our operations; and



•risks associated with governmental regulation and laws.

The categories of risk identified above are discussed in greater detail in Item 1A.—Risk Factors of this Form 10-K. These risk factors should be read in conjunction with
Item 7.—Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, and the Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report.

Our Organization and Segments

We believe our broad geographic footprint allows us to focus development in targeted markets with opportunities for new investment, and
provides stability through our presence in more developed regions. In addition, our presence in each region affords us important relationships and helps us identify local markets with attractive opportunities for new investment. As a result, we have
structured our organization into geographic regions, and each region is led by a regional president or other senior executive responsible for managing those businesses. The regional presidents report to our Chief Operating Officer (“COO”),
who in turn reports to our Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”). Both our CEO and COO are based in Arlington, Virginia.

The Company’s segment reporting structure is organized along our two lines of business (Generation and Utilities) and three regions:
(1) Latin America & Africa; (2) North America; and (3) Europe, Middle East & Asia (collectively, “EMEA”), which reflects how we manage the business internally. Additionally, AES Wind Generation is managed
within our North America region. For financial reporting purposes, the Company has six reportable segments which include:



•Latin America—Generation;



•Latin America—Utilities;







•North America—Generation;



•North America—Utilities;



•Europe—Generation;



•Asia—Generation.

Corporate and Other—The Company’s Europe Utilities, Africa Utilities, Africa Generation and AES Wind Generation businesses as well as the Company’s renewables initiatives are
reported within “Corporate and Other” because they do not require separate disclosure under segment reporting accounting guidance. See Item 7.—Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations for further discussion of the Company’s segment structure used for financial reporting purposes.

The
following describes our businesses as they are aligned in our segment reporting structure for financial reporting purposes.

North America Utilities.AES has one integrated utility in North America, IPL, which it
owns through IPALCO Enterprises Inc. (“IPALCO”), the parent holding company of IPL. IPL generates, transmits, distributes and sells electricity to approximately 470,000 customers in the city of Indianapolis and neighboring areas
within the state of Indiana. IPL owns and operates four generation facilities that provide more than 96% of the electricity it distributes. Two of the generation facilities are coal-fired plants. The third facility has a combination of units that
use coal (base load capacity) and natural gas and/or oil (peaking capacity). The fourth facility is a small peaking station that uses gas-fired combustion turbine technology. IPL’s gross generation capacity is 3,699 MW. Approximately 45% of
IPL’s coal is provided by one supplier with which IPL has long-term contracts. A key driver for the business is tariff recovery for environmental projects through the rate adjustment process. IPL’s customers include residential,
industrial, commercial and all other which made up 37%, 40%, 15% and 8%, respectively, of North America Utilities revenue for 2010.

Europe Generation.Our Generation operations in Europe accounted for 8%, 6% and 8% of our consolidated revenue in 2010,
2009 and 2008, respectively. In 2007, we began commercial operation of AES Cartagena (“Cartagena”), our first power plant in Spain, with capacity of 1,199 MW. As a result of the new accounting guidance for variable interest entities, the
Company consolidated Cartagena effective January 1, 2010. In prior periods, the results of operations for Cartagena were included in the Equity in Earnings of Affiliates line item on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Today, AES
operates four power plants in Kazakhstan which account for 8% of the country’s total installed generation capacity. In September 2009, AES completed construction and launched commercial operation of the 380 MW combined-cycle Amman East power
plant in Jordan. See Note 15—Segment and Geographic Information in the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for revenue, Adjusted Gross Margin (a non-GAAP measure) and total assets by segment. Key
business drivers of this segment are: foreign currency exchange rates, new legislation and regulations including those related to the environment.

Regulatory Matters

Overview

In each country where we conduct business, we are subject to extensive and complex governmental regulations which affect most aspects of
our business, such as regulations governing the generation and distribution of electricity and environmental regulations. These regulations affect the operation, development, growth and ownership of our businesses. Regulations differ on a
country-by-country basis and are based upon the type of business we operate in a particular country.

Regulation of our
Generation Businesses

Our Generation businesses operate in two different types of regulatory environments: Market
Environments and Other Environments.

Market Environments. In market environments, sales of electricity may be made
directly on the spot market, under negotiated bilateral contracts, or pursuant to PPAs. The spot markets are typically administered by a central dispatch or system operator who seeks to optimize the use of the generation resources throughout an
interconnected system (the cost of the least expensive next-generation plant required to meet system demand). The spot price is usually set at the marginal cost of energy or based on bid prices. In addition, many of these wholesale markets include
markets for ancillary services to support the reliable operation of the transmission system, such as regulation (a service that corrects for short-term changes in electricity use that could impact the stability of the power system). Most of our
businesses in Europe, Latin America and the United States operate in these types of liberalized markets.

Other
Environments. We operate Generation assets in certain countries that do not have a spot market. In these environments, electricity is sold only through PPAs with state-owned entities and/or industrial clients as the offtaker. Examples of
countries where we operate in this type of environment include Jordan, Nigeria, Puerto Rico and Sri Lanka.







Regulation of our Distribution Businesses

In general, our distribution companies sell electricity directly to end-users such as homes and businesses and bill customers directly.
The amount our distribution companies can charge customers for electricity is governed by a regulated tariff. The tariff, in turn, is generally based upon a certain usage level that includes a pass-through to the customer of costs that are not
controlled by the distribution company, including the costs of fuel (in the case of integrated utilities) and/or the costs of purchased energy, plus a margin for the value added by the distributor, which is usually calculated as a fair return on the
fair value of the company’s assets. This regulated tariff is periodically reviewed and reset by the applicable regulatory agency. Components of the tariff that are directly passed through to the customer are usually adjusted through an
automated process. In many instances, the tariffs can be adjusted between scheduled regulatory resets pursuant to an inflation adjustment or another index. Customers with demand above a certain level are often unregulated and can choose to contract
with generation companies directly and pay a wheeling fee, which is a fee to the distribution company for use of the distribution system. Most of our utilities operate as monopolies within exclusive geographic areas set by the regulatory agency and
face limited competition from other distributors.

Set forth below is a discussion of certain regulations we operate under in
the countries where we do business. In each country, the regulatory environment can pose material risks to our business, operations or financial condition. For further discussion of those risks, see the Item 1A.—Risk Factors of this Form
10-K.

Latin America and Africa

Argentina

Structure of Electricity Market. The Argentine
electricity market is divided into three separate lines of business: generation, transmission and distribution. AES Argentina operates 12% of the installed capacity of the Wholesale Electricity Market (“WEM”) and two distribution
companies: one under federal jurisdiction–EDELAP; and the other under the jurisdiction of the Province of Buenos Aires–EDES. The law recognizes a category of large users made up of industrial companies and other consumers with substantial
electricity supply needs.

The WEM is comprised of:



•A Term Contracts Market, with contracts freely agreed amongst producers and consumers;



•A Spot Market, with prices sanctioned on an hourly basis considering the economic cost of production represented by the short-term marginal cost (spot
prices); and



•A Stabilization System on a quarterly basis of the prices forecasted for the spot market, created for the purchase of the distributors (seasonal
prices).

Principal Regulators. The National Electricity Regulating Agency (“ENRE”) is
responsible for ensuring transmission and distribution companies comply with the concessions granted by the Argentine government and approving distribution tariffs. The WEM is managed by Compañía Administradora del Mercado Mayorista
Eléctrico, Sociedad Anónima (“CAMMESA”), the independent system operator. CAMMESA also acts as the dispatch entity, or OED (Organismo Encargado de Desapacho), and manages the organization, dispatch and operations of the WEM
at large according to the policies established by the Energy Secretariat, under the Ministry of Federal Planning, Public Investment and Services. In such capacity, CAMMESA is empowered to interpret the rules relating to the organization, dispatch
and energy agreements in the WEM. In addition to these duties, CAMMESA manages the information on supply and demand in the WEM, which is used by the Energy Secretariat to fix the seasonal prices and the market’s operational rules.
CAMMESA’s operating costs are borne by the WEM’s participants and agents.

In the Provincial Jurisdiction, the
regulator is the Organismo de Control de la Electricidad de Buenos Aires and the Dirección Provincial de Energía under the Ministry of Infrastructure.







Principal Regulations. The electricity sector activities are regulated by the
Electricity Act. Law 24.065 and Law 11.796 regulate the activities of generation, transmission and distribution of electric energy in the territory of the Province of Buenos Aires, determining what activities of transmission and distribution of
energy are public services, whereas the generation is an activity of general interest.

Presently, the price of electric
energy is determined assuming all generating units in Argentina are operating with natural gas, even though the generators may be using more expensive, alternative fuels. In the case of generators using alternative fuels, CAMMESA pays the total
variable cost of production, which may exceed the established spot price. Additionally, in the spot market, generators are also remunerated for their capacity to generate electricity in excess of supply agreements or private contracts executed by
them.

The Argentine government has adopted many new economic measures since 2002, by means of the “Emergency Law”
25561, as amended and extended by various supplemental laws and regulations. These laws and regulations effectively terminated the use of the United States Dollar as the functional currency of the Argentine electricity sector. Distribution companies
are ruled by their Concession Contracts on November 12, 2004.

Material Regulatory Actions. On July 31, 2008,
the ENRE issued Resolution 324 that granted EDELAP a tariff DVA increase of approximately 18%. In addition, the government recognized that a process to establish the RTI (integral tariff reset) should take place during February 2009. On
September 12, 2009, EDELAP submitted the tariff reset proposal to the ENRE. ENRE is considering the tariff proposals submitted by the federal distribution companies. If the regulatory agency continues to delay the granting of the tariff
increase needed by EDELAP, EDELAP could experience significant operational challenges in the future. Total DVA increase granted to EDELAP pursuant to this process is 66%.

In March 2008, the Ministry of Infrastructure of the Province of Buenos Aires issued Resolution 741 which settled a tariff increase of 15% average) to be applied for EDES during 2008 and an increase of
15% average to be applied from 2009. On March 22, 2010, the Ministry of Infrastructure of the Province of Buenos Aires issued Resolution 141 which settled the new tariff to be applied by EDES during 2010. It represents an average increase of
approximately 24%. Total DVA increase granted to EDES pursuant to this process is 190%.

During 2004, the Energy Secretariat
reached agreements with natural gas and electricity producers to reform the energy markets. In the electricity sector, the Energy Secretariat passed Resolution 826/2004, inviting generators to contribute a percentage of their sales margins to fund
the development and construction of two new combined cycle power plants to be installed by 2008/2009 (“FONINVEMEM I & II”). The time period for the funding was set from January 2004 through December 2006 and was subsequently extended
through December 2007. During 2008, both power plants started operation of the gas turbines, and since March 2010, the plants started operations in combined cycle mode. In exchange, the Argentine government committed to reform market regulation to
match more favorable regulations that existed prior to 2001. Additionally, participating generators will receive a pro rata ownership share in the new generation plants after ten years.

Potential or Proposed Regulations. A non-binding general agreement with the rest of the Generators operating in Argentina and the
government was signed on November 25, 2010 to address a nation-wide problem of overdue accounts receivables to the generation market. The non-binding agreement established the guidelines for the detailed documentation that will allow the
execution FONINVEMEM III project agreement and some additional cash revenues. Under the agreement, accounts receivable accrued from July 2009 to December 2011, for an amount of approximately $204 million will be converted into a generation asset
(estimated at 800 MW) to be built under the FONINVEMEM III project. The government will provide funds necessary to finance the projects. The plant will have a PPA with CAMMESA for ten (10) years, calculated to recover 100% of the receivables
invested plus a margin of LIBOR + 5%. Payments will be made once the project begins operations. We expect the existing FONINVEMEM I and II documents will be taken as a base for the future contracts; assuming this, the collection of the 120
installment will not be tied to the availability of the plant. Availability







risk will be assumed by the operator through a Long-Term Service Agreement (“LTSA”). Some penalties may apply to the generating companies, but only in those cases where the
unavailability is caused by their operating decisions not considered in the LTSA. According to this, the yearly penalty would be capped at 10% of the yearly amount required under the PPA. Initially, AES Argentina Generación S.A. will
participate in this proposal under the terms and conditions referred to above. Its equity ownership in the new project will equal its contribution of receivables among the generating companies, estimated to be 24% of the resulting plants. Both power
plants that were built under similar regulations started full operation in combined cycle mode in March 2010, and the installments agreed are being paid on a timely basis.

Brazil

Structure of Electricity Market. In Brazil, there are
two regulatory regimes which regulate PPAs the Regulated Contracting Ambience (“ACR”), for the Generation and Distribution of Electric Power Agents, and the Ambience for Free Contracting (“ACL”), for the Generation,
Commercialization, Importers and Exporters of Energy Power Agents as well as consumers.

This model establishes a number of
requirements to be followed by the participants in the industry, such as the obligation for distributors to contract for their market growth years in advance through regulated auctions; hydro and thermal energy contracting conditions to ensure
better balance between supply cost and system stability; and a permanent supply monitoring structure to detect possible imbalances between supply and demand.

Principal Regulators. In Brazil, there are a number of regulatory bodies which govern the electricity sector including the Brazilian Electricity Regulatory Agency (“ANEEL”) and the
Chamber of Electrical Energy Commercialization (“CCEE”).

ANEEL’s responsibilities are to regulate and inspect
production, transmission, distribution and commercialization of electricity in order to assure quality of provided services and universal access. ANEEL is also responsible for the establishment of tariffs for end consumers, in a way that the
economic and financial feasibility of power sector participants as Generation, Transmission and Distribution companies and such as the industry as a whole is preserved. The changes brought about in 2004 by the new model made ANEEL responsible for
promoting, directly or indirectly, auctions for the Distribution companies to purchase energy through long-term contracts within the National Interconnected System (Sistema Interligado Nacional) (“SIN”).

The CCEE (former Mercado Atacadista de Energia) paramount obligations include: the determination of the Differences’ Price
Settlement (Preço de Liquidação de Diferenças) (“PLD”), or Spot Price, used to value short-term market transactions; the execution of the energy accounting process, identifying who and how much electricity is
involved in multilateral short-term market transactions; the financial settlement of the amounts calculated in the energy accounting process; and preparation and execution of energy auctions within the ACR by ANEEL’s delegation.

Principal Regulations.

Distribution Companies. AES has two distribution businesses in Brazil: AES Eletropaulo and AES Sul. Under the power sector model, distribution companies have to purchase electricity at the
regulated market through auctions. Every distribution utility is obligated to contract to meet 100% of its energy needs in the ACR. Bilateral contracts are being honored but cannot be renewed. The tariff charged by distribution companies to captive
customers is composed of a non-manageable cost component (“Parcel A”), which includes energy purchase costs and charges related to the use of transmission and distribution systems and is directly passed through to customers, and a
manageable cost component (“Parcel B”), which includes operation and maintenance costs based on a model distribution company defined by ANEEL, recovery of depreciated assets and a component for the value added by the distributor
(calculated as net asset base multiplied by pre-tax weighted







average cost of capital). Parcel B is reset every four years for AES Eletropaulo and every five years for AES Sul. There is an annual tariff adjustment to pass through Parcel A costs to customers
and to adjust the Parcel B costs by inflation, less an efficiency factor. Distribution companies could also be entitled to extraordinary tariff revisions in the event of significant changes to their cost structure.

In the first half of 2010, all distribution companies signed amendments to the Concession Contracts, capturing market variance effects
over sector charges. AES Eletropaulo signed its amendment on May 3, while AES Sul signed it on April 12. The 2010 tariff readjustment already reflected such amendment. Additionally, ANEEL conducted a public hearing regarding the partition
of the extraordinary tariff reset (“RTE”) between Generation and Distribution companies. The RTE was designed to recover revenue losses of Distribution companies and energy purchase costs of Generation companies, both during the rationing
period that occurred in 2001 and as a result of regulatory, market and weather-related conditions. The RTE’s period of application for AES Eletropaulo was limited to 70 months, which was not sufficient to recover its revenue losses. The Public
Hearing process was concluded on January 12, 2010, generating an initial negative impact before taxes to AES Eletropaulo of R$6.8 million ($4.1 million) recorded in 2009, offset by a positive impact before taxes of R$7.3 million ($4.4 million)
recorded in 2010 for additional RTE adjustments. AES Tietê recorded revenue of R$6.2 million ($3.7 million) in 2010.

Generation Companies. AES has two generation businesses in Brazil: AES Tietê and AES Uruguaiana. Under the power sector
model, the Ministry of Mines and Energy MME determines the amount of energy to be sold by each plant known as “assured energy” or the amount of energy representing the long-term average energy production of the plant defined by ANEEL.
Together with the system operator, ANEEL establishes the assured energy which is the amount of energy to be sold by each plant through long term contracts. The system operator determines generation dispatch which takes into account nationwide
electricity demand, hydrological conditions and system constraints. In order to mitigate the risks involved in hydroelectric generation for each generator and to optimize the system generation capacity, a mechanism is in place to transfer energy
from those who generated more than the average of the system to those who generated less than the average. The energy that is reallocated through this mechanism is priced pursuant to an energy optimization tariff, designed to optimize the use of
generation available in the system.

AES Tietê is allowed to sell electric power within the ACR and ACL, maintaining the
competitive nature of the generation. Generation companies must provide physical coverage from their own power generation or purchase contracts for 100% of their sale contracts. The failure to provide the required physical coverage and/or present
purchase contracts, which is subject to monthly verification, exposes the generation company to the payment of penalties.

Beginning in 2003, 25% of AES Tiete’s assured energy has been added annually to the volume marketed through a PPA and consequently
since 2006, all of AES Tiete’s assured energy has been sold to AES Eletropaulo. The PPA entered into with AES Eletropaulo which expires on December 31, 2015, and requires that the price of energy sold be adjusted annually based on the
Brazilian inflation variation. Before the end of the PPA in 2015, AES Tietê must seek alternatives to the immediate re-contracting of its assured energy from 2016 onwards. Existing legislation allows AES Tietê to allocate its energy to
the regulated auctions of existing energy, or in the free market through bilateral contracts for non-distribution companies.

The state of São Paulo stablished some conditions to privatize the generation sector in Sao Paulo state including an obligation to
increase generation capacity by 15%, originally to be accomplished by the end of 2007. AES Tietê, as well as other concessionaire generators, were not able to meet this requirement due to regulatory, environmental and hydrological constraints.
Currently, the matter is under consideration by the government of the State of São Paulo (related to the increased capacity) after a decision by ANEEL’s Board of Officers that ANEEL is not the appropriate authority to consider the
extension, since the expansion obligation derives from the purchase and sale agreement between AES Tietê and the Government of São Paulo, and not from the concession agreement itself. AES Tietê is reviewing any may pursue the
development of certain gas-fired facilities in order to meet this obligation.







Environmental Regulations

Material Regulatory Actions. According to the Concession Contract, distribution companies go through a
tariff adjustment process every year. AES Eletropaulo was granted an 8.00% average tariff adjustment to be applied to the Company’s tariff as from July 4, 2010. AES Sul’s average tariff adjustment was 5.56% as of April 19, 2010.

On May 16, 2002, ANEEL issued the Order #288, a regulation that established the retroactive denial to the choice of not
participating in the “exposition relief mechanism,” a tool that allowed the sale of energy from Itaipu Generating Co. in the Spot Market. Due to its negative impact, AES Sul filed a lawsuit seeking the annulment of Order #288. For a
further discussion of this dispute see Item 3.—Legal Proceedings in this Form 10-K.

Potential or Proposed
Regulations. In 2011, the Third Reset Cycle begins; AES Eletropaulo’s will take place in 2011 and AES Sul’s will occur in 2013. A public hearing proposed a new methodology for tariff reset and our comments were submitted on
January 10, 2011, There is a another on going regarding a new methodology for tariff reset promote a new methodology for defining quality of service indicators. The outcome of these hearings is unknown. However, if the revised tariff is
inexplicitly low or our quality of service indicators are found inadequate, there could be a material impact on our business.

Cameroon

Structure of Electricity Market. Our subsidiaries in Cameroon are involved in the generation, transmission, distribution and sale of electricity through AES SONEL, Dibamba Power Development Company
(“DPDC”) and Kribi Power Development Company (“KPDC”). AES SONEL is an integrated utility which operates approximately 930 MW of generation capacity, two interconnected transmission networks and distributes electricity to
approximately 700,000 customers under a 20-year concession agreement that was signed in July of 2001. AES SONEL has the exclusive distribution rights to all medium voltage and low voltage customers, except for customers with an installed capacity of
more than 1 MW (“Major Customers”) who are free to negotiate bilateral agreements. Generation in Cameroon is open for competition and our subsidiary, DPDC, developed, built and is currently operating an 86 MW heavy fuel oil power plant
near Douala as an IPP which provides power to AES SONEL under a tolling agreement. In order to meet increasing demand for power, the government is developing the Lom Pangar Dam project on the Sanaga River which will increase the flows of the Sanaga
River and increase the generation capacity of the two major hydro power plants currently operated by AES SONEL. The Lom Pangar Dam will also generate 50 MW. Another AES subsidiary, KPDC, is developing a 216 MW gas-fired power plant in Kribi as
another IPP which will provide power to AES SONEL.

Under its Concession Agreement, AES SONEL operates the two interconnected
transmission networks in the country: the Southern Grid with a length of 1550 km and the Northern Grid with a length of 665 km. Major







Customers, distributors, or vendors can access the grid subject to paying a fee. Sales to low voltage and medium voltage customers are subject to tariff levels agreed to between AES SONEL and the
regulator based on the framework established in the AES SONEL Concession Agreement. Management of energy flows on the transmission network is currently undertaken by AES SONEL. Under the Concession requirements, AES SONEL will be required to create
a separate legal entity under which the transmission system will operate. Under the regulation in force, such entity is contemplated to be a 100% subsidiary of AES SONEL whose share capital will be opened up to other operators in the sector in
accordance with procedures to be approved by the regulator.

Principal Regulators. Cameroon’s electricity
regulatory agency, ARSEL, has functional and decision-making autonomy, and is run by a Board of Directors and a General Manager assisted by a Deputy General Manager. Its financing is provided by the state budget and fees collected from revenues
generated from activities carried out by operators of the sectors concerned. ARSEL’s decisions are highly influenced by the government via the Ministry of Power, the Prime Minister’s Office and the General Secretariat of the Presidency of
the Republic. The Ministry of Energy and Water is the Ministry mandated to issue specific regulations relating to the electricity sector and to issue the concessions, licenses and authorizations to be granted to the operators in the sector.

Principal Regulations. The principal legislative instrument governing the power sector is Law No. 98/022 of
December 24, 1998 which sets out a new institutional framework for the Power Sector and lays the foundations for competition in the power market in Cameroon. It is supplemented by the following instruments:



•Decree No. 2000/464/PM of June 30, 2000 governing the activities of the power sector;



•Decree No. 2001/021/PM of January 29, 2001 setting out the rates and methods of calculation, collection and distribution of the fees payable
by operators involved in the power sector;



•Ministerial Order No. 061/CAB/MINMEE of January 30, 2001 setting out the documents and fees required in applying for concessions, licenses,
authorizations and declarations for the generation, transmission, distribution, export and sale of power;



•Ministerial Order No. 000013/MINMEE of January 26, 2009 approving the regulation of the public distribution of electricity in Cameroon; and



•The Concession Agreements and license between the Republic of Cameroon and AES SONEL signed on July 18, 2001 and amended in 2006.

Material Regulatory Issues. Cameroon is currently preparing for presidential elections in 2011 and
local elections in 2012. Tariff adjustments expected for 2010 were challenged by the government, resulting in shortfalls of compensation due under the Concession Agreement to AES SONEL for 2010 and 2011. Following lengthy negotiations, a
compensation agreement was signed by both parties on November 24, 2010, which provides, among other things, for compensation to be paid to AES SONEL by the government of Cameroon for any revenue shortfall in 2010 and 2011 arising from the
difference between tariffs applied to end-users and tariffs due under the Concession Agreement. The estimated shortfall for 2010 was approximately $22 million, which has been paid in full. The normal tariff mechanisms to end-users are expected to be
restored in 2012.

Environmental Regulations. The environmental regulation is derived from Law No. 96/12 of
August 5, 1996 and various implementing decrees and ministerial orders. This regulation applies to all sectors but there are some specific requirements relating to the electricity sector. The main requirement of this regulation is the
obligation to conduct an environmental impact analysis for planned construction of new generation installations or new transmission lines or substations.

Potential or Proposed Regulations. In addition, there are plans to review the legal and regulatory framework of the power sector to consider the formation of new public entities. Presently, to make
up for the power shortage anticipated in 2012 (due to delays in commissioning the Kribi power plant developed by KPDC and the Lom







Pangar Dam developed by the government) and the additional demand generated by a number of infrastructural projects, the government is planning to construct thermal plants with an overall
capacity of 40 MW and a hydroelectric plant with a capacity of 200 MW. Additionally, there are other generation projects whose specifications have yet to be clearly determined. The regulatory framework relating to the development of this new
capacity and to the future contractual relationship between these new projects and AES SONEL is still unclear. However, the tariff compensation agreement referred to above provides that additional costs imposed on AES SONEL with regard to these
projects shall be fully passed through in tariffs charged to end-users.

Despite the provisions of the regulation described
above relating to the operation of the transmission network, the Minister of Energy has formally expressed his preference for a different solution that would take responsibilities for transmission activity and management of the transmission grid
away from AES SONEL and assign them to a new public entity to be created and majority-owned by the state. The impact on AES is not known at this time; however, it could be material to our results of operations.

Chile

Structure of Electricity Market. In Chile, except for the small isolated systems of Aysén and Punta Arenas, generation activities are principally in two electric systems: the Central
Interconnected Grid (“SIC”), which supplies approximately 92% of the country’s population; and the Northern Interconnected Grid (“SING”), where the principal users are mining and industrial companies. Power generation is
based primarily on long-term contracts between generation companies and customers specifying the volume, price and conditions for the sale of energy and capacity. The law recognizes two types of customers for generation companies: unregulated
customers and regulated customers. Unregulated customers are principally consumers whose connected capacity is higher than 2 MW and consumers whose connected capacity is between 500 kW and 2 MW who have selected the unregulated pricing mechanism for
a period of four years. These customers are not subject to price regulation and are able to freely negotiate prices and conditions for electricity supply with generation and distribution companies. Regulated customers are those whose connected
capacity is less than or equal to 500 kW and those with connected capacity between 500 kW and 2 MW who have selected, also for four years, the regulated pricing system.

Electricity generation in each of the SIC and the SING is coordinated by the respective independent Economic Load Dispatch Center (“CDEC”) in order to minimize operational costs and ensure the
highest economic efficiency of the system, while fulfilling all quality of service and reliability requirements established by current regulations. In order to satisfy demand at the lowest possible cost at all times, each CDEC orders the dispatch of
generation plants based strictly on variable generation costs, starting with the lowest variable cost, and does so independent of the contracts held by each generation company. Thus, while the generation companies are free to enter into supply
contracts with their customers and are obligated to comply with such contracts, the energy needed to satisfy demand is always produced by the CDEC members whose variable production costs are lower than the system’s marginal cost at the time of
dispatch. For this reason, in each hour a given generator is either a net supplier to the system or a net buyer. Net buyers pay net suppliers the system’s marginal cost. In addition, the Chilean market is designed to include payments for
capacity (or firm capacity), which are explicitly paid to generation companies for contributing to the system’s sufficiency. The cost of investment and operation of transmission systems is borne by generation companies and consumers (regulated
tolls) in proportion to their use.

Principal Regulators. The Chilean Ministry of Energy, created in 2010, grants
concessions for the provision of the public service of electric distribution and the National Commission for the Environment administers the system for evaluating the environmental impact of projects. Thermoelectric plants do not require electrical
concession agreements from the government in order to be built or operate. The new Ministry of Energy works with several agencies related to energy issues, such as the National Energy Commission (“NEC”), the Electricity and Fuel
Superintendent and the Chilean Nuclear Commission, among others, in order to provide a better coordination of energy affairs. The Ministry of Energy will also oversee a new Energy Efficiency agency. The







NEC establishes, regulates and coordinates energy policy. The Superintendent of Electricity and Fuels oversees compliance with service quality and safety regulations. The General Water Authority
issues the rights to use water for hydroelectric generation plants. The Chilean electric system includes a Panel of Experts—an independent technical agency whose purpose is to analyze and resolve in a timely fashion conflicts arising between
companies within the electric sector and among one or more of these companies and the energy regulators. In addition, the Ministry of Environment is responsible for the development and implementation of environmental regulations, protection of the
environment, environmental education and pollution control, among others.

Principal Regulations. The distinct
electricity sector activities are regulated by the General Electricity Services Law. Sector activities are also governed by the corresponding technical regulations and standards. The keystones of the electricity regulation are: (i) a regulated
compulsory marginal cost dispatch based on audited variable costs; (ii) a contract-based wholesale generation market; (iii) an open-access regime for transmission with benchmark regulation for existent transmission lines and open bids for
new lines; (iv) benchmark regulation for the distribution grid; and (v) electricity retailing by distribution companies in their exclusive concession areas.

In accordance with these laws, new contracts assigned by distribution companies for consumption from 2010 onward must be awarded to generation companies based on the lowest supply price offered in public
bid processes. These prices, called “long-term node prices,” include indexation formulas and are valid for the entire term of the contract, up to a maximum of fifteen years. More precisely, the long-term energy node price for a particular
contract is the lowest energy price offered by the generation companies participating in each respective bid process, while the long-term capacity node price is that set in the node price decree in effect at the time of the bid.

On February 17, 2011, President Sebastian Pinera’s administration enacted an energy decree that enables the government to take
preventive measures to reduce the risk of future energy shortages. Chile is experiencing a significant drought that has diminished the country’s reservoir levels and hydroelectric power capacity affecting the (SIC). The decree will be in forced
until August 2011 and focuses on three main actions: cutting available voltage by 10-12.5%; saving reservoir capacity up to 500 GWh; and offering incentives for consumers to save electricity. The decree is not expected to have a material impact on
AES Gener’s results in 2011

Environmental Regulations. Law 20,257 was enacted in April 2008 and promotes
non-conventional renewable energy sources, such as solar, wind, small hydroelectric and biomass energy. The Law requires that a percentage of the new power purchase contracts held by generation companies after August 31, 2007 be supplied from
renewable sources. The required energy percentage begins at 5% for 2010-2014, and gradually increases to a maximum of 10% in 2024. Generation companies are charged for each kWh not supplied in accordance with the Law. Our businesses in Chile have
developed a plan for complying with this law, which includes the sale of certain water rights, the purchasers of which have agreed to build a small hydroelectric plant and sell the energy to our businesses in Chile at a fixed price.

Potential or Proposed Regulations. In December 2009, the environmental agency published a draft of a potential
new ruling which will regulate the emissions from thermal power plants of NOX, SO2,
particulate matter (“PM”) and metals. The President of Chile approved the regulation on January 18, 2011 and the regulation will become effective upon approval of the General Comptroller of Chile. The regulation will require AES
Gener, our Chilean subsidiary, to install emissions reduction equipment at its existing thermal plants from late 2011 through 2015. The exact costs of compliance with such regulation have not yet been determined and the Company believes some of the
compliance costs are contractually passed through to counterparties. However, the compliance costs could be material.

A
proposed law which would give new incentives to Non-Conventional Renewable Energy (“NCRE”) such as solar, wind, small hydroelectric and biomass energy is under discussion in the Congress. The proposed law







increases the requirements of NCRE beginning 2015, such requirements reaching 20% as a percentage of the customer load in 2020. The current law imposes a requirement to reach 10% in 2024. The new
requirements would need to be fulfilled with NCRE coming from the same system (separates SIC and SING). The NCRE would need to be accredited by the NEC, which may impose fines for non-compliance. The impact to AES Gener is under analysis; however,
it will depend on the new size limit of small run of river units and if the new requirement affects the current supply contracts, which only include the 10% required by the current law. The proposed law, if passed, could result in increased costs or
otherwise have a material impact on our results of operations.

In September 2010, the NEC proposed a new normative in
Ancillary Services (“AASS”) based on a cost-efficient regulation informed by generators and customers. The normative regulates the AASS transactions among generators in: regulation, spinning reserve, non-operating reserve and the Automatic
Load Shedding Scheme (“ALSS”). AES Gener has presented observations principally against compulsory investments requested by the CDEC; AASS costs allocated incorrectly among generators according to their power generation (it believes it
should be according to their electricity withdrawals) and the ALSS’s are a demand-side obligation and adjustment mechanisms are only considered for imbalances in contributions between consumers. AES Gener is assessing the potential impact of
this regulation, and an estimate of the impact can only be established when the final regulation is issued. However, if passed, the regulations could result in required investments or other increased costs which could have a material and adverse
impact on our results of operations.

Colombia

Structure of Electricity Market. Colombia has one main national interconnected system (the “SIN”). The wholesale market
is organized around both bilateral contracts and a mandatory pool and spot market for all generation units larger than 20 MW.

In the spot market, each unit bids its availability and a set price for a 24-hour period. The dispatch is arranged from lowest to highest
bid price and the spot price is set by the marginal price. There are two types of customers: unregulated customers and regulated customers. Unregulated customers are consumers whose maximum capacity consumption is higher than 0.1 MW, or whose energy
demand is greater than 55 MWh/month. These customers are not subject to price regulation; therefore, generators or trader companies are able to freely negotiate prices and conditions for electricity supply with them. Regulated customers have their
prices determined by means of public tenders.

Electricity generation in the Colombian system is coordinated by the market
administrator whose goal is to minimize operational costs while fulfilling all quality-of-service and reliability requirements established by current regulations. In order to satisfy demand at the lowest possible cost at all times, market
administrator orders the dispatch of generation plants based on offer price (variable cost plus reliability charge) by merit, starting with the lowest offer price, and does so independent of the contracts held by each generation company. For this
reason, in each hour a given generator is either a net supplier to the system or a net buyer. Net buyers pay net suppliers the system’s spot price. In addition, the Colombian market is designed to include reliability payments, which are paid to
generation companies for contributing to the system’s sufficiency. The cost of investment and operation of transmission systems are borne by the consumers in proportion to their use.

Principal Regulators. The Ministry of Mines and Energy (“MME”) establishes the energy policies and the Regulatory
Commission of Electricity and Gas (“CREG”) was created to foster the efficient supply of energy through regulation of the wholesale market, the natural monopolies of transmission, and distribution, and by setting limits for horizontal and
vertical integration. The Ministry of the Environment (“MMA”) establishes the environmental policies.

The Public
Services Superintendence supervises the correct provision of utilities and the Industry and Commerce Superintendence is in charge of sanctioning any anticompetitive practice. Other entities that have an







impact on the electric system include the Energy Planning Unit (“UPME”), in charge of planning the electricity and gas system, and the National Development Planning Office
(“DNP”), whose main role is to develop a general development plan for the government.

Principal Regulations.
The laws of Domiciliary Public Services and the Electricity Law set the institutional arrangement and the general regulatory framework for the electricity sector. The keystones of the electricity regulation are: (i) the dispatch is based on an
offer price that represents the variable cost of the plants; (ii) a contract-based wholesale generation market; (iii) an open access regime for transmission with revenue regulated for existent transmission lines and open bids for new
lines; (iv) revenue regulated for the distribution grid; and (v) electricity retail can be performed by distribution and/or traders.

The spot market started in July 1995, and in 1996 a capacity payment was introduced for a term of ten years. In December 2006, a regulation was enacted that replaced the capacity charge with the
reliability charge and established two implementation periods. The first period consists of a transition period from December 2006 to November 2012 during which the price is equal to $13.045 per MWh and volume is determined based on each
plant’s firm energy which is prorated so that the total firm energy level does not exceed system demand. During the second period, which begins on December 2012, the reliability charge will be determined based on the energy price and the volume
of offers submitted by market participants bidding for new capacity for the system. The first reliability charge auction was held in May 2008 with the following results: (i) the reliability charge for existing plants for the period between
December 2012 and November 2013 will be $13.998 per MWh; (ii) for new plants that won the auction, the charge will be paid for twenty years starting December 2012; and (iii) three new projects won the auction for a total capacity of 430 MW
starting in 2012. The new methodology established in 2006 recognized the reliability provide by Chivor’s system and favored the company by increasing the reliability charge by approximately 120%, moving from $18 million in 2006 to almost $40
million in 2007 and is expected to have a similar amount per year until 2015.

Environmental Regulations. In Colombia,
Law 99 created the MMA in 1993. This law requires that projects that affect the land or impact the environment must obtain a license from the MMA. While regional environmental authorities can issue licenses for generation projects with capacity of
less than 100 MW, only the MMA has the authority to issue licenses for the construction of large-scale generation or transmission projects. Chivor initiated operations in 1977 through a water concession, the only environmental requirement at that
time. Furthermore, in August 1995 the MMA requested hydroelectrical plants, including Chivor to fulfill the requirements of an “Environmental Management Plan,” which serves as an environmental permit to operate. Each year, Chivor has to
demonstrate to the environmental authorities that the obligations included in such plan are accordingly fulfilled. Additionally, hydro plants must contribute 6% of their gross generation and thermal plants 4% of their gross generation to the area of
influence valued at a special tariff defined by CREG. In 2008, MMA issued Resolution 909 that regulates the emission of thermal power plants. This Resolution is not expected to affect Chivor because it is a hydro but could affect AES if we decide to
acquire or build a thermal plant in Colombia.

Potential or Proposed Regulations. CREG issued a proposal to create the
Organized Regulated Market (“MOR”). The MOR will replace the current bilateral contracts markets (between traders/utilities and generators) by putting in place a centralized auction in which the Market Administrator buys energy for all
regulated customers served by the traders/utilities. The main provisions contained in the proposal are: (i) it is mandatory for all traders/utilities to buy energy at the auction price and it is voluntary for sellers (generators and trade
companies) to offer energy in each auction; (ii) one single price for the energy sales in the auction; (iii) the auctions are held one year before the actual dispatch and the commitment period of the auction is one year; and (iv) to
establish four auctions per year. Bilateral contracts executed before the beginning of the MOR’s operation will not suffer any change and will remain valid. In general, we consider that if MOR is correctly designed, it should benefit our
businesses in Colombia. We expect that a definitive resolution will be issued in the first half of 2011.







As a part of CREG
regulatory agenda for 2011, the regulator is planning to review the lessons learned from the dry conditions brought by the 2009-10 “El Niño” phenomenon and issue regulations for these extreme events, permitting players to know in
advance the additional reliability measures that the regulator may take under those circumstances. Also, CREG is planning to issue regulations that will strengthen the energy market by improving the spot market guarantees scheme, and establish
measures to control market power from pivotal agents (agents needed at any cost to fulfill the demand requirements). This last initiative may affect spot prices but should not materially impact AES as Chivor has a high level of coverage through
bilateral contracts.

Dominican Republic

Structure of Electricity Market. The Dominican Republic has one main interconnected system composed primarily of thermal generation
and supplemented by hydroelectric power plants that harness power from available rivers. The regulatory framework in the Dominican Republic consists of: decentralized industry; unbundled generation, transmission and distribution; regulated prices in
monopolistic segments (transmission and distribution); and a competitive wholesale generation market. In accordance with this regulatory structure, all agents and electric generation, transmission and distribution companies must conduct their
operations to provide the best service at minimum cost; and comply with standards of quality, safety, continuity of services and conservation of the environment.

The spot or wholesale market is based on a centralized economic dispatch. The Organismo Coordinador (“OC”) is in charge of planning and supervision of operations through the “Centro del
Control del SENI,” which is in charge of real-time dispatch. The dispatch of the thermal units is based on auditable declared variable costs and, for the hydro units, the variable cost is equal to zero, meaning that these units are the first
for dispatch and reflect optimal system costs. The spot market relies on competitive bidding based on each generator’s variable costs as a means of providing a merit order for dispatch. Variable cost information is submitted weekly by the
generators to the OC, which then determines the merit order for dispatch based on this information.

For the sale of
electricity under long-term contracts, the regulatory framework establishes that the sale of electricity of a generating company to a distribution company will be done at prices resulting from the competitive procedures of public bidding. These bids
are governed by the conditions established by the Superintendency of Electricity (“SIE”) which supervises the bidding and awarding process. With the objective of ensuring that generation prices represent reasonable values in the market,
the SIE ensures that the sale of electricity through contracts is not greater than 80% of interconnected electric energy demand, and that the spot market represents a minimum of 20% of the total national consumption of the interconnected system
annually.







The electricity tariff applicable to regulated customers is subject to regulation within the
concessions of the distribution companies. Electricity end-users are considered customers of public services according to regulations; hence the tariff is set by resolution of the SIE. For clients with demand above 1.2 MW who are classified as
unregulated customers, tariffs are unregulated.

Principal Regulators. In order to regulate the electric sector and
implement the provisions contained in the General Electricity Law No. 125 and its By-Law, two regulators are responsible for monitoring and ensuring compliance with the law: the National Energy Commission (“CNE”) and the SIE. All
electric companies (generators, transmission and distributors), are subject to and regulated by the General Electricity Law, whether they are of national and/or foreign capital, private and/or public.

In general, CNE’s main responsibilities are to draft and coordinate the legal framework and regulatory legislation; propose and
adopt policies and procedures to assure best practices; draft plans to ensure the proper functioning and development of the energy sector and propose them to the executive branch; ensure compliance with the law; promote investment decisions in
accordance with these plans; and advise the executive branch on all matters related to the energy sector. The SIE’s main responsibilities are to develop, ensure compliance with and analyze the structure and level of prices of electricity and to
set the rates and tolls subject to regulation. SIE also reviews electricity rate levels requested by companies, monitors and supervises compliance with legal provisions and rules and monitors compliance with the technical procedures governing
generation, transmission, distribution and commercialization of electricity. In addition, SIE supervises electric market behavior in order to avoid monopolistic practices and applies penalties and fines in the cases of non-compliance with the laws
and regulations.

Principal Regulations. The energy sector regulatory framework in the Dominican Republic is governed
primarily by:



•General Electricity Law 125-01, its by-law and its amendment by Law 186-07, constitute the legal framework which regulates all phases related to the
production, transmission, distribution and commercialization of electricity, as well as the functions of State agencies created by this Law and related to these matters. The regulatory framework in the Dominican electricity market establishes a
methodology for calculating the firm capacity for each power generation unit.



•Renewable Energy Incentives Law 57-07 establishes incentives for renewable energy, mainly income tax exemption, import taxes reduction, as well as
special operational, technical and commercial treatment. The law applies to hydro generation with a capacity equal to or below 5 MW, wind generation with a capacity less than 50 MW, biomass generation with a capacity less than 80 MW, photovoltaic
generation, and thermo-solar generation with a capacity less than 120 MW.



•Hydrocarbons Law 112-00 is a regime that established a tax on consumption of fossil fuels and oil. All fossil fuels used to produce electricity has a
tax exemption under the law, as well as natural gas, and any change in this regulation does not affect AES Dominicana as a natural gas provider. All agents that use any fossil fuel to produce electricity need a resolution from CNE and the Industry
and Commerce Ministry to apply for this exemption.



•Industry and Commerce Ministry periodic resolutions for technical and price regulations for vehicular natural gas use (transportation).

In addition, the Dominican government has directly exercised varying degrees of regulation over the
electricity market and AES Dominicana’s businesses in the past, such as involvement in the re-negotiation of the existing PPAs, oversight responsibilities of the SENI and environmental controls. No assurance can be given that the Dominican
government will not alter regulations in the future in a way that will negatively affect AES Dominicana’s businesses, financial conditions or results of operations.

Environmental Regulations. The main environmental regulations are the General Law on Environment and Natural Resources 64-00 and the Regulation and Licensing Systems Environmental Permits by-law.
These







regulations provide for centralized environmental planning by the state through the integration of environmental protection and economic development plans in a common approach and policy
throughout the sector. Environmental management is achieved through permits or environmental licenses, environmental quality standards and environmental reporting. The main regulatory institutions are:



•The Ministry for the Environment and Natural Resources, which is responsible for implementing and designing the policy for the conservation and
protection of the environment and natural resources in the Dominican Republic;



•National Council of Environment and Natural Resources which is the link between the various Ministries of State in charge of evaluating the impact of
environmental policies; and



•Procurator for the Defense of the Environment and Natural Resources, which is responsible for performing the actions by the State Environmental
conflicts environment.

Despite extensive compliance plans in place by each of the entities, it is possible
AES Dominicana generating units could fall out of compliance with such environmental standards. Such non-compliance, and resulting penalties or bad publicity might negatively affect the financial results of AES Dominicana. One such penalty could be
a requirement that AES Dominicana operates its offending unit below its rated capacity, and such unavailability might affect compliance with obligations under its PPAs. In such a scenario AES Dominicana might need to make significant investments in
environmental-related infrastructure. In addition, the environmental laws and regulations may become more stringent and AES Dominicana might be forced to make certain investments to be compliant with the new standards.

Potential or Proposed Regulations. Last year, the CNE proposed a Natural Gas Act, which seeks to establish new regulations for the
services and the commercialization of natural gas, which may result in access barriers to develop the natural gas market. The proposed law does not establish a mechanism for promoting investments in the construction of new gas pipelines or kits for
fuel conversion for the automotive sector in accordance with modern regulation in this market. However, AES does not currently expect any material impact to AES Dominicana with the promulgation of such law, mainly because AES Dominicana’s role
is as a supplier of natural gas to the Dominican Republic, which is not regulated under the Natural Gas Act.

El
Salvador

Structure of Electricity Market. The Salvadorean electricity market is composed of a single
interconnected system. Under the General Electriticity Law (“GEL”), competition was introduced in generation and trading and additional regulations were implemented related to price and quality of service in non-competitive segments such
as distribution, transmission, system operation and administration.

The wholesale electricity market is based on a contract
market and a spot market. The contract market is further classified into bilateral contracts, which are freely negotiated by electricity generators, distributors, and trading companies; and regulated contracts, which are the product of regulated
public bids carried out by the distribution companies under the supervision of the Regulator, Superintendencia General de Electricidad y Telecomunicaciones (“SIGET”). Starting in June 2011, the distribution companies are required to
acquire 70% of their forecasted demand through regulated bids. The spot market is structured as a day-ahead market, and transactions are settled on a monthly basis. Currently, the price-setting mechanism for the spot market is based on a bidding
system. Regulations are in place to implement a cost-based system to replace the current bidding system.

Distribution
companies are regulated under an incentive system, specifically a Revenue Cap system, whereby the maximum tariff to be charged to the end-users is subject to the approval of SIGET. The components of the electricity tariff are (i) charges for
the use of the distribution network (the “Distribution Charge”), (ii) customer service costs (the “Service Charge”) and (iii) average energy price (the “Energy Charge”). Both the







Distribution Charge and Service Charge are based on average capital costs as well as operation and maintenance costs of an efficient distribution company. The Distribution Charge and Service
Charge are approved by SIGET every five years and have two adjustments: (i) an annual adjustment considering the inflation variation and (ii) an automatic adjustment in April, July and October, provided that the change in inflation is
greater than 10%.

Competition is encouraged by the GEL and it provides the end user with the option to acquire its
electricity from a Distribution Company or an electricity trader. The Distribution and Transmission Companies are mandated by the GEL to allow the use of the distribution grid to traders in order to deliver electricity to their customers. The grid
access terms, including tariffs, are detailed in a “distribution contract” registered and regulated by SIGET.

Principal Regulators. SIGET is the Independent Regulatory Authority established through the GEL. SIGET’s principal
responsibilities and attributions are approval of Distribution Charges, enforcement of sector regulation, dispute resolution among market participants, granting concessions for hydroelectric and geothermal projects, among others.

In addition, the National Energy Council, formed in 2007, is the policy-making entity, whose board of directors is composed by the
Secretaries of the Treasury, the Economy, Public Works, Environmental and Natural Resources and the Consumer Protection Agency.

Principal Regulations. The electricity sector is governed by the General Electricity Act, the General Electricity Act Regulations,
the Transmission System and Wholesale Market Operating Regulations and the general and specific orders issued by SIGET, under its statutory attributions.

Environmental Regulations. The environment is protected through the Environment and Natural Resources Act (“ENRA”), enacted in 1998, and it’s Regulation, enacted in 2000. These
statutes empower the Environment and Natural Resources Secretary as the policy-making entity and ENRA establishes a duty of care to the environment and orders the sustainable use of natural resources. Additionally, ENRA introduces the concept of the
Environmental Permit for the handling of certain potentially hazardous or risky materials or performing certain activities in the environment, such as the construction and operation of power plants (except fuel oil) and transmission lines.

Material Regulatory Actions. The Energy Charge has been, under current methodology, adjusted every six months to
reflect the spot market price for electricity during the previous six months. However, starting on January 12, 2011, the energy charge will be adjusted quarterly. Presidential decree 160 was published on December 23, 2010 and went into
effect on January 1, 2011. This decree shortens the Energy Charge reset period from six months to three months; the new Energy Charge reset dates will be January 12th, April 12th, July 12th and October 12th instead
of April 12th and Oct 12th each year. The reduction of the “energy charge” reset period reduces the distribution companies’ cash flow exposure before any significant spike in energy prices since the lag between energy revenues
and costs has been reduced by half.

Potential or Proposed Regulations. The Transmission System and Wholesale Market
Operating Rules have been amended to convert the wholesale market price-setting mechanism to be based on audited variable production costs instead of a competitive bidding process and will become effective in June 2011. However, this effective date
may be delayed due to technical delays necessary for implementation. Again, since electricity costs are a pass-through for distribution companies, such new regulation will have an indirect benefit to the companies by providing a stable, marginal
cost of electricity.

Nigeria

Structure of Electricity Market. In Nigeria, the state-owned entity, Power Holding Company of Nigeria (“PHCN”), holds approximately 80% of the electricity market share and private power
generating companies account for the remaining 20%. The power generating companies, of which AES Nigeria Barge Ltd. (“AESNB”) is one, maintain long-term contracts with PHCN as the sole offtaker.







All power transmission operations are currently carried out by PHCN. Under new political
initiatives and reforms, as provided under the Roadmap for Power Sector Reforms (“the Power Roadmap”), there are indications that 11 distribution companies and six generation companies would be fully privatized while the ownership of the
Transmission Company of Nigeria (“TCN”) would be retained by the government, but with private sector management. Current electricity generation is from either gas-fired or hydro power plants. Most assets are owned by state-owned companies,
though some private investors have been able to establish IPPs following recent reforms. In addition, the government is developing approximately 4,800 MW of installed capacity intended to be completed by 2013, known as the National Integrated Power
Plants (“NIPPs”). The Presidential Task Force on Power has announced its intention to privatize the NIPPs in future rounds of privatization, following completion of construction.

Principal Regulators. The Nigerian Electricity Regulatory Commission (“Nigerian ERC”) is an independent regulatory
agency, that was established under the 2005 Reform Act to undertake both the technical and economic regulation of the Nigerian electricity sector. It is responsible for general oversight functions, including the licensing of operators, setting of
tariffs and industry standards for future electricity sector development.

Two of the Nigerian ERC’s key regulatory
functions are licensing and tariff regulation. Since AESNB operates under a long-term bilateral agreement with PHCN, it is not subject to the tariff setting process. On the basis of the current reforms embodied in the Power Roadmap, a number of new
regulatory and/or other governing bodies will be established to regulate the industry.

Principal Regulations. In March
2005, the Nigerian President signed the Electric Power Sector Reform Bill into law, enabling private companies to participate in transmission and distribution in addition to electricity generation that had previously been legalized. The government
has separated PHCN into eleven distribution firms, six generating companies, and a transmission company, in preparation for privatization.

Several problems, including union opposition, have delayed the privatization indefinitely, however, in recent months the current Government has put significant emphasis on completing the privatization of
the eighteen successor companies of the PHCN in 2011. There are clauses in the AESNB PPA that, upon the effective date of a privatization, require the business to use all reasonable endeavors to obtain and require all fuel necessary for the
operation of the plant. Additionally, the off-taker is envisaged to be transferred from PHCN to Lagos State. However, no material impact to our operations is expected at this time.

Potential or Proposed Regulations.The Nigerian Government is currently preparing for an election in 2011 and privatization
of the electricity sector has been a principal issue emphasized by political parties. The 2005 Reform Act and NERC regulations provide for a generation license to have a duration of 10 years, renewable for a further five years. This is in line with
a current proposal for a uniform tariff for the power sector, MYTO, which is derived from a building blocks approach that intends a cost-reflective outcome, including a capacity and an energy component; financing costs and other key costs (operating
costs, depreciation) are intended to be accommodated; and key fluctuating costs (fuel costs, foreign exchange, inflation) are also intended to be reflected. A total license and uniform tariff duration of 15 years may present challenges to potential
investors given that 15 years may be shorter than the useful life of assets and shorter than the tenor of potential long-term debt financing. These regulations, if adopted, could make it difficult to acquire or develop new facilities.

Panama

Structure of Electricity Market. In Panama, distribution companies are required to contract 100% of their annual power requirements (although they can self-generate up to 15% of their demand).
Generators can enter into long-term PPAs with distributors or unregulated consumers. In addition, generators can enter into alternative supply contracts with each other. The terms and contents of PPAs are determined through a competitive bidding
process and are governed by the Commercial Rules. Besides the PPA market, generators may buy and sell energy in the spot market. Energy sold in the spot market corresponds to the hourly differences between the actual dispatch of energy by each
generator and its contractual commitments to supply energy. The energy spot price is







set by the order in which generators are dispatched. The National Dispatch Center (“CND”) ranks generators according to their variable cost (thermal) and water value (hydroelectric),
starting with the lowest value, thereby establishing on an hourly basis the merit order in which generators will be dispatched the following day in order to meet expected demand.

Principal Regulators. The National Secretary of Energy (“SNE”) was created by Law 52 on July 30, 2008; and has the
responsibilities of planning, investigating, directing, supervising and controlling policies of the energy sector within Panama. With these responsibilities, the Secretariat has defined strategies and policies for the Republic of Panama, which
include promoting energy security for the benefit of the population and the country’s development, and proposing laws and regulations to the executive agency that promote the procurement of electrical energy, hydrocarbons and alternative
energies in the best conditions for the country. The regulator of public services, known as the National Authority of Public Services (“ASEP”), was created by Law 26 on January 29, 1996. ASEP is an autonomous agency of the state, with
legal responsibility and self-patrimony. ASEP is responsible for the control and oversight of public services, such as potable water, sewerage, electricity, telecommunications and radio and television systems, as well as the transmission and
distribution of natural gas utilities and the companies that provide such services. ASEP’s mission is to ensure the efficient provision of the public services, as well as national technical, commercial, and environmental quality standards.

Principal Regulations. In the Republic of Panama, the electricity sector is regulated by Law No. 6 issued on
February 1997 which was amended by Law Decree 10 on February 26, 1998, and more recently by Law 57 on October 2009. The most notable amendments by Law 57 were: (i) generators are now obligated to participate in public bids for PPAs, to the
extent they have available firm capacity and energy, and failure to do so precludes them from participating in the spot market; (ii) ETESA, as opposed to the distribution companies, will now be the purchaser in charge of adjudicating PPA bids
to the winning generators, subsequently assigning such PPAs to the corresponding distribution companies; and (iii) the maximum fines which ASEP may impose for violations to the provisions of the Electricity Law increased from $1 million to $20
million. Resolution AN No. 3885-Elec, which was approved on October 8, 2010, sets forth the methodology for calculating the capacity and/or energy that generators must make available for short term bids and long term contracting.

These amendments state that ETESA has to prepare the list of charges, make the call for bids and evaluate and award contracts
for supply in accordance with the parameters, criteria and procedures established by ASEP. Consequently, ASEP must approve the list of charges produced by ETESA in addition to overseeing the process to confirm it complies with legal requirements and
current regulations.

Environmental Regulations. ASEP issued Resolution AN No. 3932-Elec on October 22, 2010
related to the Security of Dams in the Electricity Sector. This legislation has sensitive and important Security and Environmental elements related to: reports, controls by ASEP, protocols for modifications to the structure of the dams and the
operation of dams and reservoirs during floods. This regulation will be effective on November 9, 2011, but it will require a thorough process to review our current action plans during emergencies and protocols against the requirements of the
new law to properly determine the impact to AES Panama. However, the new requirements may require AES Panama to expend additional amounts which could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations.

Material Regulatory Actions. By virtue of Resolutions AN No. 34-01-Elec on April 1, 2010 and Resolution AN
No. 3852-Elec on September 21, 2010, ASEP declared the Changuinola I project to be of public interest and urgent necessity (granting AES access to private properties near the project). The owner of one of the Fincas (land) filed a
constitutional action alleging violations of due process and private property rights. The impact to the business is that if the Supreme Court admits the request, this will automatically suspend the effects of the ASEP resolution and the project will
no longer be of public interest. This could impact AES Panama’s authorization with regard to the premises and impede progress on the project. AES Panama has requested that the Supreme Court reject the action filed. For further discussion see
Item 3.—Legal Proceedings in this Form 10-K.







Potential or Proposed Regulations. In July 2010, ASEP hired Consorcio
Fundación Bariloche-PSI Consultores to evaluate alternative allocation of the Charge per Usage of the Principal Transmission System in order to encourage the development of alternative sources of generation, especially hydropower. The
consultants expect to deliver their final report by mid-January 2011 to ASEP but as of mid-February 2011 the consultants have not delivered the report. Once ASEP receives the report it is expected to present the amendments to the current
transmission rates for public comment and the amendments are expected to take effect on July 1, 2011. This could result in a possible reduction of the amounts currently being paid by AES Panama in transmission rates.

On October 13, 2010, ASEP requested the CND to make an amendment to the weekly programming methodology so that the hydroelectric
dams with a reservoir regulation equal to or less than ninety (90) days should be modeled as run-of-the-river units with zero variable cost. Under the current regulations, the Changuinola I Plant is defined as a hydro plant with a reservoir
regulation of 7.26 days. The proposed modification will cause the Changuinola I Plant to be considered as a run-of-the-river plant. It is estimated that this change could result in a reduction in energy generated by approximately 18 GWh/year for AES
Panama, which is a substantial impact on AES Panama and could have an adverse impact on our businesses and results of operations. Furthermore, this proposal could change the firm capacity of Changuinola II. Currently, the proposal is under analysis
by ASEP.

North America

Mexico

Structure of Electricity Market. Mexico has a single
national electricity grid (referred to as the “National Interconnected System”), covering nearly all of Mexico’s territory. The only exception is the Baja California peninsula which has its own separate electricity system.
Article 27 of the Mexican Constitution reserves the generation, transmission, transformation, distribution and supply of electric power exclusively to the Mexican State for the purpose of providing a “public service.”

In Mexico, since 1995 the power sector legal framework partially opened to private entities under the following schemes: cogeneration;
self supply; IPP exports; and imports for self consumption. Private investments are allowed today in this sector in the following areas: transport, storage, and distribution. The Energy Regulatory Commission (“CRE”) is in charge of issuing
the permits related to the activities from the power and natural gas sectors that were open to private investment since 1995.

Principal Regulators. The Federal Electricity Commission (“CFE”), by virtue of Article 1 of the Energy Law, is
granted sole and exclusive responsibility for providing this public service as it relates to the supply, transmission and distribution of electric power.

Principal Regulations. In 1992, the Energy Law was amended to allow private parties to invest in certain activities in the Mexico electrical power market, under the assumption that
“self-supply” generation of electric power is not considered a public service. These reforms allowed private parties to obtain permits from the Ministry of Energy for (i) generating power for self-supply; (ii) generating power
through co-generation processes; (iii) generating power through independent production; (iv) small-scale production; and (v) importing and exporting electrical power. Beneficiaries holding any of the permits contemplated under the
Energy Law are required to enter into PPAs with the CFE with regard to all surplus power produced. It is under this basis that AES’ Mérida and TEG/TEP facilities operate. Mérida provides power exclusively to CFE under a long-term
contract. TEG/TEP provides the majority of its output to two offtakers under long-term contracts, and can sell any excess or surplus energy produced to CFE at a predetermined day-ahead price.

Environmental Impact. When works or activities that may disrupt the ecological balance or exceed the limits and conditions
established in the applicable laws or the regulations are proposed, these activities shall be subject







to the conditions established by regulatory authorities, for the purposes of reducing to a minimum the negative effects on the environment. In these cases, it is necessary to first obtain the
authorization on environmental impact matters from the regulatory authorities.

In addition, high risk activities are also
regulated even though they do not define specifically what is meant by “high risk.” The Mexican Department of the Interior issued two lists defining high risk substances. The criteria used to determine whether an activity is of high risk,
is based in the characteristics or volume of the substance used, where relevant. If in the event of being spilt or released it is liable to cause an explosion or significantly affect the environment, people or property, it will be considered as of
‘high risk’. Further, if a project contemplates the use of a compound included in the lists issued by the regulator, in the necessary volumes, the interested Party must present a Risk Evaluation before the regulator.

Environmental Sanctions. The Attorney General’s Office for the Protection of the Environment is in charge of enforcing
environmental legal provisions in Mexico. The sanctions that may be imposed depend on the environmental obligations that are not observed by individuals or corporations, and vary from fines ranging from the equivalent of 50 and up to 50,000 days of
minimum wage. Additional sanctions may also be imposed, including the annulment of environmental permits and authorizations, partial or total closures of a facility, and administrative arrest.

Mexican Legislation provides that the energy sector is integrated by the Electrical and Petroleum sectors. Federation is the only one
entitled to extract and process fossil fuels, as well as to generate electricity; however, certain exceptions apply.

Renewable Energy. On October 23, 2008, a proposal for the approval of the Renewable Energies and Financing of the Energy
Transition Law was sent for the approval of the Mexican House of Representatives, and on October 25, 2008, this same proposal was approved by the Energy Committee of the same House. The law encourages generation and transportation of energy
generated by renewable sources, giving certainty and lower costs to provide incentives to participate in the private sector of this field.

In addition, the Federal government’s all-encompassing Special Program on Climate Change (“SPECC”) was formally approved. The SPECC provides a program to reduce the alleged effects of
climate change. The principal actions proposed to achieve competitive levels, include the gradual substitution of oil for natural gas in the national energy mix, stimulating the implementation of cogeneration and other efficiency saving technologies
and strongly stimulating the development of renewable energies.

Priority will be given to electricity generation from wind
(up to 507 MW installed by 2012), geothermal energy (153 MW installed by 2012), hydroelectric and solar power. The SPECC proposes a joint program between public bodies and private investors in order to increase the amount of electricity generation
capacity from renewable sources up to 1,957 MW by 2012.

The SPECC makes it clear that many of its objectives will be achieved
through the following normative, economic and market instruments: accessible financing mechanisms; simplification procedures for permitting; facilitation of electrical grid interconnection and transmission contracts; and stimulus for private
investment in energy infrastructure. Our businesses in Mexico are still reviewing the impact of these developments on their operations; however, they could be material to the business and results of operations.

United States

Structure of Electricity Market. The United States wholesale electricity market consists of multiple distinct regional markets that are subject to both federal regulation, as implemented by the
FERC, and regional regulation as defined by rules designed and implemented by the Independent System Operators (“ISO”). These rules for the most part govern such items as the determination of the market mechanism for setting the system
marginal price







for energy and the establishment of guidelines and incentives for the addition of new capacity. The current regulatory framework in the United States is the result of a series of regulatory
actions that have taken place over the past two decades, as well as numerous policies adopted by both the federal government and the individual states that encourage competition in wholesale and retail electricity markets.

Principal Regulators. The federal government, through regulations promulgated by FERC, has primary jurisdiction over wholesale
electricity markets and transmission services. While there have been numerous federal statutes enacted during the past 32 years, including the Public Utility Regulatory Policy Act of 1978 (“PURPA”), the Energy Policy Act of 1992
(“EPAct 1992”) and the Energy Policy Act of 2005 (“EPAct 2005”), there are two fundamental regulatory initiatives implemented by FERC during that time frame that directly impact our United States businesses:



•FERC approval of market-based rate authority beginning in 1986 for many providers of wholesale generation; and



•FERC issuance of Order #888 in 1996 mandating the functional separation of generation and transmission operations and requiring utilities to provide
open access to their transmission systems.

FERC has civil penalty authority over violations of any
provision of Part II of the Federal Power Act (“FPA”) which concerns wholesale generation or transmission, as well as any rule or order issued thereunder. FERC is authorized to assess a maximum civil penalty of $1 million per violation for
each day that the violation continues. The FPA also provides for the assessment of criminal fines and imprisonment for violations under Part II of the FPA. This penalty authority was enhanced in EPAct 2005. With this expanded enforcement authority,
violations of the FPA and FERC’s regulations could potentially have more serious consequences than in the past.

Pursuant
to EPAct 2005, the North America Reliability Corporation (“NERC”) has been certified by FERC as the Electric Reliability Organization (“ERO”) to develop mandatory and enforceable electric system reliability standards applicable
throughout the United States to improve the overall reliability of the electric grid. These standards are subject to FERC review and approval. Once approved, the reliability standards may be enforced by FERC independently, or, alternatively, by the
ERO and regional reliability organizations with responsibility for auditing, investigating and otherwise ensuring compliance with reliability standards, subject to FERC oversight. Monetary penalties of up to $1 million per day per violation may be
assessed for violations of the reliability standards.

Principal Regulations for Generation Businesses. Several of our
generation businesses in the United States currently operate as Qualifying Facilities (“QFs”) as defined under PURPA. These businesses entered into long-term contracts with electric utilities that had a mandatory obligation at that time,
as specified under PURPA, to purchase power from QFs at the utility’s avoided cost (i.e., the likely costs for both energy and capital investment that would have been incurred by the purchasing utility if that utility had to provide its own
generating capacity or purchase it from another source). EPAct 2005 later amended PURPA to provide for the elimination of the mandatory purchase obligation in certain markets, but did so only on a prospective basis. Cogeneration facilities and small
power production facilities that meet certain criteria can be QFs. To be a QF, a cogeneration facility must produce electricity and useful thermal energy for an industrial or commercial process or heating or cooling applications in certain
proportions to the facility’s total energy output, and must meet certain efficiency standards. To be a QF, a small power production facility must generally use a renewable resource as its energy input and meet certain size criteria.

Our non-QF generation businesses in the United States currently operate as Exempt Wholesale Generators (“EWGs”) as defined
under EPAct 1992. These businesses were historically exempt from the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935 and are also exempt from the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 2005 (“PUHCA 2005”), and, subject to FERC approval, have the
right as public utilities under the FPA to sell power at market-based rates, either directly to the wholesale market or to a third-party offtaker such as a power marketer or utility/industrial customer. Under the FPA and FERC’s regulations,
approval from FERC to sell







wholesale power at market-based rates is generally dependent upon a showing to FERC that the seller lacks market power in generation and transmission, that the seller and its affiliates cannot
erect other barriers to market entry and there is no opportunity for abusive transactions involving regulated affiliates of the seller. To prevent market manipulation, FERC requires sellers with market-based rate authority to file certain reports,
including a triennial updated market power analysis for markets in which they control certain threshold amounts of generation.

Principal Regulations for Traditional Utility Business. In addition to our generation businesses, we also own IPL, a vertically
integrated utility located in Indiana. A description of the regulatory environment under which IPL operates is provided below:

IPL. As a regulated electric utility, IPL is subject to regulation by the FERC and the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission
(“IURC”). As indicated below, the financial performance of IPL is directly impacted by the outcome of various regulatory proceedings before the IURC and FERC.

IPL is subject to regulation by the IURC with respect to the following: its services and facilities; the valuation of property; the construction, purchase or lease of electric generating facilities; the
classification of accounts; rates of depreciation; retail rates and charges; the issuance of securities (other than evidences of indebtedness payable less than twelve months after the date of issue); the acquisition and sale of some public utility
properties or securities; and certain other matters.

IPL’s tariff rates for electric service to retail customers (basic
rates and charges) are set and approved by the IURC after public hearings (“general rate cases”). General rate cases, which have occurred at irregular intervals, include the participation of consumer advocacy groups and certain customers.
The last general rate case for IPL was completed in 1995. In addition, pursuant to statute, the IURC is to conduct a periodic review of the basic rates and charges of all Indiana utilities at least once every four years, but the IURC has the
authority to review the rates of any Indiana utility at any time it chooses. Such reviews have not been subject to public hearings.

The majority of IPL customers are served pursuant to retail tariffs that provide for the monthly billing or crediting to customers of increases or decreases, respectively, in the actual costs of fuel
(including purchased power costs) consumed from estimated fuel costs embedded in basic rates, subject to certain restrictions on the level of operating income. These billing or crediting mechanisms are referred to as “trackers.” This is
significant because fuel and purchased power costs represent a large and volatile portion of IPL’s total costs. In addition, IPL’s rate authority provides for a return on IPL’s investment and recovery of the depreciation and operation
and maintenance expenses associated with certain IURC-approved environmental investments. The trackers allow IPL to recover the cost of qualifying investments, including a return on investment, without the need for a general rate case.

IPL may apply to the IURC for a change in its fuel charge every three months to recover its estimated fuel costs, including the energy
portion of purchased power costs, which may be above or below the levels included in its basic rates and charges. IPL must present evidence in each fuel adjustment charge (“FAC”) proceeding that it has made every reasonable effort to
acquire fuel and generate or purchase power, or both, so as to provide electricity to its retail customers at the lowest cost reasonably possible.

Independent of the IURC’s ability to review basic rates and charges, Indiana law requires electric utilities under the jurisdiction of the IURC to meet operating expense and income test requirements
as a condition for approval of requested changes in the FAC. Additionally, customer refunds may result if IPL’s rolling twelve-month operating income, determined at quarterly measurement dates, exceeds IPL’s authorized annual
jurisdictional net operating income and there are not sufficient applicable cumulative net operating income deficiencies against which the excess rolling twelve-month jurisdictional net operating income can be offset.

In IPL’s ten most recently approved FAC filings (FAC 81 through 90), the IURC found that IPL’s rolling annual jurisdictional
retail electric net operating income was lower than the authorized annual jurisdictional net







operating income. FAC 90 includes the twelve months ended October 31, 2010. In IPL’s FAC 76 through 80 filings, the IURC found that IPL’s rolling annual jurisdictional retail
electric net operating income was greater than the authorized annual jurisdictional net operating income. Because IPL has a cumulative net operating income deficiency, IPL was not required to make customer refunds in its FAC proceedings.

In December 2007, IPL received a letter from the staff of the IURC requesting information relevant to the IURC’s periodic review of
IPL’s basic rates and charges and IPL subsequently provided information to the staff. Since IPL’s cumulative net operating income deficiency (described above) requires no customer refunds in the FAC process, the IURC staff was concerned
that the higher-than-usual 2007 earnings may continue in the future. In response to the inquiry, IPL provided voluntary credits to its retail customers totaling $32 million. IPL recorded a $30 million deferred fuel regulatory liability in March 2008
and a $2 million deferred fuel regulatory liability in June 2008, with corresponding and respective reductions against revenues for these voluntary credits. All of these credits have been applied in the form of offsets against fuel charges that
customers would have otherwise been billed during June 1, 2008 through February 28, 2009.

Over the past few years,
IPL has received correspondence from the IURC on a few occasions expressing concern for IPL’s level of earnings and inquiring about IPL’s depreciation rates. In response, IPL provided additional information to the IURC relevant to
IPL’s earnings as well as the results of a depreciation analysis that IPL conducted. In the fourth quarter of 2010, IPL received a letter from the IURC stating that they did not have any additional questions.

IPL is a member of the Midwest Independent System Operator, Inc. (“Midwest ISO”). Midwest ISO serves as the third-party
operator of IPL’s transmission system and runs the day-ahead and real-time Energy Market and, beginning in January 2009, the Ancillary Services Market for its members.

IPL transferred functional control of its transmission facilities to the Midwest ISO and its transmission operations were integrated with those of the Midwest ISO. IPL’s participation and authority
to sell wholesale power at market-based rates are subject to the FERC jurisdiction. Transmission service over IPL’s facilities is now provided through the Midwest ISO’s tariff.

As a member of the Midwest ISO, IPL offers its generation and bids its demand into the markets operated by the Midwest ISO on an hourly
basis. The Midwest ISO settles energy hourly offers and bids based on locational marginal prices, which is pricing for energy at a given location based on a market clearing price that takes into account physical limitations, generation and demand
throughout the Midwest ISO region. The Midwest ISO evaluates the market participants’ energy offers and demand bids optimizing for energy products to economically and reliably dispatch the entire Midwest ISO system. The Company has certain
regulatory assets on its balance sheet relating to IPL’s participation in the Midwest ISO. The IURC has authorized IPL to recover the fuel portion of its costs from the Midwest ISO, to defer certain operational, administrative and other costs
from the Midwest ISO and seek recovery in IPL’s next basic rate case proceeding. Total Midwest ISO costs deferred by IPL as long-term regulatory assets were $71.0 million and $62.8 million as of December 31, 2010 and December 31,
2009, respectively. IPL will seek to recover the deferred costs in its next basic rate case proceeding; however, there can be no assurance that IPL would be successful in that regard.

Beginning in 2007, Midwest ISO transmission owners, including IPL, began to share the costs of transmission expansion projects with other
transmission owners after such projects were approved by the Midwest ISO Board of Directors. Upon approval by the Midwest ISO Board of Directors, the transmission owners must make a good-faith effort to build the projects. Costs allocated to IPL for
the projects of other transmission owners are collected by the Midwest ISO per their tariff. We believe it is probable, but not certain, that IPL will ultimately be able to recover from its customers the money it pays to the Midwest ISO for its
share of transmission expansion projects of other utilities, but such recovery is subject to IURC approval in IPL’s next basic rate case. Therefore, such costs to date have been deferred as long-term regulatory assets. To date, such costs have
not been material to IPL. However, given the magnitude of the costs anticipated to enable conformance with renewables mandates in the Midwest ISO footprint, it is probable that such costs will become







material in the next few years. Our current estimates are that IPL’s share of such costs could be more than $50 million annually by 2020 and continue increasing after that.

In 2004, the IURC initiated an investigation to examine the overall effectiveness of Demand-Side Management (“DSM”) programs
throughout the State of Indiana and to consider any alternatives to improve DSM performance statewide. On December 9, 2009, the IURC issued a Generic DSM Order that found that electric utilities subject to its jurisdiction must meet an overall
goal of annual cost-effective DSM programs that reduce retail kWh sales (as compared to what sales would have been excluding the DSM programs) of 2% per year by 2019 (beginning in 2010 at 0.3% and growing to 2.0% in 2019 subject to certain
adjustments). The IURC also found that all jurisdictional electric utilities have to participate in five initial, statewide core DSM programs, which will be administered by a Third-Party Administrator. Consequently, IPL’s DSM spending, both
capital and operating, will increase significantly going forward, which will likely reduce IPL’s retail energy sales and the associated revenues.

Prior to the issuance of the Generic DSM Order, IPL filed a petition seeking relief for substantive DSM programs. IPL proposed a DSM plan to be considered in two phases. The first phase (“Phase
I”) sought recovery for traditional-type DSM programs, such as residential home weatherization and energy efficiency education programs, with additional offerings. The IURC issued an Order in February 2010 that approved the programs included in
IPL’s Phase I request. In addition to IPL’s traditional recovery of the direct costs of the DSM program, the Order also included performance-based incentives. The second phase (“Phase II”) sought recovery for “Advanced”
DSM programs and was coincident with IPL’s application for a smart grid funding grant from the Department of Energy. The “Advanced” DSM programs included an Advanced Metering Infrastructure communication backbone as well as two-way
meters and home area network devices for certain of IPL’s customers. In February 2010, the IURC issued an Order that approved IPL’s Phase II program, but denied IPL’s request to timely recover its expenditures. Instead, IPL would need
to seek recovery of the costs incurred under its Phase II program during its next basic rate case proceeding.

In June 2010,
IPL filed a petition with the IURC seeking authority for an additional DSM program and to recover the lost revenue resulting from decreased kWh consumption and kW demand beginning on June 11, 2010 as a result of the implementation of all
approved DSM programs. The IURC granted IPL’s request related to the additional DSM program, but denied the request to recover lost revenue. Additionally, in October 2010, IPL filed a petition with the IURC for approval of its plan to comply
with the IURC’s Generic DSM Order, which petition includes estimated DSM spending of approximately $65 million from 2011 to 2013. It is not possible to predict at this time what the IURC’s response will be to this petition.

The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 includes various provisions that fund the development of the electric power industry
at the federal and state level. These provisions include, but are not limited to, improving energy efficiency and reliability; electricity delivery (including smart grid technology); energy research and development; renewable energy; and demand
response management. IPL submitted a Smart Grid Investment Grant for $20 million to provide its customers with tools to help them more efficiently use electricity and also to upgrade its delivery system infrastructure. IPL’s application was
approved and the agreement with the United States Department of Energy was executed in April 2010.

Europe, Middle East & Asia

Europe

European Union

Structure of Electricity Market.All European
Union (“EU”) member states are required to implement EU legislation, although there is a degree of disparity as to how such legislation is implemented and the pace of implementation in the respective member states. EU legislation covers a
range of topics which impact the energy sector, including market liberalization and environmental legislation.

The Company
has subsidiaries which operate existing generation businesses in a number of countries which are member states of the EU, including the Czech Republic, Hungary, the Netherlands, Spain and the United Kingdom. The Company also has subsidiaries which
are in the process of commissioning a generation plant in Bulgaria. Bulgaria became a member state of the EU as of January 1, 2007.

Principal Regulations. The principles of market liberalization in the EU electricity and gas markets were introduced under the 2003 Electricity and Gas Directives. In 2005, the European Commission (the
“Commission”) launched a sector-wide inquiry into the European gas and electricity markets. To tackle the issues identified in the inquiry and to further improve the regulatory framework for energy liberalization, the Commission launched
the Third Energy Package in 2007. In the context of the electricity market, the inquiry has to date focused on identifying issues related to price formation in the electricity wholesale markets and the role of long-term agreements as a possible
barrier to entry with a view to improving the competitive situation. In January 2007, the Commission published a proposal for a new common energy policy for Europe. In November 2008, the Commission published a non-binding second Strategic Energy
Review aimed at developing the concept of a common European energy policy. It focused mainly on security of supply and infrastructure development. The Strategic Energy Review proposed reviews of the Gas Storage Directive in 2010 and an update of the
Oil Stocks Directives.

In October 2008, the Energy Ministers reached political agreement on the “Third Liberalization
Package,” which includes five pieces of legislation, Electricity and Gas Directives, Electricity and Gas Regulations and a Regulation creating a new Agency for the Coordination of Energy Regulators, which will have limited powers to deal with
cross-border interconnectors and related issues. This legislation was formally adopted in August 2009 and must be implemented on a national level by March 2011.

Environmental Regulations. See “Environmental and Land Use Regulations—International” below for a description of these directives.

Bulgaria

Structure of Electricity Market. The Bulgarian energy sector model allows for trading at regulated prices, at freely negotiated prices between parties or on the organized market. Since an organized
market has not evolved yet despite the availability of adequate legislative framework for it, the primary means for wholesale trading is the regulated market, the bilateral transactions market and the Electricity Balancing Mechanism. These
arrangements are also supplemented by an imbalance settlement regime.

The Bulgarian power market has evolved from a system
where the National Electricity Company (“NEK”), established in November 1991 as a fully state-owned vertically integrated utility, was responsible for the entire cycle of generation, transmission and distribution. After a decade of
functioning in this role, NEK was vertically unbundled with a resulting legal separation of generation, transmission and distribution assets into different operating entities. While these structural reforms greatly helped create a competitive
electricity sector, there are no actual trading rules to enable the market to operate freely. To ensure accessible customer prices and support to renewable energy supply (“RES”) producers and the highly efficient cogeneration assets, NEK
is still acting as single buyer, purchasing the majority of power generated in Bulgaria and then selling the power to distribution companies or to transmission network-connected consumers or to export across interconnectors (as the sole







licensed Bulgarian power exporter). NEK also owns the biggest hydro-electric and pump storage generation facilities in Bulgaria.

While the transmission system in Bulgaria remains under NEK’s formal ownership, to comply fully with EU legislation, NEK has
spun-off transmission operations (i.e., system operation, balancing market administration and systems’ operation and maintenance) to the Electricity System Operator. The system also allows for a regulated third-party access.

Principal Regulators. The State Energy and Water Regulatory Commission (“SEWRC”) established in 1999 is the independent
regulator for both the energy and water markets. SEWRC’s key responsibilities are:



•Licensing activities in the electricity, heat and natural gas sectors;



•Regulating electricity, heat and natural gas prices (including those from RES and CHP power sources);



•Regulating interconnection to distribution and transmission networks; and



•Issuing of certificates of origin and green certificates for the electricity produced from RES and co-generation.

Principal Regulations. Bulgaria is at a juncture of adopting legislative packages that cover three key European policy
goals—energy independence (Directive 2009/28/EC), environmental sustainability through GHG emissions control (Directive 2009/29/EC) and market liberalization (Directive 2009/72/EC). In line with these EU-mandated goals, the government of
Bulgaria has set the following key priorities: a 20% reduction of the energy intensity of GDP by 2013 and a 50% reduction by 2020; increased renewables share of the total energy consumption to 12% by 2013 and to a minimum of 16% by 2020; and
competitive energy market through promoting new generation entry, security of supply, and sustainable development. A key milestone would be a 30% increase of bilateral contracts in the electricity market by 2013.

A key law that sets the stage for the above priorities is the Bulgarian Energy Act developed in 2004 (the “BEA”) with a view to
a transparent and predictable regulatory environment to promote further liberalization through an independent regulatory authority. The BEA creates a framework for viable commercial companies in the sector through more investment, greater autonomy
of SERWC and more effective commercial restructuring. The BEA is structured so that the market can shift away from the single-buyer model into a more market-oriented third-party network access model that allows for trading at regulated or freely
negotiated prices, as well as at a free market exchange. To be in full compliance with the EU Third Energy Package, the BEA is being amended in order for the electricity market to be fully liberalized under clear regulatory rules and sustainable
market mechanisms. Recent amendments to the BEA are making clear the commitment of the government to honoring long-term contracts for power purchasing with generators whose investments have helped upgrade the national asset base.

To help further develop the energy market, the SERWC developed new Trading Rules, adopted in the summer of 2010, where generators,
consumers and grid operators are organized in balancing groups for the most cost-effective balance between energy supply and consumption. An underlying principle of the Trading Rules will be the presence of a “Day-ahead” market (a
departure from the existing practice of weekly notification schedules). Importantly, the Trading Rules will also establish the principles for the Bulgarian power exchange, all in line with the EU’s Third Energy Liberalization legislation.

Environmental Regulations. The main environmental regulations reflect the implementation of EU
environmental directives. As of January 2007, Bulgaria is introducing EU Emissions Trading Scheme (“ETS”) as the main mechanism for meeting Kyoto Protocol GHG reduction commitments. The Bulgarian Environmental Protection Act amended on
September 27, 2005, and all secondary legislation following from it, have incorporated all EU and Kyoto emission reduction commitments. The Bulgarian National Allocation Plan (“NAP”) allows a total of 42.3 million tonnes of
CO2for the whole volume of fossil fuel-based generation in
the country. The AES Galabovo coal-based power plant will be covered by the NAP at 80% of its projected







generation for 2011 and 2012. The portion of CO2allowances which are not covered by NAP will be billed directly to NEK.

Bulgaria is also subject to the Large Combustion Plant Directive (2001/80/EC) (“LCPD”), which aims to reduce particulate emissions by controlling SO2, NOXand dust from large combustion plants. The LCPD allows for existing plants to opt for exemption from the emission level
values, as long as the operator undertakes not to operate for more than 20,000 hours starting from January 1, 2008 and ending no later than December 31, 2015. Major rehabilitation work has been taking place across units of various
Bulgarian thermal power plants in the last decade. The rehabilitated Maritza East 2 complex is now fitted with electrical filters for capturing dust and Flue Gas Desulphurisation (“FGD”) units (more than 94% efficiency). The AES Galabovo
power plant, which is currently in the process of commissioning, is equipped with a state-of-the-art wet FGD system that ensures 98% of SO2removal.

Bulgaria is dependent on foreign imports for 70% of its primary fuel sources, which makes exploration of renewable energy sources paramount for the country’s achievement of energy independence and
environmental objectives. Bulgaria’s EU-mandated renewable targets have been met mostly by hydro power plants with limited contribution to the fuel mix by wind energy and even less from biomass. The main goal of the Renewable and Alternative
Energy Sources and Biofuels Act of 2007 is to encourage generation from and grid interconnection of installations utilizing renewable energy sources.

Material Regulatory Actions

Potential or Proposed Regulations. The AESB Act referred to above is currently being amended in order to
better incorporate the EU principles set forth in Directive 2009/29/EC. Recent draft amendments to the AESB Act ensure predictability for off-take tariffs for wind project investments that have been undertaken in the last several years (including
the AES-owned Saint Nikola Wind Farm) as well as create new development opportunities for solar power, including the new solar power projects in the Bulgaria pipeline of AES Solar.

Czech Republic

Structure of Electricity Market. In accordance with EU directives regarding market liberalization, all electricity customers in the Czech Republic are able to select their energy supplier. Since
August 2007, the Prague Energy Exchange has been trading energy in the form of base load and peak load on a monthly, quarterly and annual basis. The majority of electricity is, however, still traded on a bilateral contract basis between generators
and distributors, independent traders and also between generators and final customers. In February 2008, a day-ahead spot market was incorporated into the Prague Energy Exchange. Another important entity active in the energy sector is OTE, which is
responsible for: processing and reporting business balance of electricity according to data supplied by electricity market participants; organization of short-term markets and







the balancing market by regulating energy in cooperation with transmission system operator; and evaluation and settlement of imbalances between the agreed and actual electricity supplies and
consumption.

Principal Regulators. The Energy Regulatory Office regulates the energy sector by granting permits for
businesses in the energy sector. The main tasks of the Energy Regulatory Office are: supporting competition, supporting the use of renewable and secondary energy resources, and protection of consumer interests in monopolistic markets.

Principal Regulations

Environmental Regulations. The principal environmental regulations are the Pollution Prevention and Control Regulations 76/2002
Coll. These regulations introduce a pollution control system known as Pollution Prevention and Control (“PPC”). AES Bohemia is subject to air pollution control and is regulated by the Regional Environmental Authority. The key concept of
the regulations concerns the application of Best Available Techniques (“BAT”) in order to prevent pollution. The PPC regime requires installations operating certain activities to apply for a permit to operate. The PPC permit contains
conditions on: waste management; material storage and handling; releases to air, water and land; environmental management techniques; accident prevention and control; monitoring, reporting and record-keeping; and site decommissioning.

Material Regulatory Actions. During 2010, as a result of a feed-in tariff for solar plants, the Czech Republic
experienced a boom in solar installation tripling installed capacity from January 1, 2010. This forced the government to introduce new measures for solar plants to limit the future support to only smaller installations, reduce feed-in tariffs
and implement a new tax regime. However, solar installation has already significantly affected the grid by making any development of new projects more difficult due to limited free capacity in the grid. In addition, the government decided to
introduce a gift tax on free allocated CO2credits to
electricity generators to generate additional resources for financing renewable electricity in the future and to protect electricity customers, at least partly, from a major increase in the regulated fee for the support of renewable electricity.
Although the law stipulates that the CO2gift tax should not
be paid from cogeneration electricity, it is assumed now that the AES Bohemia tax duty may exceed $1.5 million payable in the first quarter of 2011. The final regulation, which will provide calculations of the gift tax for cogeneration producers has
not been issued yet.

Hungary

Structure of Electricity Market. The Hungarian market has one main interconnected system. The state-owned electricity wholesaler, MVM, is the dominant exporter, importer and wholesaler of
electricity. MVM’s affiliated company, MAVIR, is the Hungarian transmission system operator. Currently, Hungary is dependent on







energy imports (mainly from Russia) since domestic production only partially covers consumption. The wholesale market is legally liberalized, although it remains dominated by MVM due to
MVM’s access to and control over a significant portion of the Hungarian generating facilities. The spot market is relatively illiquid with trading dominated by over-the-counter or bilateral contracts. Relative to more western parts of Europe,
the volumes traded are smaller and typically for shorter durations, although contracts with a duration that is greater than one year are available.

Principal regulators. Magyar Energia Hivatal (“MEH”) is the government entity responsible for regulation of the electricity industry in Hungary. The Ministry of National Development
oversees the activities of the MEH.

Principal Regulations. The main regulations in Hungary are those being implemented
under EU directives, the adoption of the Hungarian Electricity Act in 2007, which became effective January 1, 2008, was the final legislative step to implement a fully liberalized electricity market. By virtue of the Hungarian Electricity Act,
all customers are eligible to choose their electricity supplier. In the competitive market, generators sell capacity to wholesale traders, distribution companies, other generators, electricity traders and eligible customers at an unregulated price.
In the light of the third energy liberalization package issued by the EU in 2009, Hungary is planning to implement a major amendment of the Electricity Act and the Gas Act which will conform to the EU package.

Environmental Regulations

Material Regulatory Actions. Shortly before its accession to the EU, the Hungarian government notified the Commission of arrangements concerning compensation to the state-owned electricity
wholesaler MVM. The Commission decided to open a formal investigation in 2005 to determine whether any government subsidies were provided by MVM to its suppliers which were incompatible with the common market. In June 2008, the Commission reached
its decision that these PPAs, including AES Tisza’s PPA, contain elements of illegal state aid. The decision required MVM to terminate the PPAs within six months of the June 2008 decision, and to recover the alleged illegal state aid from the
generators by April 2009. AES Tisza is challenging the Commission’s decision in the Court of First Instance of the European Communities. Referring to the Commission’s decision, Hungary adopted act number LXX of 2008 which terminates all
long-term PPAs in Hungary, including AES Tisza’s PPA, as of December 31, 2008, and requires generators to repay the alleged illegal state aid that was allegedly received by the generators through the PPAs, and provides for the possibility
to offset the generators stranded costs from the repayable state aid. The MEH issued its Resolution No. 342/2010 pursuant to which it stated AES Tisza did not receive illegal state aid.







At the end of 2006 and for all of 2007, the Hungarian government reintroduced administrative
pricing for all electricity generators, overriding PPA pricing, including the pricing in AES Tisza’s PPA. In January 2007, AES Summit Generation Limited (“AES Summit”), a holding company associated with AES Tisza’s operations in
Hungary, and AES Tisza notified the Hungarian government of a dispute concerning its acts and omissions related to AES’ substantial investments in Hungary in connection with the reintroduction of the administrative pricing for Hungarian
electricity generators. In conjunction with this, AES Summit and AES Tisza have commenced International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (“ICSID”) arbitration proceedings against Hungary under the Energy Charter Treaty in
connection with Hungary’s reintroduction of the administrative pricing for Hungarian electricity generators. In the meantime, pursuant to the new Electricity Act in force from January 1, 2008, administrative pricing for electricity
generators was subsequently abolished. The ICSID arbitration panel issued the final determination on September 23, 2010 pursuant to which AES’ claim was dismissed. AES is in the process of analyzing the determination and the potential
legal remedies.

In 2008, Hungary introduced a special tax to be levied on energy companies including companies such as AES
Tisza. The rate of the special tax was 8% and, in 2010, was extended until 2013. Hungary also introduced a further tax on certain industries, including energy companies (the “Crisis Tax”). The rate of the Crisis Tax for energy companies is
1.05% of the net sales revenues.

Spain

Structure of Electricity Market. Spain is a member of the EU and, as such, the Spanish Government has been taking steps to liberalize the country’s electricity sector in accordance with EU
directives. Since January 1, 2003, all customers have been eligible to choose their electricity supplier.

AES currently
operates and holds a 71% ownership interest in a 1,199 MW natural gas-fired plant located in Cartagena on the southeast coast of Spain. The plant sells energy into the Pan-Iberian electricity market (“MIBEL”). The MIBEL market was created
in January 2004 when Spain and Portugal signed a formal agreement. This new market allows generators in the two countries to sell their electricity on both sides of the Spanish-Portuguese border as one single market. OMEL, Spain’s energy market
operator and Portugal’s equivalent, OMIP, exchanged stakes in April 2006, and were reorganized such that an electricity forwards market was created in Lisbon and a spot market was created in Madrid.

The main transmission company, Red Eléctrica de España (“REE”), owns 99% of the 400 kV grid and 98% of the 220 kV
network. The law has been changed to ensure that REE will become the sole transmission company in Spain. REE is also the system operator and is responsible for technical management of the system and for monitoring transmission. Under the
country’s energy infrastructure plan, REE plans to invest in strengthening the mainland grid, connecting new plants and improving interconnection throughout the country. In due course, AES Cartagena entered into an agreement with REE for the
construction of the interconnection facilities. The use of such facilities is the subject of another standard regulated contract stating the specific terms and conditions of access.

Principal Regulations. On December 23, 2010, the Spanish Government implemented the RDL 14/2010 which, among other things,
limits the numbers of hours and amount of feed-in-tariff available for photovoltaic power plants.



•The law that was passed on December 23, 2010 forms part of the government’s policy aimed at rationalizing and delimiting the legally
regulated costs in the electricity network, while searching for new sources of income and protecting the most vulnerable consumers. It is the latest law of those passed in the legislative year of 2010.



•Companies will finance the “Bono Social” (income-based subsidy) until 2013 and they will assume the costs involved in the energy savings and
efficiency policies for the period of 2011-2013.







•All the companies generating electrical power, both those that operate under the ordinary regime as well as those related to renewable energy and
cogeneration, will be paying an access tariff that amounts to €0.50/MWh.



•The hours that are entitled to premiums in the power plants using photovoltaic technology will be limited for a period of three years and in addition,
a further cap on hours is introduced for the duration of the FIT scheme as is the case in the other sectors using wind-powered and thermo-solar technology.



•The maximum limits for the tariff deficit in 2010, 2011 and 2012 have been amended to better adapt to the deviations that arose, and the year 2013 has
been kept as the point in time when self-sufficiency will be reached with regard to tariffs.

This Decree
could have a material impact on AES Cartagena and AES Solar’s business in Spain.

In September 2002, the Spanish Cabinet
approved a ten-year energy plan which focuses on meeting the country’s future energy requirements. The plan also reflects reliance on renewable energy sources and cogeneration. The Spanish electricity system has seen a steady increase in the
new generation capacity from renewable energy sources for many years, particularly as a result of attractive feed-in tariffs (approved by Royal Decree 661/207). Solar photovoltaic installed capacity in the region is estimated at 3.8 GW. The increase
in renewable energy generation capacity supported by generous feed-in tariffs has led to major changes in the regulations with the aim of reducing the total cost of the feed-in tariffs for the Spanish electricity system. Partly as a result of that
and also as a result of the tariff deficit already accumulated, Royal Decree-Law 6/2009 has introduced new measures that affect AES Cartagena. Primarily, the creation of a new obligation on AES Cartagena (and certain other generation companies)
requires them to pay for a portion of the cost of providing a social subsidy to groups of economically vulnerable electricity consumers. The liability for this cost, under the AES Cartagena Energy Agreement, is currently the subject of a dispute
with the Energy Manager, which has been referred to arbitration.

In February 2006, Spain introduced a law
(Article 2 of Royal Decree Law 3/2006), which became effective March 2, 2006, that an amount equivalent to the value of the CO2emission allowances allocated free of charge to electricity generators will be netted from electricity sales proceeds
obtained by Ordinary Regime electricity generation such as the AES Cartagena plant. The parties obliged to pay these sums are the owners of generation facilities. For the years 2008, 2009, and 2010 the number of “CO2credits” required to be surrendered by AES Cartagena under the ETS
has been greater than the number of free credits allocated to it. Liability, under the AES Cartagena Energy Agreement, for the cost of the shortfall in CO2emissions credits is currently in dispute, and is also the subject of the above-mentioned arbitration proceedings. For a
further discussion see Item 3.—Legal Proceedings.

The Spanish Government implemented Orders
(Order ITC/3315/2007, introduced on December 15, 2007, and Orders ITC/1721/2009 and ITC/1722/2009, introduced on June 26, 2009) which developed the principles set out in Article 2 and set the rules applicable for 2006, 2007 and
January 1, 2008 – June 30, 2009, respectively. The effect of these legislative provisions is that all owners of Ordinary Regime generation facilities in Spain are required to pay sums equivalent to the value of the CO2emissions allowances allocated free of charge for 2006, 2007, 2008 and
the first six months of 2009. Liability, under the AES Cartagena Energy Agreement, for these costs is currently in dispute and is the subject of the above-mentioned arbitration proceedings. For a further discussion see Item 3. —Legal
Proceedings. As for the periods after 2012, Directive 2003/87/EC establishes that power generation facilities will not be issued with allowances free of charge.

On December 23, 2002, Cadastral Law 48/2002 was enacted, which created a new category of property identified as Special Real Estate. This, together with further legislative changes (i.e., Law 51/2002
and Law 16/2007), led to the Municipality of Cartagena increasing the relevant tax rate and the issuance by the Cadastral authorities of a new property value assessment on November 21, 2007, which resulted in an increase in the







amount of Spanish property tax that is payable by AES Cartagena in respect of the plant. Liability under the Energy Agreement for this increase in tax is currently in dispute and is the subject
of the above-mentioned arbitration proceedings.

Turkey

Structure of Electricity Market. The wholesale generation and distribution market in Turkey is primarily a bilateral market
dominated by state-owned entities. The state-owned Electricity Generation Company (“EUAS”) and its subsidiaries comprise approximately 24 GW of generation capacity and represent approximately 48% of the market. Private producers (with
public offtake) account for another 35%, and auto producers and merchant power plants the remaining 17%.

Principal
Regulators

Environmental Regulations. Turkey has introduced a “renewable” feed-in tariff that sets a floor for renewable generation
(geothermal, wind and small-scale hydro) for the first ten years of operation. The floor is between €0.050 and €0.055 per kWh and decreed by EMRA each year. AES’ Turkey hydro assets fall under the renewable feed-in tariffs.

The Turkish Government has also announced plans to privatize all the state-owned generation assets, other than certain large
hydro-electric plants, in 2011.

Ukraine

Structure of Electricity Market. The electricity sector in Ukraine is regulated by the National Energy Regulatory Commission
(“NERC”). Electricity costs to end-users in Ukraine consist of three main components: (1) the wholesale market tariff is the price at which the distributor purchases energy on the wholesale market, (2) the distribution tariff
covers the cost of transporting electricity over the distribution network, and (3) the supply tariff covers the cost of supplying electricity to an end-user. The total cost permitted by the regulator under the distribution and supply tariff
each year is referred to as the DVA. The distribution and supply tariffs for all distribution companies in Ukraine are established by the NERC on an annual basis, at which time DVA and electricity distribution volumes in the tariff are adjusted. A
change in the DVA methodology was effected at the end of 2007 with respect to the treatment of wages and salaries such that the adjustment for inflation was replaced by an allowance based on the average industrial wage in the country and normative
quantity of personnel.







Principal Regulations. In 2006, NERC authorized two 25% increases in end-user tariffs
for residential customers. Since 2006, there have been no further changes in residential end-user tariffs. In 2010, the level of end-user residential tariff covered approximately 30% of real energy costs. A moratorium on end-user tariff increases
was introduced by Presidential decree for non-residential customers, effective from December 1, 2008, which resulted in the freezing of retail tariffs for the greater part of 2009. In 2010, the retail tariffs have slightly increased but legally
the moratorium is still in force. The wholesale electricity market price increased by 49% in 2008, by 8.5% in 2009, and by 18% in 2010. In the course of 2010, a simultaneous increase in wholesale market price and pressure on the end-user tariff
growth resulted in an increase of the debt to distribution companies by NERC on compensation of losses for supplying energy to residential customers at privileged tariffs.

A comprehensive review of the distribution tariff methodology addressing issues of revaluation of the rate base, operational expenses coverage on tariffs, the rate of return and introduction of regulatory
incentives to increase the quality of service was initially expected to take place at the end of 2008. However, since late 2008 and then on an annual basis, NERC has been introducing minimal changes into the tariff methodology to be valid for just
one year, including for 2010, setting the rate of return on initial investment at the level of 15% after tax, wages and salaries treatment remaining as per the mechanism introduced in 2007, and material operational expenses subject to indexation by
inflation. A similar extension of provisions for 2011 has been effected in late 2010. Development and approval of a comprehensive methodology is expected to take place during 2011 to be introduced in 2012.

In 2010, the President of Ukraine announced the list of reforms for implementation up through 2014 in all sectors of the economy,
including the electric industry. According to such reforms, there are plans to (i) develop new tariff methodology in 2011; (ii) increase tariffs for residential customers; (iii) commence elimination of cross subsidies; (iv) make
changes to legislation to improve customers’ payment discipline; (v) privatize state-owned distribution companies and generation companies; and (vi) introduce a new market structure based on bilateral agreements and balancing market,
etc.

In 2009, the Supreme Court of Ukraine took a preliminary position affecting distribution companies in the Ukraine,
including AES Kievoblenergo and AES Rivneoblenergo, whereunder it required that certain network commercial losses of power that were previously treated as tax deductible could no longer be treated as such. This position, if maintained, may have a
material effect on AES Kievoblenergo and AES Rivneoblenergo. The Company expects that the Supreme Court of Ukraine may clarify its position in 2011, and the proceedings in respect to AES Kievoblenergo and AES Rivneoblenergo are not likely to be
finally resolved for another several years.

United Kingdom

Structure of Electricity Market. On March 21, 2007, the Electricity (Single Wholesale Market) (Northern Ireland) Order 2007
was enacted, which provided for the introduction and regulation of a single wholesale electricity market (the “SEM”) for Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland that began operation in November of 2007. Revenue from the SEM includes a
regulated capacity and an energy payment based on the system marginal price. Bidding principles insist bids are cost-reflective and are based on short run marginal cost. Total annual capacity payments are calculated as the product of the annualized
fixed cost of a best new entrant peaking plant multiplied by the capacity required to meet the security standard. This accumulated capacity is then distributed on the basis of plant availability throughout the year on a per trading period basis.

Certain generating units (Kilroot GTs 1 and 2 and Ballylumford units 4, CCGT units 10 & 20 and GTs 1 and 2) are
contracted under long-term PPAs to NIE Energy Limited terminating on various dates. The CCGT units are subject to extension by NIEE between March 2012 and 2024. All of the PPAs can be cancelled under direction from NIAUR from November 1, 2010
with six months’ notice other than the Ballylumford 10 and 20 units which can be cancelled from April 1, 2012. All other units (Kilroot units K1 and K2 whose PPAs terminated in November 2010, GTs 3 and 4 and Ballylumford units 5 and 6)
participate as merchant units in the SEM as described above.







The effect of this on the Northern Ireland units operated as merchant plants in the SEM
depends largely on the relative costs of coal and gas. The relevant units receive capacity payments under the SEM.

For the
units with PPAs in place, Kilroot and Ballylumford are neutral with respect to the cost of fuel as this is passed through to its PPA counterparty as an element of the payments made to the respective units based on their availability.

Principal Regulators. Kilroot and Ballylumford are located in Northern Ireland, which is part of the United Kingdom, and are
subject to regulation by the Northern Ireland Authority for Utility Regulation (“NIAUR”).

Principal
Regulations. The principal legislation is The Electricity (Northern Ireland) Order 1992 under which the Generation Licenses of Kilroot and Ballylumford are granted.

Environmental Regulations. The Kilroot and Ballylumford plants operate under permits granted under the Pollution Prevention Control Regulations (NI) 2003.

The Industrial Emissions Directive was approved by the European Parliament on July 7, 2010 and is expected to
become law by 2014. The Directive sets stricter limits on the emissions of pollutants such as NOX, SO2and
particulate and requires further reductions in such emissions by January 2016. The combined package of the Industrial Emission Directive, National Emissions Ceiling Directive and Best Available Technique requirements forms a Regulatory Framework for
all electricity generation Large Combustion Plants for the period from 2016 onwards, principally comprising coal-fired, gas-fired, oil-fired and biomass-fired plants. The following steps may be required in respect of Kilroot: (i) fit selective
catalytic reduction and comply with the new limits by 2023, at which time there may be another review; (ii) opt out and run under a limited life derogation for a maximum of 17,500 hours; and (iii) opt into a Transitional National Plan
which shall apply from January 1, 2016 until June 30, 2020 then option to comply with Emission Limit Values or Closure.

Currently, the Ballylumford units 4, 5 and 6 (the B Station) are scheduled to close by the end of 2015 under the Large Combustion Plant Directive; however, there is the possibility that these units may be
adapted to be compliant under the Industrial Emissions Directive. The exact detail will not be known until the Industrial Emissions Directive is implemented.

With regard to the C Station at Ballylumford, gas turbines using light oils and middle distillates as liquid fuels
shall be subject to an emission limit value for NOXof
90mg/Nm3. GT10 (part of the CCGT plant) is currently permitted to 120mg/m3 on distillate. This could mean that possible modifications are required to be able to continue to run distillate as a dual fuel.

It is expected that there will be transitionary arrangements within the Directive to allow plants to manage the introduction of the new
limits and it has been suggested that large combustion plants may have until July 2020 to meet the requirements. The option appears attractive to AES and would allow the units to operate without substantial capital investment on a restricted load
factor until the end of 2020. After 2020, AES would be required to comply with the new emissions limits in order to continue operations.

The Environmental Liability Directive came into force in Northern Ireland on June 24, 2009 and is aimed at the prevention and remedying of environmental damage. An operator will be held financially
liable if is carries out certain activities which cause environmental damage, or where there is an imminent threat of such damage, regardless of whether it intended to cause the damage or was negligent. This includes IPPC permitted installations. In
practice there should be no real change to AES’ operations as a result of the coming into force of this Directive.

Material Regulatory Actions. On November 25, 2009, the NIAUR published a “Consultation Paper on Relevant Considerations
in Relation to the Possible Cancellation of Generating Unit Agreements in Northern







Ireland” which is relevant to various long-term PPAs in Northern Ireland including those at Kilroot and Ballylumford. On April 30, 2010, NIAUR made notification to Kilroot that it
intended to exercise the early cancellation provisions of the GUAs for the main coal units (K1 and K2) effective November 1, 2010. The formal cancellation notices were received on October 28, 2010 instructing NIEE to cancel the GUAs for
units K1 and K2 effective November 1, 2010. All remaining units remain contracted but are kept under review. Units K1 and K2 fully operate within the SEM (as mentioned above).

Potential or Proposed Regulations. In November 2010, the Council of the EU approved a revised directive on
industrial emissions so as to reduce emissions of pollutants that are harmful to the environment and associated with cancer, asthma and acid rain. The industrial emissions directive seeks to prevent and control air, water and soil pollution by
industrial installations. It regulates emissions of a wide range of pollutants, including sulphur and nitrogen compounds, dust particles, asbestos and heavy metals. The directive is aimed at improving local air, water and soil quality, not at
mitigating the global warming effects of some of these substances. The review integrates seven directives into a single legal Framework and provides for a more harmonized and rigorous implementation of emissions limits associated with the cleanest
available technology, so-called BAT. Deviations from this standard are only permitted where local and technical characteristics would make it disproportionately costly. The recast also tightens emission limits for NO

X

, SO


and dust from power plants and large combustion installations in oil refineries and the metal industry. New plants must
apply the cleanest available technology from 2012, four years earlier than initially proposed. Existing plants have to comply with this standard from 2016, though a transition period is foreseen. Until June 30, 2020, member states may define
transitional plans with declining annual caps for NO

X

,
SO


or dust emissions. Where installations are already
scheduled to close by the end of 2023 or operate less than 17,500 hours after 2016, they may not need to upgrade. Member States have two years to transpose the Directive.

Middle East & Asia

China

In addition to the foregoing tariff-setting mechanism, China’s central government also issued a tariff adjustment policy allowing
the on-grid tariffs to be pegged to the fuel price in the case of significant fluctuations in fuel price. Seventy percent of the increase in fuel costs may be passed through in the tariff. The tariffs of coal-fired facilities in China were increased
in 2005, 2006, 2008 and 2009 pursuant to this policy to alleviate the escalation of fuel price; however, such adjustments were obtained from the regulatory authorities only after a time lag and fell short of compensating all businesses for coal
price increases in recent years. There was no catch-up tariff adjustment in 2010 pursuant to the foregoing policy.







On July 20, 2009, NDRC issued the “Circular on Refining the Policy for On-Grid Pricing of Wind Power” (NDRC Price 2009
No. 1906), which introduces a benchmark system for on-grid tariffs for wind power replacing the existing public bidding and concession model for wind projects. The circular provides that on-grid tariffs for onshore wind power projects approved
from August 1, 2009 onwards are fixed using a centrally controlled price determination mechanism, while on-grid tariffs for offshore wind projects will be determined separately. Under the circular, China’s onshore area is divided into four
different types of wind-power resource regions, and different prices are set for each of these regions ranging from 0.51 yuan/kWh (US cent 7.5/kWh) for wind power in regions with the best wind resources, such as Inner Mongolia, to 0.61 yuan/kWh (US
cent 8.9/kWh) for regions with the worst wind resources. According to NDRC, the legislation’s intent is to standardize the wind power price regulation and promote healthy and sustainable development of the wind-power industry. Currently, we do
not expect that this newly issued circular will have a material adverse impact on our wind power businesses in China.

India

Structure of Electricity Market. Pursuant to reforms by the Government of India, including enactment of the Electricity Act of India (“EAI”), the electricity market in India is moving
towards a multi-buyer, multi-seller system as opposed to the past structure which permitted a single buyer to purchase power from power generators.







This legal and regulatory framework provides flexibility in granting electricity regulatory commissions freedom in determining tariffs as well as encouraging competition with regulatory
intervention. Transmission, distribution and trade of electricity remain regulated activities which require licenses from an electricity regulatory commission, unless exempted. The Central Government, through the Ministry of Power, is involved in
the power sector planning, policy formulation and appointment of central regulators. State governments also have powers to appoint or remove members of the State Regulatory Commissions. The state governments set up and notify the state load dispatch
center. Under the EAI, the state governments are required to unbundle the State Electricity Boards into separate generation, distribution and transmission companies.

Principal Regulators. India’s power sector is regulated by a two-level regulatory system: at the national level, the Central Electricity Regulatory Commission (“CERC”); and at the
state level, the State Electricity Regulatory Commissions (“SERC”) (together the “Regulatory Commissions”). CERC regulates tariffs of generating stations owned by the Central Government, or those involved in generating in more
than one State, and regulating interstate transmission of electricity. SERC regulates intra-state transmission and supply of electricity within each state. While discharging functions under the EAI, regulatory commissions are guided by the National
Electricity Policy, the Tariff Policy and the National Electricity Plan and directions on any policy involving public interest issued by the Central Government or state government. Regulatory Commissions are quasi-judicial authorities entrusted with
various functions including determining tariffs, granting licensees and settling disputes between the generating companies and the licensees, and between licensees. An Appellate Tribunal has been set up for appeal against orders of Regulatory
Commissions. The Appellate Tribunal has quasi-judicial powers to summon, enforce attendance, require discovery, receive evidence and review decisions. The orders of the Appellate Tribunal are executable as decrees of a civil court and can be
challenged in the Supreme Court.

Principal Regulations. In 2003, the Government of India enacted the EAI to establish
a framework for a multi-seller/multi-buyer model for the electricity industry, introducing significant changes to India’s electricity sector. The EAI is a central unified legislation relating to generation, transmission, distribution trading
and use of electricity that replaced multiple legislations. Pursuant to the EAI, the Government of India ratified the National Electricity Policy in 2005 and the National Tariff Policy in 2006. The policies established deadlines to implement
different provisions of the EAI. However, the pace of actual implementation of the reform process is contingent on the respective state governments and SERCs, as electricity is a “concurrent” subject in India’s constitution. There is
no license required to set up generation plants under the EAI and generators are allowed to sell to state utilities, traders and open-access consumers. The access to consumers is subject to regulatory provisions on transmission corridor availability
and payment of cross-subsidy surcharge.







fiscal benefits after it is certified that: (i) the power purchasing states have granted to the Regulatory Commissions full powers to fix tariffs; (ii) the power purchasing states
undertake, in principle, to privatize distribution in all cities, in that state, which has a population of more than one million, within a period to be fixed by the Ministry of Power; and (iii) the income tax holiday regime as per
Section 80-IA of the Income Tax Act, 1961 is also available.

The EAI specifies trading in electricity as a licensed
activity. The license for electricity trading is required to be obtained from the relevant regulatory commission. In 2009, CERC issued regulations for the grant of trading licenses to regulate the interstate trading of electricity. Trading license
regulations set out qualifications for the grant of the license including technical and professional qualifications and net worth requirements. Licensees are subject to conditions specifying, among other things the extent of trading margin,
maintenance of records and a requirement to pay a license fee, as specified by CERC. The Regulatory Commissions have the right to fix a ceiling on trading margins in intra-state trading. Two power exchanges have received licenses from CERC and have
started operations. The volume of power trading on the power exchanges is short-term as the bulk of power is still traded through long-term bilateral contracts.

Environmental Regulations


Material Regulatory Actions. The
Electricity Regulatory Commission (“ERC”) is empowered to determine tariffs for supply of electricity by a generating company to a distribution licensee, transmission of electricity, wheeling of electricity and retail sale of electricity.
In case of a shortage of supply of electricity, the ERC may fix the minimum and maximum tariff ceiling for sale or purchase of electricity for a period not exceeding one year to ensure reasonable prices of electricity. While determining tariffs, the
ERC follows principles and methodologies specified by the CERC for determination of tariffs, including the principle that generation, transmission, distribution and supply of electricity should be conducted on commercial principles and takes into
account factors which encourage competition, efficiency and economical use of resources.

The EAI provides that the ERC will
adopt such tariffs determined through a transparent process of bidding in accordance with guidelines issued by the Central Government. The Central Government, through the Ministry







of Power, has issued guidelines for competitive bidding and draft documentation (PPAs) for competitively bid projects. The determination of tariffs for a power project depends on the mode of
participation in the project. Tariffs may be determined in two ways: (i) based on tariff principles prescribed by CERC, i.e., cost-plus basis consisting of a capacity charge, an energy charge, an unscheduled interchange charge and incentive
payments; or (ii) a competitive bidding process where the tariff is purely market based.

Kazakhstan

Structure of Electricity Market. In Kazakhstan, the electricity sector is divided into wholesale and retail markets. The wholesale electricity market of Kazakhstan is based on bilateral contracts
conducted through an over-the-counter market and KOREM’s centralized trading system. In the retail market, the power distribution and supply functions are unbundled and retail customers with consumption of one MW or more have a right to buy the
electricity directly from power plants or retail supply companies.

Principal Regulators. The Government of Kazakhstan
approves subordinate acts in the power sector (licensing requirement, technical regulations, market rules, tariff methodologies for natural monopolies, etc.) and determines the level of price caps for groups of power plants.

The Ministry of Industry and New Technologies (the “Ministry”) is the central executive body responsible for developing state
policy in the power sector and conducting technical regulation. As a part of price cap regulation, the Ministry is responsible for determining groups of power companies for each price cap, annual adjustments of price caps and signing agreements on
investment obligations with power plants.

The Agency for Regulation of Natural Monopolies (the “Regulator”) acts as
a regulator of industries considered to be “natural monopolies” (transmission and distribution of oil, gas, electricity and heat, railroads, airports, etc.). In the power industry, the Regulator is responsible for the approval of tariffs
for heat generation, distribution and supply, electricity transmission and distribution as well as end-user tariffs for dominant companies in the retail power market. The Regulator grants different licenses in the power sector such as licenses for
generation, distribution and retail activities.

The Agency for Protection of Competition (the “AZK”) monitors power
market participants to determine entities with a dominant position and detect violations of antimonopoly legislation.







The Ministry of Environmental Protection (the “Environmental Ministry”) is
responsible for environmental policy, grants emissions permits and evaluates the environmental impact of new projects.

JSC
KEGOC is a state-owned electricity transmission company, which also acts as the system operator with a central dispatch management function and as the operator of the balancing market.

Principal Regulations. The following major laws and regulations govern the electricity industry:



•Law “On the Power Industry” (the “Kazakhstan Electricity law”);



•Law “On Natural Monopolies and Regulated Markets”;



•Law “On Competition”;



•Law “On Supporting the Use of Renewable Energy Sources”;



•Environmental Code;



•Law “On Licensing”;



•Resolution of the Government of the Republic of Kazakhstan “On Approval of the Price Caps”; and



•The state program of power industry development in 2010-2014.

Continuous changes in the law and regulations result in contradictions between different laws and regulations. This in turn results in an
uncertain regulatory environment in the power sector.

The key elements of price cap regulation of power plants are as
follows: (i) the Ministry has determined the power plant grouping based on the plant type, equipment, fuel and distance from coal mines (thirteen groups of power plants were defined); (ii) the Ministry has proposed to the government the
price cap for each group based on actual prices in 2008 and the level of investment required and the government has approved price caps for each groups of power plants for the seven-year period from 2009-2015; (iii) the Ministry may propose to
the government additional annual adjustments to price caps to reflect inflation and investment requirements within any group or a power plant may apply for an individual investment tariff to the Ministry and the Regulator; (iv) a power plant
determines its investment obligations at its own discretion and signs an agreement with the Ministry on investment obligations; and (v) the price cap and individual investment tariff regime does not constitute a price guarantee and power plants
should sell to consumers at the competitive market price but not higher than their group price cap or an individual investment tariff. Only exports of power and sale of ten percent of generation through a centralized trading system are exempt from
this restriction. Power trading activities are restricted and power plants are allowed to conduct trading activities to provide electricity supply to their consumers during emergency shutdowns.

The Regulator approves and regulates all tariffs for heat generation, transmission and supply, as well as electricity transmission and
distribution tariffs on a cost-based methodology. Power trading companies, which the AZK considers dominant entities, must notify the Regulator of any proposed increase in their tariffs and the Regulator has the right to veto such proposed tariff
increases. Furthermore, the Regulator has the right to request a decrease in the applicable tariffs.

The AZK determines the
borders of electricity markets at its own discretion, which does not correspond with the provisions of the Kazakhstan Electricity Law, and designates entities with dominant market power. The AZK may consider the tariff of a power plant which is in
compliance with price cap regulation to be an excessive monopolistic price of a dominant entity and impose sanctions, as happens from time to time to AES’ generating companies.

Environmental regulations. The Environmental Ministry is responsible for environmental policy and environmental regulations. The
Environmental Ministry issues environmental permits, sets emissions limits and







organizes ecological control in the forms of state environmental impact assessment and independent ecological audit. The Environmental Ministry reviews applications of power plants and, after
conducting the environmental impact assessment, grants environmental permits for industrial waste, air and water pollutions for a period of not more than three years.

Material Regulatory Actions. In December 2010, the Ministry refused to sign agreements on investment obligations with AES UK HPP and AES UK CHP for 2011 and has requested to amend the existing
agreement on investment obligation from AES Shulbinsk HPP in 2011. The Ministry has demanded that AES power plants in Kazakhstan undertake an additional obligation to spend all profits in new investment projects. The absence of signed agreements on
investment obligations may lead to further sanctions by the AZK and other state authorities against our businesses.

The AREM
has refused to grant a necessary tariff increase to the AES retail company Shygysenergotrade LLP for 2011. Contrary to applicable law, AREM is requesting that Shygysenergotrade LLP confirm the existence of agreements on investment obligations
between the AES power plants and the Ministry as a condition for the right to purchase power at new price caps. Increased investment costs and/or sanctions could have a material impact on these businesses, require additional capital investment, and
may impact our results of operations.

The AZK has designated all AES power plants in Kazakhstan as dominant entities in the
Eastern Kazakhstan and Pavlodar regions. Shygysenergotrade LLP has also been designated by the AZK as a dominant entity in the Eastern Kazakhstan retail market. AES has challenged these designations but so far has been unsuccessful in having the
designations overturned. The AZK is conducting other investigations into alleged violations by AES businesses in Kazakhstan of antimonopoly legislation such as excessive monopolistic prices and ungrounded refusal to supply power to certain
customers. AES believes that the investigations per se and allegations made by the AZK in the course of investigations are without merits, and AES is vigorously challenging the unfounded actions of the AZK. However, if AES Kazakhstan does not
prevail in these proceedings, there could be a material impact on these businesses and our results of operations.

Potential or Proposed Regulations. The Ministry plans to introduce a capacity market starting in 2015 to support new investments
in generating assets. The capacity market should replace price cap regulation. Details of the new regulations are not yet publicly available and the regulations are still under review by the government. The capacity market regulations could be
unfavorable to our businesses in Kazakhstan and may have a material impact on our financial results.

The Ministry and the
Regulator have drafted amendments to the Kazakhstan Electricity Law to increase sanctions for any failure to implement the investment program or comply with the price cap regulation. The absence of a signed agreement on investment obligations will
limit a power plant’s right to apply tariffs up to the price cap, such that the electricity tariff of a power plant cannot not exceed its 2008 level. It is expected that this regulation will come into force in 2011. As a result, we may be
required to make significant capital investments and to incur other expenses in order to obtain the benefits of the price caps.

The Regulator plans to introduce benchmarking tariff regulations for power distribution to be effective in 2013. The Environmental
Ministry plans to amend the Ecological Code to introduce carbon regulation to comply with the Kyoto Protocol, which was ratified by Kazakhstan. According to the draft regulation, a power plant will receive carbon emissions allocations and a carbon
trading system will be established. In addition, a violation of environmental legislation may lead to criminal liability and fines.

Philippines

Structure of Electricity Market. From a
vertically integrated industry, the Philippines has unbundled its power sector into generation, transmission, distribution and supply. The enabling law for this restructuring is Republic Act No. 9136, otherwise known as the Electric Power
Industry Reform Act of 2001 (“EPIRA”). The







EPIRA primarily aims to increase private sector participation in the power sector and to privatize the Government’s generation and transmission assets. Generation and supply are open and
competitive sectors, while transmission and distribution are regulated sectors. Sale of power is done primarily thorough medium-term contracts between generation companies and customers specifying the volume, price and conditions for the sale of
energy and capacity. The Energy Regulatory Commission (“ERC”) approves the said contracts for supply of energy. Power is also traded in the Wholesale Electricity Spot Market (“WESM”) from which at least 10% of the distribution
companies or electricity cooperatives power requirement must be sourced.

A market optimization model determines the price and
dispatch by processing the bids from trading participants and the system condition from the system operator. The market operator then comes out with a schedule of both price and energy which maximizes economic gains for participants subject to
certain constraints. The dispatch schedule is then coordinated with the system operator for implementation. The market is operating under a gross pool, net settlement system, whereby each generator submits energy offers regardless of their
contracted energy. However, the generator should declare their contracted quantities, since the market will not include contracted energy in its settlement.

New contracts assigned by distribution companies for consumption after expiration are awarded to generation companies either through the lowest supply price offered in public bid processes or through a
negotiated contract. The ERC then approves the said contract benchmarked against, among others, the prices of the best new entrant generation company. Except for its supply to MERALCO (the largest distribution company in the Philippines), to which
it is allocated about 14.89% of the contract energy under the NPC Transition Supply Contract, all supply contracts of AES Masinloc are bilateral contracts already provisionally approved by the ERC.

Principal Regulators. The ERC, created under the EPIRA, is mandated to protect long-term consumer interest in terms of quality,
reliability and reasonable pricing of sustainable supply of electricity. It is a quasi-judicial body that promulgates and enforces rules, regulations, guidelines and policies. The Department of Energy is mandated to prepare, integrate, coordinate,
supervise and control all plans, programs, projects and activities of the government relative to energy exploration, development, utilization, distribution and conservation. The DOE endorses new or existing generators. The Department of Environment
and Natural Resources administers the system for evaluating the environmental impact of new or existing generating plants.

Principal Regulations. The distinct electricity sector activities are regulated by the EPIRA. Sector activities are also governed
by the corresponding technical regulations and standards, namely, the Philippine Grid Code, Philippine Distribution Code, Open Access Transmission Service Rules, WESM Rules, and Distribution System Open Access Rules (“DSOAR”).The keystones
of the electricity regulation are: (i) performance based on revenue cap and non-discriminatory access to transmission lines; (ii) a contract-based supply and spot electricity trading for generation; (iii) performance based on maximum
average price and non-discriminatory access for DUs and ECs under the performance base rate regime; and (iv) electricity supply by distribution companies in their respective franchise areas.

Section 31 of EPIRA establishes the Retail Competition and Open Access (“RC&OA”) under which Retail Electricity
Suppliers, who are duly licensed by the ERC, may supply directly to Contestable Customers (end-users with an average demand of at least 1,000 kW) with DUs and ECs providing non-discriminatory wires services. Four of the five pre-conditions for
RC&OA have already been satisfied and the remaining condition for open access to commence is expected to be achieved next year. Actual RC&OA may commence six months after ERC’s determination that all conditions have been satisfied.

Environmental Regulations. The Renewable Energy Act of 2008 was enacted in December 2008 (“R.A. 9513”) R.A.
9513 promotes non-conventional renewable energy sources, such as solar, wind, small hydroelectric and biomass energies. The law requires that electric power participants to initially source 10% of their supply from eligible renewable energy
resources. The initial requirement of 10% is preliminary, as the National Renewable Energy Board (“NREB”) has not decided on the final figure. It is also unknown at this time if the







definition of electric power participant applies to entities that are power producers or if it applies to power consumers. If and once the regulations are implemented, our businesses in the
Philippines could be adversely impacted by having to source a portion of its generation from renewable energy resources to supply its customers’ contracts, which could in turn affect our results of operations.

Under Section 6 of the said law, consumers are also given a green energy option which provides end-users the option to choose
renewable energy resources as their source of energy. Water rights are given by the National Water Resources Board under the Department of Environment and Natural Resource for extraction and discharge of water used in the operation of the Masinloc
Plant.

Material Regulatory Actions. Pending with the ERC is the decision for the approval of additional fees for AES
Masinloc through a rate adjustment and currency exchange adjustment. The ERC previously ruled that NPC shall be responsible for any recovery/refund for both these recoveries for the transition period prior to the closing date for each company such
as AES Masinloc which obtained facilities in the privatization. With the acquisition of the Masinloc, our business also acquired the right to supply the electricity requirement of various NPC customers pursuant to the Transition Supply Contracts
entered into between NPC and those customers. In an Order on November 15, 2010, the ERC approved the refund for currency exchange recovery adjustment, covering the test period up to June 2009.

Potential or Proposed Regulations. Section 72 of the EPIRA requires a mandated rate reduction from NPC rates. With the
assignment of the Transition Supply Contracts to successor generating companies, such as AES Masinloc, NPC’s position is that the mandated rate reduction shall be for the account of the successor generating companies. AES Masinloc filed a
petition with ERC to initiate rule making and clarify the MRR implementation in light of the ongoing privatization of NPC plants. In its decision, the ERC ruled in favor of AES Masinloc, saying that the EPIRA mandated rate reduction shall be
implemented by the successor generating company subject to the execution of a written instrument between NPC and the new generator specifically containing the assumption by the latter of such obligation. The ERC ruled in favor of AES Masinloc since
there was no such written instrument. NPC filed a petition for review with the Court asking for a reversal of the said ERC decision. The case is pending with the Court of Appeals. If AES Masinloc loses this matter on appeal, it may be subject to the
rate reduction described above, which could have a material impact on its business and our results of operations.

A similar
mandated rate reduction case is pending with the ERC. MERALCO alleges that AES Masinloc failed to account for the rate reduction in MERALCO’s favor amounting to Php179,611,458.98 ($4.1 million). It is assumed that the ERC will wait for the
decision of the first matter described in the preceding paragraph before ruling on the MERALCO case since the latter is particularly dependent on the outcome of the pending petition with the Court of Appeals.

Environmental and Land Use Regulations

Overview.The Company faces certain risks and uncertainties related to numerous environmental laws and
regulations, including existing and potential greenhouse gas (“GHG”) legislation or regulations, and actual or potential laws and regulations pertaining to water discharges, waste management (including disposal of coal combustion
byproducts), and certain air emissions, such as SO2,
NOX, particulate matter, mercury and other hazardous air
pollutants. Such risks and uncertainties could result in increased capital expenditures or other compliance costs which could have a material adverse effect on certain of our United States or international subsidiaries, and our consolidated results
of operations. For further information about these risks, see Item 1A.—Risk Factors, “Our businesses are subject to stringent environmental laws and regulations,” “Our businesses are subject to enforcement
initiatives from environmental regulatory agencies,” and “Regulators, politicians, non-governmental organizations and other private parties have expressed concern about greenhouse gas, or GHG, emissions and the potential risks
associated with climate change and are taking actions which could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations, financial condition and cash flows” in this Form 10-K.







Many of the countries in which the Company does business also have laws and regulations
relating to the siting, construction, permitting, ownership, operation, modification, repair and decommissioning of, and power sales from electric power generation or distribution assets. In addition, international projects funded by the
International Finance Corporation, the private sector lending arm of the World Bank, or many other international lenders are subject to World Bank environmental standards or similar standards, which tend to be more stringent than local country
standards. The Company often has used advanced environmental technologies in order to minimize environmental impacts, including circulating fluidized bed (“CFB”) coal technologies, flue gas desulphurization technologies, selective
catalytic reduction technologies and advanced gas turbines.

Environmental laws and regulations affecting electric power
generation and distribution facilities are complex, change frequently and have become more stringent over time. The Company has incurred and will continue to incur capital costs and other expenditures to comply with environmental laws and
regulations. See Item 7.—Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Capital Expendituresin this Form 10-K for more detail. If these regulations change or the enforcement of
these regulations becomes more rigorous, the Company and its subsidiaries may be required to make significant capital or other expenditures to comply. There can be no assurance that the businesses operated by the subsidiaries of the Company would be
able to recover any of these compliance costs from their counterparties or customers such that the Company’s consolidated results of operations, financial condition and cash flows would not be materially adversely affected.

Various licenses, permits and approvals are required for our operations. Failure to comply with permits or approvals, or with
environmental laws, can result in fines, penalties, capital expenditures, interruptions or changes to our operations. Certain subsidiaries of the Company are subject to litigation or regulatory action relating to environmental permits or approvals.
See Item 3.—Legal Proceedings in this Form 10-K for more detail with respect to environmental litigation and regulatory action, including a Notice of Violation (“NOV”) issued by the United States Environmental Protection
Agency against IPL concerning new source review and prevention of significant deterioration issues under the United States Clean Air Act.

Greenhouse Gas Laws, Protocols and Regulations.In 2010, the Company’s subsidiaries operated electric power generation businesses which had total approximate direct CO2emissions of 77.2 million metric tonnes, approximately
40 million metric tonnes of which were emitted in the United States (both figures ownership adjusted). The Company uses
CO2emission estimation methodologies supported by the
“The Greenhouse Gas Protocol” reporting standard on GHG emissions. For existing power generation plants,
CO2emissions are either obtained directly from plant
continuous emission monitoring systems or calculated from actual fuel heat inputs and fuel type CO2emission factors. The following is an overview of both the regulations and laws that currently apply to our businesses and those that may be imposed over the next few years. Such regulations and laws
could have a material adverse effect on the electric power generation and distribution businesses of the Company’s subsidiaries and on the Company’s consolidated results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

International

In July 2003, the European Community “Directive 2003/87/EC on Greenhouse Gas Emission Allowance Trading” was created, which requires member states to limit emissions of CO2from large industrial sources within their countries. To do so, member
states are required to implement EC-approved national allocation plans (“NAPs”). Under the NAPs, member states are responsible for allocating limited CO2allowances within their borders. Directive 2003/87/EC does not dictate how these allocations are to be made, and NAPs that
have been submitted thus far have varied in their allocation methodologies. For these and other reasons, uncertainty remains with respect to the implementation of the European Union Emissions Trading System (“EU ETS”) that commenced in
January 2005. The European Union has announced that it intends to keep the EU ETS in place after 2012, even if the Kyoto Protocol is not extended or replaced by another agreement. The Company’s subsidiaries operate eight electric power
generation facilities, and another subsidiary has one under construction, within six member states which have adopted NAPs to implement Directive 2003/87/EC. At this time, the







Company cannot determine fully whether achieving and maintaining compliance with the NAPs to which its subsidiaries are subject will have a material impact on its consolidated operations or
results. The risk and benefit associated with achieving compliance with applicable NAPs at several facilities of the Company’s subsidiaries are not the responsibility of the Company’s subsidiaries, as they are subject to contractual
provisions that transfer the costs associated with compliance to contract counterparties. However, one such contract counterparty, GDF-Suez, is currently disputing these provisions with AES Energia Cartagena S.R.L. The matter has been submitted to
arbitration and the parties are currently awaiting a decision. See Item 3.—Legal Proceedings in this Form 10-K for more detail regarding this dispute. In connection with this dispute or any similar dispute that might arise with other
contract counterparties, there can be no assurance that the Company and/or the relevant subsidiary would prevail, or that the failure to prevail in any such dispute will not have a material adverse effect on the Company and its financial condition
or consolidated results of operations. Certain of the Company’s subsidiaries will bear some or all of the risk and benefit associated with compliance with applicable NAPs at certain facilities. Based upon anticipated operations, CO


emission allowance allocations, and the costs to acquire offsets and
emission allowances for compliance purposes, the Company has not to-date incurred material costs to comply with Directive 2003/87/EC and applicable NAPs; however, there can be no guarantees that compliance will not have a material adverse effect on
our business in future periods.

Legislative efforts at the EU have produced a “Climate Change Package.” This
package consists of three directives—Carbon Capture & Storage, an amended EU ETS and a revised Renewables Directive. The amended EU ETS and Renewable Directives have now been approved by the EU Parliament and they will enter into force
with respect to individual EU member states upon adoption by each such country of implementing legislation or regulations. The main objectives of the Climate Change Package are usually referred to as the “20-20-20” goals:



•A 20% reduction in EU GHG emissions by 2020, as compared with 1990 levels, or 30% if other developed nations agree to take similar action by 2020;



•The EU ETS caps on emissions allowances is designed to deliver 21% GHG reduction by 2020 compared to 2005 levels, with distribution of allowances
skewed in favor of member states with lower GDP, and with the potential for auctioning to be phased in for affected facilities;



•20% increase in energy efficiency; and



•Minimum compulsory 10% target for renewable energy by 2020.

Progress in implementation of the directives referred to above varies from member state to member state, and many states have not yet adopted any implementing legislation or regulations. AES generation
businesses in each member state will be required to comply with the relevant measures taken to implement the directives.

On February 16, 2005, the Kyoto Protocol became effective. The Kyoto Protocol requires the industrialized countries that have ratified it to significantly reduce their GHG emissions, including
CO








Even though it has been announced that the EU ETS will remain in place even if the Kyoto
Protocol expires at the end of 2012 without any successor agreement or commitment on GHG emissions reductions, there remains significant uncertainty with respect to the implementation of NAPs post-2012. The EU has indicated that a portion of the
emission allowances given to member states will need to be auctioned under the NAPs and the Company cannot predict with any certainty if compliance with such programs will have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial condition or
results of operations.

Countries in Latin America, Asia and Africa in which subsidiaries of the Company
operate may also choose to adopt regulations that directly or indirectly regulate GHG emissions from power plants. For a discussion of regulations in individual countries where our subsidiaries operate, see Item 1. Business—Regulatory
Matters in this Form 10-K. Although the Company does not currently believe that the laws and regulations pertaining to GHG emissions that have been adopted to date in countries in Latin America, Asia and Africa in which subsidiaries of the Company
operate will have a material impact on the Company, the Company cannot predict with any certainty if future laws and regulations in these countries regarding CO2emissions will have a material adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated financial condition or results of
operations.

United States—Federal Legislation and Regulation

Currently, in the United States there is no Federal legislation establishing mandatory GHG emissions reduction
programs (including CO2) affecting the electric power
generation facilities of the Company’s subsidiaries. There are numerous state programs regulating GHG emissions from electric power generation facilities and there is a possibility that federal GHG legislation will be enacted within the next
several years. Further, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) has adopted regulations pertaining to GHG emissions and has announced its intention to propose new regulations for electric generating units under
Section 111 of the United States Clean Air Act (“CAA”).

Potential United States Federal GHG
Legislation. Federal legislation passed the United States House of Representatives in 2009 that, if adopted, would impose a nationwide cap-and-trade program to reduce GHG emissions. In the United States Senate, several different draft bills
pertaining to GHG legislation have been considered at various times since then, including comprehensive GHG legislation similar to the legislation that passed the United States House of Representatives and more limited legislation focusing only on
the utility and electric generation industry. It is uncertain whether any such legislation or new legislation pertaining to GHG emissions will be voted on or passed by the Senate. If any legislation is passed by the Senate, it is uncertain whether
such legislation will be reconciled with the House of Representatives’ legislation and ultimately enacted into law. However, if any such legislation is enacted, the impact could be material to the Company.

EPA GHG Regulation. The EPA promulgated regulations governing GHG emissions from automobiles under the CAA. The effect of the
EPA’s regulation of GHG emissions from mobile sources is that certain provisions of the CAA will also apply to GHG emissions from existing stationary sources, including many United States power plants. Beginning on January 2, 2011,
construction of new stationary sources and modifications to existing stationary sources that result in increased GHG emissions became subject to permitting requirements under the prevention of significant deterioration (“PSD”) program of
the CAA. The PSD program, as currently applicable to GHG emissions, requires sources that emit above a certain threshold of GHGs to obtain PSD permits prior to commencement of new construction or modifications to existing facilities. In
addition, major sources of GHG emissions may be required to amend, or obtain new, Title V air permits under the CAA to reflect any new applicable GHG emissions requirements for new construction or for modifications to existing facilities.

The EPA promulgated a final rule on June 3, 2010, (the “Tailoring Rule”) that sets thresholds for GHG
emissions that would trigger PSD permitting requirements. The Tailoring Rule, which became effective in January of 2011, provides that sources already subject to PSD permitting requirements need to install Best Available Control Technology
(“BACT”) for greenhouse gases if a proposed modification would result in the







increase of more than 75,000 tons per year of GHG emissions. Also, under the Tailoring Rule, commencing in July of 2011, any new sources of GHG emissions that would emit over 100,000 tons per
year of GHG emissions, in addition to any modification that would result in GHG emissions exceeding 75,000 tons per year, would require PSD review and be subject to related permitting requirements. The EPA anticipates that it will adjust downward
the permitting thresholds of 100,000 tons and 75,000 tons for new sources and modifications, respectively, in future rulemaking actions. The Tailoring Rule substantially reduces the number of sources subject to PSD requirements for GHG emissions and
the number of sources required to obtain Title V air permits, although new thermal power plants may still be subject to PSD and Title V requirements because annual GHG emissions from such plants typically far exceed the 100,000 ton threshold noted
above. The 75,000 ton threshold for increased GHG emissions from modifications to existing sources may reduce the likelihood that future modifications to plants owned by some of our United States subsidiaries would trigger PSD
requirements, although some projects that would expand capacity or electric output are likely to exceed this threshold, and in any such cases the capital expenditures necessary to comply with the PSD requirements could be significant.

In December 2010, the EPA entered into a settlement agreement with several states and environmental groups to resolve a
petition for review challenging EPA’s new source performance standards (“NSPS”) rulemaking for electric utility steam generating units (“EUSGUs”) based on the NSPS’s failure to address GHG emissions. Under the
settlement agreement, the EPA has committed to propose GHG emissions standards for EUSGUs by July 26, 2011 and to finalize GHG emissions standards for EUSGUs by May 26, 2012. The NSPS will establish GHG emission standards for newly
constructed and reconstructed EUSGUs. The NSPS also will establish guidelines regarding the best system for achieving further GHG emissions reductions from EUSGUs and, based on such guidelines, individual states will be required to submit a plan to
the EPA to establish GHG emission standards for existing EUSGUs within their state. It is impossible to estimate the impact and compliance cost associated with any future NSPS applicable to EUSGUs until such regulations are finalized. However, the
compliance costs could have a material and adverse impact on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations.

United States—State Legislation and Regulation

Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative. The primary regulation of GHG emissions affecting the United States plants
of the Company’s subsidiaries has been through the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (“RGGI”). Under RGGI, ten Northeastern States have coordinated to establish rules that require reductions in CO2emissions from power plant operations within those states through a
cap-and-trade program. States participating in RGGI in which our subsidiaries have generating facilities include Connecticut, Maryland, New York and New Jersey. Under RGGI, power plants must acquire one carbon allowance through auction or in the
emission trading markets for each ton of CO2emitted. We have
estimated the costs to the Company of compliance with RGGI could be approximately $15 million for 2011. The initial three-year compliance period for RGGI expires at the end of 2011 and revisions to RGGI for 2012 and thereafter are currently under
discussion. While these estimated compliance costs are not material to the Company, changes in the regulations or price of allowances under RGGI could have a material and adverse impact on our operations and financial performance.

The Company’s Eastern Energy business is located in New York. Under the New York RGGI rule, each budgeted source
of CO2emissions is required to surrender one CO2allowance for each metric tonne of CO2emitted during a three-year compliance period. All fossil fuel powered
generating facilities in New York that have a generating capacity of 25 or more MW are subject to the rule. Eastern Energy secures its allowance requirements from the RGGI allowance auction or through the secondary market.

The Company’s Thames business is located in Connecticut. The state of Connecticut passed legislation, effective
July 1, 2007, which requires that the Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection develop necessary regulations to implement RGGI. The regulations adopted to implement RGGI include an auction of CO2emission allowances except for several set-aside accounts. AES Thames is
eligible for a set-aside for the first compliance period, 2009-2011, which allows CO2allowances to be purchased at $2 per allowance in 2009,







and $2 per allowance plus a consumer price indexing in years 2010 and 2011. During 2010, a similar $2 per allowance provision for the second compliance period, 2012-2014, was enacted by the
Connecticut legislature for contracted facilities.

The Company’s Warrior Run business is located in
Maryland. In April 2006, the Maryland General Assembly passed the Maryland Healthy Air Act which, among other things, required the State of Maryland to join RGGI. The Maryland Department of Environment (“MDE”) adopted regulations that
require 100% of the allowances the State receives to be auctioned except for several small allowance set-aside accounts. The MDE regulations include a safety valve to control the economic impact of the CO2cap-and-trade program. If the auction closing price reaches $7, up to
50% of a year’s allowances will be reserved for purchase by electric power generation facilities located within Maryland at $7 per allowance, regardless of auction prices. Warrior Run continues to secure its allowance requirements through the
RGGI allowance auction.

The Company’s Red Oak business is located in New Jersey. The State of New
Jersey adopted the Global Warming Response Act in July 2007, which established goals for the reduction of GHG emissions in the State. In furtherance of these goals, in January 2008, additional state legislation authorized the New Jersey Department
of Environmental Protection (“NJDEP”) to develop and adopt RGGI regulations and the NJDEP RGGI regulations became effective in 2008. Under the terms of Red Oak’s tolling agreement, RGGI CO2compliance costs are passed through to its power offtaker.

In 2010, of the approximately 40 million metric tonnes of CO


emitted in the United States by the businesses operated by our
subsidiaries (ownership adjusted), approximately 11.3 million metric tonnes were emitted in states participating in RGGI. Over the past three years, such emissions have averaged approximately 10.9 million metric tonnes. While CO


emissions from businesses operated by subsidiaries of the Company are
calculated globally in metric tonnes, RGGI allowances are denominated in short tons. (1 metric tonne equals 2,200 pounds and 1 short ton equals 2,000 pounds.) For forecasting purposes, the Company has modeled the impact of CO


compliance based on a three-year average of CO


emissions for its businesses that are subject to RGGI and that may not
be able to pass through compliance costs. The model includes a conversion from metric tonnes to short tons, as well as the impact of some market recovery by merchant plants and contractual and regulatory provisions. The model also utilizes a price
of $1.86 per allowance under RGGI. The source of this allowance price estimate was the clearing price in the most recent RGGI allowance auction held in December 2010. Based on these assumptions, the Company estimates that the RGGI compliance costs
could be approximately $15 million for 2011, which is the last year of the first RGGI compliance period. Given the fact that the assumptions utilized in the model may prove to be incorrect, there is a significant risk that our actual compliance
costs under RGGI will differ from our estimates by a material amount and that our model could underestimate our costs of compliance.

California.The Company’s Southland and Placerita businesses are located in California. On September 27, 2006, the Governor of California signed the Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006,
also called Assembly Bill 32 (“A.B. 32”). A.B. 32 directs the California Air Resources Board (“CARB”) to promulgate regulations that will require the reduction of CO


and other GHG emissions to 1990 levels by 2020. On October 29, 2010, CARB released the design of its GHG
cap-and-trade program and on December 16, 2010 voted 9-1 to approve the plan. The plan begins with Phase I in 2012, and initially covers emissions from electricity generating facilities, large industrial sources with annual emissions greater
than 25,000 tons, and imported electricity. Emitters will be required to hold enough allowances to match their emissions and can comply by reducing their emissions or by purchasing tradable allowances from other emitters or at state-run auctions.
Companies that reduce their emissions below the allowances they hold have the opportunity to sell unused allowances. Initially, retail utilities will be issued free allowances and merchant facilities will be required to bid for allowances at
auctions. There is a floor price of $10 for all allowances purchased at auctions. The number of free allowances will decline in Phase II and will further decline when Phase III begins in 2018. CARB will continue to refine certain elements of the
cap-and-trade program and further define important provisions, such as allocations in early 2011, through CARB’s “15 day notice” procedure, whereby changes to adopted regulations are recommended by CARB staff







and subject to a 15-day public comment period. The Company believes that any compliance costs arising from A.B. 32 for the thermal power plants of its subsidiaries operating in California will be
borne by the power offtaker under the terms of existing tolling agreements with the offtaker and under the terms of A.B. 32. However, after the expiration of such tolling agreements, if the Company’s subsidiaries were to sell power on a
merchant basis then such compliance costs could be borne by the subsidiaries.

Western Climate Initiative (WCI).In
February 2007, the governors of the Western United States states (Arizona, New Mexico, California, Washington and Oregon) established the WCI. The WCI has since been joined by two other states (Montana and Utah) and four Canadian provinces (British
Columbia, Manitoba, Ontario, and Quebec). Participating states and provinces have agreed to cut GHG emissions to 15% below 2005 levels by 2020, and they are considering the implementation of a cap-and-trade program for the electricity industry to
achieve this reduction. On September 23, 2008, the WCI issued its design recommendations for a cap-and-trade program that would apply to in-state electricity generators and the first jurisdictional deliverer of electricity into a WCI partner
state. The WCI issued draft guidance on the creation of cap-and-trade allowance budgets on November 29, 2009. The draft guidance contemplates an eventual cap-and-trade program with flexible mechanisms, such as allowance banking and offsets. The
final regulatory design of this program is not yet known.

Midwestern Greenhouse Gas Reduction Accord (MGGRA).The
Company owns the utility IPL, which is located in Indiana. On November 15, 2007, six Midwestern state governors (including the Governor of Indiana) and the premier of Manitoba signed the Midwestern Greenhouse Gas Reduction Accord
(“MGGRA”), committing the participating states and province to reduce GHG emissions through the implementation of a cap-and-trade program. Three states (including Indiana) and the province of Ontario have signed as observers. In May of
2010, the MGGRA Advisory Group finalized a set of recommendations for the establishment of targets for emissions reductions in the region and for the design of a regional cap-and-trade program. These include a recommended reduction in GHG emissions
of 20% below 2005 emission levels by 2025. The recommendations are from the advisory group only, and have not been endorsed or approved by individual governors, including the Governor of Indiana. If Indiana were to implement the recommended
reduction targets, the impact on the Company’s consolidated results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows could be material.

Hawaii. The Company owns a power generation facility in Hawaii. On June 30, 2007, the Governor of Hawaii signed Act 234 which sets a goal of reducing GHG emissions to at or below 1990 levels
by January 1, 2020. Act 234 also established the Greenhouse Gas Emissions Reduction Task Force, which is tasked with developing measures to meet Hawaii’s GHG emissions reduction goal. The Task Force filed a report to the Hawaii Legislature
on December 30, 2009, strongly supporting the Hawaii Clean Energy Initiative, which calls for additional renewable energy development, increased energy efficiency, and incorporates already-enacted renewable portfolio standards. The Task Force
also evaluated other mechanisms and concluded that a state-level cap-and-trade program is inappropriate due to the small size of Hawaii’s economy.

At this time, other than the estimated impact of CO2compliance noted above for certain of its businesses that are subject to RGGI, the Company has not estimated the costs of compliance with other potential United States federal, state or regional
CO2emissions reduction legislation or initiatives, such as
A.B. 32, WCI, MGGRA and potential Hawaii regulations, due to the fact that most of these proposals are in the early stages of development and any final regulations or laws, if adopted, could vary drastically from current proposals. Although complete
specific implementation measures for any federal regulations, A.B. 32, WCI, MGGRA and the Hawaiian regulations have yet to be finalized, if these GHG-related initiatives are finalized they may affect a number of the Company’s United States
subsidiaries unless they are preempted by federal GHG legislation. Any federal, state or regional legislation or regulations adopted in the United States that would require the reduction of GHG emissions could have a material adverse effect on the
Company’s consolidated results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.







The possible impact of any future federal GHG legislation or regulations or any regional or
state proposal will depend on various factors, including but not limited to:



•the geographic scope of legislation and/or regulation (e.g., federal, regional, state), which entities are subject to the legislation and/or
regulation (e.g., electricity generators, load-serving entities, electricity deliverers, etc.), the enactment date of the legislation and/or regulation and the compliance deadlines set forth therein;



•the level of reductions of
CO2being sought by the regulation and/or legislation
(e.g., 10%, 20%, 50%, etc.) and the year selected as a baseline for determining the amount or percentage of mandated
CO2reduction (e.g., 10% reduction from 1990 CO2emission levels, 20% reduction from 2000 CO2emission levels, etc.);



•the legislative and/or regulatory structure (e.g., a CO2cap-and-trade program, a carbon tax, CO2emission limits, etc.);



•in any cap-and-trade program, the mechanism used to determine the price of emission allowances or offsets to be auctioned by designated governmental
authorities or representatives;



•the price of offsets and emission allowances in the secondary market, including any price floors or price caps on the costs of offsets and emission
allowances;



•the operation of and emissions from regulated units;



•the permissibility of using offsets to meet reduction requirements and the requirements of such offsets (e.g., type of offset projects allowed,
the amount of offsets that can be used for compliance purposes, any geographic limitations regarding the origin or location of creditable offset projects), as well as the methods required to determine whether the offsets have resulted in reductions
in GHG emissions and that those reductions are permanent (i.e., the verification method);



•whether the use of proceeds of any auction conducted by responsible governmental authorities is reinvested in developing new energy technologies, is
used to offset any cost impact on certain energy consumers or is used to address issues unrelated to power;



•how the price of electricity is determined at the affected businesses, including whether the price includes any costs resulting from any new CO2legislation and the potential to transfer compliance costs pursuant to
legislation, market or contract, to other parties;



•any impact on fuel demand and volatility that may affect the market clearing price for power;



•the effects of any legislation or regulation on the operation of power generation facilities that may in turn affect reliability;



•the availability and cost of carbon control technology;



•the extent to which existing contractual arrangements transfer compliance costs to power offtakers or other contractual counterparties of our
subsidiaries;



•whether legislation regulating GHG emissions will preclude EPA from regulating GHG emissions under the Clean Air Act or preempt private nuisance suits
or other litigation by third parties; and



•any opportunities to change the use of fuel at the generation facilities of our subsidiaries or opportunities to increase efficiency.

Other United States Air Emissions Regulations and Legislation.In the United
States the CAA and various state laws and regulations regulate emissions of air pollutants, including SO2, NOX,
particulate matter (“PM”), mercury and other hazardous air pollutants (“HAPs”). The applicable rules and the steps taken by the Company to comply with the rules are discussed in further detail below.







The EPA promulgated the “Clean Air Interstate Rule”
(“CAIR”) on March 10, 2005, which required allowance surrender for SO2and NOXemissions from existing power plants located in 28 eastern states and the District of Columbia. CAIR was subsequently challenged in federal court, and on July 11, 2008, the United States Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit issued an opinion
striking down much of CAIR and remanding it to the EPA.

In response to the D.C. Circuit’s opinion,
on July 6, 2010, the EPA issued a new proposed rule (the “Clean Air Transport Rule”) to replace CAIR. The final Clean Air Transport Rule (“Transport Rule”) is scheduled to be issued by July 2011. The Transport Rule would
require significant additional reductions in SO2and
NOXemissions in 31 states and the District of Columbia starting in 2012, including several states where subsidiaries of the
Company conduct business.

The Transport Rule contemplates three possible options for reducing SO2and NOXemissions in the designated states. The EPA’s preferred option contemplates a set limit or budget on SO2and NOXemissions for each of the states, with limited interstate trading of emissions allowances and unlimited intrastate trading
of SO2and NOXemissions allowances. Affected power plants would receive emissions
allowances based on the applicable state emissions budgets. The EPA’s second option under the Transport Rule would establish emission budgets for each state, but only allow intrastate trading of emissions allowances. The final option would set
emission rate limitations for each power plant, but would allow for some intrastate averaging of emission rates. Under any of the proposed options, additional pollution control technology may be required by some of our subsidiaries, and the cost of
implementing any such technology could affect the financial condition or results of operations of these subsidiaries or the parent company. The EPA has received public comments on the Transport Rule, and such public comments will be considered by
the EPA prior to promulgating a final rule.

On December 23, 2009, the New York State Department of
Environmental Conservation (“NYSDEC”) published and enacted a rulemaking requiring the application of Reasonably Available Control Technology (“RACT”) for reductions in NOXemissions from electric utility and industrial boilers, combustion turbines and internal combustion engines. The
regulations establish that sources subject to the new emission limits must provide a compliance plan by January 1, 2012 and demonstrate compliance by July 1, 2014.

In July 1999, the EPA published the “Regional Haze Rule” to reduce haze and protect visibility in designated federal areas. On June 15, 2005, the EPA proposed amendments to the Regional
Haze Rule that, among other things, set guidelines for determining when to require the installation of “best available retrofit technology” (“BART”) at older plants. The amendment to the Regional Haze Rule required states to
consider the







visibility impacts of the haze produced by an individual facility, in addition to other factors, when determining whether that facility must install potentially costly emissions controls. States
were required to submit their regional haze state implementation plans (“SIPs”) to the EPA by December 2007, but only 13 states met this deadline. The EPA has yet to approve any state’s Regional Haze state implementation plan. The
statute requires compliance within five years after the EPA approves the relevant SIP, although individual states may impose more stringent compliance schedules.

Other International Air Emissions Regulations and Legislation.In Europe, the Company is, and will continue to
be, required to reduce air emissions from our facilities to comply with applicable EC Directives, including Directive 2001/80/EC on the limitation of emissions of certain pollutants into the air from large combustion plants (the “LCPD”),
which sets emission limit values for NOX, SO2, and particulate matter for large-scale industrial combustion plants for
all member states. Until June 2004, existing coal plants could “opt-in” or “opt-out” of the LCPD emissions standards. Those plants that opted out will be required to cease all operations by 2015 and may not operate for more than
20,000 hours after 2008. Those that opted-in, like the Company’s Kilroot facility in the United Kingdom, must invest in abatement technology to achieve specific SO2reductions. Kilroot installed a new flue gas desulphurization system in the second quarter of 2009 in order to satisfy
SO2reduction requirements. The Company’s other coal
plants in Europe are either exempt from the Directive due to their size or have opted-in but will not require any additional abatement technology to comply with the LCPD.

In November 2010, the Council of the EU approved a revised directive on industrial emissions so as to reduce
emissions of pollutants that are alleged to be harmful to the environment and associated with cancer, asthma and acid rain. The industrial emissions directive seeks to prevent and control air, water and soil pollution by industrial installations. It
regulates emissions of a wide range of pollutants, including sulphur and nitrogen compounds, dust particles, asbestos and heavy metals. The directive is aimed at improving local air, water and soil quality. The review integrates seven directives
into a single legal framework and provides for a more harmonized and rigorous implementation of emissions limits associated with the cleanest available technology, so-called BAT. Deviations from this standard are only permitted where local and
technical characteristics would make it disproportionately costly to comply. The recast also tightens emission limits for
NO

X

, SO


and dust from power plants and large combustion installations in oil
refineries and the metal industry. New plants must apply the cleanest available technology from 2012, four years earlier than initially proposed. Existing plants have to comply with this standard beginning in 2016, though a transition period is
foreseen. Until June 30, 2020, member states may define transitional plans with declining annual caps for
NO

X

, SO


or dust emissions. Where installations are already scheduled to close by
the end of 2023 or operate less than 17,500 hours after 2016, they may not need to upgrade. Member states have two years to implement the Directive. Progress in implementation of the directives referred to above varies from member state to member
state. AES generation businesses in each member state will be required to comply with the relevant measures taken to implement the directives.

On January 18 2011, the President of Chile approved a new air emissions regulation submitted to him by the national environmental regulatory agency (“CONAMA”). The new regulation
establishes limits on emissions of NOX, SO2, metals and particulate matter for both existing and new thermal power
plants, with more stringent limitations on new facilities. The regulation will become effective upon approval of the General Comptroller of Chile. The regulation will require AES Gener, our Chilean subsidiary, to install emissions reduction
equipment at its existing thermal plants from late 2011 through 2015. The exact costs of compliance with such regulation have not yet been determined and the Company believes some of the compliance costs are contractually passed through to
counterparties. However, the compliance costs could be material.

Water Discharges.The Company’s facilities are
subject to a variety of rules governing water discharges. In particular, the Company is subject to the United States Clean Water Act Section 316(b) rule regarding existing power plant cooling water intake structures issued by the EPA in 2005
(69 Fed. Reg. 41579, July 9, 2004), and the subsequent Circuit Court of Appeals decision and Supreme Court decision regarding this rule. The rule as originally issued could affect 12 of the Company’s United States power plants and the
rule’s requirements would







Waste Management.







Existing impoundments would also be required to be retrofitted with composite liners and would likely be phased out over several years. This option would not contain federal or state permitting
requirements. The primary enforcement mechanism under regulation pursuant to Subtitle D would be private lawsuits.

The public
comment period for this proposed regulation has expired, and EPA is required to consider the public comments prior to promulgating a final rule. Requirements under a final rule are expected to become effective by January 2012, with a compliance
schedule of five years. While the exact impact and compliance cost associated with future regulations of CCB cannot be established until such regulations are finalized, there can be no assurance that the Company’s businesses, financial
condition or results of operations would not be materially and adversely affected by such regulations.

Subsequent
Events

Subsequent to December 31, 2010, the Company continued to repurchase stock under the stock repurchase
program announced on July 7, 2010. The Company has repurchased 1,026,610 shares at a cost of $13 million in 2011, bringing the cumulative total through February 22, 2010 to 9,409,435 shares at a total cost of $112 million (average price of
$11.92 per share including commissions). As of February 25, 2011, $388 million of the $500 million authorized remained available under the stock repurchase program. For additional information, see Note 14—Equity.

On February 1, 2011, AES Thames, LLC (“Thames”), our 208 MW coal-fired plant in Connecticut, filed petitions for
bankruptcy protection under Chapter 11 in the U. S. Bankruptcy Court. The bankruptcy is due, in part, to the increased cost of energy production. The bankruptcy protection is not expected to have a material impact on the Company’s
financial position or the results of operations.
