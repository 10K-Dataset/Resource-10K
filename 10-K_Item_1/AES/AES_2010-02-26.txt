ITEM 1.BUSINESS

Overview

We are a global power company. We own a portfolio of electricity generation and distribution businesses
on five continents in 29 countries, with total capacity of approximately 40,300 Megawatts (“MW”) and distribution networks serving over 11 million people as of December 31, 2009. In addition, we have more than 2,200 MW under
construction in six countries. Our global workforce of 27,000 people provides electricity to people in diverse markets ranging from urban centers in the United States to remote villages in India. We were incorporated in Delaware in 1981 and for
almost three decades we have been committed to providing safe and reliable energy.

We own and operate two primary types of
businesses. The first is our Generation business, where we own and/or operate power plants to generate and sell power to wholesale customers such as utilities and other intermediaries. The second is our Utilities business, where we own and/or
operate utilities to distribute, transmit and sell electricity to end-user customers in the residential, commercial, industrial and governmental sectors within a defined service area.

Our assets are diverse with respect to fuel source and type of market, which helps reduce certain types of operating risk. Our portfolio
employs a broad range of fuels, including coal, gas, fuel oil, biomass and renewable sources such as hydroelectric power, wind and solar, which reduces the risks associated with dependence on any one fuel source. Our presence in mature markets helps
reduce the volatility associated with our businesses in faster-growing emerging markets. In addition, our Generation portfolio is largely contracted, which reduces the risk related to market prices of electricity and fuel. We also attempt to limit
risk by hedging much of our interest rate and commodity risk, and by matching the currency of most of our subsidiary debt to the revenue of the underlying business. However, our business is still subject to these and other risks, which are further
disclosed in Item 1A.—Risk Factors of this Form 10-K.

Our goal is to maximize value for our shareholders
through continued focus on increasing the profitability of our existing portfolio and increasing free cash flow while managing our risk and employing rigorous capital allocation. We will continue to seek prudent expansion of our traditional
Generation and Utilities lines of business, along with expansion of wind, solar and energy storage, through acquisitions or greenfield developments. Portfolio management remains an area of focus through which we have sold and will continue to sell
or monetize a portion of certain businesses or assets when market values appear attractive. Furthermore, we will continue to focus on improving our business operations and management processes, including our internal controls over financial
reporting.

Key Lines of Business

AES’ primary sources of revenue and gross margin today are from Generation and Utilities. These businesses are distinguished by the nature of the customers, operational differences, cost structure,
regulatory environment and risk exposure. The breakout of revenue and gross margin between Generation and Utilities for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively is shown below. Operating results for integrated utilities,
which have both Utilities and Generation, are reflected in the Utilities amounts below.







Revenue

($ in billions)



Gross Margin

($ in billions)





(1)Utilities gross margin includes the margin from generation businesses owned by the Company and from whom the utility purchases energy.

Generation

We currently own or operate a portfolio of approximately 34,000 MW, excluding the generation capabilities of our integrated utilities, consisting of 99 Generation facilities in 26 countries on five continents at our generation
businesses. We also have approximately 1,900 MW of capacity currently under construction in four countries. We are a major power source in many countries, such as Panama where we are the largest generator of electricity, and Chile, where AES
Gener (“Gener”) is the second largest electricity generation company in terms of capacity. Our Generation business uses a wide range of technologies and fuel types including coal, combined-cycle gas turbines, hydroelectric power and
biomass. Generation revenue was $6.3 billion, $7.6 billion and $6.2 billion for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively.

Performance drivers for our Generation businesses include, among other factors, plant reliability, fuel costs, power prices, volume and fixed-cost management. Growth in the Generation business is largely
tied to securing new power purchase agreements (“PPAs”), expanding capacity in our existing facilities and building or acquiring new power plants.







The majority of the electricity produced by our Generation businesses is sold under
long-term contracts, or PPAs, to wholesale customers. In 2009, approximately 65% of the revenue from our Generation business was from plants that operate under PPAs of three years or longer for 75% or more of their output capacity. These businesses
often reduce their exposure to fuel supply risks by entering into long-term fuel supply contracts or fuel tolling arrangements where the customer assumes full responsibility for purchasing and supplying the fuel to the power plant. These long-term
contractual agreements result in relatively predictable cash flows and earnings and reduce exposure to volatility in the market price for electricity and fuel; however, the amount of earnings and cash flow predictability varies from business to
business based on the degree to which its exposure is limited by the contracts it has negotiated.

Our Generation businesses
with long-term contracts face most of their competition from other utilities and independent power producers (“IPPs”) prior to the execution of a power sales agreement during the development phase of a project or upon expiration of an
existing agreement. Once a project is operational, we traditionally have faced limited competition due to the long-term nature of the generation contracts. However, as our existing contracts expire, the introduction of new power markets has
increased competition to attract new customers and maintain our current customer base.

The balance of our Generation business
sells power through competitive markets under short-term contracts, directly in the spot market or, in some cases, at regulated prices. As a result, the cash flows and earnings associated with these businesses are more sensitive to fluctuations in
the market price for electricity, natural gas, coal and other fuels. However, for a number of these facilities, including our plants in New York, which include a fleet of coal-fired plants, we have hedged a portion of our exposure to fuel, energy
and emissions pricing for 2010. Competitive factors for these facilities include price, reliability, operational cost and third party credit requirements.

Utilities

AES utility businesses distribute power to over 11 million
people in seven countries on five continents and consist primarily of 14 companies owned or operated under management agreements, each of which operate in defined service areas. These businesses also include 15 generation plants in two countries
with generation capacity totaling approximately 4,600 MW. These businesses have a variety of structures ranging from pure distribution businesses to fully integrated utilities, which generate, transmit and distribute power. Indianapolis
Power & Light (“IPL”) has the exclusive right to provide retail services to approximately 470,000 customers in Indianapolis, Indiana. Eletropaulo Metropolitana Electricidad de São Paulo S.A (“AES Eletropaulo” or
“Eletropaulo”), serving the São Paulo metropolitan region for over 100 years, has approximately six million customers and is the largest electricity distribution company in Brazil in terms of revenue and electricity
distributed. In Cameroon, we are the primary generator and distributor of electricity and in El Salvador we provide distribution services to serve more than 76% of the country’s electricity customers. Utilities revenue was $7.8 billion,
$7.8 billion and $6.9 billion for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively.

Performance
drivers for Utilities include, but are not limited to, reliability of service; management of working capital; negotiation of tariff adjustments; compliance with extensive regulatory requirements; and in developing countries, reduction of commercial
and technical losses. The results of operations of our Utilities businesses are sensitive to changes in economic growth and regulation and variations in weather conditions in the areas in which they operate.

Utilities face relatively little direct competition due to significant barriers to entry which are present in these markets. In certain
locations, our distribution businesses face increased competition as a result of changes in laws and regulations which allow wholesale and retail services to be provided on a competitive basis. Competition is a factor in efforts to acquire existing
businesses. In this arena, we compete against a number of other market participants, some of which have greater financial resources, have been engaged in distribution related businesses for longer periods of time and/or have accumulated more
significant portfolios. Relevant competitive factors for







our power distribution businesses include financial resources, governmental assistance, regulatory restrictions and access to non-recourse financing.

Renewables and Other Initiatives

Risks

We routinely encounter and address risks, some of which may cause our future results to be different, sometimes materially different, than we
presently anticipate. The categories of risk we have identified in Item 1A.—Risk Factors of this Form 10-K include the following:



•Risks associated with our disclosure controls and internal controls over financial reporting;



•Risks associated with our high levels of indebtedness;



•Risks associated with our ability to raise needed capital;



•Risks associated with revenue and earnings volatility;



•Risks associated with our operations; and



•Risks associated with governmental regulation and laws.

The categories of risk identified above are discussed and explained in greater detail in Item 1A.—Risk Factors of this
Form 10-K. These risk factors should be read in conjunction with Item 7.—Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, and the Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes included
elsewhere in this report.

Our Organization and Segments

We believe our broad geographic footprint allows us to focus development in targeted markets with opportunities for new investment, and
provides stability through our presence in more developed regions. In addition, our presence in each region affords us important relationships and helps us identify local markets with attractive opportunities for new investment. As a result, we have
structured our organization into geographic regions, and each region is led by a regional president responsible for managing existing businesses. The regional presidents report to our Chief Operating Officer (“COO”), who in turn reports to
our Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”). Both our CEO and COO are based in Arlington, Virginia.







The Company’s segment reporting structure is organized along our two lines of business
(Generation and Utilities) and three regions: (1) Latin America & Africa; (2) North America; and (3) Europe, Middle East & Asia (collectively “EMEA”), which reflects how the Company manages the business
internally. Additionally, AES Wind Generation is managed within our North America region. For financial reporting purposes, the Company has six reportable segments which include:



•Latin America—Generation;



•Latin America—Utilities;



•North America—Generation;



•North America—Utilities;



•Europe—Generation;



•Asia—Generation.

Corporate and Other—The Company’s Europe Utilities, Africa Utilities, Africa Generation and AES Wind Generation businesses as well as the Company’s solar, climate solutions and
energy storage initiatives are reported within “Corporate and Other” because they do not require separate disclosure under segment reporting accounting guidance. See Item 7.—Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition for further discussion of the Company’s segment structure used for financial reporting purposes.

North America Utilities.AES has one integrated utility in North America, IPL, which it
owns through IPALCO Enterprises Inc. (“IPALCO”), the parent holding company of IPL. IPL generates, transmits, distributes and sells electricity to approximately 470,000 customers in the city of Indianapolis and neighboring areas
within the state of Indiana. IPL owns and operates four generation facilities that provide more than 95% of the electricity it distributes. Two of the generation facilities are coal-fired plants. The third facility has a combination of units that
use coal (base load capacity) and natural gas and/or oil (peaking capacity). The fourth facility is a small peaking station that uses gas-fired combustion turbine technology. IPL’s gross generation capacity is 3,699 MW. Approximately 40% of
IPL’s coal is provided by one supplier with which IPL has long-term contracts. A key driver for the business is tariff recovery for environmental projects through the rate adjustment process. IPL’s customers include residential,
industrial, commercial and all other which made up 37%, 41%, 15% and 7%, respectively, of North America Utilities revenue for 2009.

Europe Generation. Our Generation operations in Europe accounted for 5%, 7% and 7% of our consolidated revenue in 2009, 2008 and
2007, respectively. In 2007, we began commercial operation of AES Cartagena (“Cartagena”), our first power plant in Spain, with 1,219 MW capacity. The results of operations for Cartagena, an unconsolidated entity, are included in the
Equity in Earnings of Affiliates line item on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Today, AES operates four power plants in Kazakhstan which account for 8% of the country’s total installed generation capacity. In May 2008, the Company
completed the sale of two of its wholly-owned subsidiaries in Kazakhstan, AES Ekibastuz LLP (“Ekibastuz”), a coal-fired generation plant, and Maikuben West LLP (“Maikuben”), a coal mine. AES subsidiaries continued to
manage the businesses under a management and operation agreement. In March 2009, the parties agreed to terminate the management and operation agreement effective at the end of the second quarter of 2009. See Note 15—Segment and Geographic
Information in the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for revenue, Adjusted Gross Margin (a non-GAAP measure) and total assets by segment. Key business drivers of this segment are: foreign currency exchange

Regulatory Matters

Overview

In each country where we conduct business, we are subject to extensive and complex governmental regulations which affect most aspects of our business, such as regulations governing the generation and distribution of electricity and
environmental regulations. These regulations affect the operation, development, growth and ownership of our businesses. Regulations differ on a country by country basis and are based upon the type of business we operate in a particular country.

Regulation of our Generation Businesses

Our Generation businesses operate in two different types of regulatory environments:

Market Environments.In market environments, sales of electricity may be made directly on the spot market, under negotiated bilateral contracts, or pursuant to PPAs. The spot markets are typically administered by a central dispatch
or system operator who seeks to optimize the use of the generation resources throughout an interconnected system (cost of the least expensive next generation plant required to meet system demand). The spot price is usually set at the marginal cost
of energy or based on bid prices. In addition, many of these wholesale markets include markets for ancillary services to support the reliable operation of the transmission system, such as regulation (a service that corrects for short-term changes in
electricity use that could impact the stability of the power system). Most of our businesses in Europe, Latin America and the U.S. operate in these types of liberalized markets.

Other Environments.We operate Generation assets in certain countries that do not have a spot market. In these environments,
electricity is sold only through PPAs with state-owned entities and/or industrial clients as the offtaker. Examples of countries where we operate in this type of environment include Jordan, Nigeria, Oman, Pakistan, Puerto Rico, Qatar and Sri Lanka.







Regulation of our Distribution Businesses

In general, our distribution companies sell electricity directly to end users, such as homes and businesses and bill customers directly. The
amount our distribution companies can charge customers for electricity is governed by a regulated tariff. The tariff, in turn, is generally based upon a certain usage level that includes a pass through of costs to the customer that are not
controlled by the distribution company, including the costs of fuel (in the case of integrated utilities) and/or the costs of purchased energy, plus a margin for the value added by the distributor, usually calculated as a fair return on the fair
value of the company’s assets. This regulated tariff is periodically reviewed and reset by the regulatory agency of the government. Components of the tariff that are directly passed through to the customer are usually adjusted through an
automated process. In many instances, the tariffs can be adjusted between scheduled regulatory resets pursuant to an inflation adjustment or another index. Customers with demand above a certain level are often unregulated and can choose to contract
with generation companies directly and pay a wheeling fee, which is a fee to the distribution company for use of the distribution system. Most of our utilities operate as monopolies within exclusive geographic areas set by the regulatory agency and
face very limited competition from other distributors.

Set forth below is a discussion of certain regulations we face in
countries where we do business. In each country, the regulatory environment can pose material risks to our business, its operations and/or its financial condition. For further discussion of those risks, see the Risk Factors in Item 1A. of this
Form 10-K.

Latin America & Africa

Argentina.Argentina has one main national interconnected system. The National Electrical Regulating Agency is responsible for
ensuring transmission and distribution companies comply with the concessions granted by the Argentine government and approving distribution tariffs. The regulatory entity authorized to manage and operate the wholesale electricity market in Argentina
is Compañía Administradora del Mercado Mayorista Eléctrico, Sociedad Anónima, (“CAMMESA”), in coordination with the policies established by the National Secretariat of Energy.

CAMMESA performs load dispatching and clears commercial transactions for energy and power. Sales of electricity may be made on the spot
market at the marginal cost of energy to satisfy the system’s hourly demand, or in the wholesale energy market under negotiated term contracts. As a result of the gas crisis earlier this decade, this mechanism was modified in 2003 by Resolution
240/03. At present, the price is determined as if all generating units in Argentina were operating with natural gas, even though they may be using other, more expensive, alternative fuels. In the case of generators using alternative fuels, CAMMESA
pays the total variable cost of production, which may exceed the established spot price. Additionally, in the spot market, generators are also remunerated for their capacity to generate electricity in excess of supply agreements or private contracts
executed by them.







Secretariat passed Resolution 724, which creates a new mechanism to collect the account receivables generated after the end of the period established for the funding of the combined cycle power
plants mentioned above, by investing a percentage of the funds to be collected. An agreement was executed with the Energy Secretariat in December 2008 which causes the government to pay 65% of account receivables in exchange for the investment
discussed above.

Prior to the Emergency Law, distribution companies were granted long-term concessions (up to 99 years)
which provided, directly or indirectly, tariffs based upon U.S. Dollars and adjusted by the U.S. consumer price index and producer price index. Under the new regulations, tariffs are no longer linked to the U.S. Dollar and U.S. inflation
indices. As a consequence of the emergency declared by the above-mentioned laws and its resulting regulatory framework, the tariffs of all distribution companies were converted to Argentinean Pesos and were frozen at the Argentinean Peso national
rate as of December 31, 2001. In October 2003, the Argentine Congress established a procedure for renegotiation of the public utilities concessions.

On November 12, 2004, EDELAP, an AES distribution business, signed a Letter of Understanding with the Argentine government in order to renegotiate its concession contract and to start a tariff reform
process, which was ratified by the National Congress on May 11, 2005. Final government approval was obtained on July 14, 2005. As a first step during this process, a Distribution Value Added (“DVA”) increase of 28%, effective
February 1, 2005, was granted. On October 24, 2005, EDEN and EDES, two AES distribution businesses, signed a Letter of Understanding with the Ministry of Infrastructure and Public Services of the Province of Buenos Aires to renegotiate
their concession contracts and to start a tariff reform process, which was formally approved on November 30, 2005. An initial 19% DVA increase became effective in August 2005 and an additional 8% DVA increase became effective in January 2007.
On July 31, 2008, ENRE (the national electricity regulatory agency) issued Resolution 324 that granted EDELAP a tariff increase DVA of approximately 18%. Upon execution of these Letters of Understanding, AES agreed to postpone or suspend
certain international claims against the Argentine government. However, these Letters of Understanding provide that if the government does not fulfill its commitments, AES may restart the international claim process. AES has postponed any action
until the tariff reset is finalized.

In addition, the Government established that a process to establish the RTI (integral
tariff reset) should take place during February 2009. In addition, the Government established that a process to establish the RTI (integral tariff reset) will take place during February 2009 and on September 12, 2009 EDELAP submitted the tariff
reset proposal to the ENRE. ENRE is considering the tariff proposals submitted by the federal distribution companies.

On
August 25, 2008, the Province of Buenos Aires issued Decree 1578, which granted EDES a tariff increase DVA of approximately 49%. This decree granted a rise in the tariff at all levels of consumption.

Brazil. Brazil has one main interconnected electricity system, the National Interconnected System. The power industry in
Brazil is regulated by the Brazilian government, acting through the Ministry of Mines and Energy and the National Electric Energy Agency, (“ANEEL”), an independent federal regulatory agency. ANEEL supervises concessions and authorizations
for electricity generation, transmission, trading and distribution, including the setting of tariff rates, and supervising and auditing of concessionaires.

On March 15, 2004, the Brazilian government launched a proposed new model for the Brazilian power sector. The New Power Sector Model created two market environments: (1) the regulated
contractual market for the distribution companies, and (2) the free contract environment market, designed for traders and other large volume users.

Distribution Companies.AES has two distribution businesses in Brazil—AES Eletropaulo, serving approximately six million customers in the São Paulo area, and AES Sul, serving over one
million customers in the state of Rio Grande do Sul. Under the New Power Sector Model, every distribution utility is obligated to contract to meet 100% of its energy requirements in the regulated contractual market, through energy auctions from new
proposed generation projects or existing generation facilities. Bilateral contracts are being honored, but cannot be renewed.







The tariff charged by distribution companies to captive customers is composed of a
non-manageable cost component (Parcel A), which includes energy purchase costs and charges related to the use of transmission and distribution systems and is directly passed through to customers, and a manageable cost component (Parcel B),
which includes operation and maintenance costs based on a reference company (a model distribution company defined by ANEEL), recovery of depreciated assets and a component for the value added by the distributor (calculated as net asset base
multiplied by pre-tax weighted average cost of capital). Parcel B is reset every three to five years depending on the specific concession. There is an annual tariff adjustment to pass through Parcel A costs to customers and to adjust the
Parcel B costs by inflation less an efficiency factor (X-Factor). Distribution companies are also entitled to extraordinary tariff revisions, in the event of significant changes to their cost structure.

On May 16, 2002, ANEEL issued Order 288, a regulation that stipulated the retroactive obligation to the “exposition relief
mechanism,” a tool that forbids the selling of energy from Itaipu Generating Co. (a hydro power plant in Paraguay from which Brazil imports a significant portion of its power) in the spot market and changed the calculation of electricity
pricing in the Brazilian wholesale market. Due to its negative impact, AES Sul filed a lawsuit seeking to annul Order 288, and as soon as the case went to court, AES Sul was granted a preliminary injunction that ordered ANEEL to review the Brazilian
Electric Energy Commercialization Chamber (“CCEE”) calculations and liquidation, an injunction that was later suspended. If AES Sul obtains a favorable final verdict, it will have a positive impact of about R$437.8 million (historic
values referring to 2001 and 2002) or approximately $251.4 million, but if AES Sul’s requests are not granted, under Order 288 AES Sul will owe a net amount of approximately R$142 million or approximately $81.6 million at
December 31, 2009. All amounts are reserved in AES Sul’s books, including the amount owed to CCEE in the event Sul loses the case.

At ANEEL’s Public Meeting on June 30, 2009, AES Eletropaulo was granted a 14.88% average tariff increase, effective on July 4, 2009. The effects of the completion of AES Eletropaulo’s
second tariff reset process, which was provisional since 2007, were reflected in this tariff adjustment process.

On
November 27, 2009, ANEEL initiated a Public Hearing to revise the tariff reset methodology and eliminate effects from market variance on Parcel A costs (purchased energy, transmission costs and sector charges). Current tariff methodology allows
distribution companies to achieve gains or losses depending on market variation. The original concept of the above-mentioned Public Hearing is to neutralize these effects over Parcel A costs. On February 2, 2010 ANEEL approved the amendment of
the Concession Contract, capturing market variance effects only over the sector charges (purchased energy and transmission costs were not affected). AES Eletropaulo and AES Sul will analyze and determine whether they will enter into this amendment.

Additionally ANEEL discussed through the Public Hearing the partition of the extraordinary tariff reset (“RTE”)
between Generation and Distribution companies. The RTE was basically designed to recover revenue losses of Distribution companies and energy purchase costs—called Free Energy—of Generation companies, both during the rationing period which
occurred in 2001 as a result of regulatory, market, and weather related conditions. RTE period of application for AES Eletropaulo was limited to 70 months, which was not sufficient to recover its losses. The Public Hearing process was concluded on
January 12, 2010, generating a negative pre tax impact to AES Eletropaulo of R$6.8 million. The effects of the above mentioned resolution on AES Tietê will only be quantified after ANEEL receives all Free Energy information from
Distribution Companies and releases the consolidated impact.

Generation Companies.AES has two generation businesses
in Brazil—AES Tietê, a 2,651 MW hydro-generation facility and AES Uruguaiana, a 639 MW generation facility. Under the New Power Sector Model and in order to optimize the generation of electricity through Brazil’s nationwide
system, generation plants are allocated a generating capacity referred to as “assured energy” or the amount of energy representing the long-term average energy production of the plant defined by ANEEL. Together with the system operator,
ANEEL establishes the amount of assured energy to be sold by each plant. The system operator determines generation dispatch which takes into account nationwide electricity demand, hydrological conditions and system







constraints. In order to mitigate risks involved in hydroelectric generation, a mechanism is in place to transfer surplus energy from those who generated in excess of their assured energy to
those who generated less than their assured energy. The energy that is reallocated through this mechanism is priced pursuant to an energy optimization tariff, designed to optimize the use of generation available in the system.

AES Tietê is allowed to sell electric power within the two environments, maintaining the competitive nature of the generation. All the
agreements, whether entered in the ACR (Regulated Contracting Environment) or in the ACL (Free Contracting Environment), are registered in the CCEE and they serve as basis for the accounting posting and the settlement of the differences in the
short-term market. Generation companies must provide physical coverage from their own power generation for 100% of their sale contracts. The verification of physical coverage is accomplished on a monthly basis, based on generation data and on sale
company contracts of the last 12 months. The failure to provide physical coverage exposes the generating company to the payment of penalties.

Beginning in 2003, all of AES Tietê’s assured energy has been sold to AES Eletropaulo. The PPA entered into with AES Eletropaulo expires on December 31, 2015, and requires that the price
of energy sold be adjusted annually based on the Brazilian inflation (“IGPM”) variation. In October 2003, AES Tietê and AES Eletropaulo executed an amendment to extend the PPA through June 2028. However, this amendment was not
approved by ANEEL. In response, AES Eletropaulo filed a suit against ANEEL and is currently awaiting the first-instance judgment. If the PPA were terminated, AES Tietê would only be allowed to sell in the ACR or ACL, being subject to market
prices. Based on the current rules concerning the purchase and sale of energy through the auction process, and because such rules remain in effect until 2015, the selling price may significantly differ from the current price adjusted under the terms
of the existing PPA.

AES Tietê’s concession agreement with the State of São Paulo for its generation plant
includes an obligation to increase generation capacity by 15% originally to be accomplished by the end of 2007. AES Tietê, as well as other concessionaire generators, was not able to meet this requirement due to regulatory, environmental and
hydrological constraints, and requested an extension of the term. Currently, the matter is under consideration by the Government of the State of São Paulo (related to the increased capacity), after a decision by the Board of Officers of
ANEEL, that ANEEL is not the appropriate authority to consider the extension, since the expansion obligation derives from the purchase and sale agreement between AES Tietê and the Government of São Paulo, and not from the concession
agreement. AES Tietê is negotiating new conditions and a new deadline to fulfill the expansion requirement. There is a dispute alleging that AES Tietê failed to increase its generation capacity as established in the concession agreement.
The dispute seeks to determine the application of penalties related to the concession agreement, and also to determine its termination. Judicial summons have been received and, in October 2008, AES Tietê presented its defense. Upon the
Prosecutor’s Office request, on September 30, 2009 the Court ordered the Plaintiffs to specify the individuals that should also be named as Defendants.

AES Uruguaiana has been impacted by the energy crisis in Argentina, primarily through natural gas supply restrictions. During this period, AES Uruguaiana has been forced to purchase energy from the spot
market and through bilateral contracts in order to satisfy its alleged obligations under the PPAs with the distribution companies. In August 2008, the Argentinean gas supplier sent a notification to AES Uruguaiana declaring force majeure under the
gas supply agreement. AES Uruguaiana extended the effects of such force majeure to the PPAs with the distribution companies. After such declaration by the Argentinean gas supplier, AES Uruguaiana started negotiations with the four distribution
companies to reduce the amount of energy contracted under the PPAs and resolve these matters. From August 2008 to December 2008, AES Uruguaiana and the distribution companies entered into amendments to reduce the energy amounts under the PPAs to the
level of the bilateral agreements executed by AES Uruguaiana, suspend such agreements by December 2009 and settle all pending matters. Three of these distribution companies sought and received a decision by ANEEL declaring that they were entitled to
involuntary exposures, which allows these distribution companies to purchase replacement energy in the market and recover the related additional costs, if any, through their tariffs.

Cameroon.The law governing the Cameroonian electricity sector was passed in December 1998. The regulator is the Electricity
Sector Regulatory Agency (“ARSEL”) and its role is regulating and ensuring the







proper functioning of the electricity sector, supervising the process of granting concessions, licenses and authorizations to operators, monitoring the application of the electricity regulation
by the operators of the sector, approving and/or publicizing the regulated tariffs in the sector and safeguarding the interests of electricity operators and consumers. ARSEL has the legal status of a Public Administrative Establishment and is placed
under the dual technical supervisory authority of the Ministries charged with electricity and finance.

The concession
agreement of July 2001 between the Republic of Cameroon and Sonel covers a twenty-year period. The first three years constituted a grace period to permit resolution of issues existing at the time of the privatization. In 2006, Sonel and the
Cameroonian government signed an amended concession agreement. The amendment updates the schedule for investments to more than double the number of people Sonel serves over the next 15 years and provides for upgrading the generation,
transmission and distribution system. Additionally, the concession agreement amended the tariff structure that results in an electricity price based on a reasonable return on the generation, transmission and distribution asset base and a pass
through of a portion of fuel costs associated with increased thermal generation in years when hydrology is poor. The amended concession agreement has also reduced the cost of connection to facilitate access to electricity in Cameroon.

Chile. In Chile, except for the small isolated systems of Aysén and Punta Arenas, generation activities are principally
in two electric systems: the Central Interconnected Grid (known as the SIC), which supplies approximately 92% of the country’s population; and the Northern Interconnected Grid (known as the SING), where the principal users are mining and
industrial companies.

The keystones of the electricity regulation are: 1) a regulated compulsory marginal cost dispatch based
on audited variable costs; 2) a contract-based wholesale generation market; 3) an open access regime for transmission with benchmark regulation for existent transmission lines and open bids for new lines; 4) benchmark regulation for the distribution
grid; and 5) electricity retailing by distribution companies in their exclusive concession areas.

Electricity generation in
each of these grids is coordinated by the respective independent Economic Load Dispatch Center (“CDEC”) in order to minimize operational costs and ensure the highest economic efficiency of the system, while fulfilling all quality of
service and reliability requirements established by current regulations. In order to satisfy demand at the lowest possible cost at all times, each CDEC orders the dispatch of generation plants based strictly on variable generation costs, starting
with the lowest variable cost, and does so independent of the contracts held by each generation company. Thus, while the generation companies are free to enter into supply contracts with their customers and are obligated to comply with such
contracts, the energy needed to satisfy demand is always produced by the CDEC members whose variable production costs are lower than the system’s marginal cost at the time of dispatch. For this reason, in each hour a given generator is either a
net supplier to the system or a net buyer. Net buyers pay net suppliers the system’s marginal cost. In addition, the Chilean market is designed to include payments for capacity (or firm capacity), which are explicitly paid to generation
companies for contributing to the system’s sufficiency. The cost of investment and operation of transmission systems are borne by generation companies and consumers (regulated tolls) in proportion to their use.

The Chilean Ministry of Economy, Development and Reconstruction grants concessions for the provision of the public service of electric
distribution and the National Commission for the Environment administers the system for evaluating the environmental impact of projects. Concessions are not required from government agencies to build and operate thermoelectric plants. The National
Energy Commission establishes, regulates and coordinates energy policy. The Superintendency of Electricity and Fuels oversees compliance with service quality and safety regulations. The General Water Authority issues the rights to use water for
hydroelectric generation plants. The Chilean electric system includes a Panel of Experts, an independent technical agency whose purpose is to analyze and resolve in a timely fashion conflicts arising between companies within the electric sector and
among one or more of these companies and the energy authorities.







Power generation is based primarily on long-term contracts between generation companies and
customers specifying the volume, price and conditions for the sale of energy and capacity. The law recognizes two types of customers for generation companies: unregulated customers and regulated customers. Unregulated customers are principally
consumers whose connected capacity is higher than 2 MW, and consumers whose connected capacity is between 500 kW and 2 MW who have selected the unregulated pricing mechanism for a period of four years. These customers are not subject to price
regulation; therefore, generation and distribution companies are able to freely negotiate prices and conditions for electricity supply with them. Regulated customers are those whose connected capacity is less than or equal to 500 kW, and those
with connected capacity between 500 kW and 2 MW who have selected—also for four years—the regulated pricing system.

The distinct electricity sector activities are regulated by the General Electricity Services Law, DFL No. 1/1982 enacted by the Mining Ministry, with its subsequent amendments: Law No. 19,490 (2004, known as the “Short Law
I”) and Law No. 20,01/005, or the “Short Law II”, which did not modify the foundation of Chile’s stable electricity sector model. These laws were rewritten and systematized under DFL No. 4/2007. Sector activities are
also governed by the corresponding technical regulations and standards.

In accordance with the amendment to the electricity
law enacted in May 2005, new contracts assigned by distribution companies for consumption from 2010 onward must be awarded to generation companies based on the lowest supply price offered in public bid processes. These prices called “long-term
node prices”, include indexation formulas and are valid for the entire term of the contract, up to a maximum of 15 years. More precisely, the long-term energy node price for a particular contract is the lowest energy price offered by the
generation companies participating in each respective bid process, while the long-term capacity node price is that set in the node price decree in effect at the time of the bid.

The “Tokman Law,” which was enacted in September 2007, requires that generation companies must continue to supply
electricity to distribution companies whose supply contract may be terminated as a result of bankruptcy of the distribution company, its generation supplier, or the anticipated termination of the power purchase contract due to an arbitration award
or court decision. The law states that in these situations, if the distribution company is not able to procure a new contract, all generation companies in the system must then supply the distribution company at node prices based on the
generator’s respective participation in the grid.

Another statute, Law 20,257, was enacted in April
2008. Law 20,257 promotes non-conventional renewable energy sources, such as solar, wind, small hydroelectric and biomass energy. The law requires that a percentage of the new power purchase contracts held by generation companies after
August 31, 2007, be supplied from renewable sources. The required energy percentage begins at 5% for the period 2010-2014, and gradually increases to a maximum of 10% in 2024. A penalty is applied for each kWh not supplied in accordance with
the law. This law will be in force for 25 years beginning in 2010. Our businesses in Chile have developed a plan for complying with this law, which includes the sale of certain water rights, the purchasers of which have agreed to build a small
hydroelectric plant and sell the energy to Gener at a fixed price. In December 2009, the governmental environmental agency published a draft of a potential new ruling which will regulate the emissions from thermal power plants of NO

x

, SO


, PM and metals. This ruling would impose high-quality standards over the system. This draft will enter in a discussion
process during 2010. AES Gener is analyzing the potential impact of this regulation, and an estimation of the impact can only be established when the final regulation is issued. Additionally, at the end of 2009 a law was approved that changes the
governmental administrative structure and creates the Ministry of Energy. The new Ministry of Energy will gather several agencies related to energy issues and depend on the Ministries of Mining and Economy, such as the National Energy Commission,
the Electricity and Fuel Superintendent and the Chilean Nuclear Commission, among others, in order to provide a better coordination of energy affairs. The Ministry of Energy will also oversee a new Energy Efficiency agency.

Colombia.Colombia has one main national interconnected system (the “SIN”). In 1994 the Colombian Congress issued
the laws of Domiciliary Public Services and the Electricity Law, which set the institutional arrangement and the general regulatory framework for the electricity sector. The Regulatory Commission of







Electricity and Gas (“CREG”) was created to foster the efficient supply of energy through regulation of the wholesale market, the natural monopolies of transmission and distribution,
and by setting limits for horizontal and vertical economic integration.

The wholesale market is organized around both
bilateral contracts and a mandatory pool and spot market for all generation units larger than 20 MW. Each unit bids its availability quantities for a 24-hour period with one bid price set for those 24 hours. The dispatch is arranged from
lowest to highest bid price and the spot price is set by the marginal price.

The spot market started in July 1995, and in
1996 a capacity payment was introduced for a term of 10 years. In December 2006, a regulation was enacted that replaced the capacity charge with the reliability charge and established two implementation periods. The first period consists of a
transition period from December 2006 to November 2012, during which, the price is equal to $13.045 per megawatt hour (“ MWh”) and volume is determined based on firm energy offers which are prorated so that the total firm energy level does
not exceed system demand. The second period, in which the reliability charge will be determined based on the energy price and volume offers submitted by new market participants bidding for new capacity for the system, begins in December 2012. The
first reliability charge auction was held in May 2008 with the following results: (i) the reliability charge for existing plants for the period between December 2012 and November 2013 will be $13.998 per MWh; (ii) for new plants that
successfully participated in the auction, the charge will be paid for 20 years starting December 2012; (iii) three new projects won the auction for a total capacity of 429.6 MW starting in 2012.

Furthermore, the CREG issued a proposal to create the Organized Regulated Market (“MOR”). The MOR will replace current bilateral
contracts (assigned between traders/utilities and generators) for a centralized auction in which the System Operator buys energy for all regulated customers attended by the traders/utilities. The main provisions contained in the proposal include:
(i) it is mandatory for all traders/utilities to buy energy at the auction price and it is voluntary for sellers (generators and trade companies) to offer energy in each auction; (ii) one price for the energy sales in the auction;
(iii) the auctions are held one year before the actual dispatch moment and the commitment period of the auction is one year; and (iv) the proposal is to establish four auctions in each year, in order to cover the annual demand. We expect
that a definitive resolution on this matter will be issued in the first half of 2010.

During the second half of 2009, due the
to El Niño Phenomenon, which causes low levels of rainfall in Colombia, the Ministry of Mines and Energy and CREG issued a series of temporary measures intended to guarantee reliability of the energy sector including (i) establishment of
a priority scale for the assignment of gas during scarcity periods; (ii) securing availability of thermal plants and forcing some of them to generate for electrical security reasons; and (iii) continuous follow-up of the market in order to
implement additional measures in case of increase of the probability of energy rationing in the system. These measures have affected the spot prices in the market, pressuring prices down and, therefore, distorting the current scarcity conditions.
For AES Chivor, these conditions did not have a negative impact on the 2009 results given AES Chivor’s reservoir levels and contracts for the year. Nevertheless, AES Chivor and other generators have opposed the measures and are currently
requesting the government and regulator restore the normal market conditions as soon as possible.

Dominican
Republic.The Dominican Republic has one main interconnected system with 3,000 MW of installed capacity and four isolated systems. Under current regulations, the Dominican government retains ultimate oversight and regulatory authority
as well as control over the transmission grid and the hydroelectric facilities in the country. In addition, the government shares ownership in certain generation assets and all distribution assets. The Dominican government’s oversight
responsibilities for the electricity sector are carried out by the National Energy Commission and the Superintendency of Electricity.

The wholesale electricity market in the Dominican Republic commenced operations in June 2000. This market includes a spot market and contract market. All participants in the Dominican electric system with







available units are put in the spot market in order of merit for dispatch based on lowest marginal cost. The order of merit determines the order in which each participant is dispatched. The order
of merit is effective for one week. The price to be paid for the electricity corresponds to the marginal cost of the last dispatched unit. In addition to the spot market, participants may execute private contracts in which they agree to specific
price, energy, and capacity transactions. Currently, the wholesale market has 80% of the transactions under contracts and the remaining 20% in the spot market.

The regulatory framework in the Dominican electricity market establishes a methodology for calculating the firm capacity, which is the supply that can be economically dispatched by a generating unit
during peak demand, provided that the unit has a certain unavailability (mechanical in the case of thermal power plants, and primarily hydrological in the case of hydroelectric power plants). The total firm capacity of the electric system in a year
is equal to the peak demand of that year. The capacity payment is regulated as the average fixed cost (monthly capital cost of the investment cost plus fixed operational and maintenance cost) of an oil-fired open cycle gas turbine, multiplied by 10%
to take into account a reserve margin.

The financial crisis in the Dominican Republic during 2004 caused a financial crisis
in the electricity sector. The inability to pass through higher fuel prices and the costs of devaluation led to a gap between collections at the distribution companies and the amounts required to pay the generators. In 2005, the government committed
itself to stay current with its energy bills and also to cover the potential deficit of distribution companies. During 2005, 2006, and 2007, the Government was paying both the subsidies and its own energy bills on time. In December 2006, a bill with
the primary goal of supporting fraud prosecution was sent to Congress by the Executive Branch. This bill was approved in July 2007 and is expected to help the sector reach financial sustainability by: criminalizing electrical fraud; setting new
limits to non-regulated users in order to protect the distribution companies’ market; allowing for service cutoff after only one bill due and unpaid; and classifying as a national security breach the intentional damage or interruption of the
national electricity grid.

Despite these improvements, the electricity sector has not completely recovered from the financial
crisis of 2004. In 2006, the electricity sector needed $530 million in subsidies from the government to cover current operations. In 2007, the sector needed more than $630 million and, at projected fuel prices, the government budgeted
subsidies of $800 million for 2008. In 2008, because petroleum and all other fuels doubled in price, the subsidy of $800 million was not enough to cover additional costs, which reached $1.2 billion. The Government has been trying to raise
more funds, by allocating funds from the national budget, such as a recent approval of an additional $300 million in electricity subsidies supplementing 2008. In addition, the Government has been trying to obtain credit from local banks and
multilateral institutions. In 2009, the Government paid the total debt for 2008 through a sovereign bond issuance.

Trying to
reverse the situation generated by freezing tariffs in 2005, in June and July 2009, the Superintendence of Electricity (“SIE”) increased the distribution tariffs by an average of 5.7%. As of September 30, 2009, the accumulated
increment is 12.1%. In addition, on October 12, 2009, the Government signed a Letter of Intent for a Stand-By Agreement of $1.7 billion with the International Monetary Fund (“IMF”). This agreement will include structural changes for
the electricity sector and a plan to pay the current debt to the generators. On November 9, 2009, the IMF approved the agreement. The following actions have to be executed by the Dominican Government to carry on with the agreement:



•Design a strategy to rationalize and limit tax exemptions and strengthen tax administration;



•Adjustments in tariffs and tariff system application to cover the costs of generation and distribution;



•Phasing out the general electricity subsidy by 2012 and targeting the poor;



•Reduce losses and improve measurement techniques to reduce electricity theft;



•Improving the management of distribution companies;



•Creation of a special trust fund to implement government payments to generation and distribution companies;







•Application of an external audit of the finances of state enterprises in the distribution of corporate unit; and



•Develop a plan to invest in new generation capacity and distribution.

Financial resources derived from the IMF agreement have begun to flow to the electricity generation players in the country and, in December
2009, the sector received more than $300 million in payment for outstanding debts.

In October of 2006, Corporación
Dominicana de Empresas Electricas Estatales (“CDEEE”), the state-owned transmission and hydro company, began making public statements that it intends to seek to compel the renegotiation and/or rescission of long-term PPAs with certain
power generating companies in the Dominican Republic. Although the details concerning CDEEE’s statements are unclear and no formal government action has been taken, AES holds ownership interests in three power generation facilities in the
country (AES Andres, Itabo and Dominican Power Partners) that could be adversely affected by the actions taken by the CDEEE, if any.

El Salvador.Electricity generators and distribution companies in El Salvador are linked through a single, main interconnected system managed by the Transactions Unit (“UT”). The transmission system is operated by
ETESAL, a state-owned company. The El Salvador wholesale electricity market is comprised of: (1) a contract market based on contracts between electricity generators, distributors and trading companies and (2) a spot market for uncontracted
electricity based upon bids from spot market participants specifying prices at which they are willing to buy or sell electricity.

El Salvador has seven electricity distribution companies, five went to private ownership as part of the privatization process that took place in 1998 and the additional two, representing less than 1% of the market, were created after the
electricity law allowed competition in the sector. AES controls four of these five distribution companies, encompassing about 80% of the national territory, serving about 1,110,000 customers. El Salvador’s electricity industry is regulated
under the General Electricity Law enacted in October 1996 and subsequently amended twice in June 2003 and in October 2007. The Superintendencia General de Electricidad y Telecomunicaciones (“SIGET”) is an independent regulatory authority
that regulates the electricity and telecommunications sectors in El Salvador.

The maximum tariff to be charged by
distribution companies to regulated customers is subject to the approval of SIGET. The components of the electricity tariff are (a) the average energy price (“energy charge”), (b) the charges for the use of the distribution
network (“distribution charge”), and (c) customer service costs (“service charge”). Both the distribution charge and service charge are based on average capital costs as well as operation and maintenance costs of an
efficient distribution company. The energy charge is adjusted every six months to reflect the changes in the spot market price for electricity. The distribution charge and service charge are approved by SIGET every five years and have two
adjustments: (1) an annual adjustment considering the inflation variation and (2) an automatic adjustment in April, July and October, provided that the change in the adjusted value exceeds the value in effect by at least 10%.

The distribution tariff for all five distribution companies in El Salvador was reset on December 4, 2007. The approved tariff
schedule is valid for five years (2008-2012). One outcome of the tariff reset was a significant reduction in the distribution value-added component of the tariff for AES CAESS and CLESA. On March 28, 2008, after negotiations with SIGET and the
El Salvador Presidential House, a revised tariff schedule was enacted. It came into force on April 1, 2008. The negotiated tariff schedule included a higher technical losses index than originally recognized by SIGET. This permits the companies
to recover an adequate portion of their technical losses through billing. The new tariffs improved distribution revenues by around 9% compared to the rates set on December 4, 2007. As a result of this negotiation and the enactment of the new
rate schedule, AES agreed to withdraw its appeal recourse before the El Salvador Supreme Court, which was introduced on December 11, 2007.







As expected, SIGET approved new regulations for Service Connection and Reconnection charges,
which came into force on November 3, 2008. The charges underwent a reduction of about 20% on average for these activities. In addition, there are also Quality of Service Regulations contained in SIGET resolution 192-E-2004, which require that
distribution companies comply with certain U.S. Technical Product Standards, Technical Service Standards and Commercial Service Standards. The Quality of Service Standards became permanent in 2008, which means that they are now enforced to their
full extent.

On October 23, 2008, SIGET enacted the bylaw for the Operation of the Transmission System and the Wholesale
Market based on Generation Costs, which provides rules for the Independent System Operator, who is responsible for managing and operating the wholesale market for electricity. From 1996 until the passing of the bylaw, the wholesale market was
governed by a price-offer system, whereby each generator submitted a daily price offer for its available generation (limited by a price cap) and the offer price determined dispatch. Under the new bylaw, each generating unit will have audited
variable costs (generating costs), which will determine the economic dispatch merit order. The bylaw also provides for additional capacity payments to providers as determined by the regulator. The variable costs mechanism enabling legislation has
been enacted, and it provides for a preparation and transition period before the regulations are in full force and effect which is scheduled to occur during the second half of 2010.

Currently, the Company does not face any regulatory action in El Salvador.

Nigeria.Nigeria’s electricity sector consists of a power generation, transmission and distribution market, with current
power production of approximately 6,000 MW of installed capacity, with the state-owned entity, Power Holding Company of Nigeria (“PHCN”), holding approximately 88% of the market share and thirty power generating companies holding the
remaining 12%. The power generating companies, of which AES Nigeria Barges Ltd. (“AESNB”) is one, maintain long-term contracts with PHCN as the sole offtaker. All power transmission operations are carried out by PHCN, while two other
distribution companies have been licensed.

The Nigerian Electricity Regulatory Commission (“NC”), an independent
regulatory agency, which was established under the Electric Power Sector Reform Act in 2005, regulates the electricity sector and carries out general oversight functions in the Nigerian electricity sector, including the licensing of operators,
setting of tariffs and industry standards for future electricity sector development. NC has asked AESNB to revalidate our generation license. As part of the revalidation exercise, NC is imposing certain conditions on AESNB which are in conflict with
its PPA and which may result in additional costs for AESNB. AESNB is reviewing the terms of the new license and plans to negotiate its terms and conditions to make them more consistent with our existing PPA. At this time, it is not clear what the
final outcome of these negotiations might be. Under the terms of the PPA, AESNB has a right to pass through any such additional cost and there is no cap. At present, we estimate that the additional costs, if any, due to the license will be about
$1 million.

In March 2005, the Nigerian President signed the Electric Power Sector Reform Bill into law, enabling
private companies to participate in transmission and distribution in addition to electricity generation that had previously been legalized. The government has separated PHCN into eleven distribution firms, six generating companies, and a
transmission company, all of which plan to be privatized. Several problems, including union opposition, have delayed the privatization indefinitely. However, it is envisaged that after the privatization process, the power sector will transform into
a fully liberalized market.

Panama.In 1998, as part of the privatization process, the Panamanian Government
divided the Instituto de Recursos Hidráulicos y de Electrificación (“IRHE”) assets and operations into four generation companies, three distribution companies and one transmission company. Following a public auction, 51% of
shares in each distribution company were sold by the Panamanian Government in September 1998. This was followed in November 1998 by the sale of 49% of shares in each of the three state-owned hydroelectric generation companies and 51% of shares in
the main thermoelectric generation company. These sales were completed in 1999. As a result of the sales, AES acquired control and operation of two of the hydroelectric companies.







The Panamanian Government retained control ofEmpresa de Transmisión
Eléctrica, S.A.(“ETESA”), the state-owned transmission company, which operates and controls the National Interconnected System (“NIS”) of 230 Kilovolts (“Kv”) and certain 115Kv lines. Panama has one
main interconnected system (the NIS) operated by ETESA. The transmission charges are reviewed and approved every four years by The National Authority of Public Services (ASEP); the current transmission tariffs are in effect until June 2013. The ASEP
sets the framework for the tariff regime, determining transmission zones and rates applicable in the relevant zones and regulates power generation, transmission, interconnection and distribution activities in the electric power sector.

The National Dispatch Center (“CND”) is responsible for planning, supervising and controlling the integrated operation of the
NIS and for ensuring its safe and reliable operation. The dispatch order is determined and planned by the CND, which dispatches electricity from generation plants based on lowest marginal cost. According to the Electricity Law, the order in which
generators are dispatched must be based on maximizing efficient consumption of energy by minimizing the total cost of energy in the Panamanian power system.

Distribution companies are required to contract 100% of their annual power requirements (although they can self-generate up to 15% of their demand). Generators can enter into long-term PPAs with
distributors or unregulated consumers. In addition, generators can enter into alternative supply contracts with each other. The terms and contents of PPAs are determined through a competitive bidding process and are governed by the Commercial Rules.
AES Panama participated in the last Long Term Public Bid, EDEMET 01-08, for the supply of power and energy until the year 2022. The public bid was held on September 9, 2008 and AES Panama was contracted to provide 100MW at $92.95/MWh from the
year 2012 until the year 2021 and 41 MW at $99.87/MWh from the year 2013 until the year 2022. AES Panama was already contracted to sell an average of 86% of firm capacity through 2018.

Under the Electricity Law, generation companies will not be granted new concessions if they would thereby account, directly or indirectly,
for more than 25% of national electricity consumption. The percentage may be increased by the Panamanian Government where justified by competitive conditions subject to the approval of the ASEP. The percentage was increased to 40% by Executive
Resolution No. 76 on October 19, 2005. This provision does not apply to licenses for thermal generation.

Besides
the PPA market, generators may buy and sell energy in the spot market. Energy sold in the spot market corresponds to the hourly differences between the actual dispatch of energy by each generator and its contractual commitments to supply energy. The
energy spot price is set by the order in which generators are dispatched. The CND ranks generators according to their variable cost (thermal) and the value of water (hydroelectric), starting with the lowest value, thereby establishing on an hourly
basis the merit order in which generators will be dispatched the following day in order to meet expected demand. This price ranking system is intended to ensure that national demand will be satisfied by the lowest cost combination of available
generating units in the country. A generator whose dispatched energy is greater than its contractual commitments to supply energy at any given time is a seller in the energy spot market; the reverse is true for a generator whose dispatched energy is
less than its contractual commitments to supply energy. Generators and unregulated consumers can purchase energy in the energy spot market, while only generators can sell energy in the energy spot market.

Through Law 57 from October 2009, the Panamanian Government amended certain provisions of the Electricity Law. The most notable amendments
were: (1) generators are now obligated to participate in public bids for PPAs, to the extent they have available firm capacity and energy, and failure to do so forfeits their ability to participate in the spot market; (2) ETESA, as opposed
to the distribution companies, will now be the purchaser in charge of adjudicating PPA bids to the winning generators, subsequently assigning said PPAs to the corresponding distribution companies; and (3) the maximum fines which ASEP may impose
for violations to the provisions of the Electricity Law are increased from $1 million to $20 million.







North America

Mexico.Mexico has a single national electricity grid (referred to as the “National Interconnected System”), covering
nearly all of Mexico’s territory. The only exception is the Baja California peninsula which has its own separate electricity system. Article 27 of the Mexican Constitution reserves the generation, transmission, transformation, distribution
and supply of electric power exclusively to the Mexican State for the purpose of providing a “public service.” The Federal Electricity Commission (“CFE”), by virtue of Article 1 of the Energy Law, is granted sole and
exclusive responsibility for providing this public service as it relates to the supply, transmission and distribution of electric power.

In 1992, the Energy Law was amended to allow private parties to invest in certain activities in the Mexico electrical power market, under the assumption that “self-supply” generation of electric
power is not considered a public service. These reforms allowed private parties to obtain permits from the Ministry of Energy for (i) generating power for self-supply; (ii) generating power through co-generation processes;
(iii) generating power through independent production; (iv) small-scale production; and (v) importing and exporting electrical power. Beneficiaries holding any of the permits contemplated under the Energy Law are required to enter
into PPAs with the CFE with regard to all surplus power produced. It is under this basis that AES’s Mérida (“Mérida”) and TEG/TEP facilities operate. Mérida, a majority-owned 484 MW generation business,
provides power exclusively to CFE under a long-term contract. TEG/TEP provides the majority of its output to two offtakers under long-term contracts, and can sell any excess or surplus energy produced to CFE at a predetermined day-ahead price.

United States.The U.S. wholesale electricity market consists of multiple distinct regional markets that are
subject to both federal regulation, as implemented by the FERC, and regional regulation as defined by rules designed and implemented by the Independent System Operator (“ISO”). These rules for the most part govern such items as the
determination of the market mechanism for setting the system marginal price for energy and the establishment of guidelines and incentives for the addition of new capacity. The current regulatory framework in the U.S. is the result of a series of
regulatory actions that have taken place over the past two decades, as well as numerous policies adopted by both the federal government and the individual states that encourage competition in wholesale and retail electricity markets.

The federal government, through regulations promulgated by FERC, has primary jurisdiction over wholesale electricity markets and
transmission services. While there have been numerous federal statutes enacted during the past 30 years, including the Public Utility Regulatory Policy Act of 1978 (“PURPA”), the Energy Policy Act of 1992 (“EPAct 1992”) and
the Energy Policy Act of 2005 (“EPAct 2005”), there are two fundamental regulatory initiatives implemented by FERC during that time frame that directly impact our U.S. businesses:



(a)FERC approval of market based rate authority beginning in 1986 for many providers of wholesale generation; and



(b)FERC issuance of Order #888 in 1996 mandating the functional separation of generation and transmission operations and requiring utilities to provide open access to
their transmission systems.

Several of our generation businesses in the U.S. currently operate as Qualifying
Facilities (“QFs”) as defined under PURPA. These businesses entered into long-term contracts with electric utilities that had a mandatory obligation at that time, as specified under PURPA, to purchase power from QFs at the utility’s
avoided cost (i.e., the likely costs for both energy and facilities that would have been incurred by the purchasing utility if that utility had to provide its own generating capacity). EPAct 2005 later amended PURPA to eliminate the mandatory
purchase obligation in certain markets, but did so only on a prospective basis. Cogeneration facilities and small power production facilities that meet certain criteria can be QFs. To be a QF, a cogeneration facility must produce electricity and
useful thermal energy for an industrial or commercial process or heating or cooling applications in certain proportions to the facility’s total energy output, and must meet certain efficiency standards. To be a QF, a small power production
facility must generally use a renewable resource as its energy input and meet certain size criteria.







Our non-QF generation businesses in the U.S. currently operate as Exempt Wholesale
Generators (“EWG’s”) as defined under EPAct 1992. These businesses were historically exempt from the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935 and are also exempt from the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 2005 (“PUHCA
2005”), and subject to FERC approval, have the right to sell power at market-based rates, either directly to the wholesale market or to a third-party offtaker such as a power marketer or utility/industrial customer. Under the Federal Power Act
(“FPA”) and FERC’s regulations, approval from FERC to sell wholesale power at market-based rates is generally dependent upon a showing to FERC that the seller lacks market power in generation and transmission, that the seller and its
affiliates cannot erect other barriers to market entry and there is no opportunity for abusive transactions involving regulated affiliates of the seller. To prevent market manipulation, FERC requires sellers with market-based rate authority to file
certain reports, including a triennial updated market power analysis.

FERC has civil penalty authority over violations of any
provision of Part II of the FPA, as well as any rule or order issued thereunder. FERC is authorized to assess a maximum civil penalty of $1 million per violation for each day that the violation continues. The FPA also provides for the
assessment of criminal fines and imprisonment for violations under Part II of the FPA. This penalty authority was enhanced in EPAct 2005. With this expanded enforcement authority, violations of the FPA and FERC’s regulations could potentially
have more serious consequences than in the past.

Pursuant to EPAct 2005, the North America Reliability Corporation
(“NERC”) has been certified by FERC as the Electric Reliability Organization (“ERO”) to develop mandatory and enforceable electric system reliability standards applicable throughout the U.S. to improve the overall reliability of
the electric grid. These standards are subject to FERC review and approval. Once approved, the reliability standards may be enforced by FERC independently, or, alternatively, by the ERO and regional reliability organizations with responsibility for
auditing, investigating and otherwise ensuring compliance with reliability standards, subject to FERC oversight. Monetary penalties of up to $1 million per day per violation may be assessed for violations of the reliability standards.

A brief description of the regulatory environment under which one of our larger generation businesses in the U.S. operates, Eastern Energy,
is provided below:

Eastern Energy.AES, through its Eastern Energy subsidiary, currently operates four coal-fired
generation plants with a combined total capacity of 1,268 MW located in the State of New York. The plants sell power directly to the New York Independent System Operator (“NYISO”), a FERC approved regional operator which manages the
transmission system in New York and operates the state’s wholesale electricity markets. NYISO is regulated as an electric utility by the FERC and has an Open Access Transmission Tariff on file that incorporates rates and conditions for use of
the transmission system and a Market Services Tariff that describes the rules and conditions of use for the various markets.

The NYISO wholesale power markets are based on a combination of bilateral contracts, contracts for differences (“CFDs”) which financially settle relative to an agreed-upon index or floating price, and NYISO-administered day-ahead
and real-time energy markets. The day-ahead market includes energy, regulation and operating reserves and is a financially binding commitment to produce or replace the products sold. The real-time market, which also offers energy, regulation and
operating reserves, is a balancing market and is not a financially binding commitment but rather a best-effort standard. NYISO uses location-based marginal pricing (i.e., pricing for energy at a given location based on a market clearing price
that takes into account physical limitations, generation and demand throughout the region) calculated at each node to account for congestion on the grid. Generators are paid the location marginal price at their node, while the end customer pays a
zonal price that is the average of nodes within a zone. The market has a $1,000 per MWh cap on bids for energy. However, market rules also incorporate scarcity pricing mechanisms when the market is short of required operating reserves that can
result in energy prices above $1,000 per MWh.







In addition to our generation businesses, we also own IPL, a vertically integrated utility
located in Indiana. A description of the regulatory environment under which IPL operates is provided below:

IPL.As a
regulated electric utility, IPL is subject to regulation by the FERC and the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission (“IURC”). As indicated below, the financial performance of IPL is directly impacted by the outcome of various regulatory
proceedings before the IURC and FERC.

IPL is subject to regulation by the IURC with respect to the following: its services
and facilities; the valuation of property; the construction, purchase or lease of electric generating facilities; the classification of accounts; rates of depreciation; retail rates and charges; the issuance of securities (other than evidences of
indebtedness payable less than twelve months after the date of issue); the acquisition and sale of some public utility properties or securities; and certain other matters.

IPL’s tariff rates for electric service to retail customers (basic rates and charges) are set and approved by the IURC after public
hearings (“general rate case”). General rate cases, which have occurred at irregular intervals, include the participation of consumer advocacy groups and certain customers. The last general rate case for IPL was completed in 1995. In
addition, pursuant to statute, the IURC is to conduct a periodic review of the basic rates and charges of all utilities at least once every four years, but the IURC has the authority to review the rates of any utility in its jurisdiction at any time
it chooses. Such reviews have not been subject to public hearings.

The majority of IPL customers are served pursuant to
retail tariffs that provide for the monthly billing or crediting to customers of increases or decreases, respectively, in the actual costs of fuel (including purchased power costs) consumed from estimated fuel costs embedded in basic rates, subject
to certain restrictions on the level of operating income. These billing or crediting mechanisms are referred to as “trackers”. This is significant because fuel and purchased power costs represent a large and volatile portion of IPL’s
total costs. In addition, IPL’s rate authority provides for a return on IPL’s investment and recovery of the depreciation and operation and maintenance expenses associated with certain IURC-approved environmental investments. The trackers
allow IPL to recover the cost of qualifying investments, including a return on investment, without the need for a general rate case.

IPL may apply to the IURC for a change in its fuel charge every three months to recover its estimated fuel costs, including the energy portion of purchased power costs, which may be above or below the levels included in its basic rates and
charges. IPL must present evidence in each fuel adjustment charge (“FAC”) proceeding that it has made every reasonable effort to acquire fuel and generate or purchase power, or both, so as to provide electricity to its retail customers at
the lowest cost reasonably possible.

Independent of the IURC’s ability to review basic rates and charges, Indiana law
requires electric utilities under the jurisdiction of the IURC to meet operating expense and income test requirements as a condition for approval of requested changes in the FAC. Additionally, customer refunds may result if IPL’s rolling twelve
month operating income, determined at quarterly measurement dates, exceeds IPL’s authorized annual jurisdictional net operating income and there are not sufficient applicable cumulative net operating income deficiencies against which the excess
rolling twelve month jurisdictional net operating income can be offset.

In IPL’s six most recently approved FAC filings
(FAC 81 through 86), the IURC found that IPL’s rolling annual jurisdictional retail electric net operating income was lower than the authorized annual jurisdictional net operating income. FAC 86 includes the twelve months ended October 31,
2009. In IPL’s FAC 76 through 80 filings, the IURC found that IPL’s rolling annual jurisdictional retail electric net operating income was greater than the authorized annual jurisdictional net operating income. Because IPL has a cumulative
net operating income deficiency, IPL has not been required to make customer refunds in their FAC proceedings.







In December 2007, IPL received a letter from the staff of the IURC requesting information
relevant to the IURC’s periodic review of IPL’s basic rates and charges and IPL subsequently provided information to the staff. Since IPL’s cumulative net operating income deficiency (described above) requires no customer refunds in
the FAC process, the IURC staff was concerned that the higher-than-usual 2007 earnings may continue in the future. In response to the inquiry, IPL provided voluntary credits to its retail customers totaling $32 million. IPL recorded a
$30 million deferred fuel regulatory liability in March 2008 and a $2 million deferred fuel regulatory liability in June 2008, with corresponding and respective reductions against revenues for these voluntary credits. All of these credits
have been applied in the form of offsets against fuel charges that customers would have otherwise been billed during June 1, 2008 through February 28, 2009.

In September 2009, IPL received a letter from the staff of the IURC relevant to the IURC’s periodic review of IPL’s basic rates and charges which expressed concerns about IPL’s level of
earnings and invited IPL to provide additional information. The staff of the IURC has since requested additional information relative to IPL’s level of earnings. In response, IPL provided information to the staff of the IURC. It is not possible
to predict what impact, if any, the IURC’s review may have on IPL.

IPL is a member of the Midwest Independent System
Operator, Inc. (“Midwest ISO”). Midwest ISO serves as the third-party operator of IPL’s transmission system and runs the day-ahead and real-time Energy Market and, beginning in January 2009, the Ancillary Services Market for its
members.

IPL transferred functional control of its transmission facilities to the Midwest ISO and its transmission operations
were integrated with those of the Midwest ISO. IPL’s participation and authority to sell wholesale power at market-based rates are subject to the FERC jurisdiction. Transmission service over IPL’s facilities is now provided through the
Midwest ISO’s tariff.

As a member of Midwest ISO market, IPL offers its generation and bids its demand into the market
on an hourly basis. The Midwest ISO settles energy hourly offers and bids based on locational marginal prices, which is pricing for energy at a given location based on a market clearing price that takes into account physical limitations, generation
and demand throughout the Midwest ISO region. The Midwest ISO evaluates the market participants’ energy offers and demand bids optimizing for energy products to economically and reliably dispatch the entire Midwest ISO system. The Company has
certain regulatory assets on its balance sheet relating to IPL’s participation in the Midwest ISO. The IURC has authorized IPL to recover the fuel portion of its costs from the Midwest ISO, to defer certain operational, administrative and other
costs from the Midwest ISO and seek recovery in IPL’s next basic rate case proceeding. Total Midwest ISO costs deferred by IPL as long-term regulatory assets were $62.8 million and $57.9 million as of December 31, 2009 and
December 31, 2008, respectively. IPL will seek to recover the deferred costs in its next basic rate case proceeding; however, there can be no assurance that IPL would be successful in that regard.

Beginning in 2007, Midwest ISO transmission owners including IPL began to share the costs of transmission expansion projects with other
transmission owners after such projects were approved by the Midwest ISO Board of Directors. Upon approval by the Midwest ISO Board of Directors, the transmission owners must make a good faith effort to build the projects. Costs allocated to IPL for
the projects of other transmission owners are collected by the Midwest ISO per their tariff. We believe it is probable, but not certain, that IPL will ultimately be able to recover from its customers the money it pays to the Midwest ISO for its
share of transmission expansion projects of other utilities, but such recovery is subject to IURC approval in IPL’s next basic rate case. Therefore, such costs to date have been deferred as long term regulatory assets. To date, such costs have
not been material to IPL, however, given the magnitude of the costs anticipated to enable conformance with renewables mandates in the Midwest ISO footprint, it is probable that such costs will become material in the next few years. Our current
estimates are that IPL’s share of such costs could be more than $50 million annually by 2020 and continue increasing after that.

In 2004, the IURC initiated an investigation to examine the overall effectiveness of Demand-Side Management (“DSM”) programs throughout the State of Indiana and to consider any alternatives to improve







DSM performance statewide. On December 9, 2009, the IURC issued a Generic DSM Order that found that electric utilities subject to its jurisdiction must meet annual incremental jurisdictional
energy sales reductions starting in 2010 at 0.3% and growing to 2% in 2019 (subject to certain adjustments). The IURC also found that all jurisdictional electric utilities have to participate in five initial, statewide core DSM programs, which
will be administered by a Third Party Administrator. It is not possible at this time to predict the impact that the IURC’s Generic DSM Order will have on IPL.

Prior to the issuance of the Generic DSM Order, IPL filed a petition seeking relief for substantive DSM programs. IPL proposed a DSM plan to be considered in two phases. The first phase (“Phase
I”) sought recovery for traditional-type DSM programs, such as residential home weatherization and energy efficiency education programs, with additional offerings. The IURC issued an Order in February 2010 that approved the programs included in
IPL’s Phase I request. In addition to IPL’s traditional recovery of the direct costs of the DSM program, the Order also included performance based incentives. The second phase (“Phase II”) sought recovery for “Advanced”
DSM programs and was coincident with IPL’s application for a smart grid funding grant from the Department of Energy. The “Advanced” DSM programs included an Advanced Metering Infrastructure communication backbone as well as two-way
meters and home area network devices for certain of IPL’s customers. In February 2010, the IURC issued an Order that approved IPL’s Phase II program, but denied IPL’s request to timely recover its expenditures. Instead, IPL would need
to seek recovery of the costs incurred under its Phase II program during its next basic rate case proceeding. In light of these recent IURC Orders and the $20 million Smart Grid Investment Grant that IPL is currently negotiating (discussed below),
IPL is still evaluating its DSM program and what the financial impacts will be.

The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of
2009 was enacted into law in February 2009. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 includes various provisions that fund the development of the electric power industry at the federal and state level. These provisions include, but are not
limited to, improving energy efficiency and reliability; electricity delivery (including smart grid technology); energy research and development; renewable energy; and demand response management. In August 2009, IPL submitted an application for
a Smart Grid Investment Grant for $20 million to provide its customers with tools to help them more efficiently use electricity and also to upgrade its delivery system infrastructure. In October 2009, the U.S. Department of Energy notified IPL that
its application had been selected for award negotiations. The U.S. Department of Energy’s Office of Electricity Delivery and Energy Reliability conducted a briefing for all selectees in November 2009. Negotiations with the U.S. Department
of Energy to finalize the award continue. It is unclear at this time what the tax impacts of this grant may be. IPL’s project is part of our DSM plan (discussed above). IPL is evaluating the impact these recent IURC DSM Orders may have on its
smart grid investment grant.

Europe, Middle East & Asia

Bulgaria. Bulgaria has been an EU member since January 1, 2007. The country’s electricity sector is compliant with
the EU’s Electricity and Gas Directives. Bulgaria has an independent State Water and Energy Regulatory Commission (“SWERC”) which is mainly responsible for licensing energy products, compliance with the EU electricity and gas market
rules and creating secondary renewable energy legislation. The sector is vertically unbundled with legal separation of generation, transmission and distribution into different operating entities. The market is fully liberalized with all customers
now qualifying as eligible customers and free to contract for supply.

The Bulgarian market is a combination of a regulated
market, a competitive market based on bilateral contracts and a balancing market, with the former dominating over the latter.

The National Electricity Company (“NEK”) is the Bulgarian public provider which owns, maintains and operates the 14,610 km high voltage (110Kv and above) transmission network through its 100% owned subsidiary Electricity System
Operator (“ESO”). ESO is the system operator for dispatch control of the network. NEK also owns the biggest hydro-electric and pump storage generation facilities in Bulgaria.







NEK does not operate in the consumer retail market. It purchases energy from producers and
sells it to electricity distribution companies (all of which have been privatized) and large industrial consumers. It also exports electricity. Currently NEK is the sole company in Bulgaria licensed to export electricity. In addition, NEK purchases
electricity under long-term PPAs with Thermal Power Plant Maritza East 2 and Thermal Power Plant Maritza East 3 (neither plant is owned by AES). Also, it will be purchasing electricity from renewable energy producers and combined heat and power
plants at specified preferential prices.

NEK’s role also includes the purchase of electricity from generators and its
resale to distributor/supply companies and high-voltage customers. NEK’s purchase and resale prices of electricity are determined by SWERC.

Power production from NEK’s hydro-power plants and pump storage hydro-power plants falls within its function of a public provider. These plants are integrated in NEK’s structure and no separate
prices are set for them.

The distribution sector has been fully privatized, the country’s seven distribution companies
being bundled into three regional groups. In 2004, these groups were sold to the Czech State Electricity Company (“CEZ”) in Western Bulgaria, the Austrian EVN AG in Southern Bulgaria, and E.On Energia AG in North Eastern Bulgaria. As of
January 1, 2007, the distribution companies have been separated into distribution grid operators and end suppliers.

The
transmission network is well developed, with over 14,000 km of lines and a significant interconnection to neighboring countries, including Romania, Turkey, Greece, Macedonia and Serbia. The transmission system remains under NEK’s ownership.
However, in compliance with EU legislation NEK has spun off transmission operations (i.e. system operation, balancing market administration and systems’ operation and maintenance) to ESO. Regulated third-party access is provided for.

Following EU’s renewable energy goals, Bulgaria developed a national long-term program to incentivize the use of
renewable energy sources until 2015 and a Renewable Energy Law. The latter allocates a priority status for use of the distribution system and grid interconnection to generators of energy from alternative/renewable sources as well as guaranteed
take-off of their output. As a national target, 16% of the total national energy consumption must come from renewable sources of generation by 2020.

China.In 2005, the National Development and Reform Commission (“NDRC”) released interim regulations governing on-grid tariffs, along with two other regulations governing
transmission and retail tariffs. Pursuant to the interim regulations, the on-grid tariffs shall be appraised and ratified by the pricing authorities by reference to the economic life of power generation projects and determined in accordance with the
principle of allowing IPPs to cover reasonable costs and to obtain reasonable returns. Such costs were defined to be the average costs in the industry and reasonable returns will be calculated on the basis of the interest rate of China’s
long-term Treasury bond plus certain percentage points. In addition to the foregoing tariff-setting mechanism, China’s central government also issued a tariff adjustment policy allowing the on-grid tariffs to be pegged to the fuel price in the
case of significant fluctuations in fuel price. Seventy percent of the increase in fuel costs may be passed through in the tariff. The tariffs of coal-fired facilities in China were increased in 2005, 2006 and 2008 pursuant to this policy to
alleviate the escalation of fuel price; however, such adjustments were obtained from the regulatory authorities only after a time lag and fell short of compensating all businesses for coal price increases in recent years. There was no catch up
tariff adjustment in 2009 pursuant to the foregoing policy.

Pursuant to theRenewable Energy Law of China, which came
into effect on January 1, 2006, renewable resources such as wind, solar, biomass, geo-thermal, and hydro enjoy unrestricted generation and dispatch, and local grid interconnection is mandated to such plants. To implement the Renewable Energy
Law, on August 2, 2007, various central government agencies jointly issued theTemporary Measures for Dispatching Electricity Generated by Energy Conservation Projects. Under this regulation, power plants are categorized into various
groups and each group will, under certain circumstances, enjoy priority dispatch over the subsequent groups. The







first group are renewable energy power plants, namely wind, hydro, solar, biomass, tidal-wave, geo-thermal and landfill gas power plants that satisfy certain environmental standards. The second
group is nuclear power plants. The third group is power plants using ‘modern coal’ which includes co-generation power plants, and power plants utilizing residual heat, residual gas, coal-gangue (or waste coal) and coal mine methane. The
last three groups are natural gas, conventional coal and oil-fired power plants. As a result, power plants using renewable resources will enjoy priority dispatch over power plants using fossil fuels. This is in line with the requirement that
renewable energy power plants will enjoy unrestricted generation and dispatch under the Renewable Energy Law, as well as the Chinese government’s policy objective to encourage comprehensive utilization of resources in an energy-efficient and
environmental-friendly manner.

In 2007, the Chinese government issued a number of rules and procedures that govern the
shutdown of small coal or oil-fired power plants. The types of plants to be shut down include: (i) power plants with a capacity under 50 MW; (ii) power plants with a capacity of up to 100 MW which are over 20 years old;
(iii) power plants with a capacity of up to 200 MW whose equipment has reached the end of its useful life; and (iv) power plants that have coal consumption rates that are higher than either 10% above the applicable provincial average
or 15% above the national average. The shutdown procedures have been set in place to ensure that certain smaller power plants are appropriately shutdown and replaced by larger and more efficient power plants. The purpose of such rules and
regulations is again in accord with China’s policy to achieve energy conservation and emissions reductions. The Hefei business, in which AES held a 70% interest, was shut down pursuant to this policy. A termination agreement with the offtaker
was reached and executed on March 30, 2008 and the Hefei business received a termination payment in the amount of $39 million on March 31, 2008. AES has received its shareholder’s residual value in the Hefei business and the
liquidation process of the Hefei business is expected to be completed by the end of February 2010.

On July 20, 2009,
NDRC issued theCircular on Refining the Policy for On-Grid Pricing of Wind Power(NDRC Price 2009 No. 1906), which introduces a benchmark system for on-grid tariffs for wind power replacing the existing public bidding and concession
model for wind projects. The circular provides that on-grid tariffs for onshore wind power projects approved from August 1, 2009 onwards are fixed using a centrally controlled price determination mechanism, while on-grid tariffs for offshore
wind projects will be determined separately. Under the circular, China’s onshore area is divided into four different types of wind-power resource regions, and different prices are set for each of these regions ranging from 0.51 yuan/kWh (US
cent 7.5/kWh) for wind power in regions with the best wind resources, such as Inner Mongolia, to 0.61 yuan/kWh (US cent 8.9/kWh) for regions with the worst wind resources. According to NDRC, the legislation’s intent is to standardize the wind
power price regulation and promote healthy and sustainable development of the wind-power industry. Currently, we do not expect that this newly issued circular will have a material adverse impact on our wind power businesses in China.

Czech Republic.The electricity industry in the Czech Republic is dominated by three vertically integrated companies
(“CEZ,” “E.ON” and “PRE”) that both supply and distribute power. CEZ, which owns approximately 70% of the installed capacity, produced approximately 73% of the Czech Republic’s energy in 2007. Electricity
distribution is also dominated by these three entities: CEZ (62%); E.ON (25%); and PRE (13%). There are 22 generators with installed capacity of over 50 MW and 25 generators with installed capacities between 5-50 MW, none of
which have a market share greater than 3%. In accordance with EU directives regarding market liberalization, all customers are able to select their energy supplier.

Since August 2007, the Prague Energy Exchange has been trading energy in the form of base load and peak load on a monthly, quarterly and annual basis. The majority of electricity is, however, still traded
on a bilateral basis between generators and distributors, independent traders (there are six major active traders plus more than 20 smaller traders in the market) and also between generators and final customers. In February 2008, a day-ahead spot
market was incorporated into the Energy Exchange as existed in Slovakia. As of March 2009, the Prague Energy Exchange will also include Hungary trades. AES Bohemia’s electricity, steam, water and compressed air output is governed under
bilateral contracts with industrial and municipal customers in the surrounding area.







European Union.European Union (“EU”) member states are required to
implement EU legislation, although there is a degree of disparity as to how such legislation is implemented and the pace of implementation in the respective member states. EU legislation covers a range of topics which impact the energy sector,
including market liberalization and environmental legislation. The Company has subsidiaries which operate existing generation businesses in a number of countries which are member states of the EU, including the Czech Republic, Hungary, the
Netherlands, Spain and the United Kingdom. The Company also has subsidiaries which are in the process of constructing a generation plant in Bulgaria. Bulgaria became a member state of the EU as of January 1, 2007.

The principles of market liberalization in the EU electricity and gas markets were introduced under the Electricity and Gas Directives. In
2005, the European Commission (the “Commission”), the legislative and administrative body of the EU, launched a sector-wide inquiry into the European gas and electricity markets. In the context of the electricity market, the inquiry has to
date focused on identifying issues related to price formation in the electricity wholesale markets and the role of long-term agreements as a possible barrier to entry with a view to improving the competitive situation. In January 2007, the
Commission published a proposal for a new common energy policy for Europe. In November 2008, the Commission published a non-binding second Strategic Energy Review aimed at developing the concept of a common European Energy Policy. It focused mainly
on security of supply and infrastructure development. The Strategic Energy Review proposed reviews of the Gas Storage Directive in 2010 and an update of the Oil Stocks Directives.

In October 2008, Energy Ministers reached political agreement on the “Third Liberalization Package,” which includes five pieces of
legislation, Electricity and Gas Directives, Electricity and Gas Regulations and a Regulation creating a new Agency for the Coordination of Energy Regulators, which will have limited powers to deal with cross-border interconnectors and related
issues. This legislation was formally adopted in August 2009 and must be implemented at national level by March 2011. Further legislative efforts at the EU level focused instead on the “Climate Change Package.” This package consists of
three directives (Carbon Capture & Storage, an amended EU Emissions Trading Scheme (“ETS”), and a revised Renewables Directive). The ETS and Renewable Directives have now been adopted and should enter into force at national level
in 2010. The main objectives of the Climate Change Package are usually referred to as the “20-20-20” goals:



•A 20% reduction in EU GHG emissions by 2020, as compared with 1990 levels, or 30% if other developed nations agree to take similar action by 2020;



•The ETS caps will deliver 21% GHG reduction by 2020 compared to 2005 levels, distribution will be skewed to favor lower GDP member states, and
auctioning may be phased in for some member states power sectors;



•20% increase in energy efficiency; and



•Minimum compulsory 10% target for renewable energy by 2020.

Progress in implementation of the directives referred to above varies from member state to member state. AES generation businesses in each
member state will be required to comply with the relevant measures taken to implement the directives. See “Environmental and Land Use Regulations—Air Emissions” below, for a description of these directives.

Hungary.The Hungarian market has one main interconnected system. The state-owned electricity wholesaler, MVM, is the dominant
exporter, importer and wholesaler of electricity. MVM’s affiliated company, MAVIR, is the Hungarian transmission system operator. Currently, Hungary is dependent on energy imports (mainly from Russia) since domestic production only partially
covers consumption. Magyar Energia Hivatal (“MEH”), is the government entity responsible for regulation of the electricity industry in Hungary.

The adoption of the Electricity Act by Hungary in 2007, which became effective January 1, 2008, was the final legislative step to implement a fully liberalized electricity market. By virtue of the
Electricity Act, all







customers are eligible to choose their electricity supplier. In the competitive market, generators sell capacity to wholesale traders, distribution companies, other generators, electricity
traders and eligible customers at an unregulated price.

Shortly before its accession to the EU, the Hungarian government
notified the Commission of arrangements concerning compensation to the state-owned electricity wholesaler, MVM. The Commission decided to open a formal investigation in 2005 to determine whether or not any government subsidies were provided by MVM
to its suppliers which were incompatible with the common market. In June 2008, the Commission reached its decision that the PPAs, including AES Tisza’s PPA, contain elements of illegal state aid. The decision requires Hungary to terminate the
PPAs within six months of the June 2008 publication of the decision, and to recover the alleged illegal state aid from the generators within ten months of publication. AES Tisza is challenging the Commission’s decision in the Court of First
Instance of the European Communities. Referring to the Commission’s decision, Hungary adopted act number LXX of 2008 which terminates all long-term PPAs in Hungary, including AES Tisza’s PPA, as of December 31, 2008, and requires
generators to repay the alleged illegal state aid that was allegedly received by the generators through the PPAs, and provides for the possibility to offset stranded costs of the generators from the repayable state aid. Depending on the outcome of
these events, there could be a material impact on the Company.

At the end of 2006 and for all of 2007, the Hungarian
government reintroduced administrative pricing for all electricity generators, overriding PPA pricing, including the pricing in AES Tisza’s PPA. In January 2007, AES Summit Generation Limited, a holding company associated with AES Tisza’s
operations in Hungary, and AES Tisza notified the Hungarian government of a dispute concerning its acts and omissions related to AES’ substantial investments in Hungary in connection with the reintroduction of the administrative pricing for
Hungarian electricity generators. In conjunction with this, AES Summit and AES Tisza have commenced International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (“ICSID”) arbitration proceedings against Hungary under the Energy Charter
Treaty in connection with Hungary’s reintroduction of the administrative pricing for Hungarian electricity generators. In the meantime, pursuant to the new Electricity Act in force from January 1, 2008, administrative pricing for
electricity generators was subsequently abolished.

Hungary, pursuant to act number LXVII of 2008 introduced a special tax to
be levied on energy companies including companies such as AES Tisza. The rate of the special tax is 8% and it is valid for two years, i.e., 2009 and 2010.

India.India’s power sector is regulated by the Central Electricity Regulatory Commission (“CERC”) at the national level and respective State Electricity Regulatory
Commissions (“SERCs”) at the state level. CERC is responsible for regulating interstate generation and central transmission, while intrastate generation, distribution and transmission are regulated by SERCs.

In 2003, the Government of India enacted the Electricity Act of 2003 (the “Electricity Act”) to establish a framework for a
multi-seller-multi-buyer model for the electricity industry and introduced significant changes in India’s electricity sector. In accordance with the Electricity Act, the Government of India came out with the National Electricity Policy in
February 2005 and in January 2006 published the National Tariff Policy. The policies established deadlines to implement different provisions of the Electricity Act. However, the pace of actual implementation of the reform process is contingent on
the respective state governments and SERCs, as electricity is a “concurrent” subject in India’s constitution.

Under the Electricity Act, there is no license required to set up generation plants and generators are allowed to sell to state utilities, traders, and open access consumers. The access to consumers is subject to regulatory provisions on
transmission corridor availability and payment of cross subsidy surcharge. Under the National Tariff Policy, sales since the end of 2006 from new IPP’s to distribution utilities are required to be on a competitive bidding basis. Two power
exchanges have received licenses from CERC and have started operations in the past year. However, the volume of power trading on the power exchanges is short term and small, as the bulk of power is still traded through long-term bilateral contracts.







Kazakhstan. Under the present regulatory structure, the power generation
and supply sector in Kazakhstan is mainly regulated by the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources (the “Ministry”), the Agency for Protection of Competition (the “AZK”), the Agency for Regulation of Natural Monopolies (the
“Regulator”) and the Agency for Construction and Housing services (the “Housing Agency”). The Housing Agency is a newly established state body responsible for state policy in heat generation, distribution and supply as well as
low-voltage electricity distribution. Each of the above-mentioned state bodies has the necessary authority for the supervision of the Kazakhstan power industry. However, continuous changes in the law result in certain contradictions between
different laws and regulations. This in turn results in uncertainty in the regulatory environment for the power sector.

Kazakhstan has a wholesale electricity market and regional retail markets, where generators, electricity trading companies and customers are free to sign contracts with some restrictions imposed by laws. The electricity market has a
functioning centralized trading system but contractual arrangements prevail. State-owned entities and natural monopolies are obligated to buy power through tenders and centralized trading. The wholesale transmission grid is owned by the state-owned
company KEGOC, JSC, which also acts as the system operator. The government has a plan to introduce a real-time balancing market in the near future.

In 2009, the Kazakhstan government set upper price limits for thirteen groups of power plants for the seven-year period of 2009-2015 to prevent power price hikes in case of power shortages and to help
attract investment. The power plant grouping was determined by the Ministry based on the plant type, equipment, fuel and distance from coal mines. The Ministry proposed to the government the level of price caps for each group based on the previous
year’s actual prices and level of investment required. The Ministry may propose additional annual adjustments to price caps to reflect inflation and investment requirements within any group. In cases where such price ceiling is too low to
support investment into a particular project, a power generation company may apply for an individual investment tariff. The Ministry and the Regulator have rights jointly to approve the investment programs, approve the investment tariffs and sign an
investment contract with a power plant. The legislation envisages substantial fines for any failure to implement investment programs.

The price cap and individual investment tariff regime does not constitute a price guarantee and power plants should sell to customers at the market price but not higher than their group price cap or an individual investment tariff. Only
exports of power and sale of ten percent of generation through a centralized trading system are exempt from this restriction. Power trading activities are restricted and power plants are allowed to conduct trading activities to provide electricity
supply to its customers during emergency shutdowns.

The Regulator approves and regulates all tariffs for power transmission
and distribution. Power trading companies which the AZK considers dominant entities must notify the Regulator of the proposed increase of their prices and the Regulator has the right to veto such proposed tariff increases. Further, the Regulator has
the right to request a decrease in the applicable tariffs and/or request introduction of the fixed prices for those power trading companies with a prior record of anti-monopoly violations.

The AZK recognizes all AES power plants in Kazakhstan as dominant entities in power generation of the Eastern Kazakhstan and Pavlodar
regions. In addition, AES Sogrinsk CHP and Shygys Energo Trade LLP, a retailing company managed by AES, are also considered by AZK to be dominant entities in power trading in the Eastern Kazakhstan region. These two businesses are required to notify
the Regulator about any price increases in power resale in Eastern Kazakhstan. In December 2009, the Regulator turned down an application of Shygys Energo Trade to increase the retail tariff by 37% based on technical shortcomings in the application.
As a result, the cost of power for Shygys Energo Trade appears to be 40% higher than its current retail tariff due to significant increase of all cost components (power and transmission) earlier approved by the Regulator for all generators and
transmission companies for 2010. In addition, the local Governor is requiring AES’ hydro power plants to sell 100% of its generated electricity to Shygys Energo Trade which has lead to increased debt before AES generators. AES is vigorously
challenging these actions and attempting to have Shygys Energo Trade’s retail tariff increased effective January 1, 2010 and avoid losses for Shygys Energo Trade and its generators.







In separate but related proceedings, all AES power plants in Kazakhstan are contesting their
designation as “dominant.”

Philippines. The Philippines have three major island grids—Luzon,
Visayas, and Mindanao. Luzon is the largest grid, accounting for 79% and 71%, respectively, of installed capacity and gross generation. The Luzon and Visayas grids are interconnected through undersea cables. In June 2001, the Philippines Congress
issued the Electric Power Industry Reform Act of 2001 (“EPIRA”), aiming at liberalizing the electricity sector, and transforming it from a single-buyer model in which National Power Company (“NPC”) plays a dominant role in
generation, transmission, and distribution, to a competitive market model, in which NPC is privatized and competition is introduced in generation and distribution.

The Energy Regulatory Commission (“ERC”) was created to be the governing body for the restructured power industry and to promote competition, encourage market development, ensure customer choice
and penalize abuse of market power. As part of its role, the ERC regulates the rates charged by transmission and distribution companies and as such approves cost recovery of contracts between generators and distribution companies.

The Power Sector Assets and Liabilities Management Corporation (“PSALM”) was created in July 2001 to manage the sale, disposition
and privatization of the NPC generation assets. As of 2009, PSALM has sold 3,952 MW of NPC generating assets (including the sale of the 660 MW Masinloc plant to AES), and is in the process of selling additional generation assets
representing approximately 246 MW of capacity.

EPIRA mandated PSALM to select and appoint qualified entities called
Independent Power Producer Administrators (“IPPA”) to administer and manage the energy output that has been contracted by NPC with IPPs. PSALM initially appointed three independent trading teams to act as IPPA for these contracts, but it
has now completed the process for the selling of 2,145 MW of contracted capacity. The additional sale of 1,200 MW of contracted capacity is underway.

The Wholesale Electricity Spot Market (“WESM”) started commercial operation in the Luzon grid in June 2006 with the primary objective of establishing a competitive, efficient, transparent, and
reliable spot market for electricity. The market is organized around both bilateral contracts and a mandatory pool and spot market with the spot market consisting of an hour-ahead market (ex-ante) and a real-time (ex-post) market. Each generating
unit submits hourly bids. The dispatch is arranged by the lowest to highest bid price and the spot price is set by the marginal price of the last dispatched unit following the merit order. Since AES is a merchant generator and does not have any
take-or-pay power purchase agreements, the WESM provides a secondary market for AES electricity. It also provides a source of electricity from which AES can buy electricity to meet its contractual obligations when the plant outages.

Spain.Spain is a member of the EU and as such the Spanish Government has been taking steps to liberalize the country’s
electricity sector in accordance with EU directives. Since January 1, 2003, all customers have been eligible to choose their electricity supplier.

AES currently operates and holds a 71% ownership interest in a 1,199 MW natural gas-fired plant located in Cartagena on the southeast coast of Spain. The plant sells energy into the Pan-Iberian
electricity market (“MIBEL”). The MIBEL market was created in January 2004 when Spain and Portugal signed a formal agreement. This new market allows generators in the two countries to sell their electricity on both sides of
Spanish-Portuguese border as one single market. OMEL, Spain’s energy market operator and Portugal’s equivalent, OMIP, exchanged stakes in April 2006, and were re-organized such that an electricity forwards market was created in Lisbon and
a spot market was created in Madrid.

The main transmission company, Red Eléctrica de España (“REE”)
owns 99% of the 400 kV grid and 98% of the 220 kV network. The law has been changed to ensure that REE will become the sole transmission company in Spain. REE also operates as system operator (“TSO”) and is responsible for technical
management







of the system and for monitoring transmission. Under the country’s energy infrastructure plan, REE plans to invest in strengthening the mainland grid, connecting new plants and improving
interconnection throughout the country. In due course, AES Cartagena entered into an agreement with REE for the construction of the interconnection facilities. The use of such facilities is the subject of another standard regulated contract stating
the specific terms and conditions of access.

In September 2002, the Spanish Cabinet approved a 10-year energy plan which
focuses on meeting the country’s future energy requirements. The plan also reflects reliance on renewable energy sources and cogeneration. The Spanish electricity system has seen a steady increase in the new generation capacity from renewable
energy sources for many years, particularly as a result of attractive feed-in tariffs (approved by Royal Decree 661/207). Solar PV installed capacity is said to be in the region of 3.5 GW. The increase in renewable energy generation capacity
supported by generous feed-in tariffs has led to major changes in the regulations with the aim of reducing the total cost of the feed-in tariffs for the Spanish electricity system. Partly as a result of that and also as a result of the tariff
deficit already accumulated, Royal Decree-Law 6/2009 has introduced new measures that affect AES Cartagena. The main one is the creation of a new obligation on AES Cartagena (and certain other generation companies) to pay for a portion of the cost
of providing a social subsidy to groups of economically vulnerable electricity consumers. Liability, under the AES Cartagena Energy Agreement, for this cost is currently the subject of a dispute with the Energy Manager, which has been referred to
arbitration.

For the years 2008 and 2009, the number of emissions required to be surrendered by AES Cartagena under the ETS
has been greater than the number of free emissions allocated to it. This is also expected in years 2010 to 2012. Liability, under the AES Cartagena Energy Agreement, for the cost of the shortfall in emissions is currently in dispute and is also the
subject of the above-mentioned arbitration proceedings.

In February 2006, Spain introduced a law (Article
2 of Royal Decree Law 3/2006), with effect from March 2, 2006 that an amount equivalent to the value of the CO2emission allowances allocated free of charge to electricity generators will be netted from electricity sales proceeds obtained by Ordinary Regime electricity generation such as the Cartagena
Plant. The parties obliged to pay these sums are the owners of generation facilities.

The Spanish
Government implemented Orders (Order ITC/3315/2007, introduced on December 15, 2007, and Orders ITC/1721/2009 and ITC/1722/2009, introduced on June 26, 2009) which developed the principles set out in Article 2 and set the rules applicable
for 2006, 2007 and January 1, 2008 – June 30, 2009, respectively. The effect of these legislative provisions is that all owners of Ordinary Regime generation facilities in Spain are required to pay sums equivalent to the value of the
CO2emissions allowances allocated free of charge for 2006,
2007, 2008 and the first six months of 2009. Liability, under the AES Cartagena Energy Agreement, for these costs is currently in dispute and is the subject of the above-mentioned arbitration proceedings. As for the periods after 2012, Directive
2003/87/EC establishes that power generation facilities will not be issued with allowances free of charge.

On
December 23, 2002, Cadastral Law 48/2002 was enacted which created a new category of property identified as Special Real Estate. This, together with further legislative changes (i.e., Law 51/2002 and Law 16/2007), led to the Municipality of
Cartagena increasing the relevant tax rate and the issuance by the Cadastral authorities of a new property value assessment on November 21, 2007 which resulted in an increase in the amount of Spanish property tax that is payable by AES
Cartagena in respect of the plant. Liability, under the Energy Agreement, for this increase in tax is currently in dispute and is the subject of the above-mentioned arbitration proceedings.

Turkey.The wholesale generation and distribution market in Turkey is primarily a bilateral market dominated by state-owned
entities. The state-owned Electricity Generation Company (“EUAS”) and its subsidiaries comprise approximately 24 GW of generation capacity and represent approximately 48% of the market. Private producers (with public off take) account for
another 35%, and auto producers and merchant power plants the remaining 17%. The transmission network is owned and controlled by TEIAS, the State







Transmission Company. TETAS, the Wholesale Trading Company, sets wholesale price based on average procurement costs from EUAS, auto-producers and Build Operate/Build Own Transfer/Transfer of
Operating Rights producers. This wholesale price represents the buying price for TEDAS, the State Distribution Company. Under TEDAS, there were twenty regional distribution companies. In 2006, four of them were privatized and transferred to the new
owners in 2008. Another five of them have been privatized in 2009 and are waiting approval for handover. In 2010 the Turkish Privatization Administration is planning to privatize all remaining regional distribution companies. There is also an hourly
balancing spot market, with prices typically differing from hour to hour, but typically higher than those found through TETAS, which is growing and has a capacity of 50 Gigawatt hours (“GWh”) of daily trade. The automatic price mechanism
which is meant to halt the government subsidization has been approved, and implementation commenced in July 2008. With this mechanism, all major cost items (foreign exchange, gas price increases, inflation, among others) are expected to be reflected
in the tariff. As a result, mid-term market wholesale prices are expected to converge to the current spot market prices.

Distribution companies can procure 100% of their needs from TETAS and EUAS, but can also source up to 15% from other sources. Additionally, eligible customers, using greater than 100 MWh annually, can contract with the private wholesale
companies and private power plants.

Retail electricity prices are calculated and proposed by the distribution companies and
then approved by the electricity market regulatory authority, EMRA.

Turkey has introduced a “renewable” feed-in
tariff that sets a floor for renewable generation (geothermal, wind and small scale hydro) for the first ten years of operation. The floor is between €0.050 and €0.055 per kWh and decreed by EMRA each year. AES’ Turkey hydro
assets fall under the renewable feed-in tariffs.

The Turkish Government has also announced plans to privatize all the
state-owned generation assets, other than certain large hydro-electric plants, in 2010.

Ukraine.The
electricity sector in Ukraine is regulated by the National Energy Regulatory Commission (“UNERC”). Electricity costs to end users in Ukraine consist of three main components: (1) the wholesale market tariff is the price at which the
distributor purchases energy on the wholesale market, (2) the distribution tariff covers the cost of transporting electricity over the distribution network, and (3) the supply tariff covers the cost of supplying electricity to an end user.
The total cost permitted by the regulator under the distribution and supply tariff each year is referred to as the DVA. The distribution and supply tariffs for all distribution companies in Ukraine are established by the UNERC on an annual basis, at
which time an operational expense allowance is adjusted for inflation and the tariff is adjusted for the amount of over-mandatory capital that was invested for the year and the amount of energy that was distributed. A change in the methodology was
effected at the end of 2007 with respect to the treatment of wages and salaries such that the adjustment for inflation was replaced by an allowance based on the average industrial wage in the country.

In 2006, UNERC authorized two 25% increases in end user tariffs for residential customers. Since 2006 there have been no further changes in
residential end-user tariffs. A moratorium on retail tariff increases was introduced by Presidential decree for non-residential customers, effective from December 1, 2008, which resulted in freezing of retail tariffs for the most part of
2009.The wholesale electricity market price increased by 18% in 2006, by 21% in 2007, 49% in 2008, and by 8.5% in 2009.

A
comprehensive review of the distribution tariff methodology for the calculation including the rate of return on initial investment, operational expenses treatment, and definition and valuation of the rate base was expected to take place at the end
of 2008. However, in late 2008, UNERC introduced minimal and short-term changes into the tariff methodology to be valid for 2009 and delayed a comprehensive review until 2010. Such short-term changes were implemented in 2009 and include
(a) setting rates of return on initial investment at the level of 15% after tax for 2009, (b) wages and salaries treatment remaining as per the mechanism introduced in 2007, (c) operational expenses subject to indexation by inflation
and (d) other operational expenses subject to







adjustment based on actual expenses given reasonable substantiation. In late 2009, the comprehensive review was further delayed until 2011. For 2010, major elements of the 2009 tariff methodology
were kept unchanged, including the 15% rate of return on investments. The delay is due to UNERC’s intention to develop a new methodology applicable to all distribution and supply companies. In 2011, the comprehensive tariff methodology review
is expected to take place addressing the issues of: (1) introduction of regulatory incentives to increase quality of service, (2) rate of return on investment, (3) rate base revaluation, and (4) operational expense allowance
treatment.

In 2009 the Supreme Court of Ukraine took a preliminary position affecting distribution companies in the Ukraine
including AES Kievoblenergo and AES Rivneoblenergo whereunder it required that certain network commercial losses of power that were previously treated as tax deductible could no longer be treated as such. This position, if maintained, may have a
material effect on AES Kievoblenergo and AES Rivneoblenergo. The Company expects that the Supreme Court of Ukraine may clarify its position in 2010 and the proceedings in respect of AES Kievoblenergo and AES Rivneoblenergo are not likely to be
finally resolved for another several years.

United Kingdom.AES Kilroot (“Kilroot”), is located in
Northern Ireland, which is part of the United Kingdom, and is subject to regulation by the Northern Ireland Authority for Utility Regulation (“NIAUR”). Under the terms of the generating license granted to Kilroot, the NIAUR has the right
to review and, subject to compliance with certain procedural steps and conditions, require the termination by 2010, at the earliest, of the long-term PPAs under which Kilroot currently supplies electricity to Northern Ireland Electricity plc
(“NIE”) until 2024. One such condition is that at least 180 days’ notice of such termination be given.

On
March 21, 2007, the Electricity (Single Wholesale Market) (Northern Ireland) Order 2007 was enacted, which provided for the introduction and regulation of a single wholesale electricity market for Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland
that began operation in November of 2007. The legislation grants powers to the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment, or NIAER, for a period of two years to modify existing arrangements within the electricity market in Northern Ireland,
including the power to modify existing licenses and/or require the amendment or termination of existing agreements or arrangements, to allow for the creation of a single wholesale electricity market. Modifications have been made to Kilroot’s
license and agreements to accomplish the objectives of the single market and to allow for the separation of NIE into constituent bodies and the extraction of the management of the transmission system (“SONI”) from NIE. These activities
have been completed with reasonably minimal impact and with the creation of guarantees for Kilroot from NIE upon the long-term PPAs being transferred from NIE to NIE Energy Limited.

Revenues from the new market include a regulated capacity and an energy payment based on the system marginal price. Bidding principles
restrict bids to short run marginal cost. Total annual capacity payments are calculated as the product of the annualized fixed cost of a best new entrant peaking plant multiplied by the capacity required to meet the security standard. This
accumulated capacity is then distributed on the basis of plant availability.

Despite the new market mechanisms, Kilroot has
continued to operate under its existing PPA which is able to subsist within the single wholesale market, although operating dispatch instructions are now a function of the new market inputs and system constraints and no longer the exclusive decision
of NIE. While the PPAs are in place, Kilroot (a coal-fired plant), is neutral with respect to the cost of fuel as this is passed through to its PPA counterparty as an element of the payments made to Kilroot in respect of its availability. Although
no PPAs were able to subsist, the NIAUR sought to invoke the introduction of the single electricity market (“SEM”) as a rationale for the early termination of the long-term PPAs between Kilroot and NIE Energy Limited. Kilroot challenged by
way of judicial review proceedings the determination of NIAUR that the introduction of the SEM constituted requisite arrangements to allow such early termination. The hearing took place in May 2008 and found in favor of the NIAUR. On
November 25, 2009, the NIAUR published a “Consultation Paper on Relevant Considerations in Relation to the Possible Cancellation of Generating Unit Agreements in Northern Ireland”







which is relevant to various long-term PPAs in Northern Ireland including those at Kilroot. This consultation closed on January 27, 2010 and the paper states that it has been published by
the NIAUR in order to set out and seek views on its initial thoughts on the type of issues and factors the NIAUR believes will or should inform the decision as to whether or not it should exercise its early cancellation power at the earliest
opportunity. Although this power would grant the ability to the NIAUR to terminate the long-term PPAs from 2010 provided certain procedural steps and conditions are complied with, the current expectation is that due to the value of the
CO


allowances (that passes through to the consumer while
Kilroot is under contract), the likely earliest date that cancellation would be invoked is after 2012 (when free allowances are due to cease). If the PPAs were to be cancelled post-2012, Kilroot would then become a “merchant plant” and
would operate under the gross mandatory pool operated in the SEM. The effect of this on the Kilroot business would then depend largely on the relative costs of coal and gas. Kilroot would continue to receive capacity payments under the SEM (although
at a lower rate than the availability payments under the PPAs). If the price of coal was high relative to that of gas, this could have a material adverse impact for the Kilroot business. Conversely, if the price of coal was relatively low to that of
gas, Kilroot could find this to be financially advantageous compared to the position under the existing PPAs.

Environmental and Land Use Regulations

Overview. The Company is subject to various
international, national, state and local environmental and land use laws and regulations. These laws and regulations primarily relate to discharges into the air and air quality, discharge of effluents into water and the use of water, waste disposal,
remediation, noise pollution, contamination at current or former facilities or waste disposal sites, wetlands preservation and endangered species. Many of the countries in which the Company does business also have laws and regulations relating to
the siting, construction, permitting, ownership, operation, modification, repair and decommissioning of, and power sales from, such assets. In addition, international projects funded by the International Finance Corporation, the private sector
lending arm of the World Bank, or many other international lenders, are subject to World Bank environmental standards or similar standards, which tend to be more stringent than local country standards. The Company often has used advanced
environmental technologies in order to minimize environmental impacts, including circulating fluidized bed (“CFB”) coal technologies, flue gas desulphurization technologies, selective catalytic reduction technologies and advanced gas
turbines.

Environmental laws and regulations affecting electric power generation facilities are complex, change frequently
and have become more stringent over time. The Company has incurred and will continue to incur capital costs and other expenditures to comply with environmental laws and regulations. See Item 7.—Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Capital Expenditures in this Form 10-K for more detail. If these regulations change or the enforcement of these regulations becomes more rigorous, the Company and its subsidiaries may be
required to make significant capital or other expenditures to comply. There can be no assurance that the businesses operated by the subsidiaries of the Company would be able to recover any of these compliance costs from their counterparties or
customers such that the Company’s consolidated results of operations, financial condition and cash flows would not be materially adversely affected.

Various licenses, permits and approvals are required for our operations. Failure to comply with permits or approvals, or with environmental laws, can result in fines, penalties, capital expenditures,
interruptions or changes to our operations. While the Company has at times been out of compliance with environmental laws and regulations, past non-compliance has not had a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of
operations. However, certain subsidiaries of the Company are subject to litigation or regulatory action relating to environmental permits or approvals. See Item 3.—Legal Proceedings in this Form 10-K for more detail with respect to
environmental litigation and regulatory action, including a revocation and reapproval of a new environmental permit for the Campiche project and a Notice of Violation (“NOV”) issued by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency against IPL
concerning new source review and prevention of significant deficiency issues under the U.S. Clean Air Act.







Greenhouse Gas Laws, Protocols and Regulations. In 2009, the
Company’s subsidiaries operated electric power generation businesses which had total approximate direct CO


emissions of 74.2 million metric tonnes, approximately 39.7 million metric tonnes of which were emitted in the
United States (both figures ownership adjusted). The Company uses CO


emission estimation methodologies supported by the “The Greenhouse Gas Protocol” reporting standard on GHG emissions. For existing power generation plants, CO


emissions are either obtained directly from plant continuous emission monitoring systems or calculated from actual fuel
heat inputs and fuel type CO


emission factors. The following
is an overview of both the regulations and laws that currently apply to our businesses and those that may be imposed over the next few years. Such regulations and laws could have a material adverse effect on the electric power generation businesses
of the Company’s subsidiaries and on the Company’s consolidated results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Certain of the Company’s subsidiaries are developing and implementing GHG Emissions Reduction Projects to
reduce GHG emissions and to generate GHG emissions reductions credits or offsets for use by the Company and/or for sale. There is no guarantee that these projects will be successful or that future regulatory programs will recognize such GHG
emissions reduction credits or offsets. Further, the Company does not expect the amount of any such GHG emission reductions credits or offsets to be material to its consolidated results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

International

In July 2003, the European Community “Directive 2003/87/EC on Greenhouse Gas Emission Allowance Trading” was created, which requires member states to limit emissions of CO


from large industrial sources within their countries. To do so, member
states are required to implement EC-approved national allocation plans (“NAPs”). Under the NAPs, member states are responsible for allocating limited CO



emission allowance allocations, and the costs to acquire offsets and emission allowances for compliance purposes, the Company has not to-date incurred material costs to comply with Directive 2003/87/EC
and applicable NAPs, however, there can be no guarantees that compliance will not have a material adverse effect on our business in future periods.

Legislative efforts at the EU have produced a “Climate Change Package.” This package consists of three directives—Carbon Capture & Storage, an amended EU ETS and a revised
Renewables Directive. The amended EU ETS and Renewable Directives have now been adopted and should enter into force at the national level in 2010. The main objectives of the Climate Change Package are usually referred to as the “20-20-20”
goals:



•A 20% reduction in EU GHG emissions by 2020, as compared with 1990 levels, or 30% if other developed nations agree to take similar action by 2020;







•The amended EU ETS caps will deliver 21% GHG reduction by 2020 compared to 2005 levels, distribution will be skewed to favor lower GDP member states,
and auctioning may be phased in for some member states power sectors;



•20% increase in energy efficiency; and



•Minimum compulsory 10% target for renewable energy by 2020.

Progress in implementation of the directives referred to above varies from member state to member state. AES generation businesses in each member state will be required to comply with the relevant
measures taken to implement the directives.

On February 16, 2005, the Kyoto Protocol became
effective. The Kyoto Protocol requires the industrialized countries that have ratified it to significantly reduce their GHG emissions, including CO


Even though it has been announced that the EU ETS will remain in place even if the Kyoto Protocol
expires in 2012, there remains significant uncertainty with respect to the implementation of NAPs post-2012. The EU has indicated that a portion of the emission allowances given to member states will need to be auctioned under the NAPs and the
Company cannot predict with any certainty if compliance with such programs will have a material adverse effect on its consolidated operations or results.

Countries in Latin America and Asia in which subsidiaries of the Company operate may also choose to adopt regulations
that directly or indirectly regulate GHG emissions from coal plants. For example, in April 2008 a Chilean law, was enacted that requires a percentage of all new power purchase contracts held after August 31, 2007 be supplied by renewable
sources. The Company’s subsidiary has developed a plan for complying with the law. See Regulatory Matters—Latin America—Chile. Another example is in China. One of the ways that China has chosen to address its stated goals of energy
conservation and CO


emissions reduction is by putting
regulations and procedures in place that govern the shut down of certain small coal and oil-fired power plants and encourage replacement with larger more efficient power plants. The Hefei project, formerly operated by subsidiaries of the Company in
China, was shut down pursuant to these regulations. A termination agreement with the Hefei offtaker was executed on March 30, 2008 and a subsidiary of the Company received a termination payment in the amount of $39 million on
March 31, 2008. See Regulatory Matters—Europe, Asia & Middle East—China. Although the Company does not currently believe that laws and regulations pertaining to GHG emissions that have been adopted to date in countries in
Latin America and Asia in which subsidiaries of the Company operate will have a material adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated financial condition or results of operations, the Company cannot predict with any certainty if future laws and
regulations in these countries regarding CO


emissions will
have a material adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated financial condition or results of operations.







United States—Federal Legislation and Regulation

Currently, in the United States there are no Federal mandatory GHG emissions reduction programs (including CO2) affecting the electric power generation facilities of the
Company’s subsidiaries, but there are numerous state programs and there is a possibility that federal GHG legislation will be enacted within the next several years. The U.S. House of Representatives passed federal GHG legislation in 2009, and
such legislation may be considered by the full U.S. Senate. H.R. 2454, The American Clean Energy and Security Act of 2009 (“ACESA”), was passed by the U.S. House of Representatives on June 26, 2009, and contemplates a nationwide cap
and trade program to reduce U.S. emission of CO2and other
greenhouse gases starting in 2012. A summary of key features of ACESA is set forth below:



•A planned target to reduce by 2020 GHG emissions by 17% from 2005 levels and to reduce GHG emissions by 83% from 2005 levels by 2050.



•A requirement that certain GHG emitting companies, including most power generators, surrender on an annual basis one ton of CO2equivalent allowances or GHG offset credits for each ton of annual CO2equivalent emissions. Such companies would be required to
meet allowance surrender requirements via the allocations of free allowances if available from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) or purchases in the open market at auctions if free allowances are not allocated, or otherwise.



•A mechanism under which the EPA would initially issue a capped and steadily declining number of tradable free emissions allowances to certain sections
of affected industries, including certain generators and utilities in the electricity sector, with such free distribution of allowances to the electricity sector phasing out over a five year period from 2026 through 2030.



•A provision permitting up to two billion tons of GHG offset credits in the aggregate, if available, to be purchased annually by all emitters to satisfy
the requirements above.



•A provision precluding the EPA from regulating GHG emissions under the existing provisions of the Clean Air Act (“CAA”).



•A temporary prohibition on the implementation of similar State or regional GHG cap and trade programs, with a six-year moratorium (2012 to 2017) on the
implementation or enforcement of similar GHG emission caps.



•The establishment of a combined energy efficiency and renewable electricity standard (“RES”) that would require retail electric utilities to
receive 6% of their power from renewable sources by 2012, with such requirement increasing to 20% by 2020. In certain circumstances, a portion of this requirement for renewable energy could be satisfied through measures intended to increase energy
efficiency.

The Senate introduced similar legislation on September 30, 2009 with draft bill S. 1733,
the Clean Energy Jobs and American Power Act (“CEJAPA”). CEJAPA contemplates a planned target to reduce by 2020 GHG emissions by 20% from 2005 levels and by 83% from 2005 levels by 2050. CEJAPA has been voted out of the Environment and
Public Works Committee, but it has not been set for debate on the Senate floor. It is uncertain whether CEJAPA, in a modified form or its current form, will be voted upon by the full Senate or if the Senate will pursue less comprehensive legislation
concerning GHG emissions.

At this time, if ACESA or CEJAPA were to be enacted into law, or some reconciled version of ACESA
or CEJAPA were to be enacted, the impact on the Company’s consolidated results of operations cannot be accurately predicted because of a number of uncertainties with respect to the specific terms and implementation of any such potential
legislation, including, among other provisions:



•The number of free allowances that will be allocated to subsidiaries of the Company;



•The cost to purchase allowances in an auction or on the open market, and the cost of purchasing GHG offset credits;



•The extent to which our utility business (IPL) will be able to recover compliance costs from its customers;







•The benefits to our renewables businesses from the RES provision, if any;



•The benefits to our GHG Emissions Reduction Projects from the potentially increased demand for GHG offset credits arising from GHG legislation, if any;



•The benefits from the temporary moratorium on state or regional GHG cap and trade programs, if any; and



•Whether such legislation would preempt EPA from regulating GHG emissions from electric generating units.

The EPA has proposed to regulate GHG emissions from motor vehicles in 2010 in accordance with the decision by the
Supreme Court concluding that GHG emissions could be considered a “pollutant” under the CAA and subject to regulation under the CAA. Pursuant to that decision, the EPA has a duty to determine whether CO2emissions contribute to climate change or to provide some reasonable
explanation why it will not exercise its authority. In order for the EPA to regulate CO2and other GHG emissions under Section 202 of the CAA, the EPA must determine that such emissions “endanger public health and welfare” under the CAA. On April 17, 2009, the EPA
released proposed findings for comment which included a proposed finding that atmospheric concentrations of six greenhouse gases, including CO2, “endanger public health and welfare within the meaning of Section 202(a) of the CAA.” On December 7,
2009, after review of the public comments to the proposed finding, the EPA issued the endangerment finding.

Also, in response to the Supreme Court’s decision, on July 11, 2008, the EPA issued an Advanced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking to solicit public input on whether CO


emissions should be regulated from both mobile and stationary sources under Section 202 of the CAA. On
September 28, 2009, the EPA proposed a rule to regulate GHG emissions from automobiles, a mobile source of emissions. If such rule is ultimately enacted with respect to a mobile source, one effect would be to subject stationary sources of GHG
emissions (including power plants) to regulation under various sections of the CAA. The most important impact on stationary sources would be a requirement that all new sources of GHG emissions of over 250 tons per year, and existing sources planning
physical changes that would increase their GHG emissions, obtain “new source review” permits from the EPA prior to construction. Such sources would be required to apply “best available control technology” to limit the emission of
GHGs. On September 30, 2009, the EPA proposed a rule that would limit such regulation of stationary sources to those stationary sources emitting the CO


equivalent of over 25,000 tons per year of GHGs. The Company’s coal and gas-fired U.S. power plants emit over 25,000
tons per year of GHGs and would fall within the scope of this proposed rule if they were to undertake physical changes that would increase their GHG emissions. In September of 2009, the EPA also finalized a rule mandating the widespread reporting
and tracking of GHG emissions. Although this tracking and reporting rule does not mandate reductions in GHG emissions, data generated from its implementation may facilitate the further development of federal GHG policy, which may include mandatory
GHG emissions limits.

United States – State Legislation and Regulation

Ten northeastern states have entered into a memorandum of understanding under which the states coordinate to establish
rules that require reductions in CO2emissions from power
plant operations within those states. This initiative is called the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (“RGGI”). A number of these states in which our subsidiaries have generating facilities, including Connecticut, Maryland, New York and
New Jersey, have implemented rules to effectuate RGGI. RGGI, which became effective January 1, 2009, imposes a cap on baseline CO2emissions during the 2009 through 2014 period, and mandates a ten percent reduction in CO2emissions during the 2015 to 2019 period. RGGI establishes a
cap-and-trade program whereby power plants will require a carbon allowance for each ton of CO2. Unlike the previously implemented federal sulfur dioxide (“SO2”) and NOXcap-and-trade emissions programs, RGGI requires that CO2emitters acquire CO2allowances either from a RGGI auction or in the secondary emissions trading market, except for several small set-aside
accounts for long term contracted plants and voluntary renewable energy. The auction rules include a minimum reserve price of $1.86 per allowance. This reserve price is subject to change. In addition, the auction platform and auction results are
subject to review by an independent market monitoring firm. To date, six auctions have taken







place with CO2clearing prices ranging from a high of $3.51 per allowance to a low of $2.05 per allowance. RGGI will continue to conduct quarterly auctions, and any entity can continue to buy or sell allowances in the secondary market.

The Company’s Eastern Energy business is located in New York. Under the New York RGGI rule, each budgeted source of
CO2emissions is required to surrender one CO2allowance for each CO2metric tonne emitted during a three-year compliance period. All fossil fuel powered generating facilities in
New York that have a generating capacity of 25 or more MW are subject to the rule.

The Company’s
Thames business is located in Connecticut. The State of Connecticut passed legislation, effective July 1, 2007, which requires that the Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection develop necessary regulations to implement RGGI. The
regulations adopted to implement RGGI include an auction of CO2emission allowances except for several set-aside accounts. AES Thames is eligible for a set-aside for the first compliance period, 2009-2011, which allows CO2allowances to be purchased at $2 per allowance in 2009, and $2 per allowance plus a consumer price indexing in years 2010
and 2011. Eligibility for the second compliance period, 2012-2014, is still to be determined.

The
Company’s Warrior Run business is located in Maryland. In April 2006, the Maryland General Assembly passed the Maryland Healthy Air Act which, among other thing things, required the State of Maryland to join RGGI. The Maryland Department of
Environment (“MDE”) adopted regulations that require 100% of the allowances the State receives to be auctioned except for several small allowance set-aside accounts. The Maryland MDE regulations include a safety valve to control the
economic impact of the CO2cap-and-trade program. If the
auction closing price reaches $7, up to 50% of a year’s allowances will be reserved for purchase by electric power generation facilities located within Maryland at $7 per allowance, regardless of auction prices.

The Company’s Red Oak business is located in New Jersey. The State of New Jersey adopted the Global Warming
Response Act in July 2007 which established goals for the reduction of GHG emissions in the State. In furtherance of these goals, in January 2008, additional state legislation authorized the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection
(“NJDEP”) to develop and adopt RGGI regulations and the NJDEP RGGI regulations became effective in 2008. The regulations adopted to implement RGGI include an auction of CO2emission allowances with procedures for the fixed-price sale of allowances to facilities with long-term power purchase
contracts, directs allocation of allowances to cogeneration facilities meeting specified thermal efficiency criteria, and includes a CO2allowance set-aside designed to support the voluntary renewable energy market.

In 2009, of the approximately 39.7 million metric tonnes of CO


emitted in the United States by the businesses operated by our subsidiaries (ownership adjusted),
approximately 9.7 million metric tonnes were emitted in U.S. states participating in RGGI. Over the past three years, such emissions averaged 11.1 million metric tonnes. We believe that due to the absence of allowance allocations, RGGI
could have a material adverse impact on the Company’s consolidated results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. While CO


emissions from businesses operated by subsidiaries of the Company are calculated globally in metric tonnes, RGGI
allowances are denominated in short tons. (1 metric tonne equals 2,200 pounds and 1 short ton equals 2,000 pounds.) For forecasting purposes, the Company has modeled the impact of CO


compliance based on a three-year average of CO


emissions for its businesses that are subject to RGGI and that may not be able to pass through compliance costs. The model
includes a conversion from metric tonnes to short tons as well as the impact of some market recovery by merchant plants and contractual and regulatory provisions. The model also utilizes a price of $2.05 per allowance under RGGI. The source of this
allowance price estimate was the clearing price in the sixth and most recent RGGI allowance auction held in December 2009. Based on these assumptions, the Company estimates that the RGGI compliance costs could be approximately $17.5 million per
year from 2010 through 2011, which is the last year of the first RGGI compliance period. Given the fact that the assumptions utilized in the model may prove to be incorrect, there is a significant risk that our actual compliance costs under RGGI
will differ from our estimates by a material amount and that our model could underestimate our costs of compliance.







The Company’s Southland and Placerita businesses are located in
California. On September 27, 2006, the Governor of California signed the Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006, also called Assembly Bill 32 (“A.B. 32”). A.B. 32 directs the California Air Resources Board to promulgate regulations that
will require the reduction of CO2and other GHG emissions to
1990 levels by 2020. On November 24, 2009, the California Air Resources Board released its Proposed Draft Regulation (“PDR”). The PDR contemplates a cap and trade system that will be developed in coordination with the Western Climate
Initiative (“WCI”) as detailed below. The PDR further contemplates a flexible compliance mechanism, with three-year compliance periods. The PDR also calls for the unrestricted banking of allowances (i.e., allowing allowances granted in a
particular year to be surrendered for compliance in a subsequent year).

In February 2007, the governors of the Western U.S.
states (Arizona, New Mexico, California, Washington and Oregon) established the WCI. The WCI has since been joined by two other states (Montana and Utah) and four Canadian provinces (British Columbia, Manitoba, Ontario, and Quebec). Participating
states and provinces have agreed to cut GHG emissions to 15% below 2005 levels by 2020 and they are considering the implementation of a cap-and-trade program for the electricity industry to achieve this reduction. On September 23, 2008, the WCI
issued its design recommendations for a cap-and-trade program which would apply to in-state electricity generators and the first jurisdictional deliverer of electricity into a WCI partner state. The WCI issued draft guidance on the creation of
cap-and-trade allowance budgets on November 29, 2009. The draft guidance contemplates an eventual cap-and-trade program with flexible mechanisms, such as allowance banking and offsets. The final regulatory design of this program is not yet
known.

The Company owns the utility IPL which is located in Indiana. On November 15, 2007, six Midwestern state
governors (including the Governor of Indiana) and the premier of Manitoba signed the Midwestern Greenhouse Gas Reduction Accord (“MGGRA”) committing the participating states and province to reduce GHG emissions through the implementation
of a cap-and-trade program. Three states (including Indiana) and the province of Ontario have signed as observers. The MGGRA Advisory Group has finalized a set of recommendations which are now being reviewed by the Governors of the relevant states.
The recommendations are from the advisory group only, and have not been endorsed or approved by individual Governors, including the Governor of Indiana.

The Company owns a power generation facility in Hawaii. On June 30, 2007, the Governor of Hawaii signed Act 234 which sets a goal of reducing GHG emissions to at or below 1990 levels by
January 1, 2020. Act 234 also established the Greenhouse Gas Emissions Reduction Task Force, which is tasked with developing measures to meet Hawaii’s GHG emissions reduction goal. The Task Force filed a report to the Hawaii Legislature on
December 30, 2009, strongly supporting the Hawaii Clean Energy Initiative, which calls for additional renewable energy development, increased energy efficiency, and incorporates already-enacted renewable portfolio standards. The Task Force also
evaluated other mechanisms and concluded that a state-level cap-and-trade program is inappropriate due to the small size of Hawaii’s economy.

At this time, other than the estimated impact of CO2compliance noted above for certain of its businesses that are subject to RGGI, the Company has not estimated the costs of compliance with other potential U.S. federal, state or regional CO2emissions reductions legislation or initiatives, such as A.B. 32, WCI,
MGGRA and potential Hawaii regulations, due to the fact that these proposals are in the early stages of development and any final regulations or laws, if adopted, could vary drastically from current proposals. Although complete specific
implementation measures for any federal regulations, A.B. 32, WCI, MGGRA and the Hawaiian regulations have yet to be finalized, if these GHG-related initiatives are finalized they will likely affect a number of the Company’s U.S. subsidiaries
unless they are preempted by federal GHG legislation. Any federal, state or regional legislation or regulations adopted in the U.S. that would require the reduction of GHG emissions could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s
consolidated results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.







The possible impact of any future federal GHG legislation or regulations or any regional or
state proposal will depend on various factors, including but not limited to:



•the geographic scope of legislation and/or regulation (e.g., federal, regional, state), which entities are subject to the legislation and/or
regulation (e.g., electricity generators, load-serving entities, electricity deliverers, etc.), the enactment date of the legislation and/or regulation and the compliance deadlines set forth therein;



•the level of reductions of CO2being sought by the regulation and/or legislation (e.g., 10%, 20%, 50%, etc.) and the year selected as a baseline for
determining the amount or percentage of mandated CO2reduction (e.g., 10% reduction from 1990 CO2emission
levels, 20% reduction from 2000 CO2emission levels, etc.);



•the legislative structure (e.g., a CO2cap-and-trade program, a carbon tax, CO2emission limits, etc.);



•in any cap-and-trade program, the mechanism used to determine the price of emission allowances or offsets to be auctioned by designated governmental
authorities or representatives;



•the price of offsets and emission allowances in the secondary market, including any price floors on the costs of offsets and emission allowances and
price caps on the cost of offsets and emission allowances;



•the operation of and emissions from regulated units;



•the permissibility of using offsets to meet reduction requirements (e.g., type of offset projects allowed, the amount of offsets that can be used
for compliance purposes, any geographic limitations regarding the origin or location of creditable offset projects) and the methods required to determine whether the offsets have resulted in reductions in GHG emissions and that those reductions are
permanent (i.e., the verification method);



•whether the use of proceeds of any auction conducted by responsible governmental authorities is reinvested in developing new energy technologies, is
used to offset any cost impact on certain energy consumers or is used to address issues unrelated to power;



•how the price of electricity is determined at the affected businesses, including whether the price includes any costs resulting from any new
CO2legislation and the potential to transfer compliance
costs pursuant to legislation, market or contract, to other parties;



•any impact on fuel demand and volatility that may affect the market clearing price for power;



•the effects of any legislation or regulation on the operation of power generation facilities that may in turn affect reliability;



•the availability and cost of carbon control technology;



•whether legislation regulating GHG emissions will preclude EPA from regulating GHG emissions under the Clean Air Act or preempt private nuisance suits
by third parties; and



•any opportunities to change the use of fuel at the generation facilities of our subsidiaries or opportunities to increase efficiency.

Other U.S. Air Emission Regulations.In the U.S. the CAA and various state laws
and regulations regulate emissions of air pollutants, including SO2, NOx, particulate matter (“PM”), and
mercury. The applicable rules and the steps taken by the Company to comply with the rules are discussed in further detail below.

The U.S. EPA finalized two rules that are relevant to emissions of SO2, NOx, PM and mercury from our U.S. coal-fired power plants. The first rule, the “Clean Air Interstate Rule” (“CAIR”), was promulgated by the EPA on March 10, 2005, and required allowance surrender for SO2and NOxemissions from existing power plants located in 28 eastern states and the District of Columbia. CAIR contemplated two
implementation phases. The first phase was to begin in 2009 and 2010 for NOxand SO2,
respectively. A second phase with additional







allowance surrender obligations for both air emissions was to begin in 2015. To implement the required emission reductions for this rule, the states were to establish emission allowance-based
“cap-and-trade” programs. CAIR was subsequently challenged in federal court and on July 11, 2008, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit issued an opinion striking down CAIR. On December 23, 2008, in response to motions
from the EPA and other petitioners, the Court issued an opinion and remanded the rule to the EPA without vacatur to enable the EPA to remedy CAIR’s flaws in accordance with the Court’s July opinion. The EPA plans to issue a proposed
revision to CAIR in the spring of 2010. In the interim, until EPA finalizes a new rule to replace CAIR, the Company and a number of its subsidiaries are operating subject to the remanded CAIR.

While the exact impact and cost of CAIR, any new federal mercury rules, including MACT standards for HAPs and any related state proposals
cannot be established until they are promulgated, and in the case of CAIR, until the states complete the process of assigning emission allowances to our affected facilities, there can be no assurance that any such new rules will not have a material
adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial conditions or results of operations.

The New
York State Department of Environmental Conservation (“NYSDEC”) previously promulgated regulations requiring electric generators to reduce SO2emissions by 50% below current CAA standards. The SO2regulations began to be phased in beginning on January 1, 2006 with implementation to have been completed by
January 1, 2008. These regulations also establish stringent NOxreduction requirements during the non-ozone season, rather than just during the summertime ozone season. NYSDEC has announced that both programs will be phased out due to the federal CAIR programs.

On December 23, 2009, NYSDEC published a notice of proposed rulemaking requiring the application of Reasonably Available Control
Technology (“RACT”) for reductions in NOx emissions from electric utility and industrial boilers, combustion turbines and internal combustion engines. The proposed regulations establish that sources subject to the new emission limits must
demonstrate compliance by July 1, 2012. While the exact impact and cost of the RACT for NOx cannot be established until the rules are promulgated, there can be no assurance that the Company’s business, financial conditions or results of
operations would not be materially and adversely affected by any such mandatory reductions in emissions.

In 2005, the Company
entered into a Consent Decree (the “2005 Consent Decree”) with the State of New York, and New York State Electric and Gas Corporation (“NYSEG”) which resolves violations of CAA requirements alleged to have occurred at the
Greenidge, Westover, Jennison and Hickling plants prior to the Company’s acquisition of such plants. Under the terms of the 2005 Consent Decree, the Company is required to







undertake projects to reduce emissions of certain air pollutants (“Upgrade Projects”) or to cease operations of certain electric generating units at the plants. The Company completed an
Upgrade Project at Greenidge’s Unit 4 in 2006 and a similar project at Westover’s Unit 8 in 2008 and had ceased operations of the electric generating units at Hickling and Jennison. In accordance with the 2005 Consent Decree, the Company
is required to provide notifications to the NYSDEC regarding the status of the Upgrade Projects and upon completion to propose new final emissions limits for NYSDEC’s approval. The Company has received NYSDEC approval for proposed final
emissions limits applicable to Greenidge’s Unit 4 and the Company is considering a similar proposal for Westover Unit 8. In addition, the Consent Decree also required that the non-reheat units at Greenidge and Westover, Greenidge Unit 3 and
Westover Unit 7, either undertake projects to reduce emissions of certain air pollutants, repower, or to cease operations of electric generation by December 31, 2009. Official retirement notices for both Units (Greenidge Unit 3 and Westover
Unit 7) were provided to the New York State Public Service Commission and New York Independent System Operator in 2009. The units were officially retired as of December 31, 2009.

In July 1999, the EPA published the “Regional Haze Rule” to reduce haze and protect visibility in designated federal areas. On
June 15, 2005, the EPA proposed amendments to the Regional Haze Rule that, among other things, set guidelines for determining when to require the installation of “best available retrofit technology” (“BART”) at older plants.
The amendment to the Regional Haze Rule required states to consider the visibility impacts of the haze produced by an individual facility, in addition to other factors, when determining whether that facility must install potentially costly emissions
controls. The Regional Haze Rule was further amended on October 6, 2006 when the EPA promulgated a rule allowing states to impose alternatives to BART, including emissions trading, if such alternatives were demonstrated to be more effective
than BART. States were required to submit their regional haze state implementation plans (“SIPs”) to the EPA by December 2007, but only 13 states met this deadline. EPA has yet to approve any state’s Regional Haze state implementation
plan. The statute requires compliance within five years after EPA approves the relevant SIP.

Other
International Air Emission Regulations. In Europe the Company is, and will continue to be, required to reduce air emissions from our facilities to comply with applicable EC Directives, including Directive 2001/80/EC on the limitation of
emissions of certain pollutants into the air from large combustion plants (the “LCPD”), which sets emission limit values for NOx, SO2, and particulate matter for large-scale industrial combustion plants for all member states. Until June 2004, existing coal
plants could “opt-in” or “opt-out” of the LCPD emissions standards. Those plants that opted out will be required to cease all operations by 2015 and may not operate for more than 20,000 hours after 2008. Those that opted-in,
like the Company’s AES Kilroot facility in the United Kingdom, must invest in abatement technology to achieve specific SO2reductions. Kilroot installed a new flue gas desulphurization system in the second quarter of 2009 in order to satisfy SO2reduction requirements. The Company’s other coal
plants in Europe are either exempt from the Directive due to their size or have opted-in but will not require any additional abatement technology to comply with the LCPD.

In Chile, a draft regulation has been published by the national environmental regulatory agency (“CONAMA”)
that calls for limits on certain emissions from thermal power plants, such as NOx, SO2, metals
and particulate matter. The draft regulation is currently undergoing a public hearing process under which interested parties can provide comments to CONAMA which will decide on possible further changes before the regulation is finalized and
ultimately submitted to the President for approval. If such regulation were to be enacted in its current form, the Company’s subsidiaries in Chile may need to acquire and install additional pollution control technologies over a period of
three to four years. While the exact impact and cost of any such regulation cannot be determined until it is finalized, there can be no assurance that the Company’s business, financial conditions or results of operations would not be
materially or adversely affected by any such mandatory reductions in emissions.

Water Discharges. The Company’s
facilities are subject to a variety of rules governing water discharges. In particular the Company is subject to the U.S. Clean Water Act Section 316(b) rule regarding existing power plant cooling water intake structures issued by the EPA in
2005 (69 Fed. Reg. 41579, July 9, 2004) and the subsequent







Waste Management.
