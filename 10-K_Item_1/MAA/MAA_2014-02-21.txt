MAA was formed in Tennessee in 1994.  Our corporate offices are located at 6584 Poplar Avenue, Memphis, Tennessee 38138 and our telephone number is (901) 682-6600. As ofDecember 31, 2013, we had2,151full-time employees and90part-time employees.



Merger of MAA and Colonial





The net assets and results of operations of Colonial are included in our consolidated financial statements from the closing date, October 1, 2013, throughDecember 31, 2013, the end of our fiscal year.



Reporting Segments



As ofDecember 31, 2013, we owned or had an ownership interest in275multifamily apartment communities located in14states from which we derived all significant sources of earnings and operating cash flows.  Additionally, we ownedfivecommercial properties intwostates.  Senior management evaluates performance and determines resource allocations by reviewing apartment communities individually and in the following reportable operating segments:












•Large market same store communities are generally communities in markets with a population of at least 1 million and at least 1% of the total public multifamily REIT units that we have owned and that have been stabilized for at least a full 12 months and have not been classified as held for sale. Communities are considered stabilized after achieving and maintaining at least 90% occupancy for 90 days.

•Secondary market same store communities are generally communities in markets with populations of more than 1 million but less than 1% of the total public multifamily REIT units or markets with populations of less than 1 million that we have owned and that have been stabilized for at least a full 12 months and have not been classified as held for sale. Communities are considered stabilized after achieving and maintaining at least 90% occupancy for 90 days.

•Non same store communities and other generally includes commercial properties, recent acquisitions, communities in development or lease-up and communities that have been classified as held for sale.



On the first day of each calendar year, we determine the composition of our same store operating segments for that year, which allows us to evaluate full period-over-period operating comparisons.  For financial reporting purposes, the operating results of the Colonial assets that we acquired in the Merger are within the "non-same store communities and other" reporting segment.  The legacy Colonial assets will not be eligible to be included in same store segments until January 1, 2015.  We utilize net operating income, or NOI, in evaluating the performance. Total NOI represents total property revenues less total property operating expenses, excluding depreciation and amortization, for all properties held during the period regardless of their status as held for sale. We believe NOI is a helpful tool in evaluating the operating performance of our segments because it measures the core operations of property performance by excluding corporate level expenses and other items not related to property operating performance.  During2013, we added 13 communities to our same store portfolio and moved 11 communities to our non-same store and other segment.  In addition, as a result of the Merger, we added 115 wholly-owned apartment communities and 4 commercial properties to our non-same store and other segment.



A summary of segment operating results for2013,2012and2011is included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 19. Additionally, segment operating performance for such years is discussed in Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations”, in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.



Business Objectives



Our primary business objectives are to protect and grow existing property values, to maintain a stable and increasing cash flow that will fund our dividend through all parts of the real estate investment cycle, and to create shareholder value by growing in a disciplined manner. To achieve these objectives, we intend to continue to pursue the following goals and strategies:



•effectively and efficiently operate our existing properties with an intense property and asset management focus and a decentralized structure;

•manage real estate cycles by taking an opportunistic approach to buying, selling, renovating and developing apartment communities;

•diversify investment capital across both large and secondary markets to achieve a growing and less volatile operating performance; and

•actively manage our capital structure to help enhance predictability of earnings and dividends.



2013 Highlights



•Completed the Merger.

•Core Funds From Operations, or Core FFO, for the year was $4.94 per diluted share and unit.

•Completed our inaugural unsecured public bond offering through the Operating Partnership.  The Operating Partnership issued $350 million of ten year senior unsecured notes at a coupon rate of 4.3% and an issuance price of 99.047%.

•Acquired four communities, totaling 1,137 units, during the year and sold nine communities, totaling 2,108 units.

•A joint venture in which we had a 50% interest sold Colonial Town Park, a 450,000 square foot retail center located in Smyrna, Tennessee.

•Completed the construction of two development communities during the year, and had five communities, containing 1,461 units, remaining under construction at the end of the year.












•Completed the renewal of our unsecured credit facility during the third quarter, increasing the borrowing capacity to $500 million with room for additional expansion to $800 million.



Operations Strategy



Our goal is to generate our return on investment collectively and in each apartment community by increasing revenues, controlling operating expenses, maintaining high occupancy levels and reinvesting as appropriate. The steps taken to meet these objectives include:



•providing management information and improved customer services through technology innovations;

•utilizing systems to enhance property managers’ ability to optimize revenue by adjusting rental rates in response to local market conditions and individual unit amenities;

•developing new ancillary income programs aimed at offering new services to residents, including cable, on which we generate revenue;

•implementing programs to control expenses through investment in cost-saving initiatives, including measuring and passing on to residents the cost of various expenses, including water and other utility costs;

•analyzing individual asset productivity performances to identify best practices and improvement areas;

•proactively maintaining the physical condition of each property through ongoing capital investments;

•improving the “curb appeal” of the apartment communities through extensive landscaping and exterior improvements, and repositioning apartment communities from time-to-time to enhance or maintain market positions;

•aggressively managing lease expirations to align with peak leasing traffic patterns and to maximize productivity of property staffing;

•allocating additional capital, including capital for selective interior and exterior improvements;

•compensating employees through performance-based compensation and stock ownership programs; and

•maintaining a hands-on management style and “flat” organizational structure that emphasizes senior management's continued close contact with the market and employees.



We believe that our decentralized operating structure capitalizes on specific market knowledge, provides greater personal accountability than a centralized structure and is beneficial in the acquisition and redevelopment processes. To support this decentralized operational structure, senior and executive management, along with various asset management functions, are proactively involved in supporting and reviewing property management through extensive reporting processes and frequent on-site visitations. To maximize the amount of information shared between senior and executive management and the properties on a real time basis, we utilize a web-based property management system. The system contains property and accounting modules that allow for operating efficiencies, continued expense control, provide for various expanded revenue management practices, and improve the support provided to on-site property operations. We use a “yield management” pricing program that helps our property managers optimize rental revenues, and we also utilize purchase order and accounts payable software to provide improved controls and management information.



Investment in new technologies continue to drive operating efficiencies in our business and help us to better meet the changing needs of our residents. Since its launch in October 2012, our residents have been utilizing our web-based resident internet portal on our website. Our residents have the ability to conduct business with us 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. In February 2013, we completed the roll out of online leasing renewals throughout our portfolio. As a result of transforming our operations through technology, resident’s satisfaction improved, and our operating teams have become more efficient. Web-based technologies have also resulted in declining marketing and advertising costs, improved cash management, and better pricing management of our available apartments.



In 2013, the features and functionality of our website, http://www. maac.com, were enhanced to increase a user’s engagement and search capability. Improvements included a new responsive website design, new photography, enhancements to the online web forms and improved layout of the individual MAA community homepages. We also overhauled our mobile applications. These overall enhancements have increased our web visitor traffic year-over-year to almost2.2 millionvisitors in2013, an increase of34%, with mobile traffic at1.2 millionvisitors, an increase of173%.



Acquisition Strategy



One of our growth strategies is to acquire apartment communities that are located in large or secondary markets primarily throughout the Sunbelt region of the United States. Acquisitions (and dispositions) also help us achieve our desired product mix, geographic diversification or rebalance our portfolio.  Portfolio growth allows for fixed general and administrative costs to be a smaller percentage of the overall community net operating income. We have extensive experience and research-












based skills in the acquisition of multifamily communities. We will continue to evaluate opportunities that arise, and will utilize this strategy to increase the number of apartment communities in strong and growing markets.



The following apartment communities, in addition to the115properties encompassing34,370units acquired through the Merger, were acquired for our wholly-owned portfolio during the year endedDecember 31, 2013:

(1)On August 27, 2008, we purchased 215 units of the 234-unit Village Oaks apartments located in Temple Terrace, Florida, a suburb of Tampa. The remaining 19 units had previously been sold as condominiums, and it is our intent to acquire these units if and when they become available and operate them as apartment rentals with the rest of the community. During the remainder of 2008, we acquired four of the remaining 19 units.  We acquired an additional seven units in 2009, three units in 2010, two units in 2011, and one unit in 2012.



Disposition Strategy



We sell assets that no longer meet our long-term strategy or when market conditions are favorable, and we redeploy the proceeds from those sales to develop, redevelop and acquire communities and to rebalance our portfolio across or within geographic regions. This also allows us to realize a portion of the value created through our investments and provides additional liquidity. We are then able to redeploy the net proceeds from our dispositions in lieu of raising that amount of capital externally. When we decide to sell a community, we generally solicit competing bids from unrelated parties for these individual assets and consider the sales price and other key terms of each proposal.  During2013, we disposed ofninecommunities totaling2,108units.



Development Strategy



Periodically, we invest in limited expansion development projects generally through fee-based development agreements using fixed price or cost controlled construction contracts. These contracts can have variability to cover any project cost overruns that may occur. Some development agreements require that cost overruns are contractually shared with the developer up to a specified level, while other development agreements stipulate that cost overruns are the responsibility of the developer.  While we seek opportunistic new development investments offering attractive long-term investment returns, we do not currently intend to expand into development in a significant way. We expect our investment in new development will remain a smaller component of overall growth as compared to growth through acquiring existing properties.  During2013, we incurred$53.0 millionin development costs.








































The following multifamily projects were under development as ofDecember 31, 2013(dollars in thousands):

Redevelopment Strategy



Beginning in 2005, we began an initiative of upgrading a significant number of our existing apartment communities in key markets across our portfolio. We focus on both interior unit upgrades and shared exterior amenities above and beyond routine capital upkeep in markets that we believe continue to have growth potential and can support the increased rent. During the year endedDecember 31, 2013, we renovated2,576units for a total of $11.3 million at an average rental rate that we believe was approximately11%above the normal market rate increase.



Capital Structure Strategy



We use a combination of debt and equity sources to fund our portfolio of assets, focused on producing low costs combined with a flexible capital structure. We focus on improving the net present value of our assets by generating cash flows from our portfolio of investments above the estimated total cost of debt and equity capital. We routinely make new investments when we believe it will be accretive to shareholder value. We maintain a capital structure that we believe allows us to proactively source potential investment opportunities in the marketplace.  We have structured our debt maturity schedule to avoid significant exposure in any given year and to be able to opportunistically access both secured and unsecured debt markets when appropriate.



AtDecember 31, 2013,42%of our total capitalization consisted of borrowings, including22%under our secured borrowings and20%under our unsecured credit facilities or unsecured senior notes. We currently intend to target our total debt to a range of approximately 40% to 45% of the undepreciated book value of our assets. Our charter and bylaws do not limit our debt levels and our Board of Directors can modify this policy at any time, which could allow us to become more highly leveraged. We may also issue new equity to maintain our debt within the target range. Covenants in our credit facilities limit our net-debt (total debt less cash on hand) to undepreciated book value to 60%.  As ofDecember 31, 2013, our ratio of net-debt to undepreciated book value was approximately42%.



We continuously review opportunities for lowering our cost of capital and increasing net present value per share. We havereceived an investment grade rating from all three major rating agencies.  These ratings support our plan to broaden our capital sources to include additional unsecured debt in order to take advantage of lower cost of capital in the public bond market. We evaluate opportunities to repurchase shares when we believe that our share price is significantly below our net present value. We also look for opportunities where we can acquire or develop apartment communities, selectively funded or partially funded by sales of equity securities, when appropriate opportunities arise. We will also opportunistically seek to lower our cost of capital through issuing, refinancing or redeeming preferred stock.



We have entered into sales agreements to sell shares of our common stock, from time-to-time in at-the-market offerings or negotiated transactions through controlled equity offering programs, or ATMs.  We terminated our agreement with Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Raymond James & Associates, Inc. and Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated on February 7, 2013, and on February 25, 2013, as amended and restated on November 19, 2013, we entered into distribution agreements with J.P. Morgan Securities, LLC, BMO Capital Markets Corp., KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc. and UBS Securities LLC to sell up to 4,500,000 shares of our common stock with materially the same terms as our previous ATM agreements.  As ofDecember 31, 2013, there were4,134,989shares remaining under the ATM program.














The following are the issuances of common stock which have been made through these ATM agreements throughDecember 31, 2013:

We also have a direct stock purchase plan, which allows for the optional cash purchase of common stock of at least $250, but not more than $5,000 in any given month, free of brokerage commissions and charges. We, in our absolute discretion, may grant waivers to allow for optional cash payments in excess of $5,000. During the year endedDecember 31, 2013, we issued a total of1,068shares through the optional cash purchase feature of our direct stock purchase plan, resulting in net proceeds of$68,613.



On March 2, 2012, we closed on an underwritten public offering of1,955,000shares of common stock. UBS Investment Bank and Jefferies & Company, Inc. acted as joint bookrunning managers.  This transaction resulted in net proceeds of$120.1 million.  No such issuances occurred during 2011 or 2013.



Share Repurchase Program



In 1999, our Board of Directors approved an increase in the number of shares of our common stock authorized to be repurchased to 4 million shares. As ofDecember 31, 2013, we had repurchased a total of approximately1.9 millionshares (8%of the shares of common stock and common units outstanding as of the beginning of the repurchase program). From time-to-time, we intend to repurchase shares when we believe that shareholder value would be enhanced. Factors affecting this determination include, among others, the share price and expected rates of return. No shares were repurchased from 2002 through2013under this plan.



Competition



All of our apartment communities are located in areas that include other apartment communities. Occupancy and rental rates are affected by the number of competitive apartment communities in a particular area. The owners of competing apartment communities may have greater resources than us, and the managers of these apartment communities may have more experience than our management. Moreover, single-family rental housing, manufactured housing, condominiums and the new and existing home markets provide housing alternatives to potential residents of apartment communities.



Competition for new residents is generally intense across all of our markets. Some competing communities offer features that our communities do not have. Competing communities can use concessions or lower rents to obtain temporary competitive advantages. Also, some competing communities are larger or newer than our communities. The competitive position of each community is different depending upon many factors including sub-market supply and demand. In addition, other real estate investors compete with us to acquire existing properties and to develop new properties. These competitors include insurance companies, pension and investment funds, public and private real estate companies, investment companies and other public and private apartment REITs, some of which may have greater resources, or lower capital costs, than we do.



We believe that, in general, we are well-positioned to compete effectively for residents and investments.  We believe our competitive advantages include:



•a fully integrated organization with property management, development, redevelopment, acquisition, marketing, sales and financing expertise;












•scalable operating and support systems, which include automated systems to meet the changing electronic needs of our residents and to effectively focus on our internet marketing efforts;

•access to sources of capital;

•geographic diversification with a presence in 47 markets across the country; and

•significant presence in many of our major markets that allows us to be a local operating expert.



Moving forward, we will continue to optimize lease management, improve expense control, increase resident retention efforts and align employee incentive plans with our bottom line performance. We believe this plan of operation, coupled with the portfolio’s strengths in targeting renters across a geographically diverse platform, should position us for continued operational upside in spite of a weak economic environment.  We also make capital improvements to both our apartment communities and individual apartments on a regular basis in order to maintain a competitive position in each individual market.



Environmental Matters



As part of the normal acquisition process, we obtain environmental studies on our apartment communities from various outside environmental engineering firms. As part of the due diligence process for the Colonial Merger, we reviewed the existing environmental studies and other related documents outlining any potential risk on these properties. The purpose of these studies is to identify potential sources of contamination at the apartment communities and to assess the status of environmental regulatory compliance. These studies generally include historical reviews of the apartment communities, reviews of certain public records, preliminary investigations of the sites and surrounding properties, inspection for the presence of asbestos, poly-chlorinated biphenyls, or PCBs, and underground storage tanks and the preparation and issuance of written reports. Depending on the results of these studies, more invasive procedures, such as soil sampling or ground water analysis, will be performed to investigate potential sources of contamination. These studies must be satisfactorily completed before we take ownership of an acquisition community; however, no assurance can be given that the studies or additional documents reviewed identify all significant environmental problems.  See "Risk Factors - Risks Relating to Our Real Estate Investements and our Operations - Environmental problems are possible and can be costly."



The environmental studies we received have not revealed any material environmental liabilities. We are not aware of any existing conditions that would currently be considered a material environmental liability. Nevertheless, it is possible that the studies do not reveal all environmental liabilities or that there are material environmental liabilities of which we are not aware. Moreover, no assurance can be given concerning future laws, ordinances or regulations, or the potential introduction of hazardous or toxic substances by neighboring properties or residents.



We believe that our properties are in compliance in all material respects with all applicable federal, state and local ordinances and regulations regarding hazardous or toxic substances and other environmental matters.

Tax Matters



MAA has elected to be taxed as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code. To continue to qualify as a REIT, MAA must continue to meet certain tests which, among other things, generally require that our assets consist primarily of real estate assets, our income be derived primarily from real estate assets, and that we distribute at least 90% of our REIT taxable income (other than our net capital gains) to our shareholders annually. If MAA maintains its












qualification as a REIT, MAA generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income taxes at the corporate level on its net income to the extent it distributes such net income to its shareholders annually. Even if MAA continues to qualify as a REIT, it will continue to be subject to certain federal, state and local taxes on its income and its property. In2013, MAA paid total distributions of$2.78per share of common stock to its shareholders, which was above the 90% REIT distribution requirement.



Inflation



We believe that the direct effects of inflation on our operations have been immaterial. While the impact of inflation primarily impacts our results through wage pressures, property taxes, utilities and material costs, substantially all of our leases are for a term of one year or less, which generally enables us to compensate for any inflationary effects by increasing rents on our apartments. Although an escalation in energy and food costs could have a negative impact on our residents and their ability to absorb rent increases, we do not believe this has had a material impact on our results for the year endedDecember 31, 2013.



Insurance



We carry comprehensive general liability coverage on our communities, with limits of liability customary within the multi-family apartment industry to insure against liability claims and related defense costs. We are also insured, with limits of liability customary within the multi-family apartment industry, against the risk of direct physical damage in amounts necessary to reimburse us on a replacement cost basis for costs incurred to repair or rebuild each property, including loss of rental income during the reconstruction period.
