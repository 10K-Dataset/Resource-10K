ITEM 1.BUSINESS

OVERVIEW

Founded in 1994, Mid-America Apartment Communities, Inc. is a Memphis, Tennessee-based self-administered and self-managed real estate investment trust, or REIT, that focuses on acquiring, owning and operating apartment communities in the Sunbelt region of the United States. As of December 31, 2010, we owned 100% of 151 properties representing 44,349 apartment units. As of December 31, 2010, we also had 33.33% ownership interests in Mid-America Multifamily Fund I, LLC, or Fund I, and Mid-America Multifamily Fund II, LLC, or Fund II, which owned two properties containing 626 apartment units and four properties containing 1,335 apartment units,
respectively. These apartment communities were located across 13 states.

Our business is conducted principally through Mid-America Apartments, L.P., which we refer to as our operating partnership. We are the sole general partner of the operating partnership, holding 33,188,063 common units of partnership interest, or common units, comprising a 93.8% general partnership interest in the operating partnership as of December 31, 2010. Unless the context otherwise requires, all references in this Annual Report on Form 10-K to “we,” “us,” “our,” “the company,” or “MAA” refer collectively to Mid-America Apartment Communities, Inc. and its subsidiaries.

Our corporate offices are located at 6584 Poplar Avenue, Memphis Tennessee 38138 and our telephone number is (901) 682-6600. As of December 31, 2010, we had 1,315 full time employees and 74 part time employees.

FINANCIAL INFORMATION ABOUT SEGMENTS

As of December 31, 2010, we owned or had an ownership interest in 157 multifamily apartment communities in 13 different states from which we derived all significant sources of earnings and operating cash flows. Senior management evaluates performance and determines resource allocations by reviewing apartment communities individually and in the following reportable operating segments:

•Large market same store communities are generally communities in markets with a population of at least 1 million that we have owned and that have been stabilized for at least a full 12 months and have not been classified as held for sale. Communities are considered stabilized after achieving and maintaining at least 90% occupancy for 90 days.

•Secondary market same store communities are generally communities in markets with populations of less than 1 million that we have owned and that have been stabilized for at least a full 12 months and have not been classified as held for sale. Communities are considered stabilized after achieving and maintaining at least 90% occupancy for 90 days.

•Non same store communities and other includes recent acquisitions, communities in development or lease-up, communities that have been classified as held for sale and non multifamily activities which represent less than 1% of our portfolio.









On the first day of each calendar year, we determine the composition of our same store operating segments for that year, which allows us to evaluate full period-over-period operating comparisons. We utilize net operating income, or NOI, in evaluating the performance. Total NOI represents total property revenues less total property operating expenses, excluding depreciation, for all properties held during the period regardless of their status as held for sale. We believe NOI is a helpful tool in evaluating the operating performance of our segments because it measures the core operations of property performance by excluding corporate level expenses and
other items not related to property operating performance.

A summary of segment operating results for 2010, 2009 and 2008 is included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data — Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 13. Additionally, segment operating performance for such years is discussed in Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in this annual report on Form 10-K.

BUSINESS OBJECTIVES

Our primary business objectives are to protect and grow existing property values, to maintain a stable and increasing cash flow that will fund our dividend through all parts of the real estate investment cycle, and to create new shareholder value by growing in a disciplined manner. To achieve these objectives, we intend to continue to pursue the following goals and strategies:

•effectively and efficiently operate our existing properties with an intense property and asset management focus and a decentralized structure;

•when accretive to long-term shareholder value, acquire or develop additional high-quality properties throughout the Sunbelt region of the United States;

•selectively dispose of properties that no longer meet our ownership guidelines;

•develop, renovate and reposition existing properties;

•enter into joint ventures to acquire and reposition properties; and

•actively manage our capital structure.

OPERATION STRATEGY

Our goal is to maximize our return on investment collectively and in each apartment community by increasing revenues, tightly controlling operating expenses, maintaining high occupancy levels and reinvesting as appropriate. The steps taken to meet these objectives include:

•diversifying portfolio investments across both large and secondary markets;

•providing management information and improved customer services through technology innovations;

•utilizing systems to enhance property managers’ ability to optimize revenue by adjusting rents in response to local market conditions and individual unit amenities;

•developing new ancillary income programs aimed at offering new services to residents, including, among others, cable and internet access, on which we generate revenue;

•implementing programs to control expenses through investment in cost-saving initiatives, including measuring and passing on to residents the cost of various expenses, including water and other utility costs;

•analyzing individual asset productivity performances to identify best practices and improvement areas;

•proactively maintaining the physical condition of each property through ongoing capital investments;

•improving the “curb appeal” of the apartment communities through extensive landscaping and exterior improvements, and repositioning apartment communities from time-to-time to maintain market leadership positions;

•aggressively managing lease expirations to align with peak leasing traffic patterns and to maximize productivity of property staffing;









•allocating additional capital, including capital for selective interior and exterior improvements, where the investment will generate the highest returns;

•compensating employees through performance-based compensation and stock ownership programs;

•maintaining a hands-on management style and “flat” organizational structure that emphasizes senior management's continued close contact with the market and employees;

•selling or exchanging underperforming assets;

•issuing or repurchasing shares of common or preferred stock when cost of capital and asset values permit;

•acquiring and from time to time developing properties when expected returns exceed our investment hurdle rate; and

•maintaining disciplined investment and capital allocation practices as a value investor.

Decentralized Operational Structure

We operate in a decentralized manner. We believe that our decentralized operating structure capitalizes on specific market knowledge, provides greater personal accountability than a centralized structure and is beneficial in the acquisition and redevelopment processes. To support this decentralized operational structure, senior and executive management, along with various asset management functions, are proactively involved in supporting and reviewing property management through extensive reporting processes and frequent on-site visitations. To maximize the amount of information shared between senior and executive management and the properties on a
real time basis, we utilize a web-based property management system. The system contains property and accounting modules which allow for operating efficiencies, continued expense control, provide for various expanded revenue management practices, and improve the support provided to on-site property operations. We use a “yield management” pricing program that helps our property managers optimize rental revenues and we also utilize purchase order and accounts payable software to provide improved controls and management information. We have also implemented revised utility billing processes, rolled out new web-sites enabling on-line lease applications and improved web-based marketing programs.

Intensive Property and Asset Management Focus

We have traditionally emphasized property management, and over the past several years, we have deepened our asset management functions to provide additional support in marketing, training, ancillary income and revenue management. A large majority of our property managers are Certified Apartment Managers, a designation established by the National Apartment Association, which provides training for on-site manager professionals. We also provide our own in-house leadership development program consisting of an 18-month, three-module program followed by two comprehensive case studies, which was developed with the assistance of U.S. Learning, Inc.

ACQUISITION AND JOINT VENTURE STRATEGY

One of our growth strategies is to acquire and redevelop apartment communities for our wholly-owned portfolio that are diversified over both large and secondary markets throughout the Sunbelt region of the United States and that meet our investment criteria of expected leveraged returns exceeding our investment hurdle rate, generally defined as our estimated cost of equity plus 20%. We have extensive experience and research-based skills in the acquisition and repositioning of multifamily communities. In addition, MAA will acquire newly built and developed communities that can be purchased on a favorable pricing basis. We will continue to evaluate
opportunities that arise, and will utilize this strategy to increase the number of apartment communities in strong and growing markets.

Another of our growth strategies is to co-invest with partners in joint venture opportunities to the extent we believe that a joint venture will enable us to obtain a higher return on our investment through management and other fees, which leverage our skills in acquiring, repositioning, redeveloping and managing multifamily investments. In addition, the joint venture investment strategy can provide a platform for creating more capital









diversification and lower investment risk for us. At present, we have focused our joint venture investment strategy on properties seven years old or older, with younger acquisitions becoming part of the wholly-owned portfolio.

As of December 31, 2010, we were partners in two joint ventures: Mid-America Multifamily Fund I, LLC, or Fund I, and Mid-America Multifamily Fund II, LLC, or Fund II.

The following apartment communities were acquired during the year ended December 31, 2010:

(1)On August 27, 2008, we purchased 215 units of the 234-unit Village Oaks apartments located in Temple Terrace, Florida, a suburb of Tampa. The remaining 19 units had previously been sold as condominiums and it is our intent to acquire these units if and when they become available, and operate them as apartment rentals with the rest of the community. During the remainder of 2008, we acquired four of the remaining 19 units and in 2009 we acquired an additional seven units.

(2)Legacy at Western Oaks was acquired by MAA on December 30, 2009 and was later contributed to Fund II on January 28, 2010.

DISPOSITION STRATEGY

We have one of the younger portfolios in the multifamily REIT sector, and strive to maintain a young portfolio of our assets in excellent condition, believing that continuous capital replacement and maintenance will lead to higher long-run returns on investment. From time-to-time, we dispose of mature assets, defined as those apartment communities that no longer meet our investment criteria and long-term strategic objectives, to ensure that our portfolio consists primarily of high quality, well-located properties within our market area. Typically, we select assets for disposition that do not meet our present investment criteria, including estimated
future return on investment, location, market, potential for growth and capital needs. From time-to-time we also may dispose of assets for which we receive an offer meeting or exceeding our return on investment criteria even though those assets may not meet the disposition criteria disclosed above. We did not sell any apartment communities in 2010.

RENOVATION, REPOSITIONING AND DEVELOPMENT STRATEGY

Periodically, we invest in limited expansion development projects using fixed price contracts. In October 2010, we purchased land in Franklin (Nashville), Tennessee and entered into an agreement to develop a 428-unit apartment community on the site. Construction began in late 2010, but no units were completed by the end of the year. During 2011, we also plan to begin developing a phase II to the 1225 South Church apartments in Charlotte, North Carolina that were purchased in December 2010. While we seek opportunistic









new development investments offering superior locations with attractive long-term investment returns, we do not currently intend to maintain a dedicated development staff or to expand into development in a significant way. We expect our investment in new development will remain a smaller component of overall growth as compared to growth through acquiring existing properties.

Beginning in 2005, we began an initiative of upgrading a significant number of our existing apartment communities in key markets across our portfolio. We focus on both interior unit upgrades and shared exterior amenities above and beyond routine capital upkeep in markets that we feel continue to have growth potential and can support the increased rent. During the year ended December 31, 2010, we renovated 1,760 units achieving a combined 10.6% rent increase above the normal renewal rate.

CAPITAL STRUCTURE STRATEGY

We use a combination of debt and equity sources to fund our portfolio of assets, focused on producing the overall lowest cost and most flexible capital structure. We focus on improving the net present value of each share of our common stock by generating cash flows from our portfolio of investments above the estimated total cost of debt and equity capital. We routinely make new investments when we believe it can add to value per share. In the past, we have sold assets to fund share repurchases when, in management’s view, shareholder value would be enhanced.

At December 31, 2010, 39% of our total capitalization consisted of borrowings. We currently intend to target our total debt to a range of approximately 45% to 55% of the undepreciated book value of our assets, although our charter and bylaws do not limit our debt levels. We may issue new equity to maintain our debt within this target range. Circumstances may cause us to exceed that target from time-to-time. As of December 31, 2010, our ratio of debt to undepreciated book value was approximately 49%. Our Board of Directors can modify this policy at any time, which could allow us to become more highly leveraged but may decrease our ability to make
distributions to our shareholders.

We continuously review opportunities for lowering our cost of capital, and increasing net present value per share. We evaluate opportunities to repurchase stock when we believe that our stock price is below our net present value. We also look for opportunities where we can acquire or develop apartment communities, selectively funded or partially funded by stock sales, when the investment return is projected to substantially exceed our cost of capital. We will also opportunistically seek to lower our cost of capital through issuing, refinancing or redeeming preferred stock as we did in 2010.

MAA has entered into sales agreements with Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Raymond James & Associates, Inc. and Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated to sell shares of MAA’s common stock, from time-to-time in at-the-market offerings or negotiated transactions through controlled equity offering programs, or ATMs.

The following are the issuances of common stock, which have been made through these agreements through December 31, 2010:

We also have a direct stock purchase plan, which allows for the optional cash purchase of common stock of at least $250, but not more than $5,000 in any given month, free of brokerage commissions and charges. We, in our absolute discretion, may grant waivers to allow for optional cash payments in excess of $5,000. During the year ended December 31, 2010, we issued a total of 551,895 shares through the optional cash purchase feature of our direct stock purchase plan, resulting in net proceeds of $30.0 million.









On June 2, 2010, we redeemed 3,100,001 shares of the 6,200,000 issued and outstanding shares of our 8.30% Series H Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock, or Series H. On August 5, 2010, we redeemed the remaining 3,099,999 shares of the issued and outstanding Series H. The Series H shares were redeemed for a $25 per share redemption price plus any accrued and unpaid dividends through and including the respective redemption date. The redemptions were funded by proceeds through issuances of our common shares through our ATM programs and Dividend and Distribution Reinvestment and Share Purchase Plan, or DRSPP.

SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM

In 1999, our Board of Directors approved an increase in the number of shares of our common stock authorized to be repurchased to 4 million shares. As of December 31, 2010, Mid-America had repurchased a total of approximately 1.86 million shares (8% of the shares of common stock and common units outstanding as of the beginning of the repurchase program). From time-to-time, we intend to repurchase shares when we believe that shareholder value is enhanced. Factors affecting this determination include, among others, the share price, financing agreements and rates of return. No shares were repurchased from 2002 through 2010 under this plan.

COMPETITION

All of our apartment communities are located in areas that include other apartment communities. Occupancy and rental rates are affected by the number of competitive apartment communities in a particular area. The owners of competing apartment communities may have greater resources than us, and the managers of these apartment communities may have more experience than our management. Moreover, single-family rental housing, manufactured housing, condominiums and the new and existing home markets provide housing alternatives to potential residents of apartment communities.

Apartment communities compete on the basis of monthly rent, discounts and facilities offered, such as apartment size and amenities, and apartment community amenities, including recreational facilities, resident services and physical property condition. We make capital improvements to both our apartment communities and individual apartments on a regular basis in order to maintain a competitive position in each individual market.

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS

As part of the acquisition process, we obtain environmental studies on all of our apartment communities from various outside environmental engineering firms. The purpose of these studies is to identify potential sources of contamination at the apartment communities and to assess the status of environmental regulatory compliance. These studies generally include historical reviews of the apartment communities, reviews of certain public records, preliminary investigations of the sites and surrounding properties, visual inspection for the presence of asbestos, poly-chlorinated biphenyls, or PCBs, and underground storage tanks and the preparation and
issuance of written reports. Depending on the results of these studies, more invasive procedures, such as soil sampling or ground water analysis, will be performed to investigate potential sources of contamination. These studies must be satisfactorily completed before we take ownership of an acquisition community; however, no assurance can be given that the studies identify all significant environmental problems.

Under various federal, state and local laws and regulations, an owner or operator of real estate may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of certain hazardous or toxic substances on properties. Such laws often impose such liability without regard to whether the owner caused or knew of the presence of hazardous or toxic substances and whether the storage of such substances was in violation of a resident’s lease. Furthermore, the cost of remediation and removal of such substances may be substantial, and the presence of such substances, or the failure to promptly remediate such substances, may adversely affect the owner’s ability
to sell such real estate or to borrow using such real estate as collateral.

We are aware of environmental concerns specifically relating to potential issues resulting from mold in residential properties and have in place an active management and preventive maintenance program that includes procedures specifically related to mold. We have established a policy requiring residents to sign a mold addendum to lease. We also have a $5 million insurance policy that covers remediation and exposure to mold. Therefore, we believe that our exposure to this issue is limited and controlled.









The environmental studies we received have not revealed any material environmental liabilities. We are not aware of any existing conditions that would currently be considered an environmental liability. Nevertheless, it is possible that the studies do not reveal all environmental liabilities or that there are material environmental liabilities of which we are not aware. Moreover, no assurance can be given concerning future laws, ordinances or regulations, or the potential introduction of hazardous or toxic substances by neighboring properties or residents.

We believe that our apartment communities are in compliance in all material respects with all applicable federal, state and local ordinances and regulations regarding hazardous or toxic substances and other environmental matters.

QUALIFICATION AS A REAL ESTATE INVESTMENT TRUST

We have elected to be taxed as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code. To continue to qualify as a REIT, we must continue to meet certain tests which, among other things, generally require that our assets consist primarily of real estate assets, our income be derived primarily from real estate assets, and that we distribute at least 90% of our REIT taxable income (other than our net capital gain) to our shareholders annually. As a qualified REIT, we generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income taxes at the corporate level on our net income to the extent we distribute such net income to our shareholders
annually. Even if we continue to qualify as a REIT, we will continue to be subject to certain federal, state and local taxes on our income and our property. In 2010, we paid total distributions of $2.46 per common share to our shareholders, which was above the 90% REIT distribution requirement.
