Item 1. Business

Overview

Marathon Petroleum Corporation (“MPC”) was incorporated in Delaware on November 9, 2009. We have127years of experience in the energy business with roots tracing back to the formation of the Ohio Oil Company in 1887. We are one of the largest independent petroleum product refining, marketing, retail and transportation businesses in the United States and the largest east of the Mississippi. Our operations consist of three reportable operating segments: Refining & Marketing; Speedway; and Pipeline Transportation. Each of these segments is organized and managed based upon the nature of the products and services it offers.

•Refining & Marketing—refines crude oil and other feedstocks at oursevenrefineries in the Gulf Coast and Midwest regions of the United States, purchases refined products and ethanol for resale and distributes refined products through various means, including barges, terminals and trucks that we own or operate. We sell refined products to wholesale marketing customers domestically and internationally, buyers on the spot market, our Speedway®business segment and to independent entrepreneurs who operate Marathon®retail outlets.

•Speedway—sells transportation fuels and convenience products in the retail market in the Midwest, East Coast and Southeast.

•Pipeline Transportation—transports crude oil and other feedstocks to our refineries and other locations, delivers refined products to wholesale and retail market areas and includes the aggregated operations of MPLX LP.

See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Note11for operating segment and geographic financial information, which is incorporated herein by reference.

Corporate History and Structure

MPC was incorporated in 2009 in connection with an internal restructuring of Marathon Oil Corporation (“Marathon Oil”). On May 25, 2011, the Marathon Oil board of directors approved the spinoff of its Refining, Marketing & Transportation Business (“RM&T Business”) into an independent, publicly traded company, MPC, through the distribution of MPC common stock to the stockholders of Marathon Oil common stock on June 30, 2011 (the “Spinoff”). Following the Spinoff, Marathon Oil retained no ownership interest in MPC, and each company had separate public ownership, boards of directors and management. All subsidiaries and equity method investments not contributed by Marathon Oil to MPC remained with Marathon Oil and, together with Marathon Oil, are referred to as the “Marathon Oil Companies.” On July 1, 2011, our common stock began trading “regular-way” on the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) under the ticker symbol “MPC.”

Recent Developments

On September 30, 2014, we acquired from Hess Corporation (“Hess”) all of its retail locations, transport operations and shipper history on various pipelines, including approximately40thousand barrels per day (“mbpd”) on Colonial Pipeline, for$2.82 billion. We refer to these assets as “Hess’ Retail Operations and Related Assets” and substantially all of these assets are part of our Speedway segment. This acquisition significantly expands our Speedway presence fromnineto22states throughout the East Coast and Southeast and is aligned with our strategy to grow higher-valued, stable cash flow businesses. This acquisition also enables us to further leverage our integrated refining and transportation operations, providing an outlet for an incremental200mbpd of assured sales from our refining system. The transaction was funded with a combination of debt and available cash. Our financial results and operating statistics for the periods prior to the acquisition do not include amounts for Hess’ Retail Operations and Related Assets.

In July 2014, we exercised our option to acquire a 35 percent ownership interest in Enbridge Inc.’s Southern Access Extension (“SAX”) pipeline, which will run from Flanagan, Ill. to Patoka, Ill. and is expected to be operational in late 2015. This option resulted from our agreement to be the anchor shipper on the SAX pipeline and our commitment to the Sandpiper pipeline project as discussed below. During2014, we made contributions of$120 millionto Illinois Extension Pipeline Company, LLC (“Illinois Extension Pipeline”) to fund our portion of the construction costs incurred-to-date on the SAX pipeline project.

On April 1, 2014, we purchased a facility in Cincinnati, Ohio from Felda Iffco Sdn Bhd, Malaysia for$40 million. The plant currently produces biodiesel, glycerin and other by-products. The capacity of the plant is approximately60 milliongallons per year.









In March 2014, we acquired from Chevron Raven Ridge Pipe Line Company an additionalseven percentinterest in Explorer Pipeline Company (“Explorer”) for$77 million, bringing our ownership interest to25 percent. Explorer owns approximately 1,900 miles of refined products pipeline from Lake Charles, Louisiana to Hammond, Indiana.

In November 2013, we agreed with Enbridge Energy Partners L.P. (“Enbridge Energy Partners”) to serve as an anchor shipper for the Sandpiper pipeline, which will run from Beaver Lodge, North Dakota to Superior, Wisconsin. We also agreed to fund37.5 percentof the construction of the Sandpiper pipeline project, which is currently estimated to cost $2.6 billion, of which approximately $1.0 billion is our share. We made contributions of$192 millionduring2014and have contributed$216 millionsince project inception. In exchange for our commitment to be an anchor shipper and our investment in the project, we will earn an approximate 27 percent equity interest in Enbridge Energy Partners’ North Dakota System when the Sandpiper pipeline is placed into service, which is expected to be in 2017. Enbridge Energy Partners’ North Dakota System currently includes approximately 240 miles of crude oil gathering pipelines connected to a transportation pipeline that is approximately 730 miles long. We will also have the option to increase our ownership interest to approximately 30 percent through additional investments in future system improvements.

OnAugust 1, 2013, we acquired from Mitsui & Co. (U.S.A.), Inc. its interests inthreeethanol companies for$75 million. Under the purchase agreement, we acquired an additional24 percentinterest in The Andersons Clymers Ethanol LLC (“TACE”), bringing our ownership interest to60 percent; a34 percentinterest in The Andersons Ethanol Investment LLC (“TAEI”), which holds a50 percentownership in The Andersons Marathon Ethanol LLC (“TAME”), bringing our direct and indirect ownership interest in TAME to67 percent; and a40 percentinterest in The Andersons Albion Ethanol LLC (“TAAE”), which owns an ethanol production facility in Albion, Michigan. On October 1, 2013, our ownership interest in TAAE increased to43 percentas a result of TAAE acquiring one of the owner’s interest.

On February 1, 2013, we acquired from BP Products North America Inc. and BP Pipelines (North America) Inc. (collectively, “BP”) the 451,000 barrel per calendar day refinery in Texas City, Texas, three intrastate natural gas liquid pipelines originating at the refinery, four light product terminals, branded-jobber marketing contract assignments for the supply of approximately 1,200 branded sites, a 1,040 megawatt electric cogeneration facility and a 50 mbpd allocation of space on the Colonial Pipeline. We refer to these assets as the “Galveston Bay Refinery and Related Assets.” We paid $1.49 billion for these assets, which included $935 million for inventory. Pursuant to the purchase and sale agreement, we may also be required to pay BP a contingent earnout of up to an additional $700 million over six years, subject to certain conditions. In July 2014, we paid BP$180 millionfor the first period’s contingent earnout. These assets are part of our Refining & Marketing and Pipeline Transportation segments. Our financial results and operating statistics for the periods prior to the acquisition do not include amounts for the Galveston Bay Refinery and Related Assets.

See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Note5for additional information on these acquisitions and investments. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Note26for information regarding our future contributions to the SAX pipeline project and the Sandpiper pipeline project.

MPLX LP

In 2012, we formed MPLX LP (“MPLX”), a master limited partnership, to own, operate, develop and acquire pipelines and other midstream assets related to the transportation and storage of crude oil, refined products and other hydrocarbon-based products. On October 31, 2012, MPLX completed its initial public offering of 19.9 million common units, which represented the sale by us of a 26.4 percent interest in MPLX.

As ofDecember 31, 2014, we owned a71.5 percentinterest in MPLX, including thetwo percentgeneral partner interest, and we consolidate this entity for financial reporting purposes since we have a controlling financial interest.

MPLX’s initial assets consisted of a51 percentgeneral partner interest in MPLX Pipe Line Holdings LP (“Pipe Line Holdings”), which owns a network of common carrier crude oil and product pipeline systems and associated storage assets in the Midwest and Gulf Coast regions of the United States, and a100 percentinterest in a butane storage cavern in West Virginia. We originally retained a 49 percent limited partner interest in Pipe Line Holdings.

On May 1, 2013, we sold afive percentinterest in Pipe Line Holdings to MPLX for$100 million, which was financed by MPLX with cash on hand.

On March 1, 2014, we sold MPLX a13 percentinterest in Pipe Line Holdings for$310 million. MPLX financed this transaction with$40 millionof cash on-hand and$270 millionof borrowings on its bank revolving credit agreement.









On October 30, 2014, we announced plans to substantially accelerate the growth of MPLX, which is expected to provide unitholders an average annual distribution growth rate percentage in the mid-20s over the next five years as we build meaningful scale more quickly. We believe this increased scale provides MPLX greater flexibility to fund organic projects and to pursue acquisition opportunities.

On December 1, 2014, we sold and contributed interests in Pipe Line Holdings totaling30.5 percentto MPLX for$600 millionin cash and2.9 millionMPLX common units valued at$200 million. MPLX financed the sales portion of this transaction with$600 millionof borrowings on its bank revolving credit facility.

On December 8, 2014, MPLX completed a public offering of3.5 millioncommon units at a price to the public of$66.68per common unit, with net proceeds of$221 million. MPLX used the net proceeds from this offering to repay borrowings under its bank revolving credit facility and for general partnership purposes. On December 10, 2014, we exercised our right to maintain our two percent general partner interest in MPLX by purchasing130 thousandgeneral partner units for$9 million.



On February 12, 2015, MPLX completed its initial underwritten public offering of $500 million aggregate principal amount of four percent unsecured senior notes due February 15, 2025 (the “Senior Notes”). The Senior Notes were offered at a price to the public of 99.64 percent of par. The net proceeds of this offering were used to repay the amounts outstanding under its bank revolving credit facility, as well as for general partnership purposes.

See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Note4for additional information on MPLX.



Our Competitive Strengths

High Quality Refining Assets

We believe we are the largest crude oil refiner in the Midwest and the fourth largest in the United States based on crude oil refining capacity. We own aseven-plant refinery network, with approximately1.7million barrels per calendar day (“mmbpcd”) of crude oil throughput capacity. Our refineries process a wide range of crude oils, including heavy and sour crude oils, which can generally be purchased at a discount to sweet crude oil, and produce transportation fuels such as gasoline and distillates, specialty chemicals and other refined products. While we have historically processed significant quantities of heavy and sour crude oils, our refineries have the ability to process up to 68 percent light sweet crude oils.

Strategic Location

The geographic locations of our refineries provide us with strategic advantages. Located in Petroleum Administration for Defense District (“PADD”) II and PADD III, which consist of states in the Midwest and the Gulf Coast regions of the United States, our refineries have the ability to procure crude oil from a variety of supply sources, including domestic, Canadian and other foreign sources, which provides us with flexibility to optimize crude supply costs. For example, geographic proximity to various United States shale oil regions and Canadian crude oil supply sources allows our refineries access to price-advantaged crude oils and lower transportation costs than certain of our competitors. Our refinery locations and midstream distribution system also allow us to access refined product export markets and to serve a broad range of key end-user markets across the United States quickly and cost-effectively.











*As ofDecember 31, 2014

Extensive Midstream Distribution Networks

Our assets give us extensive flexibility and optionality to respond promptly to dynamic market conditions, including weather-related and marketplace disruptions. We believe the relative scale of our transportation and distribution assets and operations distinguishes us from other refining and marketing companies. We currently own, lease or have ownership interests in approximately8,300miles of crude oil and products pipelines. Through our ownership interests in MPLX, we are one of the largest petroleum pipeline companies in the United States on the basis of total volume delivered. We also own one of the largestprivate domestic fleets of inland petroleum product barges and one of the largest terminal operations in the United States, as well as trucking and rail assets. We operate this system in coordination with our refining and marketing network, which enables us to optimize feedstock and other raw material supplies and refined product distribution, and further allows for important economies of scale across our system.









General Partner and Sponsor of MPLX

Our investment in MPLX should allow us to enhance our share price through our limited partner and general partner interests which tend to receive higher market multiples. MPLX also provides us an efficient vehicle to invest in organic projects and pursue acquisitions of midstream assets. MPLX’s significant liquidity and access to the capital markets should provide us a strong foundation to execute our strategy for growing our midstream logistics business. Our role as the general partner allows us to maintain strategic control of the assets so we can continue to optimize our refinery feedstock and distribution networks. We have an extensive portfolio of midstream assets that can potentially be sold and/or contributed to MPLX, providing MPLX with a competitive advantage. As ofDecember 31, 2014, these assets included:

•approximately5,400miles of crude oil and products pipelines that MPC owns, leases or has an ownership interest;

•19owned or leased inland towboats and211owned or leased inland barges;

•63owned and operated light product terminals with approximately20 millionbarrels of storage capacity and192loading lanes;

•18owned and operated asphalt terminals with approximately5 millionbarrels of storage capacity and65loading lanes;

•oneleased andtwonon-operated, partially-owned light product terminals;

•2,210owned or leased railcars;

•59 millionbarrels of tank and cavern storage capacity at our refineries;

•25rail and24truck loading racks at our refineries;

•sevenowned and11non-owned docks at our refineries;

•a condensate splitter at our Canton refinery; and

•approximately 20 billion gallons of fuels distribution.

We continue to focus resources on growing this portfolio of midstream assets, including investments in the Sandpiper and SAX pipeline projects and a condensate splitter project at our Catlettsburg refinery. We broadly estimate these assets and growth projects can generate annual earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”) of $1.6 billion. See Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for additional information on these pipeline investments.

Competitively Positioned Marketing Operations

We are one of the largest wholesale suppliers of gasoline and distillates to resellers within our market area. We have two strong retail brands: Speedway®and Marathon®. We believe that Speedway LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary, operates the second largest chain of company-owned and operated retail gasoline and convenience stores in the United States, with approximately2,750convenience stores in22states throughout the Midwest, East Coast and Southeast. The Marathon brand is an established motor fuel brand in the Midwest and Southeast regions of the United States, comprised of approximately5,460retail outlets operated by independent entrepreneurs in19states as ofDecember 31, 2014. In addition, as part of the acquisition of the Galveston Bay Refinery and Related Assets in 2013 and Hess’ Retail Operations and Related Assets in 2014, we obtained retail marketing contracts that provide us with the opportunity to convert the associated retail outlets to the Marathon brand. As ofDecember 31, 2014, we had outstanding retail marketing contract assignments for approximately590retail outlets. We believe our distribution system allows us to maximize the sales value of our products and minimize cost.

Attractive Growth Opportunities

We believe we have attractive growth opportunities. Our capital and investment budget for 2015 of$2.53 billionincludes$1.28 billionfor the Refining & Marketing segment (which includes$234 millionfor midstream investments),$452 millionfor the Speedway segment and$659 millionfor the Pipeline Transportation segment.

Our Refining & Marketing segment’s midstream investments include building condensate splitters at our Canton, Ohio and Catlettsburg, Kentucky refineries to increase our capacity to process condensate from the Utica Shale region. The condensate splitter at our Canton refinery began operation at the end of 2014 and we expect to complete the condensate splitter at our Catlettsburg refinery in 2015. Our Refining & Marketing segment’s investments also include refining margin enhancement projects, including projects to further capture synergies at our Galveston Bay refinery, increase our distillate production, expand our export capacity and increase our capacity to process condensates and light crude oils.

Our Speedway segment investments include converting and integrating Hess’ Retail Operations and Related Assets, constructing new convenience stores and rebuilding existing locations. We also anticipate acquiring high quality stores through opportunistic acquisitions.









Our Pipeline Transportation segment’s midstream investments include investments in equity interests in the Sandpiper and SAX pipeline projects that will transport crude oil from growing North American hydrocarbon production regions to our refineries. MPLX is also pursuing the Cornerstone pipeline project, which will connect the Utica Shale production to our Canton, Ohio refinery. There are also potential opportunities for additional build-out projects to provide transportation solutions from the Utica Shale region to a wide range of markets.

Established Track Record of Profitability and Diversified Income Stream

We have demonstrated an ability to achieve positive financial results throughout all stages of the refining cycle. We believe our business mix and strategies position us well to continue to achieve competitive financial results. Income generated by our Speedway segment, which was significantly expanded with the acquisition of Hess’ Retail Operations and Related Assets, and our Pipeline Transportation segment is less sensitive to business cycles while our Refining & Marketing segment enables us to generate significant income and cash flow when market conditions are more favorable.

Strong Financial Position

As ofDecember 31, 2014, we had$1.49 billionin cash and cash equivalents and$3.80 billionin unused committed borrowing facilities, excluding MPLX’s credit facility. We had$6.64 billionof debt at year-end, which represented37percent of our total capitalization. This combination of strong liquidity and manageable leverage provides financial flexibility to fund our growth projects and to pursue our business strategies.



Our Business Strategies

Achieve and Maintain Top-Tier Safety and Environmental Performance

We remain committed to operating our assets in a safe and reliable manner and targeting continuous improvement in our safety record across all of our operations. We have a history of safe and reliable operations, which was demonstrated again in 2014 with a solid performance compared to the industry average. Four of our refineries have earned designation as a U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (“OSHA”) Voluntary Protection Program (“VPP”) Star site. In addition, we remain committed to environmental stewardship by continuing to improve the efficiency and reliability of our operations. We proactively address our regulatory requirements and encourage our operations to improve their environmental performance, with our 2014 designated environmental incidents showing an additional 15 percent reduction over 2013 results. Our Robinson, Illinois refinery had no significant designated environmental incidents in 2014, and our Galveston Bay refinery achieved further reduction of approximately 87 percent in designated environmental incidents since we acquired it on February 1, 2013.

Grow Higher-Valued, Stable Cash Flow Businesses

We intend to allocate significantly more capital to grow our midstream and retail businesses. These businesses typically have more predictable and stable income and cash flows compared to our refining operations and we believe investors assign a higher value to businesses with stable cash flows. Our capital and investment budget for 2015 includes investments in both our Refining & Marketing and Pipeline Transportation segments related to midstream assets. We have budgeted$234 millionfor midstream assets that are part of the Refining & Marketing segment,$659 millionfor the Pipeline Transportation segment and$452 millionfor the Speedway segment.

We plan to substantially accelerate the growth of MPLX and intend to evolve it into a large cap, diversified MLP. We intend to increase revenue on the MPLX network of pipeline systems through higher utilization of existing assets, by capitalizing on organic investment opportunities that may arise from the growth of MPC’s operations and from increased third-party activity in MPLX’s areas of operations. We also plan to pursue acquisitions of midstream assets through MPLX, both within our existing geographic footprint and in new areas. We expect there will continue to be significant investments in infrastructure to connect growing North American crude oil production with existing refining assets and to move refined products to wholesale and retail marketing customers. We intend to aggressively participate in this infrastructure build-out and grow our midstream business primarily through MPLX.

We significantly expanded Speedway’s presence along the East Coast and Southeast through our acquisition of Hess’ Retail Operations and Related Assets. We intend to continue growing Speedway’s sales and profitability by focusing on the conversion and integration of these locations, from which we expect to realize increased merchandise sales and other synergies. We also remain focused on organic growth through constructing new stores, rebuilding old stores, acquiring high quality stores through opportunistic acquisitions and improving margins at our existing operations. We have identified numerous opportunities for new convenience stores or store rebuilds in our existing market, western Pennsylvania and Tennessee. In addition, our highly successful Speedy Rewards®customer loyalty program, which has more than3.9 millionactive members as ofDecember 31, 2014, provides us with a unique competitive advantage and opportunity to increase our Speedway customer base with existing and new Speedway locations, including the stores recently acquired from Hess.









Deliver Top Quartile Refining Performance

Our refineries are well positioned to benefit from the growing crude oil and condensate production in North America, including the Bakken, Eagle Ford and Utica Shale regions, along with the Canadian oil sands. We are also well positioned to export distillates, gasoline and other products.

We intend to enhance our margins in the Refining & Marketing segment by capturing synergies at our Galveston Bay refinery, increasing our condensate and light crude oil processing capacity, growing our distillate production and expanding our exports. For example, we recently completed construction of a condensate splitter at our Canton refinery and we have a project underway to increase condensate processing capacity at our Catlettsburg refinery. We also have projects to increase light crude oil processing capacity at our Robinson refinery, to increase distillate production at our Garyville, Louisiana; Galveston Bay and Robinson refineries and to expand the export capacity at our Garyville and Galveston Bay refineries. We will continue to evaluate opportunities to expand our existing asset base, with an emphasis on increasing distillate production, light crude oil processing and export capabilities and synergistic opportunities at our Galveston Bay refinery.

Sustain Focus on Shareholder Returns

We intend to continue our focus on the return of capital to shareholders in the form of a strong and growing base dividend, supplemented by share repurchases. We have increased our quarterly dividend by150percent since becoming a stand-alone company in June 2011 and our board of directors has authorized share repurchases totaling$8.0 billion. Through open market purchases and two accelerated share repurchase (“ASR”) programs, we repurchased89 millionshares of our common stock for approximately$6.27 billion, representing approximately25percent of our outstanding common shares when we became a stand-alone company in June 2011. After the effects of these repurchases,$1.73 billionof the$8.0 billiontotal authorization was available for future repurchases as ofDecember 31, 2014.

Increase Assured Sales Volumes at our Marathon Brand and Speedway Locations

We consider assured sales as those sales we make to Marathon brand customers, our Speedway operations and to our wholesale customers with whom we have required minimum volume sales contracts. We believe having assured sales brings ratability to our distribution systems, provides a solid base to enhance our overall supply reliability and allows us to efficiently and effectively optimize our operations between our refineries, our pipelines and our terminals. The Marathon brand has been a consistent vehicle for sales volume growth in existing and contiguous markets. The acquisition of Hess’ Retail Operations and Related Assets significantly expands our Speedway presence fromnineto22states throughout the East Coast and Southeast and enables us to further leverage our integrated refining and transportation operations, providing an outlet for an incremental200mbpd of assured sales from our refining system.

Utilize and Enhance our High Quality Employee Workforce

We utilize our high quality employee workforce by continuing to leverage our commercial skills. In addition, we continue to enhance our workforce through selective hiring practices and effective training programs on safety, environmental stewardship and other professional and technical skills.











Refining & Marketing

Refineries

We currently own and operatesevenrefineries in the Gulf Coast and Midwest regions of the United States with an aggregate crude oil refining capacity of1,731thousand barrels per calender day (“mbpcd”). During2014, our refineries processed1,622mbpd of crude oil and184mbpd of other charge and blendstocks. During2013, our refineries processed1,589mbpd of crude oil and213mbpd of other charge and blendstocks. The table below sets forth the location, crude oil refining capacity, tank storage capacity and number of tanks for each of our refineries as ofDecember 31, 2014.

(a)Refining throughput can exceed crude oil capacity due to the processing of other charge and blendstocks in addition to crude oil and the timing of planned turnaround and major maintenance activity.

Our refineries include crude oil atmospheric and vacuum distillation, fluid catalytic cracking, hydrocracking, catalytic reforming, coking, desulfurization and sulfur recovery units. The refineries process a wide variety of light and heavy crude oils purchased from various domestic and foreign suppliers. We produce numerous refined products, ranging from transportation fuels, such as reformulated gasolines, blend-grade gasolines intended for blending with ethanol and ultra-low sulfur diesel (“ULSD”) fuel, to heavy fuel oil and asphalt. Additionally, we manufacture aromatics, propane, propylene, cumene and sulfur. See the Refined Product Marketing section for further information about the products we produce.

Our refineries are integrated with each other via pipelines, terminals and barges to maximize operating efficiency. The transportation links that connect our refineries allow the movement of intermediate products between refineries to optimize operations, produce higher margin products and efficiently utilize our processing capacity. For example, naphtha may be moved from Texas City to Robinson where excess reforming capacity is available. Also, shipping intermediate products between facilities during partial refinery shutdowns allows us to utilize processing capacity that is not directly affected by the shutdown work.

Garyville, Louisiana Refinery. Our Garyville, Louisiana refinery is located along the Mississippi River in southeastern Louisiana between New Orleans and Baton Rouge. The Garyville refinery is configured to process a wide variety of crude oils into gasoline, distillates, fuel-grade coke, asphalt, polymer-grade propylene, propane, slurry, sulfur and dry gas. The refinery has access to the export market and multiple options to sell refined products. A major expansion project was completed in 2009 that increased Garyville’s crude oil refining capacity, making it one of the largest refineries in the U.S. Our Garyville refinery has earned designation as an OSHA VPP Star site.

Galveston Bay, Texas City, Texas Refinery. Our Galveston Bay refinery, which we acquired on February 1, 2013, is located on the Texas Gulf Coast approximately 30 miles southeast of Houston, Texas.

Gasoline and Distillates. We sell gasoline, gasoline blendstocks and distillates (including No. 1 and No. 2 fuel oils, jet fuel, kerosene and diesel fuel) to wholesale customers, Marathon-branded independent entrepreneurs and our Speedway®convenience stores and on the spot market. In addition, we sell diesel fuel and gasoline for export to international customers. We sold55percent of our gasoline sales volumes and89percent of our distillates sales volumes on a wholesale or spot market basis in2014. The demand for gasoline and distillates is seasonal in many of our markets, with demand typically at its highest levels during the summer months.









We have blended ethanol into gasoline for more than 20 years and began expanding our blending program in 2007, in part due to federal regulations that require us to use specified volumes of renewable fuels. Ethanol volumes sold in blended gasoline were78mbpd in2014,74mbpd in2013and68mbpd in2012. We sell reformulated gasoline, which is also blended with ethanol, in12states in our marketing area. We also sell biodiesel-blended diesel fuel in15states in our marketing area. The future expansion or contraction of our ethanol and biodiesel blending programs will be driven by market economics and government regulations.

Propane. We produce propane at most of our refineries. Propane is primarily used for home heating and cooking, as a feedstock within the petrochemical industry, for grain drying and as a fuel for trucks and other vehicles. Our propane sales are typically split evenly between the home heating market and industrial consumers.

Feedstocks and Special Products. We are a producer and marketer of feedstocks and specialty products. Product availability varies by refinery and includes propylene, raffinate, butane, benzene, xylene, molten sulfur, cumene and toluene. We market these products domestically to customers in the chemical, agricultural and fuel-blending industries. In addition, we produce fuel-grade coke at our Garyville, Detroit and Galveston Bay refineries, which is used for power generation and in miscellaneous industrial applications, and anode-grade coke at our Robinson refinery, which is used to make carbon anodes for the aluminum smelting industry. Our feedstocks and special products sales increased to 268 mbpd in 2014 from 214 mbpd in 2013 and 112 mbpd in 2012 primarily due to our Galveston Bay refinery.

Heavy Fuel Oil. We produce and market heavy residual fuel oil or related components, including slurry, at all of our refineries. Heavy residual fuel oil is primarily used in the utility and ship bunkering (fuel) industries, though there are other more specialized uses of the product.

Asphalt. We have refinery-based asphalt production capacity of up to101mbpcd, which includes asphalt cements, polymer-modified asphalt, emulsified asphalt, industrial asphalts and roofing flux. We have a broad customer base, including asphalt-paving contractors, government entities (states, counties, cities and townships) and asphalt roofing shingle manufacturers. We sell asphalt in the domestic and export wholesale markets via rail, barge and vessel.











Terminals

As ofDecember 31, 2014, we owned and operated63light product and18asphalt terminals. Our light product and asphalt terminals averaged1,426mbpd and27mbpd of throughput in2014, respectively. In addition, we distribute refined products throughoneleased light product terminal,twolight product terminals in which we have partial ownership interests but do not operate and approximately118third-party light product and10third-party asphalt terminals in our market area. The following table sets forth additional details about our owned and operated terminals atDecember 31, 2014.

Speedway

Our Speedway segment sells gasoline, diesel and merchandise through convenience stores that it owns and operates, primarily under the Speedway and Hess brands. We have the right to use the Hess brand through September 30, 2017. We are in the process of converting convenience stores acquired from Hess to the Speedway brand, which we target to complete by the end of 2016. Speedway convenience stores offer a wide variety of merchandise, including prepared foods, beverages and non-food items. Speedway’s Speedy Rewards® loyalty program has been a highly successful loyalty program since its inception in 2004, with a consistently growing base of more than3.9 millionactive members as ofDecember 31, 2014. Due to Speedway’s ability to capture and analyze member-specific transactional data, Speedway is able to offer the Speedy Rewards® members discounts and promotions specific to their buying behavior. We believe Speedy Rewards® is a key reason customers choose Speedway over competitors and it continues to drive significant value for both Speedway and our Speedy Rewards® members.

The demand for gasoline is seasonal, with the highest demand usually occurring during the summer driving season. Margins from the sale of merchandise tend to be less volatile than margins from the retail sale of gasoline and diesel fuel. Merchandise margin as a percent of total gross margin for Speedway decreased in 2014, primarily related to the convenience stores acquired from Hess. The following table sets forth Speedway merchandise statistics for the past three years.

Pipeline Transportation

As ofDecember 31, 2014, we owned, leased or had ownership interests in approximately8,300miles of crude oil and products pipelines, of which approximately2,900miles are owned through our investments in MPLX.

MPLX

In 2012, we formed MPLX, a master limited partnership, to own, operate, develop and acquire pipelines and other midstream assets related to the transportation and storage of crude oil, refined products and other hydrocarbon-based products. On October 31, 2012, MPLX completed its initial public offering. As ofDecember 31, 2014, we owned a71.5 percentinterest in MPLX, including thetwo percentgeneral partner interest, and MPLX’s assets consisted of a 99.5 percent general partner interest in Pipe Line Holdings, which owns common carrier pipeline systems through Marathon Pipe Line LLC (“MPL”) and Ohio River Pipe Line LLC (“ORPL”), and a100 percentinterest in aone millionbarrel butane storage cavern in West Virginia.









As ofDecember 31, 2014, Pipe Line Holdings, through MPL and ORPL, owned or leased and operated1,004miles of common carrier crude oil lines and1,902miles of common carrier products lines located inninestates andfourtank farms in Illinois and Indiana with available storage capacity of3.29 millionbarrels that is committed to MPC. The table below sets forth additional detail regarding these pipeline systems and storage assets as ofDecember 31, 2014.

Competition, Market Conditions and Seasonality

The downstream petroleum business is highly competitive, particularly with regard to accessing crude oil and other feedstock supply and the marketing of refined products. We compete with a large number of other companies to acquire crude oil for refinery processing and in the distribution and marketing of a full array of petroleum products. Based upon the “The Oil & Gas Journal2014Worldwide Refinery Survey,” we ranked fourth among U.S. petroleum companies on the basis of U.S. crude oil refining capacity as ofDecember 31, 2014. We compete in four distinct markets for the sale of refined products—wholesale, spot, branded and retail distribution. We believe we compete with about60companies in the sale of refined products to wholesale marketing customers, including private-brand marketers and large commercial and industrial consumers; about90companies in the sale of refined products in the spot market;12refiners or marketers in the supply of refined products to refiner-branded independent entrepreneurs; and approximately910retailers in the retail sale of refined products. In addition, we compete with producers and marketers in other industries that supply alternative forms of energy and fuels to satisfy the requirements of our industrial, commercial and retail consumers. We do not produce any of the crude oil we refine.

We also face strong competition for sales of retail gasoline, diesel fuel and merchandise. Our competitors include service stations and convenience stores operated by fully integrated major oil companies and their independent entrepreneurs and other well-recognized national or regional convenience stores and travel centers, often selling gasoline, diesel fuel and merchandise at competitive prices. Non-traditional retailers, such as supermarkets, club stores and mass merchants, have affected the convenience store industry with their entrance into sales of retail gasoline and diesel fuel. Energy Analysts International, Inc. estimated such retailers had approximately14percent of the U.S. gasoline market in mid-2014.

Our pipeline transportation operations are highly regulated, which affects the rates that our common carrier pipelines can charge for transportation services and the return we obtain from such pipelines.

Market conditions in the oil and gas industry are cyclical and subject to global economic and political events and new and changing governmental regulations. Our operating results are affected by price changes in crude oil, natural gas and refined products, as well as changes in competitive conditions in the markets we serve. Price differentials between sweet and sour crude oils, West Texas Intermediate (“WTI”) and Light Louisiana Sweet (“LLS”) crude oils and other market structure differentials also affect our operating results.









Demand for gasoline, diesel fuel and asphalt is higher during the spring and summer months than during the winter months in most of our markets, primarily due to seasonal increases in highway traffic and construction. As a result, the operating results for each of our segments for the first and fourth quarters may be lower than for those in the second and third quarters of each calendar year.



Environmental Matters

Our management is responsible for ensuring that our operating organizations maintain environmental compliance systems that support and foster our compliance with applicable laws and regulations, and for reviewing our overall environmental performance. We also have a Corporate Emergency Response Team that oversees our response to any major environmental or other emergency incident involving us or any of our facilities.

We believe it is likely that the scientific and political attention to issues concerning the extent and causes of climate change will continue, with the potential for further regulations that could affect our operations. Currently, legislative and regulatory measures to address greenhouse gases are in various phases of review, discussion or implementation. The cost to comply with these laws and regulations cannot be estimated at this time, but could be significant. For additional information, see Item 1A. Risk Factors. We estimate and publicly report greenhouse gas emissions from our operations and products. Additionally, we continuously strive to improve operational and energy efficiencies through resource and energy conservation where practicable.

Our operations are subject to numerous other laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment. Such laws and regulations include, among others, the Clean Air Act (“CAA”) with respect to air emissions, the Clean Water Act (“CWA”) with respect to water discharges, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (“RCRA”) with respect to solid and hazardous waste treatment, storage and disposal, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (“CERCLA”) with respect to releases and remediation of hazardous substances and the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (“OPA-90”) with respect to oil pollution and response. In addition, many states where we operate have similar laws. New laws are being enacted and regulations are being adopted on a continuing basis, and the costs of compliance with such new laws and regulations are very difficult to estimate until finalized.

For a discussion of environmental capital expenditures and costs of compliance for air, water, solid waste and remediation, see Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Environmental Matters and Compliance Costs.

Air









In 2013, the Obama administration developed the social cost of carbon (“SCC”). The SCC is to be used by the EPA and other federal agencies in regulatory cost-benefit analyses to take into account alleged broad economic consequences associated with changes to emissions of greenhouse gases. The SCC was first issued in 2010. In 2013, the Obama administration significantly increased the estimate to $36 per ton. In response to the regulated community and Congress’ critiques of how the SCC was developed, the Office of Management and Budget provided an opportunity to comment on the SCC, but ultimately did not make any significant revisions. In December 2014, the White House Council on Environmental Quality (“CEQ”) issued new draft guidance for assessing greenhouse gas emissions under the National Environmental Policy Act (“NEPA”), adding for the first time language that requires the analyses to also include the impact of climate change on projects, including using the SCC when analyzing costs and benefits of a project. While the impact of a higher SCC in future regulations is not known at this time, it may result in increased costs to our operations.

The EPA finalized the Boiler and Process Heater Maximum Achievable Control Technology (“Boiler MACT”) in March 2011 with work practice standards that are applicable to refinery and natural gas fired equipment. Subsequently, in January 2013 the EPA made certain revisions to the March 2011 final rule in response to petitions for reconsideration. In December 2014, the EPA proposed reconsideration of limited issues and proposed to delete rule provisions for an affirmative defense for malfunctions. Currently, litigation is pending in the D.C. Circuit Court on both the 2011 and 2013 rule-makings. We anticipate litigation to continue through 2015. We are in the process of implementing the work practice standards. Final financial impacts of the Boiler MACT rule cannot be determined at this time because the ongoing litigation could affect the final rule.



On June 30, 2014, the EPA proposed to revise existing refinery air emissions standards. The final rule is expected to be issued by June 17, 2015 and allows for implementation through June 2018. EPA’s periodic review and possible revision of these standards is required under the CAA. This rule may require additional controls, lower emission standards and ambient air monitoring. Due to the present uncertainty regarding final standards, we cannot reasonably estimate the cost associated with this rule.

Water

We maintain numerous discharge permits as required under the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System program of the CWA and have implemented systems to oversee our compliance with these permits. In addition, we are regulated under OPA-90, which among other things, requires the owner or operator of a tank vessel or a facility to maintain an emergency plan to respond to releases of oil or hazardous substances. Also, in case of any such release, OPA-90 requires the responsible company to pay resulting removal costs and damages. OPA-90 also provides for civil penalties and imposes criminal sanctions for violations of its provisions. We have implemented emergency oil response plans for all of our components and facilities covered by OPA-90 and we have established Spill Prevention, Control and Countermeasures plans for all facilities subject to such requirements.

Additionally, OPA-90 requires that new tank vessels entering or operating in U.S. waters be double-hulled and that existing tank vessels that are not double-hulled be retrofitted or removed from U.S. service. All barges used for river transport of our raw materials and refined products meet the double-hulled requirements of OPA-90. We operate facilities at which spills of oil and hazardous substances could occur. Some coastal states in which we operate have passed state laws similar to OPA-90, but with expanded liability provisions, that include provisions for cargo owner responsibility as well as ship owner and operator responsibility.











In 2013, the EPA and the US Army Corps of Engineers proposed significant changes to the definition of the term “waters of the US” (WOTUS) used in numerous programs under the CWA. The proposed changes have the potential to expand permitting, planning and reporting obligations and extend the timing to secure permits for pipeline and fixed asset construction and maintenance activities. Some man-made water bodies on our plant sites (firewater ponds, stormwater systems, and green infrastructure systems) may become WOTUS, which may require new permits requiring the control of liquids entering and exiting these water bodies. A final rule is anticipated in early 2015.

In May 2014, the EPA issued the final rule regarding cooling water intake structures which impacts three of our refineries. The final rule established closed-loop cooling as one of eight required technologies. The final rule also requires company engagement with Fish and Wildlife to determine if any endangered species are at risk in the locations during the next NPDES permit cycle. This rule will apply with the next NPDES renewal at our Catlettsburg, Garyville, and Robinson refineries. This rule is not anticipated to have a material impact on our operations.

Solid Waste

We continue to seek methods to minimize the generation of hazardous wastes in our operations. RCRA establishes standards for the management of solid and hazardous wastes. Besides affecting waste disposal practices, RCRA also addresses the environmental effects of certain past waste disposal operations, the recycling of wastes and the regulation of underground storage tanks (“USTs”) containing regulated substances. We have ongoing RCRA treatment and disposal operations at two of our facilities and primarily utilize offsite third-party treatment and disposal facilities. Ongoing RCRA-related costs, however, are not expected to be material to our results of operations or cash flows.

Remediation

We own or operate, or have owned or operated, certain convenience stores and other locations where, during the normal course of operations, releases of refined products from USTs have occurred. Federal and state laws require that contamination caused by such releases at these sites be assessed and remediated to meet applicable standards. The enforcement of the UST regulations under RCRA has been delegated to the states, which administer their own UST programs. Our obligation to remediate such contamination varies, depending on the extent of the releases and the stringency of the applicable state laws and regulations. A portion of these remediation costs may be recoverable from the appropriate state UST reimbursement funds once the applicable deductibles have been satisfied. We also have ongoing remediation projects at a number of our current and former refinery, terminal and pipeline locations. Penalties or other sanctions may be imposed for noncompliance.

Claims under CERCLA and similar state acts have been raised with respect to the clean-up of various waste disposal and other sites. CERCLA is intended to facilitate the clean-up of hazardous substances without regard to fault. Potentially responsible parties for each site include present and former owners and operators of, transporters to and generators of the hazardous substances at the site. Liability is strict and can be joint and several. Because of various factors including the difficulty of identifying the responsible parties for any particular site, the complexity of determining the relative liability among them, the uncertainty as to the most desirable remediation techniques and the amount of damages and clean-up costs and the time period during which such costs may be incurred, we are unable to reasonably estimate our ultimate cost of compliance with CERCLA; however, we do not believe such costs will be material to our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

Mileage Standards, Renewable Fuels and Other Fuels Requirements

In 2007, the U.S. Congress passed the Energy Independence and Security Act (“EISA”), which, among other things, set a target of 35 miles per gallon for the combined fleet of cars and light trucks in the United States by model year 2020, and contains a second Renewable Fuel Standard (“RFS2”). In August 2012, the EPA and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration jointly adopted regulations that establish average industry fleet fuel economy standards for passenger cars and light trucks of up to 41 miles per gallon by model year 2021 and average fleet fuel economy standards of up to 49.7 miles per gallon by model year 2025 (the standards from 2022 to 2025 are the government’s current estimate but will require further rulemaking). New or alternative transportation fuels such as compressed natural gas could also pose a competitive threat to our operations.











On November 29, 2013, the EPA issued a proposed rule for the 2014 renewal fuel volume requirements. On November 21, 2014, the EPA announced the rule would not become final until sometime in 2015. This continues the lack of clarity and timeliness that has become common place with the EPA’s administration of the RFS2 requirements. This proposed rule has substantially reduced the RFS2 requirements from the statutory numbers as follows: total renewables has been reduced from 18.15 to 15.21 billion gallons, the advanced requirement has been reduced from 3.75 to 2.20 billion gallons, the biomass-based diesel requirement has remained flat from 2013 at 1.28 billion gallons, and the cellulosic requirement has been reduced from 1.75 billion to 17 million gallons. If these proposed requirements become final, it will allow the obligated parties to comply in 2014 without needing any substantial volumes of 85 percent ethanol-blended or 15 percent ethanol-blended (“E15”) gasolines and postpone the issues and concerns of having to blend ethanol past the E10 “blendwall” at least for 2014. Likewise, the EPA has not finalized the 2015 renewable fuel volumes as required by the November 30, 2014 statutory deadline. As a result, the future of the RFS still remains undecided and is in need of a legislative re-write or repeal to provide a stable business platform for the obligated parties.

With potentially uncertain supplies, the advanced biofuels programs may present specific challenges in that we may have to enter into arrangements with other parties or purchase credits from the EPA to meet our obligations to use advanced biofuels, including biomass-based diesel and cellulosic biofuel. Additionally, the EPA did not finalize the 2013 RFS2 renewable fuel obligations until August 2013. Therefore, it is uncertain how industry will comply with meeting the advanced biofuels obligation. The continued delay of the final rule for 2014 has also delayed the day when compliance reports are due for 2013. In 2012 and 2013, the EPA also discovered that 173 million biodiesel renewable identification numbers (“RINs”) used to meet the annual requirement for that fuel had been fraudulently created and sold to unsuspecting third parties, including MPC. The EPA finalized a rule establishing a quality assurance program for RINs purchased to help meet the annual biofuel requirements under the RFS2 program. The program is aimed at reducing the risks that RINs are fraudulently created or sold. We have already instituted internal procedures to help mitigate that risk.

We made investments in infrastructure capable of expanding biodiesel blending capability to help comply with the biodiesel RFS2 requirement by buying and blending biodiesel into our refined diesel product, and by buying needed biodiesel RINs in the EPA-created biodiesel RINs market. On April 1, 2014, we purchased a facility in Cincinnati, Ohio, which currently produces biodiesel, glycerin and other by-products. The capacity of the plant is approximately60 milliongallons per year. As a producer of biodiesel, we now generate RINs, thereby reducing our reliance on the external RIN market.

On October 13, 2010, the EPA issued a partial waiver decision under the CAA to allow for an increase in the amount of ethanol permitted to be blended into gasoline from E10 to E15 for 2007 and newer light-duty motor vehicles. On January 21, 2011, the EPA issued a second waiver for the use of E15 in vehicles model year 2001-2006. There are numerous issues, including state and federal regulatory issues, which need to be addressed before E15 can be marketed for use in traditional gasoline engines.

There will be compliance costs and uncertainties regarding how we will comply with the various requirements contained in EISA and related regulations. We may experience a decrease in demand for refined petroleum products due to an increase in combined fleet mileage or due to refined petroleum products being replaced by renewable fuels.

On March 3, 2014, the EPA signed the final Tier 3 fuel standards. The final Tier 3 fuel standards require, among other things, a lower annual average sulfur level in gasoline to no more than 10 parts per million (“ppm”) beginning in calendar year 2017. In addition, gasoline refiners and importers may not exceed a maximum per-gallon sulfur standard of 80 ppm while retailers may not exceed a maximum per-gallon sulfur standard of 95 ppm. We anticipate that we will spend an estimated $750 million to $1 billion between 2014 and 2019 for capital expenditures necessary to comply with these standards.











Trademarks, Patents and Licenses

Our Marathon trademark is material to the conduct of our refining and marketing operations, and our Speedway trademark is material to the conduct of our retail marketing operations. We currently hold a number of U.S. and foreign patents and have various pending patent applications. Although in the aggregate our patents and licenses are important to us, we do not regard any single patent or license or group of related patents or licenses as critical or essential to our business as a whole. In general, we depend on our technological capabilities and the application of know-how rather than patents and licenses in the conduct of our operations.
