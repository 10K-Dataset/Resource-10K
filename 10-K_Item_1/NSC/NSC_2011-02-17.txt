Item 1.  Business and Item 2.  Properties

GENERAL- Norfolk Southern Corporation (Norfolk Southern) is a Norfolk, Virginia based company that controls a major freight railroad, Norfolk Southern Railway Company.  Norfolk Southern Railway Company is primarily engaged in the rail transportation of raw materials, intermediate products, and finished goods primarily in the Southeast, East, and Midwest and, via interchange with rail carriers, to and from the rest of the United States.  Norfolk Southern also transports overseas freight through several Atlantic and Gulf Coast ports.  Norfolk Southern provides comprehensive logistics services and offers the most extensive intermodal network in the eastern half of the United States.  The common stock of Norfolk Southern is listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) under the symbol “NSC.”

Norfolk Southern was incorporated on July 23, 1980, under the laws of the Commonwealth of Virginia.  On June 1, 1982, Norfolk Southern acquired control of two major operating railroads, Norfolk and Western Railway Company (NW) and Southern Railway Company (Southern) in accordance with an Agreement of Merger and Reorganization dated as of July 31, 1980, and with the approval of the transaction by the Interstate Commerce Commission (now the Surface Transportation Board [STB]).  Effective December 31, 1990, Norfolk Southern transferred all the common stock of NW to Southern and Southern’s name was changed to Norfolk Southern Railway Company (Norfolk Southern Railway or NSR).  Effective September 1, 1998, NW was merged with and into Norfolk Southern Railway.  As of December 31, 2010, all the common stock of Norfolk Southern Railway was owned directly by Norfolk Southern.

Norfolk Southern makes available free of charge through its website, www.nscorp.com, its annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and all amendments to those reports as soon as reasonably practicable after such material is electronically filed with or furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

RAILWAY OPERATING REVENUES- NS’ total railway operating revenues were $9.5 billion in 2010.  See the financial information by traffic segment in Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”

COAL TRAFFIC- Coal, coke, and iron ore - most of which is bituminous coal - is NS’ railroads’ largest commodity group as measured by revenues.  The railroads handled a total of 170.8 million tons in 2010, most of which originated on NS’ lines in West Virginia, Virginia, Pennsylvania, and Kentucky.  Revenues from coal, coke, and iron ore accounted for about 28% of NS’ total railway operating revenues in 2010.

Total coal handled through all system ports in 2010 was 36.6 million tons. Of this total, 16.6 million tons (including coastwise traffic) moved through Norfolk, Virginia,  8.3 million tons moved to various docks on the Ohio River, 7.1 million tons (including coastwise traffic) moved through the Baltimore Terminal, and 4.6 million tons moved to various Lake Erie ports.  Other than coal for export, virtually all coal handled by NS’ railroads was terminated in states east of the Mississippi River.

See the discussion of coal traffic, by type of coal, in Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”

GENERAL MERCHANDISE TRAFFIC- General merchandise traffic is composed of five major commodity groupings:  automotive; chemicals; metals and construction; agriculture; consumer products and government; and paper, clay and forest products.  The automotive group includes finished vehicles for BMW, Chrysler, Ford Motor Company, General Motors, Honda, Hyundai, Mazda, Mercedes-Benz, Mitsubishi, Subaru, Suzuki, Toyota and Volkswagen, and auto parts for Ford Motor Company, General Motors, and Chrysler.  The chemicals group includes sulfur and related chemicals, petroleum products, chlorine and bleaching compounds, plastics, rubber, industrial chemicals, chemical wastes, and municipal wastes.  The metals and construction group includes steel, aluminium products, machinery, scrap metals, cement, aggregates, bricks, and minerals.  The agriculture, consumer products, and government group includes soybeans, wheat, corn, fertilizer, animal 
and poultry feed, food oils, flour, beverages, canned goods, sweeteners, consumer products, ethanol, and items for the military.  The paper, clay and forest products group includes lumber and wood products, pulp board and paper products, wood fibers, wood pulp, scrap paper, and clay.

In 2010, 123 million tons of general merchandise freight, or approximately 66% of total general merchandise tonnage handled by NS, originated online.  The balance of general merchandise traffic was received from connecting carriers at interterritorial gateways.  The principal interchange points for NS-received traffic included Chicago, Memphis, New Orleans, Cincinnati, Kansas City, Detroit, Hagerstown, St. Louis/East St. Louis, and Louisville.  General merchandise carloads handled in 2010 were 2.3 million, the revenues from which accounted for 53% of NS’ total railway operating revenues in 2010.

See the discussion of general merchandise rail traffic by commodity group in Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”

INTERMODAL TRAFFIC- The intermodal market consists of shipments moving in trailers, domestic and international containers, and RoadRailer® equipment.  These shipments are handled on behalf of intermodal marketing companies, international steamship lines, truckers, and other shippers.  Intermodal units handled in 2010 were 2.9 million, the revenues from which accounted for 19% of NS’ total railway operating revenues for the year.

See the discussion of intermodal traffic  in Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”

FREIGHT RATES- In 2010, NS’ railroads continued their reliance on private contracts and exempt price quotes as their predominant pricing mechanisms.  Thus, a major portion of NS’ freight business is not currently economically regulated by the government.  In general, market forces have been substituted for government regulation and now are the primary determinant of rail service prices.

In 2010, NS’ railroads were found by the STB to not be “revenue adequate” based on results for the year 2009.  The STB has not made its revenue adequacy determination for the year 2010.  A railroad is “revenue adequate” on an annual basis  under the applicable law when its return on net investment exceeds the rail industry’s composite cost of capital.  This determination is made pursuant to a statutory requirement.

NONCARRIER OPERATIONS- NS’ noncarrier subsidiaries engage principally in the acquisition, leasing, and management of coal, oil, gas and minerals; the development of commercial real estate; telecommunications; and the leasing or sale of rail property and equipment.  In 2010, no such noncarrier subsidiary or industry segment grouping of noncarrier subsidiaries met the requirements for a reportable business segment, under relevant authoritative accounting guidance.

RAILWAY PROPERTY

The NS railroad system extends across 22 states and the District of Columbia.  The railroad infrastructure makes the company capital intensive with net property of approximately $23 billion.

Capital Expenditures- Capital expenditures for the past five years were as follows (including capitalized leases):

Microwave System- The NS microwave system, consisting of approximately 7,400 radio route miles, 425 core stations, 30 secondary stations, and 5 passive repeater stations, provides communications between most operating locations.  The microwave system is used primarily for voice communications, VHF radio control circuits, data and facsimile transmissions, traffic control operations, and AEI data transmissions.

Traffic Control- Of the approximately 16,500 route miles dispatched by NS, about 11,000 miles are signalized, including 8,100 miles of centralized traffic control (CTC) and 2,900 miles of automatic block signals.  Of the 8,100 miles of CTC, approximately 4,050 miles are controlled by data radio originating at 284 base station radio sites.

Computers- A computer network consisting of a centralized data center in Atlanta, Georgia, and various distributed computers throughout the company connects the yards, terminals, transportation offices, rolling stock repair points, sales offices, and other key system locations.  Operating and traffic data are processed and stored to provide customers with information on their shipments throughout the system.  Computer systems provide current information on the location of every train and each car on line, as well as related waybill and other train and car movement data.  In addition, the computer systems are utilized to assist management in the performance of a variety of functions and services including payroll, car and revenue accounting, billing, material management activities and controls, and special studies.

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS- Compliance with federal, state, and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment is a principal NS goal.  To date, such compliance has not affected materially NS’ capital additions, earnings, liquidity, or competitive position.  See “Legal Proceedings,” Part I, Item 3; “Personal Injury, Environmental, and Legal Liabilities” in Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” and Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

EMPLOYEES- The following table shows the average number of employees and the average cost per employee for wages and benefits:

More than 80% of NS’ railroad employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements with various labor unions.  See the discussion of “Labor Agreements” in Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”

GOVERNMENT REGULATION- In addition to environmental, safety, securities, and other regulations generally applicable to all business, NS’ railroads are subject to regulation by the STB.  The STB has jurisdiction over some rates, routes, fuel surcharges, conditions of service, and the extension or abandonment of rail lines.  The STB also has jurisdiction over the consolidation, merger, or acquisition of control of and by rail common carriers.  The Federal Railroad Administration regulates certain track and mechanical equipment standards.



K10





























The relaxation of economic regulation of railroads, under the Staggers Rail Act of 1980, includes exemptions of intermodal business (trailer-on-flat-car, container-on-flat-car), rail boxcar traffic, lumber, manufactured steel, automobiles, and certain bulk commodities such as sand, gravel, pulpwood, and wood chips for paper manufacturing.  Transportation contracts on these shipments and on regulated shipments effectively remove those shipments from regulation as well  for the duration of the contract.  About 87% of NS’ freight revenues come from either exempt traffic or traffic moving under transportation contracts.

Efforts were made in 2010 to re-subject the rail industry to increased federal economic regulation and such efforts are expected to continue in 2011.  The Staggers Rail Act of 1980, which substantially balanced such regulation, encouraged and enabled rail carriers to innovate and to compete for business, thereby contributing to the economic health of the nation and to the revitalization of the industry.  Accordingly, NS will continue to oppose efforts to reimpose increased economic regulation.

COMPETITION- There is continuing strong competition among rail, water, and highway carriers.  Price is usually only one factor of importance as shippers and receivers choose a transport mode and specific hauling company.  Inventory carrying costs, service reliability, ease of handling, and the desire to avoid loss and damage during transit are also important considerations, especially for higher-valued finished goods, machinery, and consumer products.  Even for raw materials, semifinished goods, and work-in progress, users are increasingly sensitive to transport arrangements that minimize problems at successive production stages.

NS’ primary rail competitor is the CSX system; both operate throughout much of the same territory.  Other railroads also operate in parts of the territory.  NS also competes with motor carriers, water carriers, and with shippers who have the additional option of handling their own goods in private carriage, of sourcing products from different geographic areas, and of using substitute products.

Certain marketing strategies among railroads and between railroads and motor carriers enable carriers to compete more effectively in specific markets.

SECURITY OF OPERATIONS- NS has taken significant steps to provide enhanced security for the NS rail system.  In particular, NS has developed and implemented a comprehensive security plan that is modeled on and was developed in conjunction with the security plan prepared by the Association of American Railroads (AAR) post September 11, 2001.  The AAR Security Plan defines four Alert Levels and details the actions and countermeasures that are being applied across the railroad industry as the terrorist threat increases or decreases.  The Alert Level actions include countermeasures that will be applied in three general areas:  (1) operations (including transportation, engineering, and mechanical); (2) information technology and communications; and (3) railroad police.  Although security concerns preclude public disclosure of its contents, the NS Departmental Security Plan outlines the protocol within NS for all concerned to be no
tified of AAR Alert Level changes.  All NS Operations Division employees are advised by their supervisors or train dispatchers, as appropriate, of any change in Alert Level and any additional responsibilities they may incur due to such change.

The NS plan also effectively addresses and complies with Department of Transportation security regulations pertaining to training and security plans with respect to the transportation of hazardous materials.  As part of the plan, security awareness training is given to all railroad employees who directly affect hazardous material transportation safety, and this training is integrated into recurring hazardous material training and re-certification programs.  Toward that end, NS, working closely with the National Transit Institute at Rutgers University, has developed a four-module uniform national training program.  NS also has worked with the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) in developing other industry training programs.  More in-depth security training has been given to those select NS employees who have been given specific security responsibilities, and additional, location-specific security plans have been developed for certain metropolit
an areas and each of six port facilities served by NS.  With respect to the ports, each facility plan has been approved by the applicable Captain of the Port and subject to inspection by the U.S. Coast Guard.



K11

















































Additionally, NS engages in close and regular coordination with numerous federal and state agencies, including the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS), the TSA, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA), the U.S. Coast Guard, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, and various state Homeland Security offices.  As one notable example, an NS Police Special Agent, under the auspices of the AAR, has been assigned to the National Joint Terrorism Task Force (NJTTF) operating out of FBI Headquarters in Washington, DC to represent and serve as liaison to the North American rail industry.  This arrangement improves logistical flow of vital security and law enforcement information with respect to the rail industry as a whole, while having the post filled by an NS Special Agent has served to foster a strong working relationship between NS and the FBI.  NS also has become a member of the Customs-Trade Partnership Against Terroris
m (C-TPAT) program sponsored by U.S. Customs.  C-TPAT allows NS to work closely with U.S. Customs and its customers to develop measures that will help ensure the integrity of freight shipments moving on NS, particularly those moving to or from a foreign country.  Based on participation in C-TPAT, NS has ensured that its plan meets all current applicable security recommendations made by U.S. Customs.

In 2010, through participation in the Transportation Community Awareness and Emergency Response (TRANSCAER) Program, NS provided rail accident response training to approximately 4,890 emergency responders, such as local police and fire personnel, representing over 19,400 man-hours of emergency response training.  NS also conducted railroad operations classes for FBI agents and the railroad liaison agents from Joint Terrorism Task Forces.  NS’ other training efforts throughout 2010 included participation in 12 drills for local, state, and federal agencies.  NS also has ongoing programs to sponsor local emergency responders at the Security and Emergency Response Training Course (SERTC) conducted at the AAR Transportation Technology Center in Pueblo, Colorado.

Improvements in equipment design also are expected to play a role in enhancing rail security.  PHMSA, in coordination with the FRA, is amending the Hazardous Materials Regulations to prescribe enhanced safety measures for rail transportation of TIH materials, including interim design standards for railroad tank cars.  The rule mandates commodity-specific improvements in safety features and design standards for newly manufactured DOT specification tank cars and an improved top fittings performance standard.  The interim standards established in this rule will enhance the accident survivability of TIH tank cars.
