RAILWAY OPERATING REVENUES- NS’ total railway operating revenues were $11.2 billion in 2011.  See the financial information by traffic segment in Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”

COAL TRAFFIC- Coal is NS’ largest commodity group as measured by revenues.  Revenues from coal accounted for about 31% of NS’ total railway operating revenues in 2011.  NS handled a total of 177.9 million tons in 2011, most of which originated on NS’ lines from major eastern coal basins with the balance from major western coal basins via Memphis and Chicago gateways.  NS’ coal franchise serves the electric generation market, serving slightly over 100 coal generation plants, as well as the export, metallurgical and industrial markets primarily through direct rail and river, lake, and coastal facilities, including Lambert’s Point and various terminals on the Ohio River, the Port of Baltimore, and Lake Erie.

See the discussion of coal traffic, by type of coal, in Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”







GENERAL MERCHANDISE TRAFFIC- General merchandise traffic is composed of five major commodity groupings:  automotive; chemicals; metals and construction; agriculture, consumer products and government; and paper, clay and forest products.  The automotive group includes finished vehicles for BMW, Chrysler, Ford Motor Company, General Motors, Honda, Hyundai,  Mercedes-Benz, Mitsubishi, Subaru, Toyota and Volkswagen, and auto parts for Ford Motor Company, General Motors, Honda, Mazda, Mitsubishi, Nissan, Subaru, and Toyota.  The chemicals group includes sulfur and related chemicals, petroleum products, chlorine and bleaching compounds, plastics, rubber, industrial chemicals, chemical wastes, and municipal wastes.  The metals and construction group includes steel, aluminium products, machinery, scrap metals, cement, aggregates, bricks, and minerals.  The agriculture, consumer products, and government group includes soybeans, wheat, corn, fertilizer, animal and poultry feed, food oils, flour, beverages, canned goods, sweeteners, consumer products, ethanol, and items for the military.  The paper, clay and forest products group includes lumber and wood products, pulp board and paper products, wood fibers, wood pulp, scrap paper, and clay.

In 2011, 120 million tons of general merchandise freight, or approximately 66% of total general merchandise tonnage handled by NS, originated online.  The balance of general merchandise traffic was received from connecting carriers at interterritorial gateways.  The principal interchange points for NS-received traffic included Chicago, Memphis, New Orleans, Cincinnati, Kansas City, Detroit, Hagerstown, St. Louis/East St. Louis, and Louisville.  General merchandise carloads handled in 2011 were 2.3 million, the revenues from which accounted for 50% of NS’ total railway operating revenues in 2011.

See the discussion of general merchandise rail traffic by commodity group in Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”

INTERMODAL TRAFFIC- The intermodal market consists of shipments moving in trailers, domestic and international containers, and RoadRailer® equipment.  These shipments are handled on behalf of intermodal marketing companies, international steamship lines, truckers, and other shippers.  Intermodal units handled in 2011 were3.2 million, the revenues from which accounted for 19% of NS’ total railway operating revenues for the year.

See the discussion of intermodal traffic  in Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”

FREIGHT RATES- In 2011, NS’ railroads continued their reliance on private contracts and exempt price quotes as their predominant pricing mechanisms.  Thus, a major portion of NS’ freight business is not currently economically regulated by the government.  In general, market forces have been substituted for government regulation and now are the primary determinant of rail service prices.

In 2011, NS’ railroads were found by the STB to not be “revenue adequate” based on results for the year 2010.  The STB has not made its revenue adequacy determination for the year 2011.  A railroad is “revenue adequate” on an annual basis  under the applicable law when its return on net investment exceeds the rail industry’s composite cost of capital.  This determination is made pursuant to a statutory requirement.

PASSENGER OPERATIONS

NONCARRIER OPERATIONS- NS’ noncarrier subsidiaries engage principally in the acquisition, leasing, and management of coal, oil, gas and minerals; the development of commercial real estate; telecommunications; and the leasing or sale of rail property and equipment.  In 2011, no such noncarrier subsidiary or industry segment grouping of noncarrier subsidiaries met the requirements for a reportable business segment, under relevant authoritative accounting guidance.

RAILWAY PROPERTY

The NS railroad system extends across 22 states and the District of Columbia.  The railroad infrastructure makes the company capital intensive with net property of approximately $24 billion on a historical cost basis.

Property Additions- Property additions for the past five years were as follows (including capitalized leases):

Encumbrances- Certain railroad equipment is subject to the prior lien of equipment financing obligations amounting to approximately $69 million as of December 31, 2011, and $112 million as of December 31, 2010.

Track Maintenance- Of the approximately 36,300 total miles of track operated, NS had the responsibility for maintaining about 29,400 miles of track, with the remainder being operated under trackage rights from other parties responsible for maintenance.

Over 80% of the main line trackage (including first, second, third, and branch main tracks, all excluding rail operated pursuant to trackage rights) has rail ranging from 131 to 155 pounds per yard with the standard installation currently at 136 pounds per yard.  Approximately 44% of NS lines, excluding rail operated pursuant to trackage rights, carried20 million or more gross tons per track mile during 2011.

Microwave System- The NS microwave system, consisting of approximately 7,400 radio route miles, 427 core stations, 30 secondary stations, and five passive repeater stations, provides communications between most operating locations. The microwave system is used primarily for voice communications, VHF radio control circuits, data and facsimile transmissions, traffic control operations, and AEI data transmissions.

Traffic Control- Of the approximately 16,500 route miles dispatched by NS, about 11,025 miles are signalized, including 8,150 miles of centralized traffic control (CTC) and 2,875 miles of automatic block signals.  Of the 8,150 miles of CTC, approximately 5,050 miles are controlled by data radio originating at 312 base station radio sites.

Computers- A computer network consisting of a centralized production and backup data center in Atlanta, Georgia, and various distributed computers throughout the company connects the yards, terminals, transportation offices, rolling stock repair points, sales offices, and other key system locations.  Operating and traffic data are processed and stored to provide customers with information on their shipments throughout the system.  Computer systems provide current information on the location of every train and each car on line, as well as related waybill and other train and car movement data.  In addition, the computer systems are utilized to assist management in the performance of a variety of functions and services including payroll, car and revenue accounting, billing, material management activities and controls, and special studies.

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS- Compliance with federal, state, and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment is a principal NS goal.  To date, such compliance has not affected materially NS’ property additions, earnings, liquidity, or competitive position.  See “Legal Proceedings,” Part I, Item 3; “Personal Injury, Environmental, and Legal Liabilities” in Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” and Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

EMPLOYEES- The following table shows the average number of employees and the average cost per employee for wages and benefits:

More than 80% of NS’ railroad employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements with various labor unions. See the discussion of “Labor Agreements” in Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”

GOVERNMENT REGULATION- In addition to environmental, safety, securities, and other regulations generally applicable to all business, NS’ railroads are subject to regulation by the STB.  The STB has jurisdiction over some rates, routes, fuel surcharges, conditions of service, and the extension or abandonment of rail lines.  The STB also has jurisdiction over the consolidation, merger, or acquisition of control of and by rail common carriers.  The Federal Railroad Administration regulates certain track and mechanical equipment standards.

The relaxation of economic regulation of railroads, under the Staggers Rail Act of 1980, includes exemptions of intermodal business (trailer-on-flat-car, container-on-flat-car), rail boxcar traffic, lumber, manufactured steel, automobiles, and certain bulk commodities such as sand, gravel, pulpwood, and wood chips for paper manufacturing. Transportation contracts on these shipments and on regulated shipments effectively remove those shipments from regulation as well  for the duration of the contract.  About 86% of NS’ freight revenues come from either exempt traffic or traffic moving under transportation contracts.

Efforts were made in 2011 to re-subject the rail industry to increased federal economic regulation and such efforts are expected to continue in 2012.  The Staggers Rail Act of 1980, which substantially balanced such regulation, encouraged and enabled rail carriers to innovate, invest in their infrastructure, and compete for business, thereby contributing to the economic health of the nation and to the revitalization of the industry.  Accordingly, NS will continue to oppose efforts to reimpose increased economic regulation.





COMPETITION- There is continuing strong competition among rail, water, and highway carriers.  Price is usually only one factor of importance as shippers and receivers choose a transport mode and specific hauling company. Inventory carrying costs, service reliability, ease of handling, and the desire to avoid loss and damage during transit are also important considerations, especially for higher-valued finished goods, machinery, and consumer products.  Even for raw materials, semi-finished goods, and work-in progress, users are increasingly sensitive to transport arrangements that minimize problems at successive production stages.

NS’ primary rail competitor is the CSX system; both operate throughout much of the same territory.  Other railroads also operate in parts of the territory.  NS also competes with motor carriers, water carriers, and with shippers who have the additional options of handling their own goods in private carriage,  sourcing products from different geographic areas, and using substitute products.

Certain marketing strategies among railroads and between railroads and motor carriers enable carriers to compete more effectively in specific markets.

SECURITY OF OPERATIONS- NS has taken significant steps to provide enhanced security for the NS rail system.In particular, NS has developed and implemented a comprehensive security plan that is modeled on and was developed in conjunction with the security plan prepared by the Association of American Railroads (AAR) post September 11, 2001.  The AAR Security Plan defines four Alert Levels and details the actions and countermeasures that are being applied across the railroad industry as the terrorist threat increases or decreases.  The Alert Level actions include countermeasures that will be applied in three general areas:  (1) operations (including transportation, engineering, and mechanical); (2) information technology and communications; and, (3) railroad police.  Although security concerns preclude public disclosure of its contents, the NS Departmental Security Plan outlines the protocol within NS for all concerned to be notified of AAR Alert Level changes.  All NS Operations Division employees are advised by their supervisors or train dispatchers, as appropriate, of any change in Alert Level and any additional responsibilities they may incur due to such change.

The NS plan also effectively addresses and complies with Department of Transportation security regulations pertaining to training and security plans with respect to the transportation of hazardous materials.  As part of the plan, security awareness training is given to all railroad employees who directly affect hazardous material transportation safety, and this training is integrated into recurring hazardous material training and re-certification programs.  Toward that end, NS, working closely with the National Transit Institute at Rutgers University, has developed a four-module uniform national training program.  NS also has worked with the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) in developing other industry training programs.  More in-depth security training has been given to those select NS employees who have been given specific security responsibilities, and additional, location-specific security plans have been developed for certain metropolitan areas and each of six port facilities served by NS.  With respect to the ports, each facility plan has been approved by the applicable Captain of the Port and subject to inspection by the U.S. Coast Guard.

Additionally, NS engages in close and regular coordination with numerous federal and state agencies, including the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS), the TSA, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA), the U.S. Coast Guard, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, and various state Homeland Security offices.  As one notable example, an NS Police Special Agent in Charge (SAC), under the auspices of the AAR, has been assigned to the National Joint Terrorism Task Force (NJTTF) operated by the FBI, and located at the National Counter Terrorism Center (NCTC) in Arlington, VA to represent and serve as liaison to the North American rail industry.  This arrangement improves logistical flow of vital security and law enforcement information with respect to the rail industry as a whole, while having the post filled by an NS SAC has also served to foster a strong working relationship between NS and the FBI.  NS also has become a member of the Customs-Trade Partnership Against Terrorism (C-TPAT) program sponsored by U.S. Customs.  C-TPAT allows NS to work closely with U.S. Customs and its customers to develop measures that will help ensure the integrity of freight shipments moving on NS, particularly those moving to or from a foreign country.  Based on participation in C-TPAT, NS has ensured that its plan meets all current applicable security recommendations made by U.S. Customs.





In 2011, through participation in the Transportation Community Awareness and Emergency Response (TRANSCAER) Program, NS provided rail accident response training to approximately 5,316 emergency responders, such as local police and fire personnel, representing over 18,986 hours of emergency response training.  NS also conducted railroad operations classes for FBI agents and the railroad liaison agents from NJTTF.  NS’ other training efforts throughout 2011 included participation in 17 drills for local, state, and federal agencies.  NS also has ongoing programs to sponsor local emergency responders at the Security and Emergency Response Training Course (SERTC) conducted at the AAR Transportation Technology Center in Pueblo, Colorado.

Improvements in equipment design also are expected to play a role in enhancing rail security.  PHMSA, in coordination with the FRA, is amending the Hazardous Materials Regulations to prescribe enhanced safety measures for rail transportation of TIH materials, including interim design standards for railroad tank cars.  The rule mandates commodity-specific improvements in safety features and design standards for newly manufactured DOT specification tank cars and an improved top fittings performance standard.  The interim standards established in this rule will enhance the accident survivability of TIH tank cars.
