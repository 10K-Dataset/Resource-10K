RAILWAY OPERATING REVENUES–Total railway operating revenueswere $11.0billion in2012.  Following is an overview of our three major market groups.



COAL–Coal is our largest commodity group as measured by revenues.Revenues from coal accounted for about26%of our total railway operating revenues in2012.We handled a total of156.1million tons, or1.4million carloads,in2012, most of which originated on our lines from major eastern coal basins,with the balance from major western coal basins via Memphis and Chicago gateways.Our coal franchise supportsthe electric generation market, serving approximately 100 coal generation plants, as well as the export, metallurgical and industrial markets primarily through direct rail and river, lake, and coastal facilities, including various terminals on the Ohio River,Lambert’sPoint in Norfolk, Virginia,the Port of Baltimore, and Lake Erie.



See the discussion of coal revenues and tonnage, by type of coal, in Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”

GENERAL MERCHANDISE–Our general merchandise market groupis composed of five major commodity groupings:chemicals;agriculture, consumer products and government; metals and construction; automotive; and paper, clay and forest products.

•Chemicalsincludes sulfur and related chemicals, petroleum products, chlorine and bleaching compounds, plastics, rubber, industrial chemicals, chemical wastes, and municipal wastes.

•Agriculture, consumer products, and government includes soybeans, wheat, corn, fertilizer,livestockand poultry feed, food oils, flour, beverages, canned goods,sweeteners, consumer products, ethanol, and items for the military.

•Metals and construction includes steel, aluminum products, machinery, scrap metals, cement, aggregates, bricks, and minerals.

•Automotive includes finished vehicles for BMW, Chrysler, Ford, General Motors, Honda, Hyundai, Mercedes-Benz, Mitsubishi, Subaru, Toyota and Volkswagen, and auto parts for Chrysler, Ford, General Motors, Honda, Mazda, Mitsubishi, Nissan, Subaru, and Toyota.

•Paper, clay and forest productsincludes lumber and wood products, pulp board and paper products, wood fibers, wood pulp, scrap paper, and clay.



In2012,119million tons of general merchandise freight, or approximately65%of total general merchandise tonnagewe handled, originated online.The balance of general merchandisefreightwas received from connecting carriers at interterritorial gateways.Ourprincipal interchange points for received freightincludedChicago,New Orleans, East St. Louis, Memphis, Buffalo, and Detroit.General merchandise carloads handled in2012were2.3million, the revenues from which accounted for54%ofourtotal railway operating revenues.



See the discussion ofgeneral merchandise revenuesby commodity group in Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”



INTERMODAL–Ourintermodal marketgroupconsists of shipments moving in trailers, domestic and international containers, and RoadRailer® equipment.These shipments are handled on behalf of intermodal marketing companies, international steamship lines, truckers, and other shippers.Intermodal units handled in2012were3.4million, the revenues from which accounted for20%ofourtotal railway operating revenues.



See the discussion of intermodal revenuesin Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”



FREIGHT RATES–In2012, we continued our reliance on private contracts and exempt price quotes as the predominant pricing mechanisms.Thus, a major portion of our freight business is not currently economically regulated by the government.In general, market forces have been substituted for government regulation and now are the primary determinant of rail service prices.



In2012,ourrailroads were found by theSurface Transportation Board (STB), the regulatory board that has broad jurisdiction over railroad practices,to be “revenue adequate”on an annual basisbased on results for the year2011.The STB has not made its revenue adequacy determination for the year2012.A railroad is “revenue adequate” on an annual basis under the applicablelaw when its return on net investment exceeds the rail industry’s composite cost of capital.This determination is made pursuant to a statutory requirement.

Microwave System–Ourmicrowave system, consisting of approximately6,968radio route miles,421core stations,30secondary stations, and fourpassive repeater stations, provides communications between most operating locations.  We use the microwave systemprimarily for voice communications, VHF radio control circuits, data and facsimile transmissions, trafficcontrol operations, and AEI data transmissions.



Traffic Control–Of the approximately16,500route mileswedispatch, about11,025miles are signalized, including8,150miles of centralized traffic control (CTC) and2,875miles of automatic block signals.Of the8,150miles of CTC, approximately5,100miles are controlled by data radio originating at340base station radio sites.



Computers–A computer network consisting of a centralized production and backup data centernearAtlanta, Georgia, and various distributed computers throughout the company connects the yards, terminals, transportation offices, rolling stock repair points, sales offices, and other key system locations.Operating and traffic data are processed and stored to provide customers with information on their shipments throughout the system.Computer systems provide current information on the location of every train and eachcar on line, as well as related waybill and other train and car movement data.In addition,ourcomputer systems assistusin the performance of a

K10



variety of functions and services including payroll, car and revenue accounting, billing, material management activities and controls, and special studies.



ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS–Compliance with federal, state, and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment is a principal goalof ours.To date, such compliancehas not had a material effect on our financial position, results of operations, liquidity, or competitive position.See “Legal Proceedings,” Part I, Item 3; “Personal Injury, Environmental, and Legal Liabilities”in Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” and Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.



EMPLOYEES–The following table shows the average number of employees and the average costper employee for wages and benefits:

More than80%of ourrailroad employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements with various labor unions. See the discussion of “Labor Agreements” in Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”



GOVERNMENT REGULATION–In addition to environmental, safety, securities, and other regulations generally applicable to all business, ourrailroads are subject to regulation by the STB.The STB has jurisdiction over some rates, routes, fuel surcharges, conditions of service, and the extension or abandonment of rail lines.The STB also has jurisdiction over the consolidation, merger, or acquisition of control of and by rail common carriers.The Federal Railroad Administration(FRA)regulates certain track and mechanical equipment standards.



The relaxation of economic regulation of railroads, following the Staggers Rail Act of 1980, included exemption from STB regulation of the rates and most service terms for intermodal business (trailer-on-flat-car, container-on-flat-car), rail boxcar shipments, lumber, manufactured steel, automobiles, and certain bulk commodities such as sand, gravel, pulpwood, and wood chips for paper manufacturing.  Further, all shipments that we have under contract are effectively removed from regulation for the duration of the contract.  About 86% of our revenues comes from either exempt shipments or shipments movingunder transportation contracts; the remainder comes from shipments moving under public tariff rates.



Effortshave been made over the past several yearsto re-subject the rail industry to increased federal economic regulation,and such efforts are expected to continue in 2013.The Staggers Rail Act of 1980, which substantially balanced such regulation, encouraged and enabled rail carriers to innovate, invest in their infrastructure, and compete for business, thereby contributing to the economic health of the nation and to the revitalization of the industry.Accordingly,wewill continue to oppose efforts to reimpose increased economic regulation.



Government regulations concerning the safety and security of our railroads arediscussed within the “Security of Operations” section contained herein.



COMPETITION–There is continuing strong competition among rail, water, and highway carriers.Price is usually onlyone factor of importance as shippers and receivers choose a transport mode and specific hauling company. Inventory carrying costs, service reliability, ease of handling, and the desire to avoid loss and damage during transit are also important considerations, especially for higher-valued finished goods, machinery, and consumer products.Even for raw materials, semi-finished goods, and work-in-progress, users are increasingly sensitive to transport arrangements that minimize problems at successive production stages.



K11



Ourprimary rail competitor is CSXCorporation; bothrailroadsoperate throughout much of the same territory.Other railroads also operate in parts of the territory.Wealso compete with motor carriers, water carriers, and with shippers who have the additional options of handling their own goods in private carriage, sourcing products from different geographic areas, and using substitute products.



Certain marketing strategies among railroads and between railroads and motor carriers enablerailroadsto compete more effectively in specific markets.



SECURITY OF OPERATIONS–Wehavetaken significant steps to provide enhanced security for our rail system.In particular,we havedeveloped and implemented a comprehensive security plan that is modeled on and was developed in conjunction with the security plan prepared by the Association of American Railroads (AAR) post September 11, 2001.The AAR Security Plan defines four Alert Levels and details the actions and countermeasures that are being applied across the railroad industry asaterrorist threat increases or decreases.The Alert Level actions include countermeasures that will be applied in three general areas:(1) operations(including transportation, engineering, and mechanical); (2) information technology and communications; and, (3) railroad police.Although security concerns preclude public disclosure of its contents,ourSystemSecurity Plan outlines the protocol withinour companyfor all concerned to be notified of AAR Alert Level changes.Allof ourOperations Division employees are advised by their supervisors or train dispatchers, as appropriate, of any change in Alert Level and any additional responsibilities theymay incur due to such change.



Ourplan also effectively addresses and complies withU.S.Department of Transportation(DOT)security regulations pertaining to training and security plans with respect to the transportation of hazardous materials.As partof the plan, security awareness training is given to all railroad employees who directly affect hazardous material transportation safety, and this training is integrated into recurring hazardous material training and re-certification programs.Toward that end,we, working closely with the National Transit Institute at Rutgers University, havedeveloped a four-module uniform national training program.Wehavealsoworked with the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) in developing other industry training programs.More in-depth security training has been given to select employeesof ourswho have been given specific security responsibilities, and additional, location-specific security plans have been developed for certain metropolitan areas and each ofthesix port facilitiesweserve.With respect to the ports, each facility plan has been approved by the applicable Captain of the Port andissubject to inspection by the U.S. Coast Guard.



Additionally,weengage in close and regular coordinationwith numerous federal and state agencies, including the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS), the TSA, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the FRA, the U.S. Coast Guard, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, and various state Homeland Security offices.As one notable example,one of ourPolice Special Agentsin Charge (SAC), under the auspices of the AAR, has been assigned to the National Joint Terrorism Task Force (NJTTF) operated by the FBI, and located at the National Counter Terrorism Center(NCTC) in Arlington, Virginiato represent and serve as liaison to the North American rail industry.This arrangement improves logistical flow of vital security and law enforcement information with respect to the rail industry as a whole, whilehaving the post filled by one of ourSACshas also served to foster a strong working relationship betweenusand the FBI.Wealso havebecome a member of the Customs-Trade Partnership Against Terrorism (C-TPAT) program sponsored by U.S. Customs.C-TPAT allowsusto work closely with U.S. Customs andourcustomers to develop measures that will help ensure the integrity of freight shipments moving onour railroads, particularly those moving to or from a foreign country.Based on participation in C-TPAT,wehaveensured thatourplan meets all current applicable security recommendations made by U.S. Customs.



Similarly,we areguided inouroperations by various supplemental securityaction items issued by DHS andDOT, U.S. Coast Guard Maritime Security requirements,as well as voluntary security action items developed in collaboration with TSA, DOT, and the freight railroads. Many of the action items are based on lessons learned from DHS and DOT security assessments of rail corridors in High Threat Urban Areas (HTUA). Particular attention is aimed at reducing risk in HTUA by:(1) the establishment of secure storage areas for rail cars carrying toxic-by-inhalation (TIH) materials; (2) the expedited movement of trains transporting rail cars carrying TIH materials; (3)the minimization of unattended loaded tank cars carrying TIH materials; and (4) cooperation with

K12



federal, state, local and tribal governments to identify, through risk assessments, those locations where security risks are the highest.These action items andourcompliance initiatives are outlined in the various departmental sections of ourSystemSecurity Plan.Wehavetaken appropriate actions to be compliant with the TSA Final Security Rule addressing Rail Security Sensitive Materials (RSSM) to ensure these shipments are properly inspected and that positive chain-of-custody is maintained when required.We arein compliance with the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA) rail-routing regulations outlined in Docket HM-232E.Weconduct ongoing route evaluations.In 2011,as part of the FRA’s bi-annual review,this methodology and selected routes werefound to be compliant with the regulation.  The next review by the FRA is expected mid-year 2013.



In2012, through participation in the Transportation Community Awareness and Emergency Response (TRANSCAER) Program,weprovided rail accident response training to approximately5,087emergency responders, such as local police and fire personnel, representing over19,023hours of emergency response training.Wealso conducted railroad operations classes for FBI agents and the railroad liaison agents from NJTTF and participatedinfourdrills for local, state, andfederal agencies.Wealso haveongoing programs to sponsor local emergency responders at the Security and Emergency Response Training Course conducted at the AAR Transportation Technology Center in Pueblo, Colorado.



Improvements in equipment design also are expected to play a role in enhancing rail security.PHMSA, in coordination with the FRA,hasamendedthe Hazardous Materials Regulations to prescribe enhanced safety for rail transportation of TIH materials,has providedinterim design standards for railroad tank cars.The rule mandates commodity-specific improvements in safety features and design standards for newly manufactured DOT specification tank cars and an improved top fittings performance standard.The interim standards established in this rule will enhance the accident survivability of TIH tank cars.
