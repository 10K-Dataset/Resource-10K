GENERAL -Norfolk
Southern Corporation (Norfolk Southern) is a Norfolk, Virginia based company
that controls a major freight railroad, Norfolk Southern Railway Company.
 
Norfolk Southern Railway Company is primarily
engaged in the rail transportation of raw materials, intermediate products, and
finished goods primarily in the Southeast, East, and Midwest and, via
interchange with rail carriers, to and from the rest of the United States.
 
Norfolk Southern also transports overseas freight
through several Atlantic and Gulf Coast ports.
 

Norfolk Southern provides comprehensive logistics services and offers
the most extensive intermodal network in the eastern half of the United States.
 
The common stock of Norfolk Southern is
listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) under the symbol "NSC."



Norfolk Southern was
incorporated on July 23, 1980, under the laws of the Commonwealth of
Virginia.
 
On June 1, 1982, Norfolk
Southern acquired control of two major operating railroads, Norfolk and Western
Railway Company (NW) and Southern Railway Company (Southern) in accordance with
an Agreement of Merger and Reorganization dated as of July 31, 1980, and
with the approval of the transaction by the Interstate Commerce Commission (now
the Surface Transportation Board [STB]).
 

Effective December 31, 1990, Norfolk Southern transferred all the
common stock of NW to Southern and Southern's name was changed to Norfolk
Southern Railway Company (Norfolk Southern Railway or NSR).
 
Effective September 1, 1998, NW was merged
with and into Norfolk Southern Railway.
 

As of December 31, 2009, all the common stock of Norfolk Southern
Railway was owned directly by Norfolk Southern.



Through a limited liability
company, Norfolk Southern and CSX Corporation (CSX) jointly own Conrail Inc.
(Conrail), whose primary subsidiary is Consolidated Rail Corporation
(CRC).
 
Norfolk Southern has a 58%
economic and 50% voting interest in the jointly owned entity, and CSX has the
remainder of the economic and voting interests.
 

CRC owns and operates certain properties (the Shared Assets Areas) for
the joint and exclusive benefit of NSR and CSX Transportation Inc. (CSXT) (see
Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements).



Norfolk Southern makes
available free of charge through its website, www.nscorp.com, its annual report

RAILWAY OPERATING REVENUES -NS' total railway operating revenues were $8.0 billion
in 2009.
 
See the financial information
by traffic segment in Part II, Item 7, "Management's Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations."



COAL TRAFFIC -Coal,
coke, and iron ore - most of which is bituminous coal - is NS' railroads'
largest commodity group as measured by revenues.
 
The railroads handled a total of 157.5
million tons in 2009, most of which originated on NS' lines in West Virginia,
Virginia, Pennsylvania, and Kentucky.
 

Revenues from coal, coke, and iron ore accounted for about 29% of NS'
total railway operating revenues in 2009.



Total coal handled through
all system ports in 2009 was 29.8 million tons.
 
Of this total, 14.9 million tons
(including coastwise traffic) moved through Norfolk, Virginia, 3.8 million
tons (including coastwise traffic) moved through the Baltimore Terminal, 7.5 million
tons moved to various docks on the Ohio River, and 3.6 million tons moved
to various Lake Erie ports.
 
Other than
coal for export, virtually all coal handled by NS' railroads was terminated in
states east of the Mississippi River.



See the discussion of coal
traffic, by type of coal, in Part II, Item 7, "Management's Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations."





GENERAL MERCHANDISE TRAFFIC -General merchandise traffic is composed of five major
commodity groupings:
 
automotive;
chemicals; metals and construction; agriculture, consumer products and
government; and paper, clay and forest products.
 
The automotive group includes finished
vehicles for BMW, Chrysler, Ford Motor Company, General Motors, Honda, Isuzu,
Mazda, Mercedes-Benz, Mitsubishi, Nissan, Subaru, Suzuki, Toyota, and
Volkswagen, and auto parts for Ford Motor Company, General Motors, and Chrysler.
 
The chemicals group includes sulfur and
related chemicals, petroleum products, chlorine and bleaching compounds,
plastics, rubber, industrial chemicals, chemical wastes, and municipal
wastes.
 
The metals and construction
group includes steel, aluminum products, machinery, scrap metals, cement,
aggregates, bricks, and minerals.
 
The
agriculture, consumer products, and government group includes soybeans, wheat,
corn, fertilizer, animal and poultry feed, food oils, flour, beverages, canned
goods, sweeteners, consumer products, ethanol, and items for the military.
 
The paper, clay and forest products group
includes lumber and wood products, pulp board and paper products, wood fibers,
wood pulp, scrap paper, and clay.



In 2009, 105 million
tons of general merchandise freight, or approximately 65% of total general
merchandise tonnage handled by NS, originated online.
 
The balance of general merchandise traffic
was received from connecting carriers at interterritorial gateways.
 
The principal interchange points for
NS-received traffic included Chicago, Memphis, New Orleans, Cincinnati, Kansas
City, Detroit, Hagerstown, St. Louis/East St. Louis, and Louisville.
 
General merchandise carloads handled in 2009
were 2.0 million, the revenues from which accounted for 52% of NS' total
railway operating revenues in 2009.



See the discussion of general
merchandise rail traffic by commodity group in Part II, Item 7, "Management's
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations."



INTERMODAL TRAFFIC -The intermodal market consists of shipments moving in
trailers, domestic and international containers, and RoadRailer®
equipment.
 
These shipments are handled
on behalf of intermodal marketing companies, international steamship lines, truckers,
and other shippers.
 
Intermodal units
handled in 2009 were 2.5 million, the revenues from which accounted for 19%
of NS' total railway operating revenues for the year.



See the discussion of
intermodal traffic in Part II, Item 7, "Management's Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Conditions and Results of Operations."



FREIGHT RATES -In 2009, NS' railroads continued their reliance on private contracts
and exempt price quotes as their predominant pricing mechanisms.
 
Thus, a major portion of NS' freight business
is not currently economically regulated by the government.
 
In general, market forces have been
substituted for government regulation and now are the primary determinant of
rail service prices.



In 2009, NS' railroads were
found by the STB to be "revenue adequate" based on results for the year 2008.
 
The STB has not made its revenue adequacy
determination for the year 2009.
 
A
railroad is "revenue adequate" under the applicable law when its return on net
investment exceeds the rail industry's composite cost of capital.
 
This determination is made pursuant to a
statutory requirement.

NONCARRIER OPERATIONS -NS' noncarrier subsidiaries engage principally in the
acquisition, leasing, and management of coal, oil, gas and minerals; the
development of commercial real estate; telecommunications; and the leasing or
sale of rail property and equipment.
 
In
2009, no such noncarrier subsidiary or industry segment grouping of noncarrier
subsidiaries met the requirements for a reportable business segment, under relevant
authoritative accounting guidance.

RAILWAY PROPERTY



The NS railroad system
extends across 22 states and the District of Columbia.
 
The railroad infrastructure makes the company
capital intensive with net property of approximately $23 billion.



Capital Expenditures -Capital expenditures for road, equipment, and other
property for the past five years were as follows (including capitalized
leases):



Capital
  Expenditures20092008200720062005($ in

Capital spending and
maintenance programs are and have been designed to assure the ability to
provide safe, efficient, and reliable rail transportation services.
 
For 2010, NS has budgeted $1.44 billion
of capital expenditures.
 
On May 1, 2006,
NS and Kansas City Southern (KCS) formed a joint venture, Meridian Speedway LLC
(MSLLC), pursuant to which NS intends to contribute $300 million in cash,
substantially all of which will be used for capital improvements over a period
of approximately three years, in exchange for a 30% interest in the joint
venture.
 
Through December 31, 2009, NS
has contributed $283 million.
 
See
the discussion following "Cash used for investing activities," in Part II, Item
7, "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of

Encumbrances -Certain
railroad equipment is subject to the prior lien of equipment financing
obligations amounting to approximately $150 million as of December 31,
2009, and $236 million as of December 31, 2008.



Track Maintenance -Of the approximately 37,100 total miles of track operated, NS had
responsibility for maintaining about 29,600 miles of track, with the remainder
being operated under trackage rights from another party responsible for
maintenance.



Over 75% of the main line
trackage (including first, second, third, and branch main tracks, all excluding
rail operated pursuant to trackage rights) has rail ranging from 131 to 155
pounds per yard with the standard installation currently at 136 pounds per
yard.
 
Approximately 36% of NS lines,
excluding rail operated pursuant to trackage rights, carried 20 million or
more gross tons per track mile during 2009.

Microwave System -The NS microwave system, consisting of approximately 7,400 radio route
miles, 429 core stations, 30 secondary stations, and 5 passive repeater
stations, provides communications between most operating locations.
 
The microwave system is used primarily for
voice communications, VHF radio control circuits, data and facsimile
transmissions, traffic control operations, and AEI data transmissions.



Traffic Control -Of the approximately 16,600 route miles dispatched by
NS, about 11,100 miles are signalized, including 8,200 miles of centralized
traffic control (CTC) and 2,900 miles of automatic block signals.
 
Of the 8,200 miles of CTC, approximately 3,900
miles are controlled by data radio originating at 271 base station radio sites.



Computers -A computer network consisting of a centralized data
center in Atlanta, Georgia, and various distributed computers throughout the
company connects the yards, terminals, transportation offices, rolling stock
repair points, sales offices, and other key system locations.
 
Operating and traffic data are processed and
stored to provide customers with information on their shipments throughout the
system.
 
Computer systems provide current
information on the location of every train and each car on line, as well as
related waybill and other train and car movement data.
 
In addition, the computer systems are
utilized to assist management in the performance of a variety of functions and
services including payroll, car and revenue accounting, billing, material
management activities and controls, and special studies.



ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS -Compliance with federal, state, and local laws and
regulations relating to the protection of the environment is a principal NS
goal.
 
To date, such compliance has not
affected materially NS' capital additions, earnings, liquidity, or competitive
position.
 
See "Legal Proceedings," Part
I, Item 3; "Personal Injury, Environmental, and Legal Liabilities" in Part II,
Item 7, "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations," and Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.



EMPLOYEES -The following table shows the average number of
employees and the average cost per employee for wages and benefits:

  benefit cost per employee$32,000$31,000$30,000$32,000$29,000



More
than 80% of NS' railroad employees are covered by collective bargaining
agreements with various labor unions.
 

See the discussion of "Labor Agreements" in Part II, Item 7,
"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations."



GOVERNMENT REGULATION -In addition to environmental, safety, securities, and
other regulations generally applicable to all businesses, NS' railroads are
subject to regulation by the STB.
 
The
STB has jurisdiction over some rates, routes, fuel surcharges, conditions of
service, and the extension or abandonment of rail lines.
 
The STB also has jurisdiction over the
consolidation, merger, or acquisition of control of and by rail common
carriers.
 
The Federal Railroad
Administration regulates certain track and mechanical equipment standards.



The
relaxation of economic regulation of railroads, under the Staggers Rail Act of
1980, includes exemptions of intermodal business (trailer-on-flat-car,
container-on-flat-car), rail boxcar traffic, lumber, manufactured steel,
automobiles, and certain bulk commodities such as sand, gravel, pulpwood, and
wood chips for paper manufacturing.
 

Transportation contracts on these shipments and on regulated shipments
effectively remove those shipments from regulation as well for the duration of
the contract.
 
About 88% of NS' freight
revenues come from either exempt traffic or traffic moving under transportation
contracts.



Efforts
were made in 2009 to re-subject the rail industry to increased federal economic
regulation and such efforts are expected to continue in 2010.
 
The Staggers Rail Act of 1980, which
substantially balanced such regulation, encouraged and enabled rail carriers to
innovate and to compete for business, thereby contributing to the economic
health of the nation and to the revitalization of the industry.
 
Accordingly, NS will continue to oppose
efforts to reimpose increased economic regulation.



COMPETITION -There is continuing strong competition among rail,
water, and highway carriers.
 
Price is
usually only one factor of importance as shippers and receivers choose a
transport mode and specific hauling company.
 

Inventory carrying costs, service reliability, ease of handling, and the
desire to avoid loss and damage during transit are also important
considerations, especially for higher-valued finished goods, machinery, and
consumer products.
 
Even for raw
materials, semifinished goods, and work-in-progress, users are increasingly sensitive
to transport arrangements that minimize problems at successive production
stages.



NS'
primary rail competitor is the CSX system; both operate throughout much of the
same territory.
 
Other railroads also
operate in parts of the territory.
 
NS
also competes with motor carriers, water carriers, and with shippers who have
the additional option of handling their own goods in private carriage, of
sourcing products from different geographic areas, and of using substitute
products.



Certain
marketing strategies among railroads and between railroads and motor carriers
enable carriers to compete more effectively in specific markets.



SECURITY OF OPERATIONS -NS has taken significant steps to provide enhanced
security for the NS rail system.
 
In
particular, NS has developed and implemented a comprehensive security plan that
is modeled on and was developed in conjunction with the security plan prepared
by the Association of American Railroads (AAR) post September 11,
2001.
 
The AAR Security Plan defines four
Alert Levels and details the actions and countermeasures that are being applied
across the railroad industry as the terrorist threat increases or
decreases.
 
The Alert Level actions
include countermeasures that will be applied in three general areas:
 
(1) operations (including transportation, engineering,
and mechanical); (2) information technology and communications; and (3)
railroad police.
 
Although security
concerns preclude public disclosure of its contents, the NS Departmental
Security Plan outlines the protocol within NS for all concerned to be notified
of AAR Alert Level changes.
 
All NS
Operations Division employees are advised by their supervisors or train
dispatchers, as appropriate, of any change in Alert Level and any additional
responsibilities they may incur due to such change.



The
NS plan also effectively addresses and complies with Department of
Transportation security regulations pertaining to training and security plans
with respect to the transportation of hazardous materials.
 
As part of the plan, security awareness
training is given to all railroad employees who directly affect hazardous
material transportation safety, and this training is integrated into recurring
hazardous material training and re-certification programs.
 
Toward that end, NS, working closely with the
National Transit Institute at Rutgers University, has developed a four-module
uniform national training program.
 
NS
also has worked with the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) in
developing other industry training programs.
 

More in-depth security training has been given to those select NS
employees who have been given specific security responsibilities, and
additional, location-specific security plans have been developed for certain
metropolitan areas and each of six port facilities served by NS.
 
With respect to the ports, each facility plan
has been approved by the applicable Captain of the Port and subject to
inspection by the U.S. Coast Guard.



Additionally,
NS engages in close and regular coordination with numerous federal and state
agencies, including the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS), the TSA,
the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the Federal Railroad Administration
(FRA), the U.S. Coast Guard, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, and various
state Homeland Security offices.
 
As one
notable example, an NS Police Special Agent, under the auspices of the AAR, has
been assigned to the National Joint Terrorism Task Force (NJTTF) operating out
of FBI Headquarters in Washington, DC to represent and serve as liaison to the
North American rail industry.
 
This
arrangement improves logistical flow of vital security and law enforcement
information with respect to the rail industry as a whole, while having the post
filled by an NS Special Agent has served to foster a strong working
relationship between NS and the FBI.
 
NS
also has become a member of the Customs-Trade Partnership Against Terrorism
(C-TPAT) program sponsored by U.S. Customs.
 

C-TPAT allows NS to work closely with U.S. Customs and its customers to
develop measures that will help ensure the integrity of freight shipments
moving on NS, particularly those moving to or from a foreign country.
 
Based on participation in C-TPAT, NS has
ensured that its plan meets all current applicable security recommendations
made by U.S. Customs.





In
2009, through participation in the Transportation Community Awareness and
Emergency Response (TRANSCAER) Program, NS provided rail accident response
training to approximately 4,500 emergency responders, such as local police and
fire personnel, representing over 34,000 man-hours of emergency response
training.
 
NS also conducted railroad
operations classes for FBI agents and the railroad liaison agents from Joint
Terrorism Task Forces.
 
NS' other
training efforts throughout 2009 included participation in 10 drills for local,
state, and federal agencies.
 
NS also has
ongoing programs to sponsor local emergency responders at the Security and Emergency
Response Training Course (SERTC) conducted at the AAR Transportation Technology
Center in Pueblo, Colorado.
 
Also, the NS
annual TRANSCAER Whistle-Stop train makes stops in numerous cities, its special
training cars serving as a resource to an audience of nearly 1,000 emergency
responders annually.



Improvements
in equipment design also are expected to play a role in enhancing rail
security.
 
The Pipeline and Hazardous
Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA), in coordination with the FRA, is
amending the Hazardous Materials Regulations to prescribe enhanced safety measures
for rail transportation of TIH materials, including interim design standards
for railroad tank cars.
 
The rule
mandates commodity-specific improvements in safety features and design
standards for newly manufactured DOT specification tank cars and an improved
top fittings performance standard.
 
The
interim standards established in this rule will enhance the accident
survivability of TIH tank cars.
