RAILWAY OPERATING REVENUES–Total railway operating revenues were$10.5 billionin2015.  Following is an overview of our three major market groups.





COAL–Revenues from coal accounted for about 17% of our total railway operating revenues in2015.  We handled120 milliontons, or1.1 millioncarloads, in2015, most of which originated on our lines from major eastern coal basins, with the balance from major western coal basins received via the Memphis and Chicago gateways.  Our coal franchise supports the electric generation market, serving approximately 79 coal generation plants, as well as the export, metallurgical and industrial markets,primarily through direct rail and river, lake, and coastal facilities, including various terminals on the Ohio River,Lambert’sPoint in Norfolk, Virginia,the Port of Baltimore, and Lake Erie.



See the discussion of coal revenues and tonnage, by type of coal, in Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”





GENERAL MERCHANDISE–Our general merchandise market group is composed of five major commodity groupings:

•Chemicals includes sulfur and related chemicals, petroleum products (including crude oil), chlorine and bleaching compounds, plastics, rubber, industrial chemicals, and chemical wastes.

•Agriculture, consumer products, and government includes soybeans, wheat, corn, fertilizer, livestock and poultry feed, food oils, flour, beverages, canned goods, sweeteners, consumer products, ethanol, transportation equipment, and items for the U.S. military.



K5







•Metals and construction includes steel, aluminum products, machinery, scrap metals, cement, aggregates, sand, and minerals.

•Automotive includes finished vehicles for BMW, Chrysler, Ford, General Motors, Honda, Hyundai, Mercedes-Benz, Mitsubishi, Subaru, Tesla, Toyota, and Volkswagen, and auto parts for BMW, Chrysler, Ford, General Motors, Honda, Hyundai, Mazda, Nissan, Subaru, Toyota, and Volkswagen.

•Paper, clay and forest products includes lumber and wood products, pulp board and paper products, wood fibers, wood pulp, scrap paper, and clay.



In2015, 124 million tons of general merchandise freight, or approximately 62% of total general merchandise tonnage we handled, originated on our lines.  The balance of general merchandise freight was received from connecting carriers at interterritorial gateways.  Our principal interchange points for received freight included Chicago, East St. Louis, New Orleans, Memphis, Detroit, Kansas City, Bellevue, Meridian, Buffalo and Toledo.  General merchandise carloads handled in2015were2.5 million, the revenues from which accounted for 60% of our total railway operating revenues.



See the discussion of general merchandise revenues by commodity group in Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”





INTERMODAL–Our intermodal market group consists of shipments moving in trailers, domestic and international containers, and RoadRailer® equipment.  These shipments are handled on behalf of intermodal marketing companies, international steamship lines, truckers, and other shippers.  Intermodal units handled in2015were 3.9 million, the revenues from which accounted for 23% of our total railway operating revenues.



See the discussion of intermodal revenues in Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”





FREIGHT RATES–Private contracts and exempt price quotesare ourpredominant pricing mechanisms.  Thus, a major portion of our freight business is not economically regulated by thefederalgovernment.  In general, market forcesare the primary determinant of rail service prices.



In2015, our railroads were found by the U.S. Surface Transportation Board (STB), the regulatory board that has broad jurisdiction over railroad practices, to be “revenue adequate” on an annual basis based on results for the year2014.  The STB has not made its revenue adequacy determination for the year2015.A railroad is “revenue adequate” on an annual basis under the applicable law when its return on net investment exceeds the rail industry’s composite cost of capital.  This determination is made pursuant to a statutory requirement.





PASSENGER OPERATIONS–Amtrak operates regularly scheduled passenger trains on our lines between the following locations:

•Alexandria andLynchburg, Virginia

•Alexandria, Virginia and New Orleans, Louisiana

•Alexandria andOrange, Virginia

•Petersburgand Norfolk, Virginia

•Raleigh and Charlotte, North Carolina

•Selma and Charlotte, North Carolina

•Chicago, Illinois, and Porter, Indiana

•Chicago, Illinois, and Cleveland, Ohio

•Chicago, Illinois, and Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania

•Pittsburgh and Harrisburg, Pennsylvania



A consortium of two transportation commissions of the Commonwealth of Virginia operate commuter trains on ourline between Manassas and Alexandria.

•Metro-North Commuter Railroad Company

•Maryland Department of Transportation

•Michigan Department of Transportation



Amtrakand variouscommuter agencies conduct passenger operations over trackage owned by Conrail in the Shared Assets Areas (Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements).





NONCARRIER OPERATIONS–Ournoncarrier subsidiaries engage principally in the acquisition, leasing, and management of coal, oil, gas and minerals; the development of commercial real estate; telecommunications; and the leasing or sale of rail property and equipment.  In2015, no such noncarrier subsidiary or industry segment grouping of noncarrier subsidiaries met the requirements for a reportable business segment under relevant authoritative accounting guidance.





RAILWAY PROPERTY



Ourrailroad system extends across22states and the District of Columbia.  The railroad infrastructure makesuscapital intensive with net property of approximately $29 billion on a historical cost basis.

Track Maintenance–Of the 36,200 total miles of track we operate, we are responsible for maintaining 29,000 miles, with the remainder being operated under trackage rights from other parties responsible for maintenance.



Over 82% of the main line trackage (including first, second, third, and branch main tracks, all excluding rail operated pursuant to trackage rights) has rail ranging from 131 to 155 pounds per yard with the standard installation currently at 136 pounds per yard.  Approximately 43% of our lines, excluding rail operated pursuant to trackage rights, carried 20 million or more gross tons per track mile during2015.

Traffic Control–Of the approximately 16,800 route miles we dispatch, about 11,300 miles are signalized, including 8,500 miles of centralized traffic control (CTC) and 2,800 miles of automatic block signals.  Of the 8,500 miles of CTC, approximately 7,600 miles are controlled by data radio originating at 355 base station radio sites.





ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS–Compliance with federal, state, and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment isone ourprincipal goals.  To date, such compliancehas not had a material effect on our financial position, results of operations, liquidity, or competitive position.  See “Legal Proceedings,” Part I, Item 3; “Personal Injury, Environmental, and Legal Liabilities” in Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” and Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

More than80%of ourrailroad employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements with various labor unions. See the discussion of “Labor Agreements” in Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”





GOVERNMENT REGULATION–In addition to environmental, safety, securities, and other regulations generally applicable to all business, ourrailroads are subject to regulation by the STB.  The STB has jurisdiction over some rates, routes, fuel surcharges, conditions of service, and the extension or abandonment of rail lines.  The STB also has jurisdiction over the consolidation, merger, or acquisition of control of and by rail common carriers.  The Federal Railroad Administration(FRA)regulates certain track and mechanical equipment standards.



The relaxation of economic regulation of railroads, following the Staggers Rail Act of 1980, included exemption from STB regulation of the rates and most service terms for intermodal business (trailer-on-flat-car, container-on-flat-car), rail boxcar shipments, lumber, manufactured steel, automobiles, and certain bulk commodities such as sand, gravel, pulpwood, and wood chips for paper manufacturing.  Further, all shipments that we have under contract are effectively removed from commercial regulation for the duration of the contract.  About 90% of our revenues comes from either exempt shipments or shipments moving under transportation contracts; the remainder comes from shipments moving under public tariff rates.



Effortshave been made over the past several yearsto increase federal economic regulation of the rail industry,and such efforts are expected to continue in2016.  The Staggers Rail Act of 1980substantially balancedthe interests of shippers and rail carriers,andencouraged and enabled rail carriers to innovate, invest in their infrastructure, and compete for business, thereby contributing to the economic health of the nation and to the revitalization of the industry.  Accordingly,wewill continue to oppose efforts to reimpose increased economic regulation.



Government regulations concerning the safety and security of our railroads are discussed within the “Security of Operations” section contained herein.





COMPETITION–There is continuing strong competition among rail, water, and highway carriers.  Price is usually only one factor of importance as shippers and receivers choose a transport mode and specific hauling company. Inventory carrying costs, service reliability, ease of handling, and the desire to avoid loss and damage during transit are also important considerations, especially for higher-valued finished goods, machinery, and consumer products.  Even for raw materials, semi-finished goods, and work-in-progress, users are increasingly sensitive to transport arrangements that minimize problems at successive production stages.



Ourprimary rail competitor is CSXCorporation; bothrailroadsoperate throughout much of the same territory.  Other railroads also operate in parts of the territory.  Wealso compete with motor carriers, water carriers, and with shippers who have the additional options of handling their own goods in private carriage, sourcing products from different geographic areas, and using substitute products.



Certain marketing strategies to expand reach and shipping options among railroads and between railroads and motor carriers enablerailroadsto compete more effectively in specific markets.





SECURITY OF OPERATIONS-We continue to take measures to enhance the security of our rail system. Our comprehensive security plan is modeled on and was developed in conjunction with the security plan prepared by the



K10







Association of American Railroads (AAR) post September 11, 2001.  The AAR Security Plan defines four Alert Levels and details the actions and countermeasures that are being applied across the railroad industry as a terrorist threat increases or decreases.  The Alert Level actions include countermeasures that will be applied in three general areas:  (1) operations (including transportation, engineering, and mechanical); (2) information technology and communications; and, (3) railroad police.  All of our Operations Division employees are advised by their supervisors or train dispatchers, as appropriate, of any change in Alert Level and any additional responsibilities they may incur due to such change.



Our plan also complies with U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) security regulations pertaining to training and security plans with respect to the transportation of hazardous materials.  As part of the plan, security awareness training is given to all railroad employees who directly affect hazardous material transportation safety, and is integrated into hazardous material training programs.  Additionally, location-specific security plans are in place for certain metropolitan areas and each of the six port facilities we serve.  With respect to the ports, each facility's security plan has been approved by the applicable Captain of the Port and remains subject to inspection by the U.S. Coast Guard.



Additionally, we continue to engage in close and regular coordination with numerous federal and state agencies, including the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS), the TSA, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the FRA, the U.S. Coast Guard, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, and various state Homeland Security offices.

Similarly, we follow guidance from DHS and DOT regarding rail corridors in High Threat Urban Areas (HTUA). Particular attention is aimed at reducing risk in HTUA by:  (1) the establishment of secure storage areas for rail cars carrying toxic-by-inhalation (TIH) materials; (2) the expedited movement of trains transporting rail cars carrying TIH materials; (3) substantially reducing the number of unattended loaded tank cars carrying TIH materials; and (4) cooperation with federal, state, local, and tribal governments to identify those locations where security risks are the highest.



In 2015, through participation in the Transportation Community Awareness and Emergency Response (TRANSCAER) Program, we provided rail accident response training to approximately 4,792 emergency responders, such as local police and fire personnel. Our other training efforts throughout 2015 included participation in drills for local, state, and federal agencies.  We also have ongoing programs to sponsor local emergency responders at the Security and Emergency Response Training Course conducted at the AAR Transportation Technology Center in Pueblo, Colorado.
