In 2012 we completed the acquisition of Surpass Medical, Ltd. (Surpass).  Surpass is developing and commercializing next-generation flow diversion stent technology to treat brain aneurysms using a unique mesh design and delivery system.   The acquisition of Surpass enhances the product offerings within our Neurotechnology product line.



In 2011 we acquired the assets of the Neurovascular division of Boston Scientific Corporation (Neurovascular), as well as Concentric Medical, Inc., a manufacturer of minimally invasive products for the treatment of acute ischemic stroke.  These acquisitions significantly expanded our product offerings within our Neurotechnology product line.



In 2011 we completed the acquisition of Orthovita, Inc. (Orthovita), a developer of orthobiologic and biosurgery products, including synthetic bone grafts and vertebral augmentation products. The acquisition of Orthovita complements our existing product offerings, primarily within our Spine product line.

Geographic Areas



In 2012 approximately65.4%of our revenues were generated from customers in the United States. Internationally our products are sold in over 100 countries through local dealers and direct sales efforts. Additional geographic information is included under "Results of Operations" in Item 7 of this report and Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report.



Raw Materials and Inventory



Raw materials essential to our business are generally readily available from multiple sources.  Substantially all products we manufacture are stocked in inventory, while certain MedSurg products are assembled to order.  A substantial amount of our neurovascular finished goods are currently sourced from Boston Scientific Corporation; the manufacture of these products will transfer to Stryker during 2013.  The dollar amount of backlog orders at any given time is not considered to be significant.



Patents and Trademarks



Patents and trademarks are significant to our business to the extent that a product or an attribute of a product represents a unique design or process.  Patent protection of such products restricts competitors from duplicating these unique designs and features.  We seek to obtain patent protection on our products whenever appropriate for protecting our competitive advantage.  As of December 31, 2012, we own approximately 1,687 United States patents and 3,081 international patents.



Seasonality



Our business is generally not seasonal in nature; however, the number of reconstructive implant surgeries is generally lower during the summer months.



Competition



In all of our product lines we compete with local and global companies located throughout the world.  Competition exists in all product lines without regard to the number and size of the competing companies involved. The development of new and innovative products is important to our success in all areas of our business and competition in research, involving the development and the improvement of new and existing products and processes, is particularly significant.  The competitive environment requires substantial investments in continuing research and in maintaining sales forces.



The principal factors that we believe differentiate us in the highly competitive product categories in which we operate and enable us to compete effectively include our commitment to innovation and quality, service and reputation. We believe that our competitive position in the future will depend to a large degree on our ability to develop new products and make improvements to existing products.



Product Development



Most of our products and product improvements, with the exception of our neurotechnology products, have been developed internally at research facilities located in manufacturing locations in the United States, Ireland, Puerto Rico, Germany, Switzerland, India and

France.   We also invest through acquisitions in technologies developed by third parties that have the potential to expand the markets in which we operate.  We maintain close working relationships with physicians and medical personnel in hospitals and universities who assist us in product development efforts. The total costs of worldwide Company-sponsored research, development and engineering activities relating to the development of new products, improvement of existing products, technical support of products and compliance with governmental regulations for the protection of customers and patients were$471, $462 and $394 in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively.  Research, development and engineering expenses as a percentage of sales were5.4%, 5.6% and 5.4% in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The spending level in 2012 as a percentage of sales decreased primarily due to the termination of all development of the OP-1 molecule in late 2011.



Regulation



Our businesses are subject to varying degrees of governmental regulation in the countries in which operations are conducted, and the general trend is toward increasingly stringent regulation.



In the United States, the Medical Device Amendments of 1976 to the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act and its subsequent amendments, and the regulations issued or proposed thereunder, provide for regulation by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) of the design, manufacture and marketing of medical devices, including most of our products.  Many of our new products fall into FDA classifications that require notification of and review by the FDA before marketing, submitted as a 510(k). Certain of our products require extensive clinical testing, consisting of safety and efficacy studies, followed by pre-market approval (PMA) applications for specific surgical indications.



The FDA's Quality System regulations set forth standards for our product design and manufacturing processes, require the maintenance of certain records and provide for inspections of our facilities by the FDA. There are also certain requirements of state, local and foreign governments that must be complied with in the manufacture and marketing of our products.



The member states of the European Union (EU) have adopted the European Medical Device Directives that form a single set of medical device regulations for all EU member countries. These regulations require companies that wish to manufacture and distribute medical devices in EU member countries to meet certain quality system requirements and obtain CE Marking for their products. We have authorization to apply the CE Marking to substantially all of our products. In addition, we comply with the unique regulatory requirements of each of the countries in which we market our products.



Initiatives sponsored by government agencies, legislative bodies and the private sector to limit the growth of healthcare expenses generally and hospital costs in particular, including price regulation and competitive pricing, are ongoing in markets where we do business. It is not possible to predict at this time the long-term impact of such cost containment measures on our future business.



In addition, business practices in the healthcare industry have come under increased scrutiny, particularly in the United States, by government agencies and state attorneys general, and resulting investigations and prosecutions carry the risk of significant civil and criminal penalties.



Employees



At December 31, 2012, we had approximately 22,010 employees worldwide.  Certain international employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements.  We believe that we maintain positive relationships with our employees worldwide.
