MARKET OVERVIEW



Enterprise leaders face enormous pressure to stay ahead and grow profitably amidst constant change. Whether it is an impending transition to digital business or large-scale regulatory changes, business leaders today are facing more disruptive change than ever before. No enterprise can be operationally effective unless it incorporates the right strategy, management and technology decisions into every part of its business. This requirement affects all business levels, functions and roles. Chief financial officers, heads of human resources, chief marketing officers, chief information officers, and other executives and leaders across all enterprises turn to Gartner for decision-making guidance and execution support to achieve their mission-critical priorities.



OUR SOLUTION



We believe our unmatched combination of expert-led, practitioner-sourced and data-driven research steers clients toward the right decisions and actions on the issues that matter most. We employ a diversified business model that utilizes and leverages the breadth and depth of our intellectual capital. The foundation of our business model is our ability to create and distribute our proprietary research content as broadly as possible via published reports, interactive tools, facilitated peer networking, briefings, consulting and advisory services, and our conferences, including the Gartner Symposium/Xpo series.



PRODUCTS AND SERVICES



Our diversified business model provides multiple entry points and sources of value for our clients that facilitate increased client spending on our research and advisory services, conferences and consulting services. A critical part of our long-term strategy is to increase business volume and penetration with our most valuable clients, identifying relationships with the greatest sales potential and expanding those relationships by offering strategically relevant research and advice. We also seek to extend the Gartner brand name to develop new client relationships, augment our sales capacity and expand into new markets around the world. In addition, we seek to increase our revenue and operating cash flow through more effective pricing of our products and services. These initiatives have created additional revenue streams through more effective packaging, campaigning and cross-selling of our products and services.












Our principal products and services are delivered through our three business segments, as described below.



•RESEARCH.Gartner delivers independent, objective advice to leaders across an enterprise through subscription services that include on-demand access to published research content, data and benchmarks, and direct access to a network of approximately 2,300 research experts located around the globe. Gartner research is the fundamental building block for all Gartner products and services. We combine our proprietary research methodologies with extensive industry and academic relationships to create Gartner products and services that address each role across an enterprise. Within the Research segment, Global Technology Sales ("GTS") sells products and services to users and providers of technology, while Global Business Sales ("GBS") sells products and services to all other functional leaders, such as supply chain, marketing, HR, finance, legal and sales.



Our research agenda is defined by clients’ needs, focusing on the critical issues, opportunities and challenges they face every day. We are in steady contact with over15,000distinct client enterprises worldwide. We publish tens of thousands of pages of original research annually, and our research experts have more than 400,000 direct client interactions every year. Our size and scale enable us to commit vast resources toward broader and deeper research coverage and to deliver insight to our clients based on what they need and where they are. The ongoing interaction of our research experts with our clients enables us to identify the most pertinent topics to them and develop relevant product and service enhancements to meet the evolving needs of users of our research. Our proprietary research content, presented in the form of reports, briefings, updates and related tools, is delivered directly to the client’s desktop via our website and/or product-specific portals.



Clients normally sign subscription contracts that provide access to our research content and advisory services for individual users over a defined period. We typically have a minimum contract period of twelve months for our research and advisory subscription contracts and, at December 31,2019, a significant portion of our contracts were multi-year.



•CONFERENCES.Gartner attracts more than 85,000 business and technology professionals to its 70+ destination conferences worldwide each year. Attendees experience sessions led by Gartner research experts, cutting-edge technology solutions, peer exchange workshops, one-on-one analyst and advisor meetings, consulting diagnostic workshops, keynotes and more. Our conferences also provide attendees with an opportunity to interact with business executives from the world’s leading technology companies. In addition to role-specific summits and workshop-style seminars, Gartner hosts the Gartner Symposium/Xpo series, including its unique, flagship IT Symposium/Xpo®, which is held at nine locations worldwide annually. We also host 700+ more intimate live meetings each year for peer collaboration, and 240+ exclusive C-level meetings through the Evanta brand.



•CONSULTING.Through its experienced consultants, Gartner Consulting serves chief information officers and other senior executives who are driving technology-related strategic initiatives to optimize technology investments and drive business impact. Gartner Consulting combines the power of Gartner’s market-leading research with custom analysis and on-the-ground support to help clients to turn insights and advice into action and impact.



Consulting solutions capitalize on Gartner assets that are invaluable to information technology ("IT") decision-making, including: (1) our extensive research, which ensures that our consulting analyses and advice are based on a deep understanding of the IT environment and the business of IT; (2) our market independence, which keeps our consultants focused on our clients' success; and (3) our market-leading benchmarking capabilities, which provide relevant comparisons and best practices to assess and improve performance. Additionally, we provide actionable solutions for a range of IT-related priorities, including IT cost optimization, technology modernization and IT sourcing optimization.



COMPETITION



We believe that the principal factors that differentiate us from our competitors are as follows:



•Superior research content - We believe that we create the broadest, highest-quality and most relevant research coverage across all major functional roles in an enterprise. Our independent operating model and research analysis generates unbiased insight that we believe is timely, thought-provoking and comprehensive, and that is known for its high quality, independence and objectivity.



•Our leading brand name - We have provided critical, trusted insight under the Gartner name for more than 40 years.



•Our global footprint and established customer base - We have a global presence with clients in more than100countries on six continents. A substantial portion of our revenue is derived from sales outside of the United States.












•Experienced management team - Our management team is comprised of research veterans and experienced industry executives with long tenure at Gartner.



•Substantial operating leverage in our business model - We can distribute our intellectual property and expertise across multiple platforms, including research and advisory subscription and membership programs, conferences and consulting engagements, to derive incremental revenue and profitability.



•Vast network of research experts and consultants - As of December 31,2019, we had approximately 2,300 research experts and 780+ experienced consultants located around the world. Our research experts are located in more than30countries, enabling us to cover vast aspects of business and technology on a global basis.



Notwithstanding these differentiating factors, we face competition from a significant number of independent providers of information products and services. We compete indirectly with consulting firms and other data and information providers, including electronic and print media companies. These indirect competitors could choose to compete directly with us in the future. In addition, we face competition from free sources of information that are available to our clients through the internet. Limited barriers to entry exist in the markets in which we do business. As a result, new competitors may emerge and existing competitors may start to provide additional or complementary services. While we believe the breadth and depth of our research positions us well versus our competition, increased competition could result in loss of market share, diminished value in our products and services, reduced pricing, and increased sales and marketing expenditures.



INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY



Our success has resulted in part from proprietary methodologies, software, reusable knowledge capital and other intellectual property rights. We rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark, trade secret, confidentiality, non-compete and other contractual provisions to protect our intellectual property rights.

We also enter into agreements with our employees and third parties as appropriate that protect our intellectual property, and we enforce these agreements if necessary. We recognize the value of our intellectual property in the marketplace and vigorously identify, create and protect it. Additionally, we actively monitor and enforce contract compliance by our end users.



EMPLOYEES



We had a total of16,724employees at December 31,2019, an increase of10%when compared to 15,173 employees at December 31,2018. The overall growth in the number of employees was due, in part, to an increase in the total number of quota-bearing sales associates during2019.
