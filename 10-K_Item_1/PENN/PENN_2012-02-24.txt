ITEM 1. BUSINESS

Overview

We are a leading, diversified, multi-jurisdictional owner and manager of gaming and pari-mutuel properties. The Company was
incorporated in Pennsylvania in 1982 as PNRC Corp. and adopted its current name in 1994, when the Company became a public company. In 1997, we began our transition from a pari-mutuel
company to a diversified gaming company with the acquisition of the Charles Town property and the introduction of video lottery terminals in West Virginia. Since 1997, we have continued to expand our
gaming operations through strategic acquisitions (including the acquisitions of Hollywood Casino Bay St. Louis and Boomtown Biloxi, CRC Holdings, Inc., the Bullwhackers properties,
Hollywood Casino Corporation, Argosy Gaming Company, Zia Park Casino, Sanford-Orlando Kennel Club and The M Resorts LLC (the "M Resort") in June 2011), greenfield projects (such as at Hollywood
Casino at Penn National Race Course, Hollywood Slots Hotel and Raceway and Hollywood Casino Perryville), and property expansions (such as Hollywood Casino at Charles Town Races and Hollywood Casino
Lawrenceburg). Most recently, we, along with our joint venture partner, opened Hollywood Casino at Kansas Speedway on February 3, 2012, and we anticipate opening our facilities in Columbus and
Toledo, Ohio in 2012.

As
of December 31, 2011, we owned, managed, or had ownership interests in twenty-five facilities in the following eighteen jurisdictions: Colorado, Florida, Illinois,
Indiana, Iowa, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, Mississippi, Missouri, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Texas, West Virginia, and Ontario.

We
believe that our portfolio of assets provides us with a diversified cash flow from operations. We continue to expand our gaming operations through the implementation and execution of
a disciplined capital expenditure program at our existing properties, the pursuit of strategic acquisitions and the development of new gaming properties, particularly in attractive regional markets.
Current capital projects are ongoing at several of our new and existing properties, including our facilities under construction in Ohio.

In
this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the terms "we," "us," "our," the "Company" and "Penn National" refer to Penn National Gaming, Inc. and subsidiaries, unless
the context indicates otherwise.

Hollywood Casino Baton Rouge

Hollywood Casino Baton Rouge is a dockside riverboat gaming facility operating in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. Hollywood Casino Baton Rouge
features a riverboat casino reminiscent of a nineteenth century Mississippi River paddlewheel steamboat. The riverboat features approximately 28,000 square feet of gaming space with 1,120 gaming

a premium players' lounge, a nightclub, a lobby bar, a public atrium, two meeting rooms, 1,490 parking spaces, and a gift shop.

In
December 2007, we agreed to acquire 3.8 acres of adjacent land and to pay for half of the construction costs for a railroad underpass with the seller of the land. Construction on the
underpass started in June 2009 and was completed in March 2011. The underpass provides unimpeded access to the casino property and to property owned by the seller for future development.

Argosy Casino Sioux City

Argosy Casino Sioux City is located on the Missouri River in downtown Sioux City, Iowa. The riverboat features 20,500 square feet of
gaming space with 719 slot machines, 16 table games and 4 poker tables. The casino is complemented by adjacent barge facilities featuring dining facilities, meeting space, and 524 parking spaces.

Each
gaming license in Iowa is issued jointly to a gaming operator and a local charitable sponsor. The agreement between our gaming operator subsidiary in Iowa, Belle of Sioux
City, L.P. (the "Belle") and its charitable sponsor, Missouri River Historical Development, Inc. ("MRHD"), may expire as early as July 2012. The Belle is in the process of negotiating
with MRHD to transition its current barge-based facility to a new land-based facility and to enter into a new long-term agreement with MRHD. If a new agreement cannot be
reached, MRHD has indicated that it may issue a request for proposals for alternative operators for a new land-based facility and has preemptively filed a lawsuit seeking to establish its
right to do so. If MRHD were to issue such a request, the Belle may contest MRHD's right to do so, may participate in the process and/or may seek an alternative charitable









sponsor.
Accordingly, at this time, there can be no assurance that the Belle will be able to reach an agreement with MRHD or, absent such agreement, that it will be able to partner with an alternative
charitable sponsor. In the event that both MRHD and the Belle find alternative partners, it is unclear whether the Iowa Gaming and Racing Commission would issue a gaming license to one or both such
groups. Further, the Belle's ability to continue its operations may also be impacted by its ability to renew or extend its existing docking lease, which expires in January 2013, or to locate a
suitable site to construct a land-based facility.

Jersey. The property features a half-mile standardbred race track and a 150,000 square foot grandstand.









Sam Houston Race Park and Valley Race Park

On April 8, 2011, following final approval by the Texas Racing Commission, we completed our investment in a joint venture with
MAXXAM that owns and operates the Sam Houston Race Park in Houston, Texas and the Valley Race Park in Harlingen, Texas, and holds a license for a planned racetrack in Laredo, Texas. Sam Houston Race
Park, opened in April 1994, is located 15 miles northwest from downtown Houston along Beltway 8. Sam Houston Race Park hosts thoroughbred and quarter horse racing and offers daily simulcast
operations, as well as hosts various special events, private parties and meetings, concerts and national touring festivals throughout the year. Valley Race Park, which was opened in 1990, is a 91,000
square foot dog racing and simulcasting facility located in Harlingen, Texas.

Off-track Wagering Facilities

and standardbred horse racing, televised sporting events, placing pari-mutuel wagers and dining. We operate four OTWs in Pennsylvania, and through our joint venture in Pennwood, we own 50%
of a leased OTW in Toms River, New Jersey.

Trademarks

We own a number of trademarks registered with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office ("U.S. PTO"), including but not limited to,
"Telebet," "The World Series of Handicapping," and "Players' Choice." We also have a number of trademark applications pending with the U.S. PTO.

BTN, Inc.,
our wholly-owned subsidiary, entered into a License Agreement with Boomtown, Inc., dated August 8, 2000 pursuant to which it uses "Boomtown" and other
trademarks.

As
a result of our acquisitions of Hollywood Casino Corporation and Argosy, we own the service marks "Hollywood Casino" and "Argosy" which are registered with the U.S. PTO. We believe
that our rights to the "Hollywood Casino" and "Argosy" service marks are well established and have competitive value to the Hollywood Casino and Argosy properties. We also acquired other trademarks
used by the Hollywood Casino and Argosy facilities and their related services. These marks are either registered or are the subject of pending applications with the U.S. PTO.

Competition

The gaming industry is characterized by a high degree of competition among a large number of participants, including riverboat casinos,
dockside casinos, land-based casinos, video lottery and poker machines not located in casinos, Native American gaming, emerging varieties of Internet gaming and other forms of gaming in
the U.S. In a broader sense, our gaming operations face competition from all manner of leisure and entertainment activities, including: shopping; high school, collegiate and professional athletic
events; television and movies; concerts and travel. Legalized gaming is currently permitted in various forms throughout the U.S., in several Canadian provinces and on various lands taken into trust
for the benefit of certain Native Americans in the U.S. and Canada. Other jurisdictions, including states adjacent to states in which we currently have facilities (such as in Ohio and Maryland), have
legalized, and are likely to implement gaming in the near future. In addition, established gaming jurisdictions could award additional gaming licenses or permit the expansion or relocation of existing
gaming operations. New, relocated or expanded operations by other persons will increase competition for our gaming operations and could have a material adverse impact on us. Finally, the imposition of
smoking bans and/or higher gaming tax rates have a significant impact on our properties' ability to compete with facilities in nearby jurisdictions.







Our racing operations face significant competition for wagering dollars from other racetracks and OTWs, some of which also offer other forms of gaming, as well as
other gaming venues such as casinos. Additionally, for a number of years, there has been a general decline in the number of people attending and wagering on live horse races at North American
racetracks due to a number of factors, including increased competition from other wagering and entertainment alternatives and unwillingness of customers to travel a significant distance to racetracks.
Our account wagering operations compete with other providers of such services throughout the country. We also may face competition in the future from new OTWs, new racetracks or new providers of
account wagering. From time to time, states consider legislation to permit other forms of gaming. If additional gaming opportunities become available near our racing operations, such gaming
opportunities could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Midwest.

East/West.In November 2008, the citizens of Maryland approved a referendum to allow up to 15,000 slot machines at five locations
throughout the
state. These locations included a facility in each of Cecil, Allegany, Anne Arundel, Baltimore City and Worchester Counties. Applications for each of the gaming zones were submitted in February 2009.
Hollywood Casino Perryville in Cecil County, which is our facility, opened to the public on September 27, 2010 and was the only Maryland facility operational in 2010. In January 2011, the
Worchester County location opened at Ocean Downs Racetrack. In November 2010, zoning was approved by voters for a proposed casino complex offering 4,750 slot machines at the Arundel Mills mall in Anne
Arundel, Maryland. The developer of the project is targeting an opening in the summer of 2012 of approximately 2,500 to 3,000 slot machines, with the full facility expected to be open by the end of
2012. Particularly as the Anne Arundel facility opens, Hollywood Casino at Charles Town Races and Hollywood Casino Perryville will face increased









Southern Plains.

U.S. and Foreign Revenues

Our net revenues in the U.S. for 2011, 2010, and 2009 were approximately $2,727.1 million, $2,443.9 million, and
$2,354.5 million, respectively. Our revenues from operations in Canada for 2011, 2010, and 2009 were approximately $15.2 million, $15.2 million, and $14.8 million,
respectively.

Segments

In 2011, we realigned our reporting structure in connection with the hiring of a senior vice president of regional operations. We now
have three senior vice presidents of regional operations who oversee various properties based primarily on their geographic locations and whom report directly to our President and Chief Operating
Officer. This event impacted how our Chief
Executive Officer, who is the Company's Chief Operating Decision Maker ("CODM") as that term is defined in Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") 280, "Segment Reporting" ("ASC 280"), measures and
assesses our business performance and has caused us to conclude that we now have reportable segments. Therefore, we have aggregated our properties into three reportable segments: (i) Midwest,
(ii) East/West, and (iii) Southern Plains, consistent with how our CODM reviews and assesses our financial performance.









The
Midwest reportable segment consists of the following properties: Hollywood Casino Lawrenceburg, Hollywood Casino Aurora, Hollywood Casino Joliet, and Argosy Casino Alton. It also
includes our Casino Rama management service contract as well as the two Ohio properties that are currently under construction, Hollywood Casino Toledo and Hollywood Casino Columbus, which are
scheduled to open by the end of May 2012 and November 1, 2012, respectively.

The
East/West reportable segment consists of the following properties: Hollywood Casino at Charles Town Races, Hollywood Casino Perryville, Hollywood Slots Hotel and Raceway, Hollywood
Casino at Penn National Race Course, Zia Park Casino, and M Resort.

The
Southern Plains reportable segment consists of the following properties: Argosy Casino Riverside, Argosy Casino Sioux City, Hollywood Casino Baton Rouge, Hollywood Casino Tunica,
Hollywood Casino Bay St. Louis, and Boomtown Biloxi. It also includes our 50% investment in Kansas Entertainment, which owns the Hollywood Casino at Kansas Speedway which opened in February
2012.

The
Other category consists of our standalone racing operations, namely Beulah Park, Raceway Park, Rosecroft Raceway, Sanford-Orlando Kennel Club, and our joint venture interests in Sam
Houston Race Park and Valley Race Park, Freehold Raceway, and Maryland Jockey Club (which was sold in July 2011). If we are successful in obtaining gaming operations at these locations, they would be
assigned to one of our regional executives and reported in their respective reportable segment. The Other category also includes our corporate overhead operations which does not meet the definition of
an operating segment under ASC 280 and our Bullwhackers property.
