ITEM 1.    BUSINESS

Overview

We are a leading, diversified, multi-jurisdictional owner and manager of gaming and pari-mutuel properties. The Company was
incorporated in Pennsylvania in 1982 as PNRC Corp. and adopted its current name in 1994, when the Company became a public company. In 1997, we began our transition from a pari-mutuel
company to a diversified gaming company with the acquisition of the Charles Town property and the introduction of video lottery terminals in West Virginia. Since 1997, we have continued to expand our
gaming operations through strategic acquisitions (including the acquisitions of Hollywood Casino Bay St. Louis and Boomtown Biloxi, CRC Holdings, Inc., Hollywood Casino Corporation,
Argosy Gaming Company, Zia Park Casino, Sanford-Orlando Kennel Club and The M Resorts LLC (the "M Resort")), greenfield projects (such as at Hollywood Casino at Penn National Race Course,
Hollywood Casino Bangor and Hollywood Casino Perryville), and property expansions (such as Hollywood Casino at Charles Town Races and Hollywood Casino Lawrenceburg). Most recently, we, along with our
joint venture partner, opened Hollywood Casino at Kansas Speedway on February 3, 2012 and in Ohio, we opened our Hollywood Casino Toledo facility on May 29, 2012 and our Hollywood Casino
Columbus facility on October 8, 2012. Finally, on November 2, 2012, we acquired Harrah's St. Louis facility, which we are in the process of rebranding to Hollywood Casino
St. Louis.

As
of December 31, 2012, we owned, managed, or had ownership interests in twenty-nine facilities in the following nineteen jurisdictions: Colorado, Florida, Illinois,
Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, Mississippi, Missouri, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Texas, West Virginia, and Ontario.

We
believe that our portfolio of assets provides us with a diversified cash flow from operations. We continue to expand our gaming operations through the implementation and execution of
a disciplined capital expenditure program at our existing properties, the pursuit of strategic acquisitions and the development of new gaming properties, particularly in attractive regional markets.
Current capital projects are ongoing at several of our properties.

In
this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the terms "we," "us," "our," the "Company" and "Penn" refer to Penn National Gaming, Inc. and subsidiaries, unless the
context indicates otherwise.

Proposed Spin-Off of Real Estate Assets through a Real Estate Investment Trust

On November 15, 2012, we announced that we intend to pursue a plan to separate the majority of our gaming operating assets and
real property assets into two publicly traded
companies, including an operating entity, Penn National Gaming ("PNG"), and, through a tax-free Spin-Off of our real estate assets to holders of our common stock, a newly
formed publicly traded real estate investment trust ("REIT") ("PropCo"), subject to required gaming regulatory body approvals.

A
REIT is not permitted to retain earnings and profits ("E&P") accumulated during the years when the company or its predecessor was taxed as a regular C corporation. For PropCo to elect
REIT status, PropCo must distribute to its shareholders its undistributed E&P attributable to taxable periods prior to its REIT election. We currently estimate that, if PropCo were to elect REIT
status as of January 1, 2014, the aggregate amount of the special E&P taxable dividend would be approximately $1.4 billion. The dividend will be paid in a combination of cash and PropCo
common stock, which will consist of at least 20% in cash with the remainder in PropCo common stock. In addition, going forward, the Company expects that PropCo will distribute at least 90% of its
annual taxable income as dividends.

As
a result of the proposed Spin-Off, PropCo will initially own substantially all of the real property assets and will lease back most of those assets to PNG for use by its
subsidiaries, under a "triple net" 35 year Master Lease agreement (including extensions), as well as Hollywood Casino Perryville and









Hollywood
Casino Baton Rouge that will be held and operated in taxable REIT subsidiaries. PNG would own the gaming licenses, operate the leased gaming facilities and own and operate other assets,
including the Casino Rama casino management contract, the 50% joint venture interest in Hollywood Casino at Kansas Speedway, seven non-casino racetracks and gaming equipment. See the "Risk
Factors—Risks Related to Proposed Spin-Off of Real Estate Assets through a Real Estate Investment Trust" section of this Annual Report for a discussion of the risks in
connection with this proposed Spin-Off and the "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" section of this Annual Report for further details on
this transaction.

Midwest Managed Property

Casino Rama

Through CHC Casinos Canada Limited ("CHC Casinos"), our indirectly wholly-owned subsidiary, we manage Casino Rama, a full service
gaming and entertainment facility, on behalf of the Ontario Lottery and Gaming Corporation ("OLGC"), an agency of the Province of Ontario. Casino Rama is located on the lands of the Rama First Nation,
approximately 90 miles north of Toronto. The property has approximately 93,000 square feet of gaming space with 2,516 gaming machines, 105 table games and 16 poker tables. In addition, the property
includes a 5,000-seat entertainment facility, a 289-room hotel and 3,642 surface parking spaces.

The
Development and Operating Agreement (the "Agreement"), which we refer to as the management service contract for Casino Rama, sets out the duties, rights and obligations of CHC
Casinos and our indirectly wholly-owned subsidiary, CRC Holdings, Inc. The compensation under the Agreement is a base fee equal to 2.0% of gross revenues of the casino and an incentive fee
equal to 5.0% of the casino's net operating profit.

The
Agreement terminated on August 1, 2011. In July 2011, we entered into a new interim agreement with the OLGC for the operation of the Casino Rama facility through
March 31, 2012, which was subsequently extended in January 2012 for an additional six months through September 30, 2012 and extended in August 2012 on a
month-to-month basis going forward with a 60 days notice period. In March 2012, the OLGC canceled its process of evaluating bids for a new five year operating contract
for the facility (which included a limit on operating fees exceeding $5 million per year). Although that particular bid process has been canceled, there are periodic OLGC statements about
exploring other bids and privatization plans. As a result, there can be no assurance how long the OLGC will continue to engage us to manage the property.

Midwest Development Projects

In June 2012, we announced that we had filed applications with the Ohio Lottery Commission for Video Lottery Sales Agent Licenses for
Raceway Park and Beulah Park, and with the Ohio State Racing Commission for permission to relocate these racetracks in Toledo and Grove City to Dayton and Austintown (located in the Mahoning Valley),
respectively. The Dayton facility, a standardbred track, will be located on 125 acres on the site of an abandoned Delphi Automotive plant near Wagner Ford and Needmore roads in North Dayton. The
Austintown facility, which will be a thoroughbred track, will be located on 184 acres in Austintown's Centrepointe Business Park near the intersection of Interstate 80 and Ohio Route 46. Both of the
new racetrack facilities will each feature up to 1,500 video lottery terminals, as well as various restaurants, bars and other amenities. We anticipate our relocation plans being approved in the first
half of 2013 and completing these new integrated racing and gaming facilities in 2014.

following the receipt of regulatory approval, we removed approximately 350 slot machines as a result of additional competition in the marketplace, which resulted in a reduction to business volumes.

Trademarks

We own a number of trademarks registered with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office ("U.S. PTO"), including but not limited to,
"Telebet," "The World Series of Handicapping," and "Players' Choice." We also have a number of trademark applications pending with the U.S. PTO.

BTN, Inc.,
our wholly-owned subsidiary, entered into a License Agreement with Boomtown, Inc., dated August 8, 2000 pursuant to which it uses "Boomtown" and other
trademarks.

As
a result of our acquisitions of Hollywood Casino Corporation and Argosy Gaming Company, we own the service marks "Hollywood Casino" and "Argosy" which are registered with the U.S.
PTO. We believe that our rights to the "Hollywood Casino" and "Argosy" service marks are well established and have competitive value to the Hollywood Casino and Argosy properties.

Competition

The gaming industry is characterized by a high degree of competition among a large number of participants, including riverboat casinos,
dockside casinos,
land-based casinos, video lottery, sweepstakes and poker machines not located in casinos, Native American gaming, emerging varieties of Internet gaming and other forms of gaming in the
U.S. In a broader sense, our gaming operations face competition from all manner of leisure and entertainment activities, including: shopping; high school, collegiate and professional athletic events;
television and movies; concerts and travel. Legalized gaming is currently permitted in various forms throughout the U.S., in several Canadian provinces and on various lands taken into trust for the
benefit of certain Native Americans in the U.S. and Canada. Other jurisdictions, including states adjacent to states in which we currently have facilities (such as in Ohio and Maryland), have
legalized, and will expand gaming in the near future. In addition, established gaming jurisdictions could award additional gaming licenses or permit the expansion or relocation of existing gaming
operations. New, relocated or expanded operations by other persons will increase competition for our gaming operations and could have a material adverse impact on us. Finally, the imposition of
smoking bans and/or higher gaming tax rates have a significant impact on our properties' ability to compete with facilities in nearby jurisdictions.

Our
racing operations face significant competition for wagering dollars from other racetracks and OTWs, some of which also offer other forms of gaming, as well as other gaming venues
such as casinos. Additionally, for a number of years, there has been a general decline in the number of people attending and wagering on live horse races at North American racetracks due to a number
of factors, including increased competition from other wagering and entertainment alternatives and unwillingness of customers to travel a significant distance to racetracks. Our account wagering
operations compete with other providers of such services throughout the country. We also may face competition in the future from new OTWs, new racetracks, instant racing, or new providers of account
wagering. From time to time, states consider legislation to permit other forms of gaming. If additional gaming opportunities become available near our racing operations, such gaming opportunities
could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Midwest.In Ohio, voters passed a referendum in 2009 to allow four land-based casinos in four cities, one of which will be in downtown
Cincinnati, which is the primary feeder market for our Hollywood Casino Lawrenceburg property. The proposed $400 million casino in nearby Cincinnati, Ohio will be operated by Caesars
Entertainment as part of a joint venture with Rock Gaming LLC and is anticipated to open in March 2013. This new facility will have an adverse impact on Hollywood Casino Lawrenceburg. However,
this referendum also resulted in the Company being selected as the operator of two of the four land-based casinos. During 2012, we opened Hollywood Casino Toledo on
May 29thand Hollywood Casino Columbus on October 8th. Additionally in Ohio, the State of Ohio approved the placement of video lottery terminals at the
state's seven racetracks. On June 1, 2012, a new racino at Scioto Downs in Columbus, Ohio opened, which has had a negative impact on









Hollywood
Casino Lawrenceburg's financial results and competes in the same market as Hollywood Casino Columbus. In addition, new racinos in Ohio are planned at Lebanon Raceway, which will start
construction soon, and River Downs, which has started construction, both of which plan to open in early 2014. Both of these racinos are expected to have a further adverse impact on Hollywood Casino
Lawrenceburg. We are in the process of relocating our existing racetracks in Toledo and Grove City to Dayton and Austintown, respectively, where we intend to develop new integrated racing and gaming

2012, approximately 120 miles from our Hollywood Casino Bangor facility, which has and will continue to have a negative impact on Hollywood Casino Bangor. However, in November 2011, voters in
Penobscot County approved the addition of table games, which were introduced at Hollywood Casino Bangor on March 16, 2012.

Southern Plains.In Kansas, the legislature approved the expansion of casino gaming in its state, and on February 3, 2012, Kansas
Entertainment, LLC ("Kansas Entertainment"), a joint venture of affiliates of International Speedway and us, opened the facility, which is located approximately 17 miles from Argosy Casino
Riverside. The opening of this casino has and will continue to negatively impact the financial results of Argosy Casino Riverside due to their close proximity to one another. In Louisiana, a new
riverboat casino and hotel opened in Baton Rouge on September 1, 2012. The opening of this riverboat casino had and will continue to have an adverse effect on the financial results of Hollywood

U.S. and Foreign Revenues

Segments

In 2011, we realigned our reporting structure in connection with the hiring of a senior vice president of regional operations. We now
have three senior vice presidents of
regional operations who oversee various properties based primarily on their geographic locations and whom report directly to our President and Chief Operating Officer. This event impacted how our
Chief Executive Officer, who is the Company's Chief Operating Decision Maker ("CODM") as that term is defined in Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC")
280, "Segment Reporting" ("ASC 280"), measures and assesses our business performance and has caused us to conclude that we now have reportable segments. Therefore, we have aggregated our properties
into three reportable segments: (i) Midwest, (ii) East/West, and (iii) Southern Plains, consistent with how our CODM reviews and assesses our financial performance. See
"Item 7—Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" and "Item 8—Financial Statements and Supplementary
Data—Note 16—Segment Information."

The
Midwest reportable segment consists of the following properties: Hollywood Casino Lawrenceburg, Hollywood Casino Aurora, Hollywood Casino Joliet, Argosy Casino Alton, Hollywood
Casino Toledo, which opened on May 29, 2012, and Hollywood Casino Columbus, which opened on October 8, 2012. It also includes our Casino Rama management service contract and the Mahoning
Valley and Dayton Raceway projects in Ohio which we anticipate completing in 2014.

The
East/West reportable segment consists of the following properties: Hollywood Casino at Charles Town Races, Hollywood Casino Perryville, Hollywood Casino Bangor, Hollywood Casino at
Penn National Race Course, Zia Park Casino, and the M Resort.

The
Southern Plains reportable segment consists of the following properties: Argosy Casino Riverside, Argosy Casino Sioux City, Hollywood Casino Baton Rouge, Hollywood Casino Tunica,
Hollywood Casino Bay St. Louis, Boomtown Biloxi, Hollywood Casino St. Louis (formerly Harrah's St. Louis which was acquired from Caesars Entertainment on November 2, 2012),
and includes our 50% investment in Kansas Entertainment, which owns the Hollywood Casino at Kansas Speedway that opened on February 3, 2012.









The
Other category consists of our standalone racing operations, namely Beulah Park, Raceway Park, Rosecroft Raceway, Sanford-Orlando Kennel Club, and our joint venture interests in Sam
Houston Race Park, Valley Race Park and Freehold Raceway. It also included our joint venture interest in the Maryland Jockey Club which was sold in July 2011. If we are successful in obtaining gaming
operations at these locations, they would be assigned to one of our regional executives and reported in their respective reportable segment. The Other category also includes our corporate overhead
operations which does not meet the definition of an operating segment under ASC 280 and our Bullwhackers property.
