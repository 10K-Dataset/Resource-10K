Item 1.Business

As used in this Form 10-K, “MetLife,” the “Company,” “we,” “our” and
“us” refer to MetLife, Inc., a Delaware corporation incorporated in 1999, its subsidiaries and affiliates.

With a more than 140-year history, we have grown to become a leading global provider of insurance, annuities and employee benefit programs, serving 90 million customers in over 50 countries. Through
our subsidiaries and affiliates, we hold leading market positions in the United States, Japan, Latin America, Asia Pacific, Europe and the Middle East. Over the past several years, we have grown our core businesses, as well as successfully executed
on our growth strategy. This has included completing a number of transactions that have resulted in the acquisition and, in some cases, divestiture of certain businesses while also further strengthening our balance sheet to position MetLife for
continued growth.

MetLife is organized into six segments: Insurance Products, Retirement Products, Corporate
Benefit Funding and Auto & Home (collectively, “U.S. Business”), and Japan and Other International Regions (collectively, “International”). In addition, the Company reports certain of its results of operations in
Corporate & Other, which includes MetLife Bank, National Association (“MetLife Bank”) and other business activities. On November 21, 2011, MetLife, Inc. announced that it will be reorganizing its business into three broad
geographic regions: The Americas; Europe, the Middle East and Africa (“EMEA”); and Asia, and creating a global employee benefits business to better reflect its global reach. While the Company has initiated certain changes in response to
this announcement, including the appointment of certain executive leadership into some of the roles designed for the reorganized structure, management continued to evaluate the performance of the operating segments under the existing segment
structure as of December 31, 2011. In addition, management continues to evaluate the Company’s segment performance and allocated resources and may adjust such measurements in the future to better reflect segment profitability.

In December 2011, MetLife Bank and MetLife, Inc. entered into a definitive agreement to sell most of the depository
business of MetLife Bank. The transaction is expected to close in the second quarter of 2012, subject to certain regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions. Additionally, in January 2012, MetLife, Inc. announced it is exiting the
business of originating forward residential mortgages (together with MetLife Bank’s pending actions to exit the depository business, including the aforementioned December 2011 agreement, the “MetLife Bank Events”). Once MetLife Bank
has completely exited its depository business, MetLife, Inc. plans to terminate MetLife Bank’s Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) insurance, putting MetLife, Inc. in a position to be able to deregister as a bank holding
company. See “— U.S. Regulation — Financial Holding Company Regulation.” The Company continues to originate reverse mortgages and will continue to service its current mortgage customers. See Note 2 of the Notes to the
Consolidated Financial Statements.

In November 2011, the Company entered into an agreement to sell its
insurance operations in the Caribbean region, Panama and Costa Rica (the “Caribbean Business”). The sale is expected to close in the second quarter of 2012 subject to regulatory approval and other customary closing conditions. See Note 2
of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

On November 1, 2010 (the “Acquisition
Date”), MetLife, Inc. completed the acquisition of American Life Insurance Company (“American Life”) from AM Holdings LLC (formerly known as ALICO Holdings LLC) (“AM Holdings”), a subsidiary of American International Group,
Inc. (“AIG”), and Delaware American Life Insurance Company (“DelAm”) from AIG (American Life, together with DelAm, collectively, “ALICO”) (the “Acquisition”). ALICO’s fiscal year-end is November 30.
Accordingly, the Company’s consolidated financial statements reflect the assets and liabilities of ALICO as of November 30, 2011 and 2010, and the operating results of ALICO for the year ended November 30, 2011 and the one month ended
November 30, 2010. The assets, liabilities and operating results relating to the Acquisition are included in the Japan and Other International Regions segments. Prior year results have been adjusted to conform to the current year presentation
of segments. See Note 2 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.







In the U.S., we provide a variety of insurance and
financial services products — including life, dental, disability, auto and homeowners insurance, guaranteed interest and stable value products, and annuities — through both proprietary and independent retail distribution
channels, as well as at the workplace. This business serves approximately 60,000 group customers, including over 90 of the top one hundred FORTUNE 500®companies, and provides protection and retirement solutions to millions of individuals.

Outside the U.S., we operate in Japan and over 50 countries within Latin America, Asia Pacific, Europe and the Middle
East. MetLife is the largest life insurer in Mexico and also holds leading market positions in Japan, Poland, Chile and Korea. This business provides life insurance, accident and health insurance, credit insurance, annuities, endowment and
retirement & savings products to both individuals and groups. We believe our international operations will grow more quickly than our U.S. Business in the future.

Operating revenues derived from any customer did not exceed 10% of consolidated operating revenues in any of the last
three years. Financial information, including revenues, expenses, operating earnings, and total assets by segment, is provided in Note 22 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Operating revenues and operating earnings are
performance measures that are not based on accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”). See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” for
definitions of such measures.

For financial information related to revenues, total assets, and goodwill
balances by geographic region, see Note 7 and Note 22 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

We are one of the largest institutional investors in the U.S. with a $522 billion general account portfolio
invested primarily in investment grade corporate bonds, structured finance securities, commercial and agricultural mortgage loans, U.S. Treasury and agency securities, as well as real estate and corporate equity. Over the past several years, we
have taken a number of actions to further diversify and strengthen our general account portfolio.

Our
well-recognized brand, leading market positions, competitive and innovative product offerings and financial strength and expertise should help drive future growth and enhance shareholder value, building on a long history of fairness, honesty and
integrity. Over the course of the next several years, we will pursue the following objectives to achieve our goals:

U.S. Business

Overview

Insurance Products

Our Insurance Products segment offers a broad range of protection products and services aimed at serving the financial
needs of our customers throughout their lives. These products are sold to individuals and corporations, as well as other institutions and their respective employees. We have built a leading position in the U.S. group insurance market through
long-standing relationships with many of the largest corporate employers in the U.S., and we are one of the largest issuers of individual life insurance products in the U.S. Our Insurance Products segment is organized into three distinct
businesses: Group Life, Individual Life and Non-Medical Health.

Our Group Life insurance products and
services include variable life, universal life, and term life products. We offer group insurance products as employer-paid benefits or as voluntary benefits where all or a portion of the premiums are paid by the employee. These group products and
services also include employee paid supplemental life and are offered as standard products or may be tailored to meet specific customer needs.

Our Individual Life insurance products and services include variable life, universal life, term life and whole life products. Additionally, through our broker-dealer affiliates, we offer a full range of
mutual funds and other securities products. The elimination of transactions from activity between the segments within U.S. Business occurs within Individual Life.

The major products within both Group Life and Individual Life are as follows:

Variable Life.Variable life products provide insurance coverage through a contract
that gives the policyholder flexibility in investment choices and, depending on the product, in premium payments and coverage amounts, with certain guarantees. Most importantly, with variable life products, premiums and account balances can be
directed by the policyholder into a variety of separate account investment options or directed to the Company’s general account. In the separate account investment options, the policyholder bears the entire risk of the investment results. We
collect specified fees for the management of the investment options. The policyholder’s cash value reflects the investment return of the selected investment options, net of management fees and insurance-related and other charges. In some
instances, third-party money management firms manage these investment options. With some products, by maintaining a certain premium level, policyholders may have the advantage of various guarantees that may protect the death benefit from adverse
investment experience.

Universal Life.Universal life products provide
insurance coverage on the same basis as variable life, except that premiums, and the resulting accumulated balances, are allocated only to the Company’s general account. Universal life products may allow the insured to increase or decrease the
amount of death benefit coverage over the term of the contract and the owner to adjust the frequency and amount of premium payments. We credit premiums to an account maintained for the policyholder. Premiums are credited net of specified expenses.
Interest is credited to the policyholder’s account at interest rates we determine, subject to specified minimums. Specific charges are made against the policyholder’s account for the cost of insurance protection and for expenses. With some
products, by maintaining a certain premium level, policyholders may have the advantage of various guarantees that may protect the death benefit from adverse investment experience.

Term Life.Term life products provide a guaranteed benefit upon the death of the insured for
a specified time period in return for the periodic payment of premiums. Specified coverage periods range from one year to







30 years, but in no event are they longer than the period over which premiums are paid. Death benefits may be level over the period or decreasing. Decreasing coverage is used principally to
provide for loan repayment in the event of death. Premiums may be guaranteed at a level amount for the coverage period or may be non-level and non-guaranteed. Term insurance products are sometimes referred to as pure protection products, in that
there are typically no savings or investment elements. Term contracts expire without value at the end of the coverage period when the insured party is still living.

Whole Life.Whole life products provide a guaranteed benefit upon the death of the
insured in return for the periodic payment of a fixed premium over a predetermined period. Premium payments may be required for the entire life of the contract period, to a specified age or period, and may be level or change in accordance with a
predetermined schedule. Whole life insurance includes policies that provide a participation feature in the form of dividends. Policyholders may receive dividends in cash or apply them to increase death benefits, increase cash values available upon
surrender or reduce the premiums required to maintain the contract in-force. Because the use of dividends is specified by the policyholder, this group of products provides significant flexibility to individuals to tailor the product to suit their
specific needs and circumstances, while at the same time providing guaranteed benefits.

Our Non-Medical
Health products and services include dental insurance, group short- and long-term disability, individual disability income, long-term care (“LTC”), critical illness and accidental death & dismemberment coverages. Other products
and services include employer-sponsored auto and homeowners insurance provided through the Auto & Home segment and prepaid legal plans. We also sell administrative services-only (“ASO”) arrangements to some employers. The major
products in this area are:

Dental.Dental products provide insurance and
ASO plans that assist employees, retirees and their families in maintaining oral health while reducing out-of-pocket expenses and providing superior customer service. Dental plans include the Preferred Dentist Program and the Dental Health
Maintenance Organization.

Disability.Disability products provide a benefit
in the event of the disability of the insured. In most instances, this benefit is in the form of monthly income paid until the insured reaches age 65. In addition to income replacement, the product may be used to provide for the payment of
business overhead expenses for disabled business owners or mortgage payment protection. This is offered on both a group and individual basis.

Long-term Care.LTC products provide protection against the potentially high costs of LTC services. They generally pay benefits to insureds who need assistance with activities of daily
living or have a cognitive impairment. Although we discontinued the sale of these products in 2010, we continue to support our existing policyholders.

Retirement Products

Our Retirement Products segment
offers a variety of variable and fixed annuities that are primarily sold to individuals and employees of corporations and other institutions. The major products in this area are:

Variable Annuities.Variable annuities provide for both asset accumulation and asset
distribution needs. Variable annuities allow the contractholder to make deposits into various investment options in a separate account, as determined by the contractholder. The risks associated with such investment options are borne entirely by the
contractholder, except where guaranteed minimum benefits are involved. In certain variable annuity products, contractholders may also choose to allocate all or a portion of their account to the Company’s general account and are credited with
interest at rates we determine, subject to certain minimums. In addition, contractholders may also elect certain minimum death benefit and minimum living benefit guarantees for which additional fees are charged and where asset allocation
restrictions may apply.

Fixed Annuities.Fixed annuities provide for both
asset accumulation and asset distribution needs. Fixed annuities do not allow the same investment flexibility provided by variable annuities, but provide guarantees







related to the preservation of principal and interest credited. Deposits made into deferred annuity contracts are allocated to the Company’s general account and are credited with interest at
rates we determine, subject to certain minimums. Credited interest rates are guaranteed not to change for certain limited periods of time, ranging from one to 10 years. Fixed income annuities provide a guaranteed monthly income for a specified
period of years and/or for the life of the annuitant.

Corporate Benefit Funding

Our Corporate Benefit Funding segment includes an array of annuity and investment products, including guaranteed interest
products and other stable value products, income annuities, and separate account contracts for the investment management of defined benefit and defined contribution plan assets. This segment also includes certain products to fund postretirement
benefits and company, bank or trust owned life insurance used to finance non-qualified benefit programs for executives. The major products in this area are:

Stable Value Products.We offer general account guaranteed interest contracts, separate
account guaranteed interest contracts, and similar products used to support the stable value option of defined contribution plans. We also offer private floating rate funding agreements that are used for money market funds, securities lending cash
collateral portfolios and short-term investment funds.

Pensions Closeouts.We
offer general account and separate account annuity products, generally in connection with the termination of defined benefit pension plans, both in the U.S. and the United Kingdom (“U.K.”). We also offer partial risk transfer
solutions that allow for partial transfers of pension liabilities and annuity products that include single premium buyouts.

Torts and Settlements.We offer innovative strategies for complex litigation settlements, primarily structured settlement annuities.

Capital Markets Investment Products.Products offered include funding agreements,
Federal Home Loan Bank advances and funding agreement-backed commercial paper.

Other
Corporate Benefit Funding Products and Services.We offer specialized life insurance products designed specifically to provide solutions for non-qualified benefit and retiree benefit funding purposes.

Auto & Home

Our Auto & Home segment includes personal lines property and casualty insurance offered directly to employees at their employer’s worksite, as well as to individuals through a variety of
retail distribution channels, including independent agents, property and casualty specialists, direct response marketing and the individual distribution sales group. Auto & Home primarily sells auto insurance, which represented 67% of
Auto & Home’s total net earned premiums in 2011. Homeowners and other insurance represented 33% of Auto & Home’s total net earned premiums in 2011. The major products in this area are:

Auto Coverages.Auto insurance policies provide coverage for private passenger
automobiles, utility automobiles and vans, motorcycles, motor homes, antique or classic automobiles and trailers. Auto & Home offers traditional coverage such as liability, uninsured motorist, no fault or personal injury protection, as well
as collision and comprehensive.

Homeowners and Other
Coverages.Homeowners’ insurance policies provide protection for homeowners, renters, condominium owners and residential landlords against losses arising out of damage to dwellings and contents from a wide variety of perils, as
well as coverage for liability arising from ownership or occupancy. Other insurance includes personal excess liability (protection against losses in excess of amounts covered by other liability insurance policies), and coverage for recreational
vehicles and boat owners. Most of Auto & Home’s homeowners’ policies are traditional insurance policies for dwellings, providing protection for loss on a “replacement cost” basis. These policies also provide additional
coverage for reasonable, normal living expenses incurred by policyholders that have been displaced from their homes.







In 2011, Auto & Home’s business was concentrated in New York,
Massachusetts and Illinois, as measured by the percentage of total direct earned premiums, of 12%, 8% and 7%, respectively, followed by Florida with 6%, and Connecticut and Texas, each with 5%.

Sales Distribution

U.S. Business markets our products and services through various distribution groups. Our life insurance and retirement products targeted to individuals are sold via sales forces, comprised of MetLife
employees, in addition to third-party organizations. Our group life, non-medical health and corporate benefit funding products are sold via sales forces primarily comprised of MetLife employees. Personal lines property and casualty insurance
products are directly marketed to employees at their employer’s worksite. Auto & Home products are also marketed and sold to individuals by independent agents and property and casualty specialists through a direct response channel and
the individual distribution sales group. MetLife sales employees work with all distribution groups to better reach and service customers, brokers, consultants and other intermediaries.

Individual Distribution

Our individual distribution sales group targets the large middle-income market, as well as affluent individuals, owners of small businesses and executives of small- to medium-sized companies. We have also
been successful in selling our products in various multi-cultural markets.

Insurance Products are sold
through our individual distribution sales group and also through various third-party organizations utilizing two models. In the coverage model, wholesalers sell to high net worth individuals and small- to medium-sized businesses through independent
general agencies, financial advisors, consultants, brokerage general agencies and other independent marketing organizations under contractual arrangements. In the point of sale model, wholesalers sell through financial intermediaries, including
regional broker-dealers, brokerage firms, financial planners and banks.

Retirement Products are sold through
our individual distribution sales group and also through various third-party organizations such as regional broker-dealers, New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) brokerage firms, financial planners and banks.

The individual distribution sales group is comprised of three channels: the MetLife distribution channel, a career agency
system, the New England financial distribution channel, a general agency system, and MetLife Resources, a career agency system.

The MetLife distribution channel had approximately 5,000 MetLife agents under contract in 50 agencies at December 31, 2011. The career agency sales force focuses on the large middle-income and
affluent markets, including multi-cultural markets. We support our efforts in multi-cultural markets through targeted advertising, specially trained agents and sales literature written in various languages.

The New England Financial distribution channel included approximately 35 general agencies providing support to 2,100
general agents and a network of independent brokers throughout the U.S. at December 31, 2011. The New England Financial distribution channel targets high net worth individuals, owners of small businesses and executives of small- to
medium-sized companies.

MetLife Resources, a focused distribution channel of MetLife, markets retirement,
annuity and other financial products on a national basis through approximately 540 MetLife agents and independent brokers at December 31, 2011. MetLife Resources targets the nonprofit, educational and healthcare markets.

We market and sell Auto & Home products through independent agents, property and casualty specialists, a direct
response channel and the individual distribution sales group. In recent years, we have increased the number of independent agents appointed to sell these products.







Group Distribution

Insurance Products distributes its group life and non-medical health products and services through a sales force that is
segmented by the size of the target customer. Marketing representatives sell either directly to corporate and other group customers or through an intermediary, such as a broker or consultant. Voluntary products are sold through the same sales
channels, as well as by specialists for these products. Employers have been emphasizing such voluntary products and, as a result, we have increased our focus on communicating and marketing to such employees in order to further foster sales of those
products. At December 31, 2011, the group life and non-medical health sales channels had approximately 350 marketing representatives.

Retirement Products markets its retirement, savings, investment and payout annuity products and services to sponsors and advisors of benefit plans of all sizes. These products and services are offered to
private and public pension plans, collective bargaining units, nonprofit organizations, recipients of structured settlements and the current and retired members of these and other institutions.

Corporate Benefit Funding products and services are distributed through dedicated sales teams and relationship managers
located in 11 offices around the country. In addition, the retirement & benefits funding organization works with individual distribution and group life and non-medical health distribution areas to better reach and service customers,
brokers, consultants and other intermediaries.

Auto & Home is a leading provider of personal lines
property and casualty insurance products offered to employees at their employer’s worksite. At December 31, 2011, approximately 2,400 employers offered MetLife Auto & Home products to their employees.

Group marketing representatives market personal lines property and casualty insurance products to employers through a
variety of means, including broker referrals and cross-selling to group customers. Once permitted by the employer, MetLife commences marketing efforts to employees. Employees who are interested in the auto and homeowners products can call a
toll-free number to request a quote to purchase coverage and to request payroll deduction over the telephone. Auto & Home has also developed proprietary software that permits an employee in most states to obtain a quote for auto insurance
through Auto & Home’s internet website.

We have entered into several joint ventures and other
arrangements with third parties to expand the marketing and distribution opportunities of group products and services. We also seek to sell our group products and services through sponsoring organizations and affinity groups. In addition, we also
provide life and dental coverage to federal employees.

International

Overview

International provides life insurance, accident and health insurance, credit insurance, annuities, endowment and retirement & savings products to both individuals and groups. We focus on markets
primarily within Japan, Latin America, Asia Pacific, Europe and the Middle East. We operate in international markets through subsidiaries and affiliates. See “Risk Factors — Fluctuations in Foreign Currency Exchange Rates Could
Negatively Affect Our Profitability,” “Risk Factors — Our International Operations Face Political, Legal, Operational and Other Risks, Including Exposure to Local and Regional Economic Conditions, That Could Negatively Affect
Those Operations or Our Profitability,” “Risk Factors — Difficult Conditions in the Global Capital Markets and the Economy Generally May Materially Adversely Affect Our Business and Results of Operations and These Conditions May
Not Improve in the Near Future,” and “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.”

Japan

Our Japan operation is comprised of the business
acquired in the Acquisition. Our Japan operation is among the largest foreign life insurers in Japan and ranks sixth in the Japanese life insurance industry measured by total







premiums according to the Statistics of Life Insurance in Japan 2010. It provides life insurance products which include whole life, term life, variable life and universal life products. Our Japan
operation also provides accident and health insurance, fixed and variable annuities and endowment products. These products are offered to both individuals and groups. Its products are distributed through a multi-distribution platform consisting of
captive agents, independent agents, brokers, bancassurance, and direct marketing (“DM”).

Other
International Regions

Latin America.We operate in 22 countries in Latin America, with
the largest operations in Mexico, Chile and Argentina. Our Mexican operation is the largest life insurance company in Mexico in both the individual and group businesses according to Asociación Mexicana de Instituciones de Seguro, a Mexican
industry trade group which provides rankings for insurance companies. Our Chilean operation is the largest annuity company in Chile, based on market share according to Superintendencia Valores y Seguros, the Chilean insurance regulator. Our Chilean
operation also offers individual life insurance and group insurance products. We also actively market individual life insurance, group insurance products and credit life coverage in Argentina, but the nationalization of the pension system
substantially reduced our presence in Argentina. The business environment in Argentina has been, and may continue to be, affected by governmental and legal actions which impact our results of operations. See Note 2 of the Notes to the Consolidated
Financial Statements for additional information on the pending disposition of the Caribbean Business.

Asia
Pacific.We operate in four countries in Asia Pacific with wholly-owned operations in Korea, Hong Kong and Australia. Our Korean operation has significant sales of variable universal life and annuity products. Our Hong Kong operation
has significant sales of variable universal life and endowment products. Our Australia operation has significant sales of credit insurance and group life products. We also operate through a joint venture in China, the results of which are reflected
in net investment income and are not consolidated in our financial results. As discussed in Note 2 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company sold its 50% interest in its former joint venture in Japan in the second
quarter of 2011.

Europe and the Middle East.We operate in 35 countries in Europe and the
Middle East with our largest operations in Poland, the U.K., France, and the United Arab Emirates, as well as through a consolidated joint venture in India. Our Poland operation is a leading provider of life insurance, accident and health insurance,
and credit insurance. It is consistently ranked as a top three company in net profits according to “Rzeczpospolita” financial daily. Our U.K. operation provides life insurance, accident and health insurance and variable annuities in
its home market and throughout Europe. Our operation in France provides life insurance, accident and health insurance and credit insurance. In the Middle East, we provide life insurance, accident and health insurance, credit insurance, annuities,
endowment and retirement & savings products.

Sales Distribution

International markets its products and services through a multi-distribution strategy which varies by geographic region.
The various distribution channels include: agency, bancassurance, DM, brokerage and e-commerce. In developing countries, agency covers the needs of the emerging middle class with primarily traditional products (e.g., endowment and accident and
health). In more developed and mature markets, agents, while continuing to serve their existing customers to keep pace with their developing financial needs, also target upper middle class and high net worth customer bases with a more sophisticated
product set including more investment-sensitive products, such as universal life, mutual fund and single premium deposits.

In the bancassurance channel, International leverages partnerships that span all regions. In addition, DM has extensive and far reaching capabilities in all regions. The DM operations deploy both
broadcast marketing approaches (e.g. direct response TV, web-based lead generation) and traditional DM techniques such as telemarketing. Japan represents our largest DM market.







Japan

Japan’s multi-channel distribution strategy consists of captive agents, independent agents, brokers, bancassurance,
and DM. While face-to-face channels continue to be core to Japan’s business, other channels, including bancassurance and DM, have become a critical part of Japan’s distribution strategy. Our Japan operation has maintained its position in
bancassurance due to its strong distribution relationship with Japan’s mega banks, trust banks and various regional banks, as well as with the Japan Post. The DM channel is supported by an industry-leading marketing platform, state-of-the-art
call center infrastructure and its own campaign management system.

Our Japan operation has approximately
5,500 captive agents, 10,500 independent agents, 100 bancassurance relationships, including Japan Post, and 200 DM sponsors.

Other International Regions

Latin
America.Latin America’s key distribution channels include captive agents, DM, bancassurance, large multinational brokers and small-and medium-sized brokers, direct and group sales forces (mostly for group policies without broker
intermediation), and worksite marketing. The region has an exclusive and captive agency distribution network with more than 2,500 agents also selling a variety of individual life, accident and health, and pension products. In the DM channel, we work
with more than 50 sponsors and have a network of more than 1,600 telesales representatives selling mainly accident and health and individual life products. We currently work with over 3,000 active brokers with registered sales of group and
individual life, accident and health, group medical, dental and pension products. Worksite marketing in Mexico has over 2,200 agents.

Asia Pacific.Asia Pacific distribution strategies differ by country but generally utilize a combination of captive agents, bancassurance relationships and DM. Agency sales are achieved
through a force of approximately 8,500 agents and managers (which includes approximately 1,700 agents and managers related to our joint venture in China) and a growing force of independent general agents. Bancassurance sales are currently reliant
upon a significant regional strategic partnership along with a number of smaller partnerships in each market. Throughout the region, our Asia Pacific operation leverages its expertise in DM operations management to conduct its own campaigns and
provide those DM capabilities to third-party sponsors.

While not a significant part of the region’s
overall business, sales of group life and pension business are primarily achieved through independent brokers and an employee sales force.

Europe and the Middle East.Our operation in Central and Eastern Europe (“CEE”) has a multi-channel distribution strategy, which includes significant face to face channels,
built on a strong captive agency force of more than 3,400 agents, and relationships with more than 90 active independent brokers and third-party multi-level agency networks. Our CEE operation also has a group/corporate business direct sales force of
more than 70 and distribution relationships with more than 100 banks, and other financial and non-financial institutions, as well as a fast growing DM channel. The primary method of distribution is captive and third party agency and captive direct
sales forces, with a growing presence in bank, other financial and non-financial institutions, and DM.

Our operation in Western Europe also has a multi-channel distribution strategy, including DM, brokerage, banks and
financial institutions. Our U.K. operation has built a strong position in the U.K. independent advisor sector and other third-party distributors with a focus on variable and fixed term annuities. Our U.K operation also has a growing group risk
business serving small and medium sized enterprise employers and an agency sales force of approximately 600 agents which distributes accident and health and term life products.

In the Middle East, our products are distributed via a variety of channels including approximately 17,700 agents,
bancassurance, brokers and DM. Agency distribution is our primary distribution channel; we have the largest captive network in the Middle East. Bancassurance is a growing channel with approximately 90 relationships, and approximately 260
programs providing access to millions of bank customers.







Corporate & Other

Corporate & Other contains the excess capital not allocated to the segments, external integration costs,
internal resource costs for associates committed to acquisitions, and various start-up and run-off entities. Additionally, Corporate & Other includes interest expense related to the majority of our outstanding debt, expenses associated with
certain legal proceedings, the financial results of MetLife Bank and income tax audit issues. See Note 2 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Corporate & Other also includes the elimination of intersegment amounts, which
generally relate to intersegment loans, which bear interest rates commensurate with related borrowings.

MetLife Bank is a member of the Federal Reserve System and the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York and is subject to
regulation, examination and supervision primarily by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (“OCC”), and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (“CFPB”), and secondarily by the FDIC, the Board of Governors of the Federal
Reserve System (the “Federal Reserve Board”) and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York (the “FRB of NY” and, collectively with the Federal Reserve Board, the “ Federal Reserve”).

Policyholder Liabilities

We establish, and carry as liabilities, actuarially determined amounts that are calculated to meet our policy obligations when a policy matures or is surrendered, an insured dies or becomes disabled or
upon the occurrence of other covered events, or to provide for future annuity payments. Amounts for actuarial liabilities are computed and reported in the consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP. For more details on Policyholder
Liabilities see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Summary of Critical Accounting Estimates — Liability for Future Policy Benefits” and “Management’s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Policyholder Liabilities.”

Pursuant to state insurance laws and country regulators, MetLife, Inc.’s insurance subsidiaries establish statutory reserves, reported as liabilities, to meet their obligations on their respective
policies. These statutory reserves are established in amounts sufficient to meet policy and contract obligations, when taken together with expected future premiums and interest at assumed rates. Statutory reserves and actuarial liabilities for
future policy benefits generally differ based on accounting guidance.

The New York Insurance Law and
regulations require certain MetLife entities to submit to the New York Superintendent of Insurance or other state insurance departments, with each annual report, an opinion and memorandum of a “qualified actuary” that the statutory
reserves and related actuarial amounts recorded in support of specified policies and contracts, and the assets supporting such statutory reserves and related actuarial amounts, make adequate provision for their statutory liabilities with respect to
these obligations. See “— U.S. Regulation — Insurance Regulation — Policy and Contract Reserve Adequacy Analysis.”

Insurance regulators in many of the non-U.S. countries in which MetLife operates require certain MetLife entities to prepare a sufficiency analysis of the reserves posted in the locally required
regulatory financial statements, and to submit that analysis to the regulatory authorities. See “— International Regulation.”

Underwriting and Pricing

Underwriting

Underwriting generally involves an evaluation of applications for Insurance Products, Retirement Products, Corporate
Benefit Funding, and Auto & Home by a professional staff of underwriters and actuaries, who determine the type and the amount of risk that we are willing to accept. International offers the products described above, with the exception of
property and casualty insurance. They also offer credit insurance and accident and health products. We employ detailed underwriting policies, guidelines and procedures designed to assist the underwriter to properly assess and quantify risks before
issuing policies to qualified applicants or groups, which are consistent for both the U.S. Business and International.







Insurance underwriting considers not only an applicant’s medical
history, but also other factors such as financial profile, foreign travel, vocations and alcohol, drug and tobacco use. Group underwriting generally evaluates the risk characteristics of each prospective insured group, although with certain
voluntary products and for certain coverages, members of a group may be underwritten on an individual basis. We generally perform our own underwriting; however, certain policies are reviewed by intermediaries under guidelines established by us.
Generally, we are not obligated to accept any risk or group of risks from, or to issue a policy or group of policies to, any employer or intermediary. Requests for coverage are reviewed on their merits and generally a policy is not issued unless the
particular risk or group has been examined and approved by our underwriters.

The underwriting conducted by
our remote underwriting offices and intermediaries, as well as our corporate underwriting office, are subject to periodic quality assurance reviews to maintain high-standards of underwriting and consistency. Such offices are also subject to periodic
external audits by reinsurers with whom we do business.

We have established senior level oversight of the
underwriting process that facilitates quality sales and serves the needs of our customers, while supporting our financial strength and business objectives. Our goal is to achieve the underwriting, mortality and morbidity levels reflected in the
assumptions in our product pricing. This is accomplished by determining and establishing underwriting policies, guidelines, philosophies and strategies that are competitive and suitable for the customer, the agent and us.

Auto & Home’s underwriting function has six principal aspects: evaluating potential worksite marketing
employer accounts and independent agencies; establishing guidelines for the binding of risks; reviewing coverage bound by agents; underwriting potential insureds, on a case by case basis, presented by agents outside the scope of their binding
authority; pursuing information necessary in certain cases to enable Auto & Home to issue a policy within our guidelines; and ensuring that renewal policies continue to be written at rates commensurate with risk.

Subject to very few exceptions, agents in each of the U.S. Business distribution channels have binding authority for
risks which fall within its published underwriting guidelines. Risks falling outside the underwriting guidelines may be submitted for approval to the underwriting department; alternatively, agents in such a situation may call the underwriting
department to obtain authorization to bind the risk themselves. In most states, we generally have the right within a specified period (usually the first 60 days) to cancel any policy.

Pricing

Pricing reflects our corporate underwriting standards, which are consistent for both U.S. Business and International. Product pricing is based on the expected payout of benefits calculated through the use
of assumptions for mortality, morbidity, expenses, persistency and investment returns, as well as certain macroeconomic factors, such as inflation. Investment-oriented products are priced based on various factors, which may include investment
return, expenses, persistency and optionality. For certain investment oriented products in the U.S. and certain business sold internationally, pricing may include prospective and retrospective experience rating features. Prospective experience
rating involves the evaluation of past experience for the purpose of determining future premium rates and all prior year gains and losses are borne by us. Retrospective experience rating also involves the evaluation of past experience for the
purpose of determining the actual cost of providing insurance for the customer, however, the contract includes certain features that allow us to recoup certain losses or distribute certain gains back to the policyholder based on actual prior
years’ experience.

Rates for group life, non-medical health, and medical health products are based on
anticipated results for the book of business being underwritten. Renewals are generally reevaluated annually or biannually and are repriced to reflect actual experience on such products. Products offered by Corporate Benefit Funding are priced
frequently and are very responsive to bond yields, and such prices include additional margin in periods of market uncertainty. This business is predominantly illiquid, because a majority of the policyholders have no contractual rights to cash values
and no options to change the form of the product’s benefits.







Rates for individual life insurance products are highly regulated and must
be approved by the regulators of the jurisdictions in which the product is sold. Generally such products are renewed annually and may include pricing terms that are guaranteed for a certain period of time. Fixed and variable annuity products are
also highly regulated and approved by the respective regulators. Such products generally include penalties for early withdrawals and policyholder benefit elections to tailor the form of the product’s benefits to the needs of the opting
policyholder. We periodically reevaluate the costs associated with such options and will periodically adjust pricing levels on our guarantees. Further, from time to time, we may also reevaluate the type and level of guarantee features currently
being offered.

Rates for Auto & Home’s major lines of insurance are based on its proprietary
database, rather than relying on rating bureaus. Auto & Home determines prices in part from a number of variables specific to each risk. The pricing of personal lines insurance products takes into account, among other things, the expected
frequency and severity of losses, the costs of providing coverage (including the costs of acquiring policyholders and administering policy benefits and other administrative and overhead costs), competitive factors and profit considerations. The
major pricing variables for personal lines insurance include characteristics of the insured property, such as age, make and model or construction type, as well as characteristics of the insureds, such as driving record and loss experience, and the
insured’s personal financial management. Auto & Home’s ability to set and change rates is subject to regulatory oversight.

As a condition of our license to do business in each state, Auto & Home, like all other automobile insurers, is required to write or share the cost of private passenger automobile insurance for
higher risk individuals who would otherwise be unable to obtain such insurance. This “involuntary” market, also called the “shared market,” is governed by the applicable laws and regulations of each state, and policies written in
this market are generally written at rates higher than standard rates.

We continually review our underwriting
and pricing guidelines so that our policies remain competitive and supportive of our marketing strategies and profitability goals. Management does not expect the current economic environment, with its volatility and uncertainty, to materially impact
the pricing of our products.

Reinsurance Activity

We participate in reinsurance activities in order to limit losses, minimize exposure to significant risks, and provide
additional capacity for future growth. We enter into various agreements with reinsurers that cover individual risks, group risks or defined blocks of business, primarily on a coinsurance, yearly renewable term, excess or catastrophe excess basis.
These reinsurance agreements spread risk and minimize the effect of losses. The extent of each risk retained by us depends on our evaluation of the specific risk, subject, in certain circumstances, to maximum retention limits based on the
characteristics of coverages. We also cede first dollar mortality risk under certain contracts. In addition to reinsuring mortality risk, we reinsure other risks, as well as specific coverages. We obtain reinsurance for capital requirement purposes
and also when the economic impact of the reinsurance agreement makes it appropriate to do so.

Under the terms
of the reinsurance agreements, the reinsurer agrees to reimburse us for the ceded amount in the event a claim is paid. Cessions under reinsurance agreements do not discharge our obligations as the primary insurer. In the event that reinsurers do not
meet their obligations under the terms of the reinsurance agreements, reinsurance balances recoverable could become uncollectible.

We reinsure our business through a diversified group of well-capitalized, highly rated reinsurers. We analyze recent trends in arbitration and litigation outcomes in disputes, if any, with our reinsurers.
We monitor ratings and evaluate the financial strength of our reinsurers by analyzing their financial statements. In addition, the reinsurance recoverable balance due from each reinsurer is evaluated as part of the overall monitoring process.
Recoverability of reinsurance recoverable balances is evaluated based on these analyses. We generally secure large reinsurance recoverable balances with various forms of collateral, including secured trusts, funds withheld accounts and irrevocable
letters of credit.







U.S. Business

For our individual life insurance products, we have historically reinsured the mortality risk primarily on an excess of
retention basis or a quota share basis. We currently reinsure 90% of the mortality risk in excess of $1 million for most products and reinsure up to 90% of the mortality risk for certain other products. In addition to reinsuring mortality risk
as described above, we reinsure other risks, as well as specific coverages. Placement of reinsurance is done primarily on an automatic basis and also on a facultative basis for risks with specified characteristics. On a case by case basis, we may
retain up to $20 million per life and reinsure 100% of amounts in excess of the amount we retain. We evaluate our reinsurance programs routinely and may increase or decrease our retention at any time.

For other policies within the Insurance Products segment, we generally retain most of the risk and only cede particular
risks on certain client arrangements.

Our Retirement Products segment reinsures a portion of the living and
death benefit guarantees issued in connection with our variable annuities. Under these reinsurance agreements, we pay a reinsurance premium generally based on fees associated with the guarantees collected from policyholders, and receive
reimbursement for benefits paid or accrued in excess of account values, subject to certain limitations.

Our
Corporate Benefit Funding segment has periodically engaged in reinsurance activities, as considered appropriate.

Our Auto & Home segment purchases reinsurance to manage its exposure to large losses (primarily catastrophe losses) and to protect statutory surplus. We cede to reinsurers a portion of losses and
premiums based upon the exposure of the policies subject to reinsurance. To manage exposure to large property and casualty losses, we utilize property catastrophe, casualty and property per risk excess of loss agreements.

International

For certain of our life insurance products, we reinsure risks above the corporate retention limit of up to $5 million to external reinsurers on a yearly renewable term basis. We may also reinsure
certain risks with external reinsurers depending upon the nature of the risk and local regulatory requirements.

For selected large corporate clients, International reinsures group employee benefits or credit insurance business with
various client-affiliated reinsurance companies, covering policies issued to the employees or customers of the clients. Additionally, we cede and assume risk with other insurance companies when either company requires a business partner with the
appropriate local licensing to issue certain types of policies in certain countries. In these cases, the assuming company typically underwrites the risks, develops the products and assumes most or all of the risk.

International also has reinsurance agreements in force that reinsure a portion of the living and death benefit guarantees
issued in connection with variable annuity products. Under these agreements, we pay or receive reinsurance fees associated with the guarantees collected from policyholders, and pay or receive reimbursement for benefits paid or accrued in excess of
account values, subject to certain limitations.

Corporate & Other

We also reinsure through 100% quota share reinsurance agreements certain run-off LTC and workers’ compensation
business written by MetLife Insurance Company of Connecticut (“MICC”), a subsidiary of MetLife, Inc.

Catastrophe Coverage

We have exposure to catastrophes, which could contribute to significant fluctuations in our results of operations. We
also use excess of retention and quota share reinsurance agreements to provide greater







diversification of risk and minimize exposure to larger risks. International currently purchases catastrophe coverage to insure risks within certain countries deemed by management to be exposed
to the greatest catastrophic risks.

Reinsurance Recoverables

For information regarding ceded reinsurance recoverable balances, included in premiums, reinsurance and other receivables
in the consolidated balance sheets, see Note 9 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

U.S. Regulation

Insurance Regulation

In the United States, insurance is principally regulated by the states, with the federal government playing a limited
role. Insurance regulation generally aims at supervising and regulating insurers individually rather than on a group-wide basis, with the goal of protecting policyholders and ensuring that each insurance company remains solvent.

Each of MetLife’s insurance subsidiaries operating in the United States is licensed and regulated in each
U.S. jurisdiction where it conducts insurance business. The extent of such regulation varies, but most jurisdictions have laws and regulations governing the financial aspects of insurers, including standards of solvency, statutory reserves,
reinsurance and capital adequacy, and the business conduct of insurers. In addition, statutes and regulations usually require the licensing of insurers and their agents, the approval of policy forms and certain other related materials and, for
certain lines of insurance, the approval of rates. Such statutes and regulations also prescribe the permitted types and concentration of investments. See “Risk Factors — Our Insurance, Brokerage and Banking Businesses Are Highly
Regulated, and Changes in Regulation and in Supervisory and Enforcement Policies May Reduce Our Profitability and Limit Our Growth.”

Each insurance subsidiary is required to file reports, generally including detailed annual financial statements, with insurance regulatory authorities in each of the jurisdictions in which it does
business, and its operations and accounts are subject to periodic examination by such authorities. These subsidiaries must also file, and in many jurisdictions and in some lines of insurance obtain regulatory approval for, rules, rates and forms
relating to the insurance written in the jurisdictions in which they operate.

State and federal insurance and
securities regulatory authorities and other state law enforcement agencies and attorneys general from time to time make inquiries regarding compliance by MetLife, Inc. and its insurance subsidiaries with insurance, securities and other laws and
regulations regarding the conduct of our insurance and securities businesses. We cooperate with such inquiries and take corrective action when warranted. See Note 16 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Holding Company Regulation.MetLife, Inc. and its U.S. insurance subsidiaries are subject to
regulation under the insurance holding company laws of various U.S. jurisdictions. The insurance holding company laws and regulations vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, but generally require a controlled insurance company (insurers that are
subsidiaries of insurance holding companies) to register with state regulatory authorities and to file with those authorities certain reports, including information concerning its capital structure, ownership, financial condition, certain
intercompany transactions and general business operations.

State insurance statutes also typically place
restrictions and limitations on the amount of dividends or other distributions payable by insurance company subsidiaries to their parent companies, as well as on transactions between an insurer and its affiliates. See “Management’s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Liquidity and Capital Resources — MetLife, Inc. — Liquidity and Capital Sources — Dividends from Subsidiaries.”







Guaranty Associations and Similar Arrangements.Most of
the U.S. jurisdictions in which our insurance subsidiaries are admitted to transact business require life and property and casualty insurers doing business within the jurisdiction to participate in guaranty associations, which are organized to pay
certain contractual insurance benefits owed pursuant to insurance policies issued by impaired, insolvent or failed insurers. These associations levy assessments, up to prescribed limits, on all member insurers in a particular state on the basis of
the proportionate share of the premiums written by member insurers in the lines of business in which the impaired, insolvent or failed insurer is engaged. Some states permit member insurers to recover assessments paid through full or partial premium
tax offsets.

In the past five years, the aggregate assessments levied against MetLife have not been material.
We have established liabilities for guaranty fund assessments that we consider adequate. See Note 16 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the insolvency assessments.

Statutory Insurance Examination.As part of their regulatory oversight process, state insurance
departments conduct periodic detailed examinations of the books, records, accounts, and business practices of insurers domiciled in their states. State insurance departments also have the authority to conduct examinations of non-domiciliary insurers
that are licensed in their states. During the three-year period ended December 31, 2011, MetLife has not received any material adverse findings resulting from state insurance department examinations of its insurance subsidiaries conducted
during this three-year period.

Regulatory authorities in a small number of states, Financial Industry
Regulatory Authority (“FINRA”) and, occasionally, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), have had investigations or inquiries relating to sales of individual life insurance policies or annuities or other products by
Metropolitan Life Insurance Company (“MLIC”), MetLife Securities, Inc., New England Life Insurance Company, New England Securities Corporation, General American Life Insurance Company, Walnut Street Securities, Inc., MICC and Tower
Square Securities, Inc. These investigations often focus on the conduct of particular financial services representatives and the sale of unregistered or unsuitable products or the misuse of client assets. Over the past several years, these and a
number of investigations by other regulatory authorities were resolved for monetary payments and certain other relief, including restitution payments. We may continue to resolve investigations in a similar manner.

Policy and Contract Reserve Adequacy Analysis.Annually, our U.S. insurance subsidiaries are
required to conduct an analysis of the sufficiency of all statutory reserves. In each case, a qualified actuary must submit an opinion which states that the statutory reserves, when considered in light of the assets held with respect to such
reserves, make good and sufficient provision for the associated contractual obligations and related expenses of the insurer. If such an opinion cannot be provided, the insurer must set up additional reserves by moving funds from surplus. Since
inception of this requirement, our U.S. insurance subsidiaries which are required by their states of domicile to provide these opinions have provided such opinions without qualifications.

NAIC.The National Association of Insurance Commissioners (“NAIC”) is an organization, the
mandate of which is to benefit state insurance regulatory authorities and consumers by promulgating model insurance laws and regulations for adoption by the states. The NAIC provides standardized insurance industry accounting and reporting guidance
through its Accounting Practices and Procedures Manual (the “Manual”). However, statutory accounting principles continue to be established by individual state laws, regulations and permitted practices. Changes to the Manual or
modifications by the various state insurance departments may impact the statutory capital and surplus of MetLife, Inc.’s U.S. insurance subsidiaries.

Surplus and Capital; Risk-Based Capital.Insurers are required to maintain their capital and surplus at or above minimum levels. Regulators have discretionary authority, in connection with the
continued licensing of our U.S. insurance subsidiaries, to limit or prohibit an insurer’s sales to policyholders if, in their judgment, the regulators determine that such insurer has not maintained the minimum surplus or capital or that the
further transaction of business will be hazardous to policyholders. Most of our U.S. insurance subsidiaries are subject to risk-based capital (“RBC”) requirements and report their RBC based on a formula calculated by applying factors







to various asset, premium and statutory reserve items, as well as taking into account the risk characteristics of the insurer. The major categories of risk involved are asset risk, insurance
risk, interest rate risk, market risk and business risk. The formula is used as an early warning regulatory tool to identify possible inadequately capitalized insurers for purposes of initiating regulatory action, and not as a means to rank insurers
generally. State insurance laws provide insurance regulators the authority to require various actions by, or take various actions against, insurers whose RBC ratio does not meet or exceed certain RBC levels. As of the date of the most recent annual
statutory financial statements filed with insurance regulators, the RBC of each of these subsidiaries was in excess of each of those RBC levels. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations — Liquidity and Capital Resources — The Company — Capital.”

In
late 2009, following rating agency downgrades of virtually all residential mortgage-backed securities (“RMBS”) from certain vintages, the NAIC engaged PIMCO Advisory (“PIMCO”), a provider of investment advisory services, to
analyze approximately 20,000 RMBS held by insurers and evaluate the likely loss that holders of those securities would suffer in the event of a default. PIMCO’s analysis showed that the severity of expected losses on those securities evaluated
that are held by our U.S. insurance companies was significantly less than would be implied by the rating agencies’ ratings of such securities. The NAIC incorporated the results of PIMCO’s analysis into the RBC charges assigned to the
evaluated securities, with a beneficial impact on the RBC of our U.S. insurance subsidiaries. The NAIC utilized the solution again for 2010. The NAIC adopted a similar solution for 2010 for commercial mortgage-backed securities
(“CMBS”) by selecting BlackRock Solutions, a provider of investment advisory services, to assist in the RBC determination process. BlackRock Solutions served as a third-party modeler of the 7,000 CMBS holdings of U.S. insurance
companies, including our U.S. insurance subsidiaries. The impact of the implementation for 2010 of the modeling solution for CMBS on our U.S. insurance subsidiaries was minimal. Any revisions to the modeling bases for 2011 are not anticipated
to have a material impact on the RBC of our U.S. insurance subsidiaries.

In 2011, the NAIC adopted a proposal
that permits RBC recognition for the risk mitigation value of the use of derivatives for hedging asset (fixed maturity and equity securities) risk. The adopted measure is effective December 31, 2011 and is anticipated to have a modest, positive
impact on the RBC of our U.S. insurance subsidiaries.

Regulation of Investments.Each of
our U.S. insurance subsidiaries is subject to state laws and regulations that require diversification of our investment portfolios and limit the amount of investments in certain asset categories, such as below investment grade fixed income
securities, equity real estate, other equity investments, and derivatives. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations would cause investments exceeding regulatory limitations to be treated as non-admitted assets for purposes of measuring
surplus and, in some instances, would require divestiture of such non-qualifying investments. We believe that the investments made by each of MetLife, Inc.’s U.S. insurance subsidiaries complied, in all material respects, with such regulations
at December 31, 2011.

The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act
(“Dodd-Frank”) includes provisions that may impact the investments and investment activities of MetLife, Inc. and its subsidiaries, including the federal regulation of such activities. Until the various final regulations are promulgated
pursuant to Dodd-Frank, and perhaps for some time thereafter, the full impact of Dodd-Frank on such activities will remain unclear. Such provisions and regulations include, but are not limited to, the regulation of the over-the-counter derivatives
markets and prohibitions on covered banking entities engaging in proprietary trading and sponsoring or investing in hedge funds or private equity funds (commonly known as the Volcker Rule). See “— Dodd-Frank and Other Legislative and
Regulatory Developments — Regulation of Over-the-Counter Derivatives” and “— Dodd-Frank and Other Legislative and Regulatory Developments — Volcker Rule.”

Federal Initiatives.Although the insurance business in the United States is primarily regulated by the
states, federal initiatives often have an impact on our business in a variety of ways. From time to time, federal measures are proposed which may significantly affect the insurance business. These areas include financial services regulation,
securities regulation, pension regulation, health care regulation, privacy, tort reform legislation and







taxation. In addition, various forms of direct and indirect federal regulation of insurance have been proposed from time to time, including proposals for the establishment of an optional federal
charter for insurance companies. See “— Dodd-Frank and Other Legislative and Regulatory Developments.”

Financial Holding Company Regulation

Once MetLife Bank has completely exited its depository business, MetLife, Inc. plans to terminate MetLife Bank’s
FDIC insurance, putting MetLife, Inc. in a position to be able to deregister as a bank holding company. Upon completion of the foregoing, MetLife, Inc. will no longer be regulated as a bank holding company or subject to enhanced supervision and
prudential standards as a bank holding company with assets of $50 billion or more. However, if, in the future, MetLife, Inc. is designated by the Financial Stability Oversight Council (“FSOC”) as a non-bank systemically important financial
institution (as discussed below), it could once again be subject to regulation by the Federal Reserve and enhanced supervision and prudential standards, such as Regulation YY (as discussed below).

The FSOC issued a notice of proposed rulemaking in October 2011, outlining the process it will follow and the criteria it
will use to assess whether a non-bank financial company should be subject to enhanced supervision by the Federal Reserve as a non-bank systemically important financial institution. If MetLife, Inc. meets the quantitative thresholds set forth in the
proposal, the FSOC will continue with a further analysis using qualitative and quantitative factors.

In April
2011, the Federal Reserve Board and the FDIC proposed a rule regarding the implementation of the Dodd-Frank requirement that (i) each non-bank financial company designated by the FSOC for enhanced supervision by the Federal Reserve Board (a
“non-bank systemically important financial institution” or “non-bank SIFI”) and each bank holding company with assets of $50 billion or more report periodically to the Federal Reserve Board, the FDIC and the FSOC the plan of such
company for rapid and orderly resolution in the event of material financial distress or failure, and (ii) that each such company report on the nature and extent of credit exposures of such company to significant bank holding companies and
significant non-bank financial companies and the nature and extent of credit exposures of significant bank holding companies and significant non-bank financial companies to such covered company. In November 2011, the Federal Reserve Board and the
FDIC adopted a final rule implementing the resolution plan requirement, effective November 30, 2011, but deferred finalizing the credit exposure reporting requirement until a later date. If MetLife, Inc. remains a bank holding company on July 1,
2012, or if, in the future, it is designated by the FSOC as a non-bank SIFI, it would be required to submit a resolution plan. See “— Dodd-Frank and Other Legislative and Regulatory Developments — Orderly Liquidation Authority.”

In December 2011, the Federal Reserve Board issued a release proposing the adoption of enhanced prudential
standards required by Dodd-Frank (“Regulation YY”). Regulation YY would apply to bank holding companies with assets of $50 billion or more and non-bank systemically important financial institutions. Regulation YY would impose (i) enhanced
RBC requirements, (ii) leverage limits, (iii) liquidity requirements, (iv) single counterparty exposure limits, (v) governance requirements for risk management, (vi) stress test requirements, and (vii) special debt-to-equity limits for certain
companies, and would establish a procedure for early remediation based on the failure to comply with these requirements. The Federal Reserve Board invited comment on, among other things, whether and how to apply these standards to non-bank
systemically important financial institutions. For further information regarding enhanced prudential standards and Regulation YY, see “— Dodd-Frank and Other Legislative and Regulatory Developments — Enhanced Prudential
Standards.”

Regulatory Agencies.Currently, as the owner of a federally-chartered
bank, MetLife, Inc. remains a bank holding company and financial holding company. As such, MetLife, Inc continues to be subject to regulation under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (the “BHC Act”), and to inspection,
examination, and supervision by the Federal Reserve. In addition, MetLife Bank is subject to regulation and examination primarily by the OCC and the CFPB and secondarily by the Federal Reserve and the FDIC, as described below under “—
Banking Regulation.”







Financial Holding Company Activities.As a financial
holding company, MetLife, Inc.’s activities and investments are restricted by the BHC Act, as amended by the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 (the “GLB Act”), to those that are “financial” in nature or “incidental”
or “complementary” to such financial activities. Activities that are financial in nature include securities underwriting, dealing and market making, sponsoring mutual funds and investment companies, insurance underwriting and agency,
merchant banking and activities that the Federal Reserve Board has determined to be closely related to banking. In addition, under the insurance company investment portfolio provision of the GLB Act, financial holding companies are authorized to
make investments in other financial and non-financial companies, through their insurance subsidiaries, that are in the ordinary course of business and in accordance with state insurance law, provided the financial holding company does not routinely
manage or operate such companies except as may be necessary to obtain a reasonable return on investment.

Capital.







capital plan exercise and CCAR 2012 in evaluating proposed capital actions by participating bank holding companies, such as common stock dividend increases and stock repurchases, and that it will
provide its assessment of participating institutions’ capital plans in mid-March 2012.

Consumer
Protection Laws.Numerous other federal and state laws also affect MetLife, Inc.’s and MetLife Bank’s earnings and activities, including federal and state consumer protection laws. The GLB Act included consumer privacy
provisions that, among other things, require disclosure of a financial institution’s privacy policy to customers. In addition, these provisions permit states to adopt more extensive privacy protections through legislation or regulation. As part
of Dodd-Frank, Congress established the CFPB to supervise and regulate institutions that provide certain financial products and services to consumers. Although the consumer financial services subject to the CFPB’s jurisdiction generally exclude
insurance business of the kind in which we engage, the CFPB does have authority to regulate consumer services provided by MetLife Bank and non-insurance consumer services provided elsewhere throughout MetLife. See “— Dodd-Frank and Other
Legislative and Regulatory Developments — Consumer Protection Laws.”

Change of Control
and Restrictions on Mergers and Acquisitions.Because MetLife, Inc. is a financial holding company and bank holding company, no person may acquire control of MetLife, Inc. without the prior approval of the Federal Reserve Board. A
change of control is conclusively presumed upon acquisition of 25% or more of any class of voting securities and rebuttably presumed upon acquisition of 10% or more of any class of voting securities. Further, as a result of MetLife, Inc.’s
ownership of MetLife Bank, approval from the OCC would be required in connection with a change of control (generally presumed upon the acquisition of 10% or more of any class of voting securities) of MetLife, Inc. As a result of Dodd-Frank, Federal
Reserve approval is required for any acquisition of a non-bank firm by a bank holding company having more than $10 billion of assets, such as MetLife, Inc. Further, as a bank holding company with assets of $50 billion or more, MetLife,
Inc. will be required to provide prior notice to the Federal Reserve before acquiring control of voting shares of a company engaged in financial activities that has $10 billion or more of consolidated assets.

Banking Regulation

Securities, Broker-Dealer and Investment Adviser Regulation

Some of our subsidiaries and their activities in offering and selling variable insurance products are subject to extensive regulation under the federal securities laws administered by the SEC. These
subsidiaries issue variable







annuity contracts and variable life insurance policies through separate accounts that are registered with the SEC as investment companies under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the
“Investment Company Act”). Each registered separate account is generally divided into sub-accounts, each of which invests in an underlying mutual fund which is itself a registered investment company under the Investment Company Act. In
addition, the variable annuity contracts and variable life insurance policies issued by these registered separate accounts are registered with the SEC under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”). Other subsidiaries
are registered with the SEC as broker-dealers under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), and are members of, and subject to regulation by, FINRA. Further, some of our subsidiaries are registered as
investment advisers with the SEC under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended (the “Investment Advisers Act”), and are also registered as investment advisers in various states, as applicable. Certain variable contract separate
accounts sponsored by our subsidiaries are exempt from registration, but may be subject to other provisions of the federal securities laws.

Federal and state securities regulatory authorities and FINRA from time to time make inquiries and conduct examinations regarding compliance by MetLife, Inc. and its subsidiaries with securities and other
laws and regulations. We cooperate with such inquiries and examinations and take corrective action when warranted.

Federal and state securities laws and regulations are primarily intended to protect investors in the securities markets and generally grant regulatory agencies broad rulemaking and enforcement powers,
including the power to limit or restrict the conduct of business for failure to comply with such laws and regulations. See “— Dodd-Frank and Other Legislative and Regulatory Developments — Regulation of Brokers and Dealers.” We
may also be subject to similar laws and regulations in the foreign countries in which we provide investment advisory services, offer products similar to those described above, or conduct other activities.

Environmental Considerations

As an owner and operator of real property, we are subject to extensive federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations. Inherent in such ownership and operation is also the risk that there may
be potential environmental liabilities and costs in connection with any required remediation of such properties. In addition, we hold equity interests in companies that could potentially be subject to environmental liabilities. We routinely have
environmental assessments performed with respect to real estate being acquired for investment and real property to be acquired through foreclosure. We cannot provide assurance that unexpected environmental liabilities will not arise. However, based
on information currently available to us, we believe that any costs associated with compliance with environmental laws and regulations or any remediation of such properties will not have a material adverse effect on our business, results of
operations or financial condition.

Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (“ERISA”) Considerations

We provide products and services to certain employee benefit plans that are subject to ERISA, or the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”). As such, our activities are subject to the restrictions imposed by ERISA and the Code, including the requirement under ERISA that fiduciaries must perform their duties solely in the
interests of ERISA plan participants and beneficiaries and the requirement under ERISA and the Code that fiduciaries may not cause a covered plan to engage in prohibited transactions with persons who have certain relationships with respect to such
plans. The applicable provisions of ERISA and the Code are subject to enforcement by the Department of Labor (“DOL”), the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) and the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation.

InJohn Hancock Mutual Life Insurance Company v. Harris Trust and Savings Bank (1993),the U.S. Supreme Court
held that certain assets in excess of amounts necessary to satisfy guaranteed obligations under a participating group annuity general account contract are “plan assets.” Therefore, these assets are subject to certain fiduciary obligations
under ERISA, which requires fiduciaries to perform their duties solely in the interest of ERISA plan participants and beneficiaries. On January 5, 2000, the Secretary of Labor issued final regulations indicating, in cases where an insurer has
issued a policy backed by the insurer’s general account to or for an







employee benefit plan, the extent to which assets of the insurer constitute plan assets for purposes of ERISA and the Code. The regulations apply only with respect to a policy issued by an
insurer on or before December 31, 1998 (“Transition Policy”). No person will generally be liable under ERISA or the Code for conduct occurring prior to July 5, 2001, where the basis of a claim is that insurance company general
account assets constitute plan assets. An insurer issuing a new policy that is backed by its general account and is issued to or for an employee benefit plan after December 31, 1998 will generally be subject to fiduciary obligations under
ERISA, unless the policy is a guaranteed benefit policy.

The regulations indicate the requirements that must
be met so that assets supporting a Transition Policy will not be considered plan assets for purposes of ERISA and the Code. These requirements include detailed disclosures to be made to the employee benefits plan and the requirement that the insurer
must permit the policyholder to terminate the policy on 90 day notice and receive without penalty, at the policyholder’s option, either (i) the unallocated accumulated fund balance (which may be subject to market value adjustment) or
(ii) a book value payment of such amount in annual installments with interest. We have taken and continue to take steps designed to ensure compliance with these regulations.

Dodd-Frank and Other Legislative and Regulatory Developments

Dodd-Frank effected the most far-reaching overhaul of financial regulation in the U.S. in decades. The full impact of
Dodd-Frank on us will depend on the numerous rulemaking initiatives required or permitted by Dodd-Frank and the various studies mandated by Dodd-Frank, which are scheduled to be completed over the next few years. See “Risk Factors —
Various Aspects of Dodd-Frank Could Impact Our Business Operations, Capital Requirements and Profitability and Limit Our Growth.”

Federal Regulation.  Dodd-Frank established the Federal Insurance Office within the Department of the Treasury, which has the authority to participate in the negotiations of international
insurance agreements with foreign regulators for the U.S., as well as to collect information about the insurance industry and recommend prudential standards. While not having a general supervisory or regulatory authority over the business of
insurance, the director of this office will perform various functions with respect to insurance, including serving as a non-voting member of the FSOC and making recommendations to the FSOC regarding insurers to be designated for more stringent
regulation. The director is also required to submit a report to Congress regarding how to modernize and improve the system of insurance regulation in the United States, including by increasing national uniformity through either a federal charter or
effective action by the states.

Enhanced Prudential Standards.As a large, interconnected
bank holding company with assets of $50 billion or more or, if designated as such by the FSOC, a non-bank systemically important financial institution, MetLife, Inc. will be subject to enhanced prudential standards imposed on such companies.
The FSOC has proposed rules governing the process of how it would designate non-bank financial companies that would be subject to enhanced supervision by the Federal Reserve, but these rules have not become final and no non-bank financial companies
have been so designated.

As proposed, Regulation YY would subject non-bank systemically important financial
institutions to the same enhanced standards as large bank holding companies. Regulation YY would impose (i) enhanced RBC requirements, (ii) leverage limits, (iii) liquidity requirements, (iv) single counterparty exposure limits,
(v) governance requirements for risk management, (vi) stress test requirements, and (vii) special debt-to-equity limits for certain companies, and would establish a procedure for early remediation based on the failure to comply with
these requirements. The Federal Reserve Board invited comment on, among other things, whether and how to apply these standards to non-bank systemically important financial institutions.

In addition, if it were determined that MetLife, Inc. posed a substantial threat to U.S. financial stability, the
applicable federal regulators would have the right to require it to take one or more other mitigating actions to reduce that risk, including limiting its ability to merge with or acquire another company, terminating activities, restricting its
ability to offer financial products or requiring it to sell assets or off-balance sheet items to







unaffiliated entities. Enhanced standards would also permit, but not require, regulators to establish requirements with respect to contingent capital, enhanced public disclosures and short-term
debt limits. These standards are described as being more stringent than those otherwise imposed on bank holding companies; however, the Federal Reserve Board is permitted to apply them on an institution-by-institution basis, depending on its
determination of the institution’s riskiness.

MetLife, Inc., as a bank holding company, will have to
meet minimum leverage ratio and RBC requirements on a consolidated basis to be established by the Federal Reserve Board that are not less than those applicable to insured depository institutions under so-called prompt corrective action regulations
as in effect on the date of the enactment of Dodd-Frank. One consequence of these new rules will ultimately be the inability of bank holding companies to include trust-preferred securities as part of their Tier 1 capital. Because of the
phase-in period for these new rules, they should have little practical effect on MetLife’s ability to treat its currently outstanding trust-preferred securities as part of its Tier 1 capital, but they do prevent MetLife, Inc. from treating
the common equity units issued originally as part of the consideration for the Acquisition (and since re-sold to the public) as Tier I capital, since the new rules apply immediately to instruments issued after May 19, 2010. See Note 14 of
the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information on these common equity units.

Under
Dodd-Frank, all bank holding companies that have elected to be treated as financial holding companies, such as MetLife, Inc., are required to be “well capitalized” and “well managed” as defined by the Federal Reserve Board, on a
consolidated basis, and not just at their depository institution(s), a higher standard than was applicable to financial holding companies before Dodd-Frank. If we are unable to meet these standards, we could be subject to activity restrictions,
ultimately be required to divest certain operations and be restricted in our ability to pay dividends, repurchase common stock or other securities or engage in transactions that could affect our capital or need for capital. See “Risk
Factors — Our Insurance, Brokerage and Banking Businesses Are Highly Regulated, and Changes in Regulation and in Supervisory and Enforcement Policies May Reduce Our Profitability and Limit Our Growth.”

Regulation of Over-the-Counter Derivatives.

Volcker Rule.Dodd-Frank restricts the ability of insured depository institutions and of companies, such as MetLife, Inc., that control an insured depository institution, and their
affiliates, to engage in proprietary trading and to sponsor or invest in funds (hedge funds and private equity funds) that rely on certain exemptions from the Investment Company Act. Dodd-Frank provides an exemption for investment activity by a
regulated insurance company or its affiliate solely for the general account of such insurance company if such activity is in compliance with the insurance company investment laws of the state or jurisdiction in which such company is domiciled and
the appropriate Federal regulators after consultation with relevant insurance commissioners have not jointly determined such laws to be insufficient to protect the safety and soundness of the institution or the financial stability of the
U.S. Other exemptions, including, but not limited to, activities for risk-mitigating







hedging and activities on behalf of customers, may be available for the general account or separate account activities of insurance companies. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the appropriate
Federal regulatory authorities are permitted under the legislation to impose, as part of rulemaking, additional capital requirements and other restrictions on any exempted activity. Dodd-Frank provides for a period of rulemaking during which the
effects of the statutory language may be clarified. Among other things, one task of the rulemaking is to appropriately accommodate the business of insurance within an insurance company subject to regulation in accordance with relevant insurance
company investments laws. Until the rulemaking is complete, including the scope of the statutory exemptions to be applied to insurance companies for each of the prohibitions on proprietary trading and fund sponsoring or investing, it is unclear
whether MetLife, Inc. may have to alter any of its future activities to comply, including continuing to invest in private investment funds for its general accounts or to issue certain insurance products backed by its separate accounts. See
“Risk Factors – Various Aspects of Dodd-Frank Could Impact Our Business Operations, Capital Requirements and Profitability and Limit Our Growth.”

Consumer Protection Laws.  Dodd-Frank established the CFPB that supervises and regulates institutions
providing certain financial products and services to consumers. Although the consumer financial services to which this legislation applies exclude insurance business of the kind in which we engage, the CFPB has authority to regulate consumer
services provided by MetLife Bank and non-insurance consumer services provided elsewhere throughout MetLife. Dodd-Frank established a statutory standard for Federal preemption of state consumer financial protection laws, which standard may require
national banks to comply with many state consumer financial protection laws that previously were considered preempted by Federal law. The scope of this new standard is currently the matter of some dispute between the Comptroller of the Currency and
some state attorneys general, and there have been judicial decisions holding that Dodd-Frank did not change the pre-existing preemption standard as established in earlier judicial decisions. As a result of the new standard, whatever its scope is
finally determined to be, the regulatory and compliance burden on MetLife Bank may increase, which could adversely affect its business and results of operations. Dodd-Frank also includes provisions on mortgage lending, anti-predatory lending and
other regulatory and supervisory provisions that could also impact the business and operations of MetLife Bank.

Orderly Liquidation Authority.







Regulation of Brokers and Dealers.Dodd-Frank also
authorizes the SEC to establish a standard of conduct applicable to brokers and dealers when providing personalized investment advice to retail and other customers. This standard of conduct would be to act in the best interest of the customer
without regard to the financial or other interest of the broker or dealer providing the advice.

Source of
Strength.  Dodd-Frank statutorily imposes the requirement that MetLife, Inc. serve as a source of strength for MetLife Bank.

We cannot predict what other proposals may be made, what legislation may be introduced or enacted or the impact of any such legislation on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

International Regulation

Our international operations are regulated in the jurisdictions in which they are located or operate. This regulation includes minimum capital, solvency and operational requirements. The authority of our
international operations to conduct business is subject to licensing requirements, permits and approvals, and these authorizations are subject to modification and revocation. Periodic examinations of insurance company books and records, financial
reporting requirements, market conduct examinations and policy filing requirements are among the techniques used by regulators to supervise our non-U.S. insurance businesses. We also have investment and pension companies in certain foreign
jurisdictions that provide mutual fund, pension and other financial products and services. Those entities are subject to securities, investment, pension and other laws and regulations, and oversight by the relevant securities, pension and other
authorities of the countries in which the companies operate. In some jurisdictions, some of our insurance products are considered “securities” under local law and may be subject to local securities regulations and oversight by local
securities regulators.

Our international operations are exposed to increased political, legal, financial,
operational and other risks. Our international operations may be materially adversely affected by the actions and decisions of foreign authorities and regulators, such as through nationalization or expropriation of assets, the imposition of limits
on foreign ownership of local companies, changes in laws (including tax laws and regulations), their application or interpretation, political instability, dividend limitations, price controls, currency exchange controls or other restrictions that
prevent us from transferring funds from these operations out of the countries in which they operate or converting local currencies we hold into U.S. dollars or other currencies, as well as other adverse actions by foreign governmental
authorities and regulators. Such actions may negatively affect our business in these jurisdictions. See “Risk Factors — Our International Operations Face Political, Legal, Operational and Other Risks, Including Exposure to Local and
Regional Economic Conditions, That Could Negatively Affect Those Operations or Our Profitability” and “Risk Factors — Our Insurance, Brokerage and Banking Businesses Are Highly Regulated, and Changes in Regulation and in Supervisory
and Enforcement Policies May Reduce Our Profitability and Limit Our Growth.”

Certain of our
international insurance operations may be subject to assessments, generally based on their proportionate share of business written in the relevant jurisdiction, for certain obligations to policyholders and claimants resulting from the insolvency of
insurance companies. We cannot predict the timing and scope of any assessments that may be made in the future, which may materially affect the results of operations of our international insurance operations in particular quarterly or annual periods.

Annually, many of our international insurance operations are required to conduct an analysis of the
sufficiency of all statutory reserves. In most of those cases, a locally qualified actuary must submit an analysis of the likelihood that the reserves make good and sufficient provision for the associated contractual obligations and related expenses
of the insurer. Local regulatory and actuarial standards for this vary widely; the required implied certainty of the signing actuary’s opinion varies equally widely.

We are also subject to the evolving Solvency II insurance regulatory directive for each of our insurance operations
throughout the European Economic Area. The European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (“EIOPA”) established Solvency II as a new capital adequacy regime for the European insurance







industry. Currently, the EIOPA anticipates final proposals for standards and guidelines to be published in September 2012. Implementation is under discussion within EIOPA, but we are proceeding
with our plan for readiness by January 1, 2013. Our Solvency II program is governed by a steering committee comprised of senior management. Solvency II encompasses solvency capital requirements, allows for both standard model and internal model
calculations, requires a robust governance and risk management framework fully embedded in day-to-day decision making and greater quarterly and annual reporting disclosures. As requirements are finalized by the regulators, capital requirements might
be impacted in a number of jurisdictions. Compliance with these new capital standards may impact the level of capital required to be held at individual legal entities. Further, the efforts required to comply with these regulations may increase
operating costs at these entities. See “Risk Factors — Our Insurance, Brokerage and Banking Businesses Are Highly Regulated, and Changes in Regulation and in Supervisory and Enforcement Policies May Reduce Our Profitability and Limit Our
Growth.”

We expect the scope and extent of regulation outside of the U.S., as well as regulatory
oversight, generally to continue to increase. That oversight, and the legal and regulatory environment in the countries in which we operate, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.

Japan

Our operations in Japan are subject to regulation and examination by Japan’s Financial Services Agency (“FSA”). Our operations in Japan are required to file with the FSA annual reports for
each fiscal year (ending March 31) which include financial statements. These annual reports are not prepared on a U.S. GAAP basis. Similar to the U.S., Japanese law provides that insurers in Japan must maintain specified solvency standards for
the protection of policyholders and to support the financial strength of licensed insurers. As of September 30, 2011, the date of our most recent regulatory filing in Japan, the solvency margin ratio of our Japan operations was 1,529.5%, which
is significantly in excess of the legally mandated solvency margin of 200% in Japan. Most Japanese life insurers maintain a solvency margin ratio well in excess of the legally mandated minimum. The FSA will apply a revised method of calculating the
solvency margin ratio of life insurance companies in Japan for the next fiscal year-end, which is March 31, 2012, and required the disclosure of the ratio calculated on this new basis as reference information for the last fiscal year-end, which
was March 31, 2011. As of September 30, 2011, the solvency margin of our Japan operations calculated on this new basis was 923.9%. We do not expect our relative position within the industry to materially change as a result of the
application of this revised method.

A portion of the annual earnings of our Japan operations may be
repatriated each year, and may further be distributed to MetLife, Inc. as a dividend. We may determine not to repatriate profits from the Japan operations or to repatriate a reduced amount in order to maintain or improve the solvency margin of the
Japan operations or for other reasons. In addition, the FSA may limit or not permit profit repatriations or other transfers of funds to the U.S. if such transfers would be detrimental to the solvency or financial strength of our Japan operations or
for other reasons.

Our operations in Japan are subject to assessments to cover obligations to policyholders
in the event of insolvency of other insurance companies. Under the Japanese Insurance Business Law, all licensed life insurers in Japan are assessed on an annual basis by the Life Insurance Policyholders Protection Corporation of Japan. These
assessments are aggregated across all licensed life insurers in Japan and used to satisfy certain obligations to policyholders and claimants of insolvent life insurance companies. We cannot predict the amount of future assessments, which may
materially affect our results of operations in Japan in particular quarterly or annual periods.

Competition

We believe that competition faced by our segments is based on a number of factors, including service,
product features, scale, price, financial strength, claims-paying ratings, credit ratings, e-business capabilities and name recognition. We compete in the U.S. and internationally, with other insurance companies, as well as non-insurance financial
services companies, such as banks, broker-dealers and asset managers, for individual consumers, employer and other group customers as well as agents and other distributors of insurance and







investment products. Some of these companies offer a broader array of products, have more competitive pricing or, with respect to other insurance companies, have higher claims paying ability
ratings. Our U.S. Business competes in the U.S. with over 1,000 other U.S. and foreign-owned companies. In Japan, we compete with over 40 domestic and foreign-owned life insurance companies, many of which offer products in categories on which we
focus: accident and health insurance, life insurance, and annuities. However, we typically have two to three main competitors per product category. Elsewhere, we compete with the foreign insurance operations of large U.S. insurers and with global
insurance groups and local companies in particular areas in which they are active. Many of our group insurance products are underwritten annually and, accordingly, there is a risk that group purchasers may be able to obtain more favorable terms from
competitors rather than renewing coverage with us. See “Risk Factors — Competitive Factors May Adversely Affect Our Market Share and Profitability.”

We believe that the turbulence in financial markets that began in the second half of 2007, its impact on the capital
position of many competitors, and subsequent actions by regulators and rating agencies have altered the competitive environment. In particular, we believe that these factors have highlighted financial strength as the most significant differentiator
from the perspective of some customers and certain distributors. We believe the Company is well positioned to compete in this environment. In particular, the Company distributes many of its individual products through other financial institutions
such as banks and broker-dealers. These distribution partners are currently placing greater emphasis on the financial strength of the company whose products they sell. In addition, the financial market turbulence has highlighted the extent of the
risk associated with certain variable annuity products and has led many companies in our industry to re-examine the pricing and features of the products they offer. The effects of current market conditions may also lead to consolidation in the life
insurance industry. Although we cannot predict the ultimate impact of these conditions, we believe that the strongest companies will enjoy a competitive advantage as a result of the current circumstances.

We must attract and retain productive sales representatives to sell our insurance, annuities and investment products.
Insurance companies compete for sales representatives with demonstrated ability. We compete with other insurance companies for sales representatives primarily on the basis of our financial position, support services and compensation and product
features. See “— U.S. Business — Sales Distribution.” In selected global markets, we continue to undertake several initiatives to grow our career agency forces, while continuing to enhance the efficiency and
production of our existing sales forces. We cannot provide assurance that these initiatives will succeed in attracting and retaining productive agents. Sales of individual insurance, annuities and investment products and our results of operations
and financial position could be materially adversely affected if we are unsuccessful in attracting and retaining productive agents. See “Risk Factors — We May Be Unable to Attract and Retain Sales Representatives for Our
Products.”

Numerous aspects of our business are subject to regulation. Legislative and other changes
affecting the regulatory environment can affect our competitive position within the life insurance industry and within the broader financial services industry. See “— U.S. Regulation,” “— International
Regulation,” “Risk Factors — Our Insurance, Brokerage and Banking Businesses Are Highly Regulated, and Changes in Regulation May Reduce Our Profitability and Limit Our Growth,” “Risk Factors — Governmental and
Regulatory Actions for the Purpose of Stabilizing and Revitalizing the Financial Markets and Protecting Investors and Consumers May Not Achieve the Intended Effect or Could Adversely Affect Our Competitive Position” and “Risk
Factors — Changes in U.S. Federal and State Securities Laws and Regulations, and State Insurance Regulations Regarding Suitability of Annuity Product Sales, May Affect Our Operations and Our Profitability.”

Employees

At December 31, 2011, we had approximately 67,000 employees. We believe that our relations with our employees are satisfactory.
