Item 1. BUSINESS

General

UDR is a self-administered real estate investment trust, or REIT, that owns, operates, acquires, renovates, develops, redevelops, and manages multifamily apartment communities generally located in high barrier-to-entry markets located throughout the United States. The high barrier-to-entry markets are characterized by limited land for new construction, difficult and lengthy entitlement processes, low single-family home affordability and strong employment growth potential. AtDecember 31, 2014, our consolidated real estate portfolio included139communities located in20markets, with a total of39,851completed apartment homes, which are held through our subsidiaries, including the Operating Partnership, and consolidated joint ventures. In addition, we have an ownership interest in36communities containing10,055apartment homes through unconsolidated joint ventures or partnerships. As ofDecember 31, 2014, the Company was developingonewholly-owned community with369apartment homes and three unconsolidated joint venture communities with 1,018 apartment homes, none of which have been completed.

AtDecember 31, 2014, the Operating Partnership’s consolidated real estate portfolio included68communities located in17markets, with a total of20,814completed apartment homes. The Operating Partnership owns, operates, acquires, renovates, develops, redevelops, and manages multifamily apartment communities generally located in high barrier-to-entry markets located throughout the United States. During the year endedDecember 31, 2014, revenues of the Operating Partnership represented approximately52%of our total rental revenues.

UDR has elected to be taxed as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, which we refer to in this Report as the “Code.” To continue to qualify as a REIT, we must continue to meet certain tests which, among other things, generally require that our assets consist primarily of real estate assets, our income be derived primarily from real estate assets, and that we distribute at least 90% of our REIT taxable income (other than our net capital gains) to our stockholders annually. As a REIT, we generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income taxes at the corporate level on our net income to the extent we distribute such net income to our stockholders annually. In2014, we declared total distributions of$1.04per common share and paid dividends of$1.015per common share.

UDR was formed in 1972 as a Virginia corporation. In June 2003, we changed our state of incorporation from Virginia to Maryland. The Operating Partnership is the successor-in-interest to United Dominion Realty, L.P., a limited partnership formed under the laws of Virginia, which commenced operations in 1995. The Operating Partnership was redomiciled in 2004 as a Delaware limited partnership. Our corporate offices are located at 1745 Shea Center Drive, Suite 200, Highlands Ranch, Colorado and our telephone number is (720) 283-6120. Our website iswww.udr.com. The information contained on our website, including any information referred to in this Report as being available on our website, is not a part of or incorporated into this Report.

As ofFebruary 19, 2015, we had 1,523 full-time associates and 59 part-time associates, all of whom were employed by UDR.

Reporting Segments

We report in two segments:Same-Store CommunitiesandNon-Mature Communities/Other.

Our Same-Store Communitiessegment includes those communities acquired, developed, and stabilized prior toJanuary 1, 2013, and held as ofDecember 31, 2014. These communities were owned and had stabilized occupancy and operating expenses as of the beginning of the prior year, there is no plan to conduct substantial redevelopment activities, and the community is not classified as held for sale at year end. A community is considered to have stabilized occupancy once it achieves 90% occupancy for at least three consecutive months.












OurNon-Mature Communities/Othersegment represents those communities that do not meet the criteria to be included inSame-Store Communities,including, but not limited to, recently acquired, developed and redeveloped communities, and the non-apartment components of mixed use properties. For additional information regarding our operating segments, see Note 15,Reportable Segments, in the Notes to the UDR Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Report and Note 12,Reportable Segments, in the Notes to the Operating Partnership’s Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Report.

Business Objectives

Our principal business objective is to maximize the economic returns of our apartment communities to provide our stockholders with the greatest possible total return and value. To achieve this objective, we intend to continue to pursue the following goals and strategies:

•own and operate apartments in high barrier-to-entry markets, which are characterized by limited land for new construction, difficult and lengthy entitlement processes, low single-family home affordability and strong employment growth potential, thus enhancing stability and predictability of returns to our stockholders;

•manage real estate cycles by taking an opportunistic approach to buying, selling, renovating, redeveloping, and developing apartment communities;

•empower site associates to manage our communities efficiently and effectively;

•measure and reward associates based on specific performance targets; and

•manage our capital structure to help enhance predictability of earnings and dividends.

2014Highlights

•In July 2014, the Company marked its 42nd year as a REIT and paid its 168th consecutive quarterly dividend in October. The Company’s annualized declared 2014 dividend of $1.04 represented a 10.6% increase over the previous year.

•We achieved Same-Store revenue growth of 4.3% and Same-Store net operating income (“NOI”) growth of 5.2%.

•During the year ended December, 31, 2014, we invested approximately$251.5 millionin wholly-owned development projects and$31.5 millionin redevelopment projects and major renovations, including completion of 980 development apartment homes and 401 redevelopment apartment homes in primary markets.

•We expanded our relationship with the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company (“MetLife”):

•We increased our ownership interest in the remaining six operating communities in the UDR/MetLife I Joint Venture from 12% to 50%, and MetLife and the Company contributed the communities to the UDR/MetLife II Joint Venture. We paid MetLife $82.5 million for the additional ownership interests.

•We increased our ownership interest in four land sites in the UDR/MetLife I Joint Venture from approximately 3% to 50%. The remaining interest continues to be held by our joint venture partner MetLife. We paid MetLife approximately $36.8 million for the additional ownership interests.

•We sold 50% of our interest in 3033 Wilshire and 49% of our interest in 13th and Market to MetLife for gross proceeds of approximately $62.5 million, resulting in the assets being held by unconsolidated joint ventures.

•We issued $300 million of 3.75%, 10-year senior unsecured medium-term notes in June. Net proceeds were used to pay down borrowings outstanding on our unsecured revolving credit facility and for general corporate purposes.

•We completed five developments containing 1,396 homes for an estimated aggregate cost of $480.0 million.

•We acquired land parcels for future development located in Huntington Beach, California for $77.8 million and Boston, Massachusetts for$32.2 million.

•We acquired two communities located in Seattle, Washington and Kirkland, Washington with a total of 358 apartment homes for $45.5 million and $75.2 million, respectively.

•We recognized gains on the sale of real estate of$143.6 million, net of tax, which consisted of:












•the sale of nine communities with a total of 2,500 apartment homes, an adjacent parcel of land, and one operating property for gross proceeds of $328.4 million, resulting in a gain, net of tax, of approximately $138.6 million; and

•the sale of our 49% interest in a recently completed development for gross proceeds of $54.2 million, resulting in a gain, net of tax, of $7.2 million and our 50% interest in a land parcel for gross proceeds of $8.3 million, resulting in a loss, net of tax, of $2.2 million.

•We sold common stock under our amended equity distribution agreement for net proceeds of approximately$99.8 million, which was primarily used to fund the Company's Steele Creek participating loan investment.

Other than the following, there were no significant changes to the Operating Partnership’s business during2014(the above2014highlights relate to UDR or other subsidiaries of UDR):

•The Operating Partnership sold one operating community and an adjacent parcel of land in San Diego, California for gross proceeds of $48.7 million, resulting in a gain of approximately $24.4 million and net proceeds of$47.9 million. The Operating Partnership also recorded gains of$39.2 millionin connection with UDR’s sale oftwocommunities in Tampa, Florida and Los Angeles, California, which were previously deferred.

Our Strategies and Vision

Our vision is to be the innovative multifamily public REIT of choice. Our strategic priorities are:

1. Strengthen the Quality of Our Portfolio

2. Flexible/Strong Balance Sheet

3. Increase Cash Flow to Support Dividend Growth

4. A Great Place to Work and Live

Capital Allocation

Acquisitions and Dispositions

When evaluating potential acquisitions, we consider:

•population growth, cost of alternative housing, overall potential for economic growth and the tax and regulatory environment of the community in which the property is located;

•geographic location, including proximity to jobs, entertainment, transportation, and our existing communities which can deliver significant economies of scale;

•construction quality, condition and design of the property;

•current and projected cash flow of the property and the ability to increase cash flow;

•potential for capital appreciation of the property;

•ability to increase the value and profitability of the property through operations and redevelopment;

•whether it is located in a high barrier-to-entry market;

•terms of resident leases, including the potential for rent increases;

•occupancy and demand by residents for properties of a similar type in the vicinity;

•prospects for liquidity through sale, financing, or refinancing of the property; and

•competition from existing multifamily communities and the potential for the construction of new multifamily properties in the area.

We regularly monitor our assets to increase the quality and performance of our portfolio. Factors we consider in deciding whether to dispose of a property include:

•current market price for an asset compared to projected economics for that asset;












•potential increases in new construction in the market area;

•areas with low job growth prospects;

•markets where we do not intend to establish a long-term concentration; and

•operating efficiencies.

Development Activities

Our objective in developing a community is to create value while improving the quality of our portfolio. Demographic trends, economic drivers, and how multifamily fundamentals/valuations have trended over the long-term govern our review process on where to allocate development capital. At December 31, 2014, our development pipeline included one wholly-owned community located in Boston, Massachusetts with 369 homes and a budget of $217.7 million, in which we have a carrying value of $177.6 million.

Redevelopment Activities

Our objective in redeveloping a community is twofold: we aim to meaningfully grow rental rates while also producing a higher yielding and more valuable asset through asset quality improvement. During 2014, we continued to redevelop properties in primary markets where we concluded there was an opportunity to add value. At December 31, 2014, the Company was redeveloping 708 apartment homes, 694 of which have been completed, at one wholly-owned community with 739 apartment homes located in New York, New York. During the year ended December 31, 2014, we incurred$31.5 millionin major renovations, which include major structural changes and/or architectural revisions to existing buildings.

Joint Venture Activities

We have entered into, and may continue in the future to enter into, joint ventures (including limited liability companies or partnerships) through which we would own an indirect economic interest of less than 100% of the community or communities owned directly by such joint ventures. Our decision to either hold an apartment community in fee simple or have an indirect interest in the community through a joint venture is based on a variety of factors and considerations, including: (i) the economic and tax terms required by the seller of land or a community; (ii) our desire to diversify our portfolio of communities by market, submarket and product type; (iii) our desire at times to preserve our capital resources to maintain liquidity or balance sheet strength; and (iv) our projections, in some circumstances, that we will achieve higher returns on our invested capital or reduce our risk if a joint venture vehicle is used. Each joint venture agreement is individually negotiated, and our ability to operate and/or dispose of a community in our sole discretion may be limited to varying degrees depending on the terms of the joint venture agreement.

The Operating Partnership is not a party to any of the joint venture activities described above.

Balance Sheet Management












We maintain a capital structure that we believe allows us to proactively source potential investment opportunities in the marketplace. We have structured our debt maturity schedule to be able to opportunistically access both secured and unsecured debt markets when appropriate.

Financing Activities

As part of our plan to finance our activities, we utilize proceeds from debt and equity offerings and refinancings to extend maturities, pay down existing debt, fund development and redevelopment activities, and acquire apartment communities.

Operational Excellence, Cash Flow and Dividend Growth

Investment in new technologies continues to drive operating efficiencies in our business and help us to better meet the changing needs of our residents. Since its launch in January 2009, our residents have been utilizing our web-based resident internet portal on our website. Our residents have the ability to conduct business with us 24 hours a day, 7 days a week and complete online leasing applications and renewals throughout our portfolio.

We launched a new website at the end of 2014. This is the third major revision of UDR.com, and represents a complete rebuild of our on-line presence. It was completed after several months of research with customer focus groups that told us what they wanted to see in an on-line shopping experience. The new website features elements such as on-line appointment scheduling, enhanced neighborhood information, and comparison shopping tools, all of which are available via any device the customer may choose. To date, we are exceeding our initial targets for the site by converting a higher than expected amount of traffic to community visits.

As a result of transforming our operations through technology, residents’ satisfaction improved, and our operating teams have become more efficient. Web-based technologies have also resulted in declining marketing and advertising costs, improved cash management, and better pricing management of our available apartment homes.

Portfolio Improvement

We are focused on increasing our presence in markets with favorable job formation, high propensity to rent, low single-family home affordability, and a favorable demand/supply ratio for multifamily housing. Portfolio investment decisions consider internal analyses and third-party research.

For the year ended December 31, 2014, approximately 65.0% of our same-store NOI was generated by communities located in our primary markets of: Seattle, Washington; San Francisco Bay Area, California; Los Angeles, California; Orange County, California; Austin, Texas; Dallas, Texas; Boston, Massachusetts; New York, New York; and Metropolitan D.C.

Operating Partnership Strategies and Vision

The Operating Partnership’s long-term strategic plan is to achieve greater operating efficiencies by investing in fewer, more concentrated markets and enhance resident and associate service through technology. As a result, the Operating Partnership has sought to expand its interests in communities located in New York, New York; San Francisco Bay Area, California; Boston, Massachusetts; and Metropolitan D.C. over the past years. Prospectively, we plan to continue to channel new investments into those markets we believe will continue to provide the best investment returns. Markets will be targeted based upon defined criteria including above average job growth, low single-family home affordability and limited new supply for multifamily housing, which are three key drivers to strong rental growth.

Markets and Competitive Conditions

During the year endedDecember 31, 2014, 65.0% of our consolidated same-store NOI was generated from apartment homes located in our primary markets. AtDecember 31, 2014, the Company held 70.7% of its same-store carrying value of its real estate portfolio in our primary markets. During the year endedDecember 31, 2014, 72.9% of the Operating Partnership’s same-store NOI was generated from apartment homes located in our primary markets. AtDecember 31, 2014, the Operating Partnership held 76.1% of its same-store carrying value of its real estate portfolio in its primary markets. We believe that this diversification increases investment opportunity and decreases the risk associated with cyclical local real estate markets and economies, thereby increasing the stability and predictability of our earnings.

Competition for new residents is generally intense across all of our markets. Some competing communities offer features that our communities do not have. Competing communities can use rental concessions or lower rents to obtain temporary competitive advantages. Also, some competing communities are larger or newer than our communities. The competitive position of each community is different depending upon many factors including sub-market supply and demand. In addition,












other real estate investors compete with us to acquire existing properties, redevelop existing properties, and to develop new properties. These competitors include insurance companies, pension and investment funds, public and private real estate companies, investment companies and other public and private apartment REITs, some of which may have greater resources, or lower capital costs, than we do.

We believe that, in general, we are well-positioned to compete effectively for residents and investments. We believe our competitive advantages include:

•a fully integrated organization with property management, development, redevelopment, acquisition, marketing, sales and financing expertise;

•scalable operating and support systems, which include automated systems to meet the changing electronic needs of our residents and to effectively focus on our Internet marketing efforts;

•access to sources of capital;

•geographic diversification with a presence in 20 markets across the country; and

•significant presence in many of our major markets that allows us to be a local operating expert.

Moving forward, we will continue to optimize lease management, improve expense control, increase resident retention efforts and align employee incentive plans with our bottom line performance. We believe this plan of operation, coupled with the portfolio’s strengths in targeting renters across a geographically diverse platform, should position us for continued operational upside.

Communities

AtDecember 31, 2014, our consolidated real estate portfolio included139communities with a total of39,851completed apartment homes, which included the Operating Partnership’s consolidated real estate portfolio of68communities with a total of20,814completed apartment homes. The overall quality of our portfolio enables us to raise rents and to attract residents with higher levels of disposable income who are more likely to absorb such rents.

AtDecember 31, 2014, the Company was developingonewholly-owned community with369apartment homes,noneof which have been completed. In addition, at December 31, 2014, the Company had three communities with 825 apartment homes which were completed but not yet stabilized.

AtDecember 31, 2014, the Company was redeveloping 708 apartment homes, 694 of which have been completed, atonewholly-owned community with739apartment homes.

Same-Store Community Comparison

We believe that one pertinent quantitative measurement of the performance of our portfolio is tracking the results of our same-store communities’ NOI, which is total rental revenue, less rental expenses excluding property management and other operating expenses. Our same-store community population is comprised of operating communities which we own and have stabilized occupancy, revenues and expenses as of the beginning of the prior year.

For the year endedDecember 31, 2014, our same-store NOIincreasedby$21.6 millionor5.2%compared to the prior year. Our same-store community properties provided 79.2% of our total NOI for the year ended December 31, 2014. Theincreasein NOI for the34,581same-store apartment homes, or 86.8% of our portfolio, was driven by an increase in rental rates, fee and reimbursement income, and increased occupancy, partially offset by an increase in real estate taxes and insurance expenses.

For the year endedDecember 31, 2014, the Operating Partnership’s same-store NOIincreasedby$15.2 millionor6.1%compared to the prior year. Our same-store community properties provided 88.1% of our total NOI for the year ended December 31, 2014. Theincreasein NOI for the19,010same-store apartment homes, or 91.3% of the Operating Partnership’s portfolio, was driven by an increase in rental rates, fee and reimbursement income, and increased occupancy, partially offset by an increase in operating expenses.

Revenue growth in 2015 may be impacted by adverse developments affecting the economy generally, reduced occupancy rates, increased rental concessions, new supply, increased bad debt and other factors which may adversely impact our ability to increase rents.

Tax Matters












UDR has elected to be taxed as a REIT under the Code. To continue to qualify as a REIT, UDR must continue to meet certain tests that, among other things, generally require that our assets consist primarily of real estate assets, our income be derived primarily from real estate assets, and that we distribute at least 90% of our REIT taxable income (other than net capital gains) to our stockholders annually. Provided we maintain our qualification as a REIT, we generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income taxes at the corporate level on our net income to the extent such net income is distributed to our stockholders annually. Even if we continue to qualify as a REIT, we will continue to be subject to certain federal, state and local taxes on our income and property.

We may utilize our taxable REIT subsidiary (“TRS”) to engage in activities that REITs may be prohibited from performing, including the provision of management and other services to third parties and the conduct of certain nonqualifying real estate transactions. Our TRS generally is taxable as a regular corporation, and therefore, subject to federal, state and local income taxes.

The Operating Partnership intends to qualify as a partnership for federal income tax purposes. As a partnership, the Operating Partnership generally is not a taxable entity and does not incur federal income tax liability. However, any state or local revenue, excise or franchise taxes that result from the operating activities of the Operating Partnership are incurred at the entity level.

Inflation

We believe that the direct effects of inflation on our operations have been immaterial. While the impact of inflation primarily impacts our results through wage pressures, property taxes, utilities and material costs, substantially all of our leases are for a term of 14 months or less, which generally enables us to compensate for any inflationary effects by increasing rents on our apartment homes. Although an escalation in energy and food costs could have a negative impact on our residents and their ability to absorb rent increases, we do not believe this has had a material impact on our results for the year endedDecember 31, 2014.

Environmental Matters

Various environmental laws govern certain aspects of the ongoing operation of our communities. Such environmental laws include those regulating the existence of asbestos-containing materials in buildings, management of surfaces with lead-based paint (and notices to residents about the lead-based paint), use of active underground petroleum storage tanks, and waste-management activities. The failure to comply with such requirements could subject us to a government enforcement action and/or claims for damages by a private party.

To date, compliance with federal, state and local environmental protection regulations has not had a material effect on our capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position. We have a property management plan for hazardous materials. As part of the plan, Phase I environmental site investigations and reports have been completed for each property we acquire. In addition, all proposed acquisitions are inspected prior to acquisition. The inspections are conducted by qualified environmental consultants, and we review the issued report prior to the purchase or development of any property. Nevertheless, it is possible that the environmental assessments will not reveal all environmental liabilities, or that some material environmental liabilities exist of which we are unaware. In some cases, we have abandoned otherwise economically attractive acquisitions because the costs of removal or control of hazardous materials have been prohibitive or we have been unwilling to accept the potential risks involved. We do not believe we will be required to engage in any large-scale abatement at any of our properties. We believe that through professional environmental inspections and testing for asbestos, lead paint and other hazardous materials, coupled with a relatively conservative posture toward accepting known environmental risk, we can minimize our exposure to potential liability associated with environmental hazards.

Federal legislation requires owners and landlords of residential housing constructed prior to 1978 to disclose to potential residents or purchasers of the communities any known lead paint hazards and imposes treble damages for failure to provide such notification. In addition, lead based paint in any of the communities may result in lead poisoning in children residing in that community if chips or particles of such lead based paint are ingested, and we may be held liable under state laws for any such injuries caused by ingestion of lead based paint by children living at the communities.

We are unaware of any environmental hazards at any of our properties that individually or in the aggregate may have a material adverse impact on our operations or financial position. We have not been notified by any governmental authority, and we are not otherwise aware, of any material non-compliance, liability, or claim relating to environmental liabilities in connection with any of our properties. We do not believe that the cost of continued compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations will have a material adverse effect on us or our financial condition or results of operations. Future environmental laws, regulations, or ordinances, however, may require additional remediation of existing conditions that are not












currently actionable. Also, if more stringent requirements are imposed on us in the future, the costs of compliance could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and our financial condition.

Insurance

We carry comprehensive general liability coverage on our communities, with limits of liability customary within the multi-family apartment industry to insure against liability claims and related defense costs. We are also insured, with limits of liability customary within the multi-family apartment industry, against the risk of direct physical damage in amounts necessary to reimburse us on a replacement cost basis for costs incurred to repair or rebuild each property, including loss of rental income during the reconstruction period.
