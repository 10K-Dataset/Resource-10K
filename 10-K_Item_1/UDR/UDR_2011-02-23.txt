Item 1.BUSINESS



General



UDR is a self administered real estate investment trust, or
    REIT, that owns, acquires, renovates, develops, redevelops, and
    manages apartment communities in select markets throughout the
    United States. At December 31, 2010, our consolidated
    apartment portfolio included 172 communities located in 23
    markets, with a total of 48,553 completed apartment homes, which
    are held through our operating partnerships, including the
    Operating Partnership and Heritage Communities L.P., our
    subsidiaries and consolidated joint ventures. In addition, we
    have an ownership interest in 37 communities containing 9,891
    completed apartment homes through unconsolidated joint ventures.



At December 31, 2010, the Operating Partnership’s
    consolidated apartment portfolio included 81 communities located
    in 19 markets, with a total of 23,351 completed apartment homes.
    The Operating Partnership owns, acquires, renovates, develops,
    redevelops, manages, and disposes of multifamily apartment
    communities generally located in highbarrier-to-entrymarkets located in the United States. The highbarrier-to-entrymarkets are characterized by limited land for new construction,
    difficult and lengthy entitlement process, expensive
    single-family home prices and significant employment growth
    potential. During the fiscal year ended December 31, 2010,
    revenues of the Operating Partnership represented approximately
    55% of our total rental revenues.



UDR elected to be taxed as a REIT under the Internal Revenue
    Code of 1986, as amended, which we refer to in this Report as
    the “Code”. To continue to qualify as a REIT, we must
    continue to meet certain tests which, among other things,
    generally require that our assets consist primarily of real
    estate assets, our income be derived primarily from real estate
    assets, and that we distribute at least 90% of our REIT taxable
    income (other than our net capital gains) to our stockholders
    annually. As a qualified REIT, we generally will not be subject
    to U.S. federal income taxes at the corporate level on our
    net income to the extent we distribute such





net income to our stockholders annually. In 2010, we declared
    total distributions of $0.730 per common share and paid
    dividends of $0.725 per common share.

UDR was formed in 1972 as a Virginia corporation. In June 2003,
    we changed our state of incorporation from Virginia to Maryland.
    The Operating Partnership was formed in 2004 as Delaware limited
    partnership. The Operating Partnership is thesuccessor-in-interestto United Dominion Realty, L.P., a limited partnership formed
    under the laws of Virginia, which commenced operations in 1995.
    Our corporate offices are located at 1745 Shea Center Drive,
    Suite 200, Highlands Ranch, Colorado and our telephone
    number is(720) 283-6120.Our website is located atwww.udr.com.



As of February 17, 2011, we had 1,547 full-time
    associates and 85 part-time associates, all of whom were
    employed by UDR.



Reporting
    Segments



We report in two segments: Same Communities and Non-Mature/Other
    Communities. Our Same Communities segment includes those
    communities acquired, developed, and stabilized prior to
    January 1, 2009, and held as of December 31, 2010.
    These communities were owned and had stabilized occupancy and
    operating expenses as of the beginning of the prior year, there
    is no plan to conduct substantial redevelopment activities, and
    the community is not held for disposition within the current
    year. A community is considered to have stabilized occupancy
    once it achieves 90% occupancy for at least three consecutive
    months. Our Non-Mature/Other Communities segment includes those
    communities that were acquired or developed in 2008, 2009 or
    2010, sold properties, redevelopment properties, properties
    classified as real estate held for disposition, condominium
    conversion properties, joint venture properties, properties
    managed by third parties, and the non-apartment components of
    mixed use properties. For additional information regarding our
    operating segments, see Note 15 to UDR’s consolidated
    financial statements and Note 12 to the Operating
    Partnership’s consolidated financial statements.



Business
    Objectives



Our principal business objective is to maximize the economic
    returns of our apartment communities to provide our stockholders
    with the greatest possible total return and value. To achieve
    this objective, we intend to continue to pursue the following
    goals and strategies:



•own and operate apartments in markets that have the best growth
    prospects based on favorable job formation and low home
    affordability, thus enhancing stability and predictability of
    returns to our stockholders;•manage real estate cycles by taking an opportunistic approach to
    buying, selling, renovating, and developing apartment
    communities;•empower site associates to manage our communities efficiently
    and effectively;•measure and reward associates based on specific performance
    targets; and•manage our capital structure to help enhance predictability of
    earnings and dividends.







    Highlights





•We acquired five operating communities with 1,374 homes located
    in Orange County, California; Baltimore, Maryland; Los Angeles,
    California; and Boston, Massachusetts for $412 million. We
    also acquired a land parcel located in San Francisco,
    California for $23.6 million.



•We acquired an interest in a joint venture with Metropolitan
    Life Insurance Company (“MetLife”) for
    $100.8 million. The joint venture owns 26 operating
    communities with 5,748 homes and 11 parcels of land with the
    potential to develop approximately 2,300 additional homes. The
    majority of the portfolio is comprised of mid/high-rise
    buildings located in urban, in-fill locations. The assets are
    located in many of our core markets with rent and quality levels
    at the top of each market.



•We completed the development of four wholly-owned communities
    with 1,575 homes at a total cost of $259.7 million.



•We completed the development of one community (274 apartment
    homes) held by a consolidated joint venture for a total cost of
    $122.3 million.



•We repaid $187.3 million of secured debt and
    $50 million of maturing medium-term unsecured notes. The
    $187.3 million of secured debt includes $70.5 million
    for a maturing construction loan held by one of our consolidated
    joint ventures, repayment of $52.7 million of credit
    facilities and $64.1 million of mortgage payments.



•We repurchased unsecured debt with a notional amount of
    $29.2 million for $29.4 million resulting in a loss on
    extinguishment of $1 million, which includes the write off
    of related deferred finance charges. The unsecured debt
    repurchased by the Company matures in 2011. As a result of this
    repurchase, the loss is represented as an addition to interest
    expense on the Consolidated Statement of Operations.



•We closed on a $250 million, five-year unsecured term loan
    facility of which $100 million was swapped into a fixed
    rate of 3.76% and $150 million has rate of LIBOR plus
    200 basis points.



•In 2009, we entered into an Amended and Restated Distribution
    Agreement with respect to the issue and sale by us from time to
    time of our Medium-Term Notes, Series A Due Nine Months or
    More From Date of Issue. In February 2010, we issued
    $150 million of 5.25% senior unsecured medium-term
    notes under the Amended and Restated Distribution Agreement.
    These notes were priced at 99.46% of the principal amount at
    issuance and the unamortized discount was $519,000 at
    December 31, 2010.



•In 2009, we initiated an “At the Market” equity
    distribution program pursuant to which we may sell up to
    15,000,000 shares of Common Stock from time to time to or
    through sales agents, by means of ordinary brokers’
    transactions on the New York Stock Exchange at prevailing market
    prices at the time of sale, or as otherwise agreed with the
    applicable agent. During the year ended December 31, 2010,
    we sold 6,144,367 shares of Common Stock through this
    program for aggregate gross proceeds of approximately
    $110.8 million at a weighted average price per share of
    $18.04. Aggregate net proceeds from such sales, after deducting
    related expenses, including commissions paid to the sales agents
    of approximately $2.2 million, were approximately
    $108.6 million.



•We initiated an underwritten public offering to sell
    16,000,000 shares of Common Stock at a price of $20.35 per
    share. We granted the underwriters a30-dayoption to purchase up to an additional 2,400,000 shares of
    Common Stock to cover overallotments, if any. We sold
    18,400,000 shares of Common Stock in this offering for
    aggregate gross proceeds of approximately $374.4 million at
    a price of $20.35 per share. Aggregate net proceeds from the
    offering, after deducting related expenses were approximately
    $359.2 million.



Other than the following, there were no significant changes to
    the Operating Partnership’s business during 2010 (the above
    2010 highlights relate to UDR or other subsidiaries of UDR):



•On September 30, 2010, the Operating Partnership guaranteed
    certain outstanding securities of UDR, such that the Operating
    Partnership, as primary obligor and not merely as surety,
    irrevocably and unconditionally guarantees to each holder of the
    applicable securities and to the trustee and their





successors and assigns under the respective indenture
    (a) the full and punctual payment when due, whether at
    stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise, of all
    obligations of UDR under the respective indenture whether for
    principal of or interest on the securities (and premium, if
    any), and all other monetary obligations of UDR under the
    respective indenture and the terms of the applicable securities
    and (b) the full and punctual performance within the
    applicable grace periods of all other obligations of UDR under
    the respective indenture and the terms of the applicable
    securities.



Our
    Strategies and Vision



We previously announced our vision to be the innovative
    multifamily public real estate investment trust of choice. We
    identified the following strategies to guide decision-making and
    growth:



1. Strengthen our portfolio



2. Continually improve operations



3. Maintain access to low-cost capital



Strengthen
    our Portfolio



We are focused on increasing our presence in markets with
    favorable job formation, low single-family home affordability,
    and a favorable demand/supply ratio for multifamily housing.
    Portfolio decisions consider internal analyses and third-party
    research, taking into account job growth, multifamily permitting
    and housing affordability.



For the year ended December 31, 2010, approximately 55.7%
    of our same store net operating income was provided by our
    communities located in California, Metropolitan
    Washington, D.C., Oregon and Washington state.



Operating
    Partnership Strategies and Vision



The Operating Partnership’s long-term strategic plan is to
    achieve greater operating efficiencies by investing in fewer,
    more concentrated markets. As a result, the Operating
    Partnership has sought to expand its interests in communities
    located in California, Metropolitan Washington D.C. and the
    Washington state markets over the past years. Prospectively, we
    plan to continue to channel new investments into those markets
    we believe will continue to provide the best investment returns.
    Markets will be targeted based upon defined criteria including
    favorable job formation, low single-family home affordability
    and favorable demand/supply ratio for multifamily housing.



Acquisitions
    and Dispositions



During 2010, in conjunction with our strategy to strengthen our
    portfolio, we acquired five operating communities with 1,374
    apartment homes for approximately $412 million.



When evaluating potential acquisitions, we consider:



•population growth, cost of alternative housing, overall
    potential for economic growth and the tax and regulatory
    environment of the community in which the property is located;•geographic location, including proximity to jobs, entertainment,
    transportation, and our existing communities which can deliver
    significant economies of scale;•construction quality, condition and design of the community;•current and projected cash flow of the property and the ability
    to increase cash flow;•potential for capital appreciation of the property;•ability to increase the value and profitability of the property
    through operations and redevelopment;•terms of resident leases, including the potential for rent
    increases;•occupancy and demand by residents for properties of a similar
    type in the vicinity;







•prospects for liquidity through sale, financing, or refinancing
    of the property; and•competition from existing multifamily communities and the
    potential for the construction of new multifamily properties in
    the area.



We regularly monitor our assets to increase the quality and
    performance of our portfolio. Factors we consider in deciding
    whether to dispose of a property include:



•current market price for an asset compared to projected
    economics for that asset;•potential increases in new construction in the market area;•areas where the economy is not expected to grow substantially;•markets where we do not intend to establish a long-term
    concentration; and•operating efficiencies.



During 2010, we sold one 149 apartment home community. This
    apartment home community was not owned by the Operating
    Partnership.

None of these projects are held by the Operating Partnership.



Redevelopment
    Activities



During 2010, we continued to redevelop properties in targeted
    markets where we concluded there was an opportunity to add
    value. During the year ended December 31, 2010, we incurred
    $30.8 million in major renovations, which include major
    structural changesand/orarchitectural revisions to existing buildings.



Joint
    Venture Activities



In 2010, we completed the development of an apartment community
    located in Bellevue, Washington with 274 apartment homes,
    45,394 square feet of retail space and a carrying value of
    $122.3 million. On October 16, 2009, our partner in
    the joint venture (“Elements Too”) in this property
    resigned as managing member and appointed us as managing member.
    In addition, our partner relinquished its voting rights and
    approval rights and its ability to substantively participate in
    the decision-making process of the joint venture. As a result of
    UDR’s control of the joint venture, we were required to
    consolidate the joint venture. On December 30, 2009, we
    entered into an agreement with our partner to purchase its 49%
    interest in Elements Too for $3.2 million, which was paid
    in 2010. At closing, our interest in Elements Too increased to
    98%.



We are a partner with an unaffiliated third party in a joint
    venture (“989 Elements”) which owns and operates a
    23-story, 166 home high-rise apartment community in the central
    business district of Bellevue, Washington. At closing, UDR owned
    49% of the joint venture. Our initial investment was
    $11.8 million. On December 31, 2009, our partner
    resigned as managing member and appointed us as managing member.
    In addition, our partner relinquished its voting rights and
    approval rights and its ability to substantively participate in
    the decision-making process of the joint venture. Concurrently,
    we entered into an agreement with our partner to purchase its
    49% interest in 989 Elements for $7.7 million, which was
    paid in 2010. At closing, our interest in 989 Elements increased
    to 98%.



We are a partner with an unaffiliated third party in a joint
    venture (“Bellevue Plaza”) which owns an operating
    retail site in Bellevue, Washington. We initially planned to
    develop a 430 home high rise apartment building with ground
    floor retail on an existing operating retail center. However,
    during the year ended December 31, 2009, the joint venture
    decided to continue to operate the retail property as opposed to
    developing a high rise apartment building on the site. On
    December 30, 2009, our partner relinquished its voting
    rights and approval rights and its ability to substantively
    participate in the decision-making process of the joint venture.
    Our partner also resigned as managing member and appointed us as
    managing member. Concurrently, we entered into an agreement with
    our partner to purchase its 49% interest in Bellevue Plaza for
    $5.2 million, which was paid in 2010. At closing, our
    interest in Bellevue Plaza increased from 49% to 98%.



For additional information regarding these consolidated joint
    ventures, see Note 5,Joint Venturesto the
    Consolidated Financial Statements of UDR, Inc. included in this
    Report.



In November 2010, we acquired The Hanover Company’s
    (“Hanover”) partnership interests in the
    Hanover/MetLife Master Limited Partnership (the
    “UDR/MetLife Partnership”). The UDR/MetLife
    Partnership owns a portfolio of 26 operating communities
    containing 5,748 homes and 11 land parcels with the
    potential to develop approximately 2,300 additional homes. Under
    the terms of the UDR/MetLife Partnership, we will act as the
    general partner and earn fees for property and asset management
    and financing transactions. We acquired ownership interests of
    12.27% in the operating communities and 4.14% in the land
    parcels for $100.8 million. Our initial investment of
    $100.8 million consists of $71.8 million in cash,
    which includes associated transaction costs, and a
    $30 million payable (includes discount of $1 million)
    to Hanover. We agreed to pay the $30 million balance to
    Hanover in two interest free installments in the amounts of
    $20 million and $10 million on the first and second
    anniversaries of the closing, respectively. Our investment at
    December 31, 2010 was $122.2 million.



In October 2010, the Company entered into a venture with an
    affiliate of Hanover to develop a 240 apartment home
    community in the metropolitan Boston, Massachusetts area. At the
    closing and at





December 31, 2010, UDR owned a noncontrolling interest of
    95% in the joint venture. Our initial investment was
    $10 million and our investment at December 31, 2010
    was $10.3 million.



During 2009, we and an unaffiliated third party formed a joint
    venture for the investment of up to $450 million in
    multi-family properties located in key, high barrier to entry
    markets. The partners will contribute equity of
    $180 million of which our maximum equity will be 30% or
    $54 million when fully invested. During the year ended
    December 31, 2010, the joint venture acquired its first
    property (151 homes) located in Metropolitan Washington D.C. for
    $43.1 million. At closing and at December 31, 2010, we
    owned 30% of the joint venture. Our investment at
    December 31, 2010 and 2009 was $5.2 million and
    $242,000, respectively.



The Operating Partnership is not a party to any of the joint
    venture activities described above.



Continually
    Improve Operations



We continue to make progress on automating our business as a way
    to drive operating efficiencies and to better meet the changing
    needs of our residents. Since its launch in January 2009, our
    residents have been utilizing the resident internet portal on
    our website. Our residents have access to conduct business with
    us 24 hours a day, 7 days a week to pay rent on line
    and to submit service requests. In July 2010, we completed the
    roll out of online renewals throughout our entire portfolio. As
    a result of transforming operations through technology our
    residents get the convenience they want and our operating teams
    have become more efficient. These improvements in adopting the
    web as a way to conduct business with us have also resulted in a
    decline in marketing and advertising costs, improved cash
    management, and improved capabilities to better manage pricing
    of our available apartment homes.



In 2010, we launched an enhancedwww.udr.comwebsite along and a new Modern Living website that highlights
    our premier urban-style location communities. Both UDR.com and
    Modern Living feature innovativepoint-of-viewwalking tours (at select locations), social media content
    sharing and a new “save to favorites” feature that
    entices first-time visitors to revisit www.udr.com. In addition
    to improvements to www.udr.com, we also increased our suite of
    mobile and tablet device offerings with the addition of an iPad,
    Android, BlackBerry and Palm Pre apartment search applications.
    These overall enhancements have contributed to increasing our
    web visitor traffic to over 2.3 million visitors (up 24%)
    and almost 1.5 million organic search engine visitors (up
    30%) which contributed to a 20%year-over-yearlead stream increase.



Maintaining
    Access to Low-Cost Capital



We seek to maintain a capital structure that allows us to seek,
    and not just react to, opportunities available in the
    marketplace. We have structured our borrowings to stagger our
    debt maturities and to be able to opportunistically access both
    secured and unsecured debt.



Special
    Dividend



On November 5, 2008, our Board of Directors declared a
    dividend on a pre-adjusted basis of $1.29 per share (“the
    Special Dividend”). The Special Dividend was paid on
    January 29, 2009 to stockholders of record on
    December 9, 2008. The dividend represented our fourth
    quarter recurring distribution of $0.33 per share and an
    additional special distribution of $0.96 per share due to
    taxable income arising from our dispositions occurring during
    the year. Subject to our right to pay the entire Special
    Dividend in cash, stockholders had the option to make an
    election to receive payment in cash or in shares, however, the
    aggregate amount of cash payable to stockholders, other than
    cash payable in lieu of fractional shares, would not be less
    than $44.0 million.



The Special Dividend, totaling $177.1 million, was paid on
    137,266,557 shares issued and outstanding on the record
    date. Approximately $133.1 million of the Special Dividend
    was paid through the issuance of 11,358,042 shares of
    common stock, which was determined based on the volume weighted
    average closing sales price of our common stock of $11.71 per
    share on the NYSE on January 21, 2009 and January 22,
    2009. In January 2010, the Financial Accounting Standards
    Board’s (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards
    Update2010-01,Accounting for Distributions to Shareholders with Components
    of Stock and Cash(“ASU2010-01”),





which considers distributions that contain components of cash
    and stock and allows shareholders to select their preferred form
    of distribution as a stock dividend. Such a distribution is
    treated as a stock issuance on the date the dividend is paid. At
    December 31, 2008, we accrued $133.1 million of
    distribution payable related to the Special Dividend. ASU2010-01is
    effective for the Company on December 15, 2009 and should
    be applied on a retrospective basis. As a result, we reversed
    the effect of the issuance of additional shares of common stock
    pursuant to the Special Dividend, which was retroactively
    reflected in each of the historical periods presented within the
    Company’sForm 8-Kfiled with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or the
    “SEC” on May 22, 2009, and effectively issued
    these shares on January 29, 2009 (the payment date of the
    Special Dividend).



Financing
    Activities



As part of our plan to strengthen our capital structure, we
    utilized proceeds from debt and equity offerings and
    refinancings to extend maturities, pay down existing debt and
    acquire apartment communities. The following is a summary of our
    major financing activities in 2010:





•repaid $187.3 million of secured debt and
    $50.0 million of maturing medium-term unsecured notes. The
    $187.3 million of secured debt includes $70.5 million
    for a maturing construction loan held by one of our consolidated
    joint ventures, repayment of $52.7 million of credit
    facilities and $64.1 million of mortgage payments;



•repurchased unsecured debt with a notional amount of
    $29.2 million for $29.4 million resulting in a loss on
    extinguishment of $1 million, which includes the write off
    of related deferred finance charges. The unsecured debt
    repurchased by us matures in 2011. As a result of this
    repurchase, the loss is represented as an addition to interest
    expense on the Consolidated Statement of Operations;



•closed on a $250 million, five-year unsecured term loan
    facility of which $100 million was swapped into a fixed
    rate of 3.76% and $150 million has a rate of LIBOR plus
    200 basis points;



•in 2009, we entered into an Amended and Restated Distribution
    Agreement with respect to the issue and sale by us from time to
    time of our Medium-Term Notes, Series A Due Nine Months or
    More From Date of Issue. In February 2010, we issued
    $150 million of 5.25% senior unsecured medium-term
    notes under the Amended and Restated Distribution Agreement.
    These notes were priced at 99.46% of the principal amount at
    issuance and had a discount of $519,000 at December 31,
    2010;



•in 2009, we initiated an “At the Market” equity
    distribution program pursuant to which we may sell up to
    15,000,000 shares of common stock from time to time to or
    through sales agents, by means of ordinary brokers’
    transactions on the New York Stock Exchange at prevailing market
    prices at the time of sale, or as otherwise agreed with the
    applicable agent. During the year ended December 31, 2010,
    we sold 6,144,367 shares of common stock through this
    program for aggregate gross proceeds of approximately
    $110.8 million at a weighted average price per share of
    $18.04. Aggregate net proceeds from such sales, after deducting
    related expenses, including commissions paid to the sales agents
    of approximately $2.2 million, were approximately
    $108.6 million;



•in 2010, we initiated an underwritten public offering to sell
    16,000,000 shares of our common stock at a price of $20.35
    per share. We granted the underwriters a30-dayoption to purchase up to an additional 2,400,000 shares of
    common stock to cover overallotments, if any. We sold
    18,400,000 shares of common stock in this offering for
    aggregate gross proceeds of approximately $374.4 million at
    a price of $20.35 per share. Aggregate net proceeds from the
    offering, after deducting related expenses were approximately
    $359.2 million; and



•on September 30, 2010, the Operating Partnership guaranteed
    certain outstanding securities of UDR, such that the Operating
    Partnership, as primary obligor and not merely as surety,
    irrevocably and unconditionally guarantees to each holder of the
    applicable securities and to the trustee and their successors
    and assigns under the respective indenture (a) the full and
    punctual payment when due, whether at stated maturity, by
    acceleration or otherwise, of all obligations of UDR under the
    respective indenture whether for principal of or interest on the
    securities (and premium, if any), and all other monetary
    obligations of UDR under the respective indenture and the terms
    of the applicable securities





and (b) the full and punctual performance within the
    applicable grace periods of all other obligations of UDR under
    the respective indenture and the terms of the applicable
    securities.



Markets
    and Competitive Conditions



At December 31, 2010, 55.7% of our consolidated same store
    net operating income and 76% of the Operating Partnership’s
    same store net operating income was generated from apartment
    homes located in California, Metropolitan Washington D.C.,
    Oregon, and Washington state. We believe that this
    diversification increases investment opportunity and decreases
    the risk associated with cyclical local real estate markets and
    economies, thereby increasing the stability and predictability
    of our earnings.



Competition for new residents is generally intense across all of
    our markets. Some competing communities offer features that our
    communities do not have. Competing communities can use
    concessions or lower rents to obtain temporary competitive
    advantages. Also, some competing communities are larger or newer
    than our communities. The competitive position of each community
    is different depending upon many factors includingsub-marketsupply and demand. In addition, other real estate investors
    compete with us to acquire existing properties and to develop
    new properties. These competitors include insurance companies,
    pension and investment funds, public and private real estate
    companies, investment companies and other public and private
    apartment REITs, some of which may have greater resources, or
    lower capital costs, than we do.



We believe that, in general, we are well-positioned to compete
    effectively for residents and investments. We believe our
    competitive advantages include:



•a fully integrated organization with property management,
    development, redevelopment, acquisition, marketing, sales and
    financing expertise;•scalable operating and support systems, which include automated
    systems to meet the changing electronic needs of our residents
    and to effectively focus on our Internet marketing efforts;•purchasing power;•geographic diversification with a presence in 23 markets across
    the country; and•significant presence in many of our major markets that allows us
    to be a local operating expert.



Moving forward, we will continue to emphasize aggressive lease
    management, improved expense control, increased resident
    retention efforts and the alignment of employee incentive plans
    tied to our bottom line performance. We believe this plan of
    operation, coupled with the portfolio’s strengths in
    targeting renters across a geographically diverse platform,
    should position us for continued operational improvement in
    spite of the difficult economic environment.



Communities



At December 31, 2010, our apartment portfolio included 172
    consolidated communities having a total of 48,553 completed
    apartment homes and an additional 930 apartment homes under
    development, which included the Operating Partnership’s
    apartment portfolio of 81 consolidated communities having a
    total of 23,351 completed apartment homes. The overall quality
    of our portfolio enables us to raise rents and to attract
    residents with higher levels of disposable income who are more
    likely to absorb expenses, such as water and sewer costs, from
    the landlord to the resident. In addition, it potentially
    reduces recurring capital expenditures per apartment home, and
    therefore should result in increased cash flow in the future.



Same
    Store Community Comparison



We believe that one pertinent qualitative measurement of the
    performance of our portfolio is tracking the results of our same
    store community’s net operating income (“NOI”),
    which is total rental revenue, less rental expenses excluding
    property management and other operating expenses. Our same store
    community population are operating communities which we own and
    have stabilized occupancy, revenues and expenses as of the
    beginning of the prior year.





For the year ended December 31, 2010, our same store NOI
    decreased by $6.2 million or 1.7% compared to the prior
    year. The decrease in NOI for the 40,699 apartment homes which
    make up the same store population was driven by a decrease in
    rental rates and an increase in expenses which was partially
    offset by increased occupancy.



For the year ended December 31, 2010, the Operating
    Partnership’s same store NOI decreased by $6.0 million
    or 2.7% compared to the prior year. The decrease in NOI for the
    22,104 apartment homes which make up the same store population
    was driven by a decrease in revenue rental rates and increase in
    operating expenses which was partially offset by increased
    occupancy.



Revenue growth in 2011 may be impacted by general adverse
    conditions affecting the economy, reduced occupancy rates,
    increased rental concessions, increased bad debt and other
    factors which may adversely impact our ability to increase rents.



Tax
    Matters



UDR has elected to be taxed as a REIT under the Code. To
    continue to qualify as a REIT, UDR must continue to meet certain
    tests that, among other things, generally require that our
    assets consist primarily of real estate assets, our income be
    derived primarily from real estate assets, and that we
    distribute at least 90% of our REIT taxable income (other than
    net capital gains) to our stockholders annually. Provided we
    maintain our qualification as a REIT, we generally will not be
    subject to U.S. federal income taxes at the corporate level
    on our net income to the extent such net income is distributed
    to our stockholders annually. Even if we continue to qualify as
    a REIT, we will continue to be subject to certain federal, state
    and local taxes on our income and property.



We may utilize taxable REIT subsidiaries to engage in activities
    that REITs may be prohibited from performing, including the
    provision of management and other services to third parties and
    the conduct of certain nonqualifying real estate transactions.
    Taxable REIT subsidiaries generally are taxable as regular
    corporations and therefore are subject to federal, state and
    local income taxes.



The Operating Partnership intends to qualify as a partnership
    for federal income tax purposes. As a partnership, the Operating
    Partnership generally is not a taxable entity and does not incur
    federal income tax liability. However, any state or local
    revenue, excise or franchise taxes that result from the
    operating activities of the Operating Partnership are incurred
    at the entity level.



Inflation



We believe that the direct effects of inflation on our
    operations have been immaterial. While the impact of inflation
    primarily impacts our results through wage pressures, utilities
    and material costs, substantially all of our leases are for a
    term of one year or less, which generally enables us to
    compensate for any inflationary effects by increasing rents on
    our apartment homes. Although an extreme escalation in energy
    and food costs could have a negative impact on our residents and
    their ability to absorb rent increases, we do not believe this
    has had a material impact on our results for the year ended
    December 31, 2010.



Environmental
    Matters



Various environmental laws govern certain aspects of the ongoing
    operation of our communities. Such environmental laws include
    those regulating the existence of asbestos-containing materials
    in buildings, management of surfaces with lead-based paint (and
    notices to residents about the lead-based paint), use of active
    underground petroleum storage tanks, and waste-management
    activities. The failure to comply with such requirements could
    subject us to a government enforcement actionand/orclaims for damages by a private party.



To date, compliance with federal, state and local environmental
    protection regulations has not had a material effect on our
    capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position. We have
    a property management plan for hazardous materials. As part of
    the plan, Phase I environmental site investigations and reports
    have been completed for each property we acquire. In addition,
    all proposed acquisitions are inspected prior to





acquisition. The inspections are conducted by qualified
    environmental consultants, and we review the issued report prior
    to the purchase or development of any property. Nevertheless, it
    is possible that our environmental assessments will not reveal
    all environmental liabilities, or that some material
    environmental liabilities exist of which we are unaware. In some
    cases, we have abandoned otherwise economically attractive
    acquisitions because the costs of removal or control of
    hazardous materials have been prohibitive or we have been
    unwilling to accept the potential risks involved. We do not
    believe we will be required to engage in any large-scale
    abatement at any of our properties. We believe that through
    professional environmental inspections and testing for asbestos,
    lead paint and other hazardous materials, coupled with a
    relatively conservative posture toward accepting known
    environmental risk, we can minimize our exposure to potential
    liability associated with environmental hazards.



Federal legislation requires owners and landlords of residential
    housing constructed prior to 1978 to disclose to potential
    residents or purchasers of the communities any known lead paint
    hazards and imposes treble damages for failure to provide such
    notification. In addition, lead based paint in any of the
    communities may result in lead poisoning in children residing in
    that community if chips or particles of such lead based paint
    are ingested, and we may be held liable under state laws for any
    such injuries caused by ingestion of lead based paint by
    children living at the communities.



We are unaware of any environmental hazards at any of our
    properties that individually or in the aggregate may have a
    material adverse impact on our operations or financial position.
    We have not been notified by any governmental authority, and we
    are not otherwise aware, of any material non-compliance,
    liability, or claim relating to environmental liabilities in
    connection with any of our properties. We do not believe that
    the cost of continued compliance with applicable environmental
    laws and regulations will have a material adverse effect on us
    or our financial condition or results of operations. Future
    environmental laws, regulations, or ordinances, however, may
    require additional remediation of existing conditions that are
    not currently actionable. Also, if more stringent requirements
    are imposed on us in the future, the costs of compliance could
    have a material adverse effect on us and our financial condition.



Insurance



We carry comprehensive general liability coverage on our
    communities, with limits of liability customary within the
    industry to insure against liability claims and related defense
    costs. We are also insured, with limits of liability customary
    within the industry, against the risk of direct physical damage
    in amounts necessary to reimburse us on a replacement cost basis
    for costs incurred to repair or rebuild each property, including
    loss of rental income during the reconstruction period.
