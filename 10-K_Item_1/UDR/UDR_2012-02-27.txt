Item 1. BUSINESS

General

UDR is a self administered real estate investment trust, or REIT, that owns, operates,
acquires, renovates, develops, redevelops, and manages multifamily apartment communities generally
located in high barrier-to-entry markets located throughout the United States. The high
barrier-to-entry markets are characterized by limited land for new construction, difficult and
lengthy entitlement process, expensive single-family home prices and significant employment growth
potential. At December 31, 2011, our consolidated apartment portfolio included 163 communities
located in 22 markets, with a total of 47,343 completed apartment homes, which are held through our
operating partnerships, including the Operating Partnership, our subsidiaries and consolidated
joint ventures. In addition, we have an ownership interest in 39 communities containing 10,496
completed apartment homes through unconsolidated joint ventures. At
December 31, 2011, the Company is developing seven wholly-owned
communities with 2,108 apartment homes, 145 of which have been
completed.

At December 31, 2011, the Operating Partnership’s consolidated apartment portfolio included 77
communities located in 17 markets, with a total of 23,160 completed apartment homes. The Operating
Partnership owns, operates, acquires, renovates, develops, redevelops, and manages multifamily
apartment communities generally located in high barrier-to-entry markets located throughout the
United States. During the fiscal year ended December 31, 2011, revenues of the Operating
Partnership represented approximately 53% of our total rental revenues.





UDR elected to be taxed as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, which
we refer to in this Report as the “Code”. To continue to qualify as a REIT, we must continue to
meet certain tests which, among other things, generally require that our assets consist primarily
of real estate assets, our income be derived primarily from real estate assets, and that we
distribute at least 90% of our REIT taxable income (other than our net capital gains) to our
stockholders annually. As a qualified REIT, we generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income
taxes at the corporate level on our net income to the extent we distribute such net income to our
stockholders annually. In 2011, we declared total distributions of $0.80 per common share and paid
dividends of $0.77 per common share.

UDR was formed in 1972 as a Virginia corporation. In June 2003, we changed our state of
incorporation from Virginia to Maryland. The Operating Partnership was formed in 2004 as Delaware
limited partnership. The Operating Partnership is the successor-in-interest to United Dominion
Realty, L.P., a limited partnership formed under the laws of Virginia, which commenced operations
in 1995. Our corporate offices are located at 1745 Shea Center Drive, Suite 200, Highlands Ranch,
Colorado and our telephone number is (720) 283-6120. Our website is located atwww.udr.com.

As of February 17, 2012, we had 1,652 full-time associates and 98 part-time associates, all of
whom were employed by UDR.

Reporting Segments

We report in two segments: Same Communities and Non-Mature/Other Communities. Our Same
Communities segment includes those communities acquired, developed, and stabilized prior to January
1, 2010, and held as of December 31, 2011. These communities were owned and had stabilized
occupancy and operating expenses as of the beginning of the prior year, there is no plan to conduct
substantial redevelopment activities, and the community is not classified as held for sale at year
end. A community is considered to have stabilized occupancy once it achieves 90% occupancy for at
least three consecutive months. Our Non-Mature/Other Communities segment includes those
communities that were acquired or developed in 2009, 2010 or 2011, sold properties, redevelopment
properties, properties classified as real estate held for sale, condominium conversion properties,
joint venture properties, properties managed by third parties, and the non-apartment components of
mixed use properties. For additional information regarding our operating segments, see Note 15 to
UDR’s consolidated financial statements and Note 11 to the Operating Partnership’s consolidated
financial statements.

Business Objectives

Our principal business objective is to maximize the economic returns of our apartment
communities to provide our stockholders with the greatest possible total return and value. To
achieve this objective, we intend to continue to pursue the following goals and strategies:

•own and operate apartments in markets that have the best growth prospects based on
favorable job formation and low home affordability, thus enhancing stability and
predictability of returns to our stockholders;

•manage real estate cycles by taking an opportunistic approach to buying, selling,
renovating, and developing apartment communities;

•empower site associates to manage our communities efficiently and effectively;

•measure and reward associates based on specific performance targets; and

•manage our capital structure to help enhance predictability of earnings and dividends.







2011 Highlights

•We acquired eight operating communities with 3,161 homes located in New York, New York;
San Francisco, California; Boston, Massachusetts; and Metropolitan D.C. markets for $1.5
billion. We also acquired three parcels of land for $34.3 million.

•We entered into a consolidated joint venture to acquire and redevelop a commercial
property into a 173- apartment home community in Orange County, California. We also entered
into two unconsolidated joint ventures to develop a 263- apartment home community in San
Diego, California and a 256- apartment home community in College Park, Maryland.

•One of our unconsolidated joint ventures acquired two operating communities with 509
homes in the Washington, D.C. market for $237.8 million.

•We repaid $336.0 million of secured debt. The $336.0 million of secured debt includes
$197.5 million of construction loans, repayment of $102.8 million of credit facilities,
$22.4 million of mortgage payments, and repayment of $13.3 million in tax exempt bonds.

•Certain holders submitted their outstanding 4.00% Convertible Senior Notes due 2035 to
the Company for repurchase. As a result, we repurchased notes with a notional value of
$10.8 million, representing approximately 6.44% of the $167.8 million in aggregate
principal amount outstanding, and expensed $207,000 of unamortized financing costs during
the three months ended March 31, 2011. On March 2, 2011 the Company called the remaining
outstanding notes with a notional value of $156.9 million. The notes were redeemed on April
4, 2011 and unamortized financing costs of $3.0 million were written off.

•We issued $300 million aggregate principal amount of 4.250% senior unsecured notes due
June 2018 under our existing shelf registration statement. Interest is payable semiannually
beginning in December 2011. The notes were priced at 98.988% of the principal amount plus
accrued interest from May 23, 2011 to yield 4.419% to maturity. The notes are fully and
unconditionally guaranteed by the Operating Partnership.

•We repaid $97.1 million on the maturity of our 3.625% Convertible Senior Notes due
September 2011.

•We entered into a new $900 million unsecured revolving credit facility, replacing the
Company’s $600 million credit facility. The Operating Partnership issued a guarantee in
connection with the new facility, similar to the guarantee it issued under the prior
facility. The new credit facility has an initial term of four years and includes a one-year
extension option, and contains an accordion feature that allows the Company to increase the
facility to $1.35 billion. Based on the Company’s current credit ratings, the credit
facility carries an interest rate equal to LIBOR plus a spread of 122.5 basis points and a
facility fee of 22.5 basis points. In 2011, the Company had net borrowings of $389.3
million on its unsecured revolving credit facilities.

•In September 2009, the Company entered into an equity distribution agreement under which
the Company may offer and sell up to 15.0 million shares of its common stock over time to
or through its sales agents. During the year ended December 31, 2011, we sold 4,395,601
shares of common stock through an equity distribution agreement for aggregate gross
proceeds of approximately $104.5 million at a weighted average price per share of $23.78.
Aggregate net proceeds from such sales, after deducting related expenses, including
commissions paid to the sales agents of approximately $2.1 million, were approximately
$102.4 million, and such proceeds were used for general corporate purposes.

•We entered into a new equity distribution agreement under which the Company may offer
and sell up to 20.0 million shares of its common stock over time to or through its sales
agents. During the year ended December 31, 2011, we sold 11,849,079 shares of common stock
through this program (of which 419,048 shares were settled subsequent to December 31, 2011)
for aggregate gross proceeds of approximately $297.7 million at a weighted average price
per share of $25.12. Aggregate net proceeds from such sales, after deducting related
expenses, including commissions paid to the sales agents of approximately $6.0 million,
were approximately $291.7 million, and such proceeds were used for general corporate
purposes. In September 2011, the Company entered into a new equity distribution agreement
in connection with filing a new registration statement on Form S-3. The new equity
distribution agreement replaced the March 2011 agreement, and no material changes were made
to the equity distribution agreement. As of December 31, 2011 8,150,921 shares of common
stock may be sold under our equity distribution agreement.







•We closed on a public offering of 20,700,000 shares of our common stock, including
2,700,000 shares sold as a result of the underwriters’ exercise of their overallotment
option in full at the closing, at a price of $25.00 per share, for net proceeds of
approximately $496.3 million after underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated
offering expenses.

•We repurchased 141,200 shares of our 6.75% Series G Cumulative Redeemable Preferred
Stock for $3.6 million, which is $100,000 more than their liquidation value of $3.5
million.

Other than the following, there were no significant changes to the Operating Partnership’s
business during 2011 (the above 2011 highlights relate to UDR or other subsidiaries of UDR):

•The Operating Partnership acquired four operating communities with 1,833 homes located
in the New York, New York and Boston, Massachusetts markets for $761.2 million. In partial
consideration for the acquisition of two of these communities, 4,371,845 OP Units were
issued.

•The Operating Partnership issued a guarantee on $300 million of medium-term notes due
June 2018 issued by UDR.

•The Operating Partnership issued a guarantee in conjunction with a $900 million
unsecured revolving credit facility entered into by UDR. The facility replaced the General
Partner’s $600 million credit facility, which the Operating Partnership had previously
guaranteed.

Our Strategies and Vision

We previously announced our vision to be the innovative multifamily public real estate
investment trust of choice. We identified the following strategies to guide decision-making and
growth:

1.Strengthen quality of our portfolio2.Grow our cash flow to support dividend growth3.Increase our balance sheet strength and flexibility4.Great place to work and live

Strengthen quality of our Portfolio

We are focused on increasing our presence in markets with favorable job formation, low
single-family home affordability, and a favorable demand/supply ratio for multifamily housing.
Portfolio decisions consider internal analyses and third-party research, taking into account job
growth, multifamily permitting and housing affordability.

For the year ended December 31, 2011, approximately 50.9% of our same store net operating
income (“NOI”) was provided by our communities located in California, Metropolitan Washington,
D.C., Oregon and Washington state.





Grow our cash flow to support dividend growth

Acquisitions and Dispositions

During 2011, in conjunction with our strategy to strengthen our portfolio, we acquired eight
operating communities with 3,161 apartment homes for approximately $1.5 billion. Four of these
operating communities, representing 1,833 homes, were acquired by the Operating Partnership for
approximately $761.2 million.

When evaluating potential acquisitions, we consider:

•population growth, cost of alternative housing, overall potential for economic growth
and the tax and regulatory environment of the community in which the property is located;

•geographic location, including proximity to jobs, entertainment, transportation, and
our existing communities which can deliver significant economies of scale;

•construction quality, condition and design of the community;

•current and projected cash flow of the property and the ability to increase cash flow;

•potential for capital appreciation of the property;

•ability to increase the value and profitability of the property through operations and
redevelopment;

•terms of resident leases, including the potential for rent increases;

•occupancy and demand by residents for properties of a similar type in the vicinity;

•prospects for liquidity through sale, financing, or refinancing of the property; and

•competition from existing multifamily communities and the potential for the
construction of new multifamily properties in the area.

We regularly monitor our assets to increase the quality and performance of our portfolio.
Factors we consider in deciding whether to dispose of a property include:

•current market price for an asset compared to projected economics for that asset;

•potential increases in new construction in the market area;

•areas where the economy is not expected to grow substantially;

•markets where we do not intend to establish a long-term concentration; and

•operating efficiencies.

During 2011, we sold eighteen apartment home communities, of which eight communities were
owned by the Operating Partnership.

Redevelopment Activities

During 2011, we continued to redevelop properties in targeted markets where we concluded there
was an opportunity to add value. During the year ended December 31, 2011, we incurred $30.0 million
in major renovations, which include major structural changes and/or architectural revisions to
existing buildings.





Joint Venture Activities

Consolidated joint venture

In August 2011, the Company invested in a consolidated joint venture with an unaffiliated
third party to acquire and redevelop an existing commercial property into a 173-apartment home
community in Orange County, California. At closing the Company contributed $9.0 million and at
December 31, 2011, UDR owned a 90% controlling interest in the investment. Under the terms of the
operating agreement, our partner is required to achieve certain criteria as it relates to the
entitlement process. If the criteria are met on or before 730 days after the site plan application
is deemed complete by the city, the Company is obligated to contribute an additional $3.0 million
to the joint venture for distribution to our partner. At the acquisition date, the Company accrued
and capitalized $3.0 million related to the contingent consideration, which represents the
difference between fair value of the property of $9.8 million on the formation date and the
estimated fair value of the underlying property upon completion of the entitlement process of $12.8
million.

Unconsolidated joint ventures

In May 2011, the Company entered into a joint venture to develop a 263-home community in San
Diego, California. At December 31, 2011 and at closing, UDR owned a noncontrolling interest of 95%
in the joint venture. Our initial investment was $9.9 million and our investment at December 31,
2011 was $12.1 million.

In June 2011, one of our existing joint ventures (UDR/MetLife I) sold a parcel of land to a
joint venture, in which the Company is a partner, to develop a 256-home community in College Park,
Maryland. At December 31, 2011 and at closing, UDR owned a noncontrolling interest of 95% in the
joint venture. Our initial investment was $7.1 million and our investment at December 31, 2011 was
$8.6 million.

UDR is a partner with an unaffiliated third party, which formed a joint venture for the
investment of up to $450.0 million in multifamily properties located in key, high barrier to entry
markets such as Metropolitan Washington D.C. The partners will contribute equity of $180.0 million
of which the Company’s maximum equity will be 30% or $54.0 million when fully invested. In 2011,
the joint venture acquired two properties (509 homes). At December 31, 2011, the Company owned a
30% interest in the joint venture. Our investment at December 31, 2011 was $34.1 million.

For additional information regarding these and our other joint ventures, see Note 5,Joint
Venturesto the Consolidated Financial Statements of UDR, Inc. in this Report.

The Operating Partnership is not a party to any of the joint venture activities described
above.





Increase our balance sheet strength and flexibility

We maintain a capital structure that allows us to seek, and not just react to, opportunities
available in the marketplace. We have structured our borrowings to stagger our debt maturities and
to be able to opportunistically access both secured and unsecured debt.

Financing Activities

As part of our plan to strengthen our capital structure, we utilized proceeds from debt and
equity offerings and refinancings to extend maturities, pay down existing debt and acquire
apartment communities. The following is a summary of our major financing activities in 2011.

•We received proceeds of $30.7 million from secured debt financings. The $30.7 million
includes $25.7 million in variable rate mortgages and $5.0 million in fixed rate mortgages.

•We repaid $336.0 million of secured debt, which includes
$197.5 million of construction loans, repayment of $102.8 million of credit facilities,
$22.4 million of mortgage payments, and repayment of $13.3 million in tax exempt bonds.

•Certain holders submitted their outstanding 4.00% Convertible Senior Notes due 2035 to
us for repurchase. As a result, we repurchased notes with a notional value of $10.8
million, representing approximately 6.44% of the $167.8 million in aggregate principal
amount outstanding, and expensed $207,000 of unamortized financing costs during the three
months ended March 31, 2011. On March 2, 2011, the Company called the remaining outstanding
notes with a notional value of $156.9 million. The notes were redeemed on April 4, 2011 and
unamortized financing costs of $3.0 million were written off.

•In May 2011, we issued $300 million aggregate principal amount of 4.250% senior
unsecured notes due June 2018 under its existing shelf registration statement. Interest is
payable semiannually beginning in December 2011. The notes were priced at 98.988 % of the
principal amount plus accrued interest from May 23, 2011 to yield 4.419% to maturity. The
notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by the Operating Partnership.

•We repaid $97.1 million on our 3.625% Convertible Senior Notes due September 2011.

•In October 2011, we entered into a $900 million unsecured revolving credit facility,
replacing the Company’s $600 million credit facility. The Operating Partnership issued a
guarantee in connection with the new credit facility, similar to the guarantee it issued
under the prior facility. The new facility has an initial term of four years and includes a
one-year extension option, and contains an accordion feature that allows the Company to
increase the facility to $1.35 billion. Based on the Company’s current credit ratings, the
credit facility carries an interest rate equal to LIBOR plus a spread of 122.5 basis points
and a facility fee of 22.5 basis points. In 2011, the Company had net borrowings of $389.3
million on its unsecured revolving credit facilities.

•In September 2009, we entered into an equity distribution agreement under which we may
offer and sell up to 15.0 million shares of its common stock over time to or through its
sales agents. During the year ended December 31, 2011, we sold 4,395,601 shares of common
stock through an equity distribution agreement for aggregate gross proceeds of
approximately $104.5 million at a weighted average price per share of $23.78. Aggregate net
proceeds from such sales, after deducting related expenses, including commissions paid to
the sales agents of approximately $2.1 million, were approximately $102.4 million.

•In March 2011, we entered into a new equity distribution agreement under which we may
offer and sell up to 20.0 million shares of our common stock over time to or through its
sales agents. During the year ended December 31, 2011, we sold 11,849,079 shares of common
stock through this program (of which 419,048 shares were settled subsequent to December 31,
2011) for aggregate gross proceeds of approximately $297.7 million at a weighted average
price per share of $25.12. Aggregate net proceeds from such sales, after deducting related
expenses, including commissions paid to the sales agents of approximately $6.0 million,
were approximately $291.7 million. In September 2011, we entered into a new equity
distribution agreement in connection with filing a new registration statement on Form S-3.
The new equity distribution agreement replaced the March 2011 agreement, and no material
changes were made to the equity distribution agreement.

•In July 2011, we closed a public offering of 20,700,000 shares of its common stock,
including 2,700,000 shares sold as a result of the underwriters’ exercise of their
overallotment option in full at the closing, at a price of $25.00 per share, for net
proceeds of approximately $496.3 million after underwriting discounts and commissions and
estimated offering expenses.

•We repurchased 141,200 shares of our 6.75% Series G Cumulative Redeemable Preferred
Stock for $3.6 million, which was $100,000 more than their liquidation value of $3.5
million.

Great place to work and live

We continue to make progress on automating our business as a way to drive operating
efficiencies and to better meet the changing needs of our residents. Since its launch in January
2009, our residents have been utilizing the resident internet portal on our website. Our residents
have access to conduct business with us 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, to pay rent on line and to
submit service requests. In July 2010, we completed the roll out of online renewals throughout our
entire portfolio. As a result of transforming operations through technology, our residents get the
convenience they want, and our operating teams have become more efficient. These improvements in
adopting the web as a way to conduct business with us have also resulted in a decline in marketing
and advertising costs, improved cash management, and improved capabilities to better manage pricing
of our available apartment homes.

In 2011, UDR.com features and functionality were enhanced to increase user engagement and
increase lead volume year-over-year, such as, improved photography, enhancements to the online web
forms and improved layout of the individual UDR community homepages. In addition to improvements towww.udr.com, we also improved our suite of mobile and tablet devices on the iPhone, iPad
and Android platforms. These overall enhancements have contributed to increasing our web visitor
traffic to almost 3.1 million visitors (up 31%), almost 2.1 million organic search engine visitors
(up 38%), mobile traffic increased 112%, mobile leads generated increased 115% and mobile as a
percent of total web traffic was at 22% in Q4 2011. Overall, the UDR.com and mobile initiatives
contributed to a 17% year-over-year lead stream increase.





Operating Partnership Strategies and Vision

The Operating Partnership’s long-term strategic plan is to achieve greater operating
efficiencies by investing in fewer, more concentrated markets and
enhance resident and associate service through technology. As a result, the Operating
Partnership has sought to expand its interests in communities located in New York, New York; San
Francisco, California; Boston, Massachusetts; and Metropolitan D.C. markets over the past years.
Prospectively, we plan to continue to channel new investments into those markets we believe will
continue to provide the best investment returns. Markets will be targeted based upon defined
criteria including above average job growth, low single-family home affordability and limited new
supply for multifamily housing- three key drivers to strong rental growth.

Markets and Competitive Conditions

At December 31, 2011, 50.9% of our consolidated same store net operating income and 72.4% of
the Operating Partnership’s same store net operating income was generated from apartment homes
located in California, Metropolitan Washington D.C., Oregon, and Washington state. We believe that
this diversification increases investment opportunity and decreases the risk associated with
cyclical local real estate markets and economies, thereby increasing the stability and
predictability of our earnings.

Competition for new residents is generally intense across all of our markets. Some competing
communities offer features that our communities do not have. Competing communities can use
concessions or lower rents to obtain temporary competitive advantages. Also, some competing
communities are larger or newer than our communities. The competitive position of each community is
different depending upon many factors including sub-market supply and demand. In addition, other
real estate investors compete with us to acquire existing properties and to develop new properties.
These competitors include insurance companies, pension and investment funds, public and private
real estate companies, investment companies and other public and private apartment REITs, some of
which may have greater resources, or lower capital costs, than we do.

We believe that, in general, we are well-positioned to compete effectively for residents and
investments. We believe our competitive advantages include:

•a fully integrated organization with property management, development, redevelopment,
acquisition, marketing, sales and financing expertise;

•scalable operating and support systems, which include automated systems to meet the
changing electronic needs of our residents and to effectively focus on our Internet
marketing efforts;

•purchasing power;

•geographic diversification with a presence in 22 markets across the country; and

•significant presence in many of our major markets that allows us to be a local
operating expert.

Moving forward, we will continue to emphasize aggressive lease management, improved expense
control, increased resident retention efforts and the alignment of employee incentive plans tied to
our bottom line performance. We believe this plan of operation, coupled with the portfolio’s
strengths in targeting renters across a geographically diverse platform, should position us for
continued operational improvement in spite of the difficult economic environment.

Communities

At December 31, 2011, our apartment portfolio included 163 consolidated communities having a
total of 47,343 completed apartment homes and an additional 1,963 apartment homes under
development, which included the Operating Partnership’s apartment portfolio of 77 consolidated
communities having a total of 23,160 completed apartment homes. The overall quality of our
portfolio enables us to raise rents and to attract residents with higher levels of disposable
income who are more likely to absorb expenses, such as water and sewer costs, from the landlord to
the resident. In addition, it potentially reduces recurring capital expenditures per apartment
home, and therefore should result in increased cash flow in the future.

At
December 31, 2011, the Company is developing seven wholly-owned
communities with 2,108 apartment homes, 145 of which have been
completed.

At
December 31, 2011, the Company is redeveloping seven wholly-owned
communities with 3,123 apartment homes, 467 of which have been
completed.

Same Store Community Comparison

We believe that one pertinent quantitative measurement of the performance of our portfolio is
tracking the results of our same store community’s net operating income, which is total rental
revenue, less rental expenses excluding property management and other operating expenses. Our same
store community population are operating communities which we own and have stabilized occupancy,
revenues and expenses as of the beginning of the prior year.





For the year ended December 31, 2011, our same store NOI increased by $18.1 million or 5.6%
compared to the prior year. The increase in NOI for the 37,869 apartment homes which make up the
same store population was driven by an increase in rental rates and fee and reimbursement income,
partially offset by an increase in operating expenses and decreased occupancy.

For the year ended December 31, 2011, the Operating Partnership’s same store NOI increased by
$11.5 million or 6.2% compared to the prior year. The increase in NOI for the 19,194 apartment
homes which make up the same store population was driven by an increase in revenue rental rates,
partially offset by an increase in operating expenses and decreased occupancy.

Revenue growth in 2012 may be impacted by general adverse conditions affecting the economy,
reduced occupancy rates, increased rental concessions, increased bad debt and other factors which
may adversely impact our ability to increase rents.

Tax Matters

UDR has elected to be taxed as a REIT under the Code. To continue to qualify as a REIT, UDR
must continue to meet certain tests that, among other things, generally require that our assets
consist primarily of real estate assets, our income be derived primarily from real estate assets,
and that we distribute at least 90% of our REIT taxable income (other than net capital gains) to
our stockholders annually. Provided we maintain our qualification as a REIT, we generally will not
be subject to U.S. federal income taxes at the corporate level on our net income to the extent such
net income is distributed to our stockholders annually. Even if we continue to qualify as a REIT,
we will continue to be subject to certain federal, state and local taxes on our income and
property.

We may utilize taxable REIT subsidiaries to engage in activities that REITs may be prohibited
from performing, including the provision of management and other services to third parties and the
conduct of certain nonqualifying real estate transactions. Taxable REIT subsidiaries generally are
taxable as regular corporations and therefore are subject to federal, state and local income taxes.

The Operating Partnership intends to qualify as a partnership for federal income tax purposes.
As a partnership, the Operating Partnership generally is not a taxable entity and does not incur
federal income tax liability. However, any state or local revenue, excise or franchise taxes that
result from the operating activities of the Operating Partnership are incurred at the entity level.

Inflation

We believe that the direct effects of inflation on our operations have been immaterial. While
the impact of inflation primarily impacts our results through wage pressures, utilities and
material costs, substantially all of our leases are for a term of one year or less, which generally
enables us to compensate for any inflationary effects by increasing rents on our apartment homes.
Although an escalation in energy and food costs could have a negative impact on our residents and
their ability to absorb rent increases, we do not believe this has had a material impact on our
results for the year ended December 31, 2011.

Environmental Matters

Various environmental laws govern certain aspects of the ongoing operation of our communities.
Such environmental laws include those regulating the existence of asbestos-containing materials in
buildings, management of surfaces with lead-based paint (and notices to residents about the
lead-based paint), use of active underground petroleum storage tanks, and waste-management
activities. The failure to comply with such requirements could subject us to a government
enforcement action and/or claims for damages by a private party.

To date, compliance with federal, state and local environmental protection regulations has not
had a material effect on our capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position. We have a
property management plan for hazardous materials. As part of the plan, Phase I environmental site
investigations and reports have been completed for each property we acquire. In addition, all
proposed acquisitions are inspected prior to acquisition. The inspections are conducted by
qualified environmental consultants, and we review the issued report prior to the purchase or
development of any property. Nevertheless, it is possible that our environmental assessments will
not reveal all environmental liabilities, or that some material environmental liabilities exist of
which we are unaware. In some cases, we have abandoned otherwise economically attractive
acquisitions because the costs of removal or control of hazardous materials have been prohibitive
or we have been unwilling to accept the potential risks involved. We do not believe we will be
required to engage in any large-scale abatement at any of our properties. We believe that through
professional environmental inspections and testing for asbestos, lead paint and other hazardous
materials, coupled with a relatively conservative posture toward accepting known environmental
risk, we can minimize our exposure to potential liability associated with environmental hazards.





Federal legislation requires owners and landlords of residential housing constructed prior to
1978 to disclose to potential residents or purchasers of the communities any known lead paint
hazards and imposes treble damages for failure to provide such notification. In addition, lead
based paint in any of the communities may result in lead poisoning in children residing in that
community if chips or particles of such lead based paint are ingested, and we may be held liable
under state laws for any such injuries caused by ingestion of lead based paint by children living
at the communities.

We are unaware of any environmental hazards at any of our properties that individually or in
the aggregate may have a material adverse impact on our operations or financial position. We have
not been notified by any governmental authority, and we are not otherwise aware, of any material
non-compliance, liability, or claim relating to environmental liabilities in connection with any of
our properties. We do not believe that the cost of continued compliance with applicable
environmental laws and regulations will have a material adverse effect on us or our financial
condition or results of operations. Future environmental laws, regulations, or ordinances, however,
may require additional remediation of existing conditions that are not currently actionable. Also,
if more stringent requirements are imposed on us in the future, the costs of compliance could have
a material adverse effect on us and our financial condition.

Insurance

We carry comprehensive general liability coverage on our communities, with limits of liability
customary within the industry to insure against liability claims and related defense costs. We are
also insured, with limits of liability customary within the industry, against the risk of direct
physical damage in amounts necessary to reimburse us on a replacement cost basis for costs incurred
to repair or rebuild each property, including loss of rental income during the reconstruction
period.
