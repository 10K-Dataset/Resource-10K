Item 1. BUSINESS

General

UDR is a self administered real estate investment trust, or REIT, that owns, operates, acquires, renovates, develops, redevelops, and manages multifamily apartment communities generally located in high barrier-to-entry markets located throughout the United States. The high barrier-to-entry markets are characterized by limited land for new construction, difficult and lengthy entitlement processes, low single-family home affordability and strong employment growth potential. AtDecember 31, 2012, our consolidated apartment portfolio included145communities located in22markets, with a total of41,571completed apartment homes, which are held through our subsidiaries, including the Operating Partnership, and consolidated joint ventures. In addition, we have an ownership interest in39communities containing9,558apartment homes through unconsolidated joint ventures. AtDecember 31, 2012, the Company is developingeightwholly-owned communities with2,622apartment homes,76of which have been completed.

AtDecember 31, 2012, the Operating Partnership’s consolidated apartment portfolio included72communities located in19markets, with a total of21,660completed apartment homes. The Operating Partnership owns, operates, acquires, renovates, develops, redevelops, and manages multifamily apartment communities generally located in high barrier-to-entry markets located throughout the United States. During the year endedDecember 31, 2012, revenues of the Operating Partnership represented approximately54%of our total rental revenues.

UDR elected to be taxed as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, which we refer to in this Report as the “Code”. To continue to qualify as a REIT, we must continue to meet certain tests which, among other things, generally require that our assets consist primarily of real estate assets, our income be derived primarily from real estate assets, and that we distribute at least 90% of our REIT taxable income (other than our net capital gains) to our stockholders annually. As a qualified REIT, we generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income taxes at the corporate level on our net income to the extent we distribute such net income to our stockholders annually. In2012, we declared total distributions of$0.88per common share and paid dividends of$0.88per common share.

UDR was formed in 1972 as a Virginia corporation. In June 2003, we changed our state of incorporation from Virginia to Maryland. The Operating Partnership is the successor-in-interest to United Dominion Realty, L.P., a limited partnership formed under the laws of Virginia, which commenced operations in 1995. The Operating Partnership was redomiciled in 2004 as a Delaware limited partnership. Our corporate offices are located at 1745 Shea Center Drive, Suite 200, Highlands Ranch, Colorado and our telephone number is (720) 283-6120. Our website is located atwww.udr.com.

As ofFebruary 18, 2013, we had 1,551 full-time associates and 82 part-time associates, all of whom were employed by UDR.

Reporting Segments

We report in two segments: Same Communities and Non-Mature/Other Communities. Our Same Communities segment includes those communities acquired, developed, and stabilized prior toJanuary 1, 2011, and held as ofDecember 31, 2012. These communities were owned and had stabilized occupancy and operating expenses as of the beginning of the prior year, there is no plan to conduct substantial redevelopment activities, and the community is not classified as held for sale at year end. A community is considered to have stabilized occupancy once it achieves 90% occupancy for at least three consecutive months. Our Non-Mature/Other Communities segment includes those communities that were acquired or developed in2011or2012, sold properties, redevelopment properties, properties classified as real estate held for sale, consolidated joint venture properties, properties managed by third parties, and the non-apartment components of mixed use properties. For additional information regarding our operating segments, see Note 14 to UDR’s consolidated financial statements and Note 11 to the Operating Partnership’s consolidated financial statements.

Business Objectives

Our principal business objective is to maximize the economic returns of our apartment communities to provide our stockholders with the greatest possible total return and value. To achieve this objective, we intend to continue to pursue the following goals and strategies:

•own and operate apartments in high barrier-to-entry markets, which are characterized by limited land for new construction, difficult and lengthy entitlement processes, low single-family home affordability and strong employment growth potential, thus enhancing stability and predictability of returns to our stockholders;

•manage real estate cycles by taking an opportunistic approach to buying, selling, renovating, and developing apartment communities;

•empower site associates to manage our communities efficiently and effectively;

•measure and reward associates based on specific performance targets; and

At the acquisition date, the Company accrued and capitalized$3.0 millionrelated to the contingent consideration, which represented the difference between the fair value of the property of$9.8 millionon the formation date and the estimated fair value of the underlying property upon completion of the entitlement process of$12.8 million.

The Operating Partnership did not have any acquisitions during the year endedDecember 31, 2012.

When evaluating potential acquisitions, we consider:

•population growth, cost of alternative housing, overall potential for economic growth and the tax and regulatory










environment of the community in which the property is located;

•geographic location, including proximity to jobs, entertainment, transportation, and our existing communities which can deliver significant economies of scale;

•construction quality, condition and design of the community;

•current and projected cash flow of the property and the ability to increase cash flow;

•potential for capital appreciation of the property;

•ability to increase the value and profitability of the property through operations and redevelopment;

•high barrier-to-entry markets which are characterized by low single-family affordability and strong employment growth potential;

•terms of resident leases, including the potential for rent increases;

•occupancy and demand by residents for properties of a similar type in the vicinity;

•prospects for liquidity through sale, financing, or refinancing of the property; and

•competition from existing multifamily communities and the potential for the construction of new multifamily properties in the area.

During2012, we sold21communities (6,507apartment homes) for $609.4 million, recognizing a gain (before tax) of$260.4 million.Fourof these communities (1,314apartment homes) were owned by the Operating Partnership, and were sold for a gain of$51.1 million.

We regularly monitor our assets to increase the quality and performance of our portfolio. Factors we consider in deciding whether to dispose of a property include:

•current market price for an asset compared to projected economics for that asset;

•potential increases in new construction in the market area;

•areas with low job growth prospects;

•markets where we do not intend to establish a long-term concentration; and

•operating efficiencies.

Balance Sheet Management

We maintain a capital structure that we believe allows us to proactively source potential investment opportunities in the marketplace. We have structured our debt maturity schedule to be able to opportunistically access both secured and unsecured debt markets when appropriate.

Financing Activities

Operational Excellence, Cash Flow and Dividend Growth

Investment in new technologies continue to drive operating efficiencies in our business and help us to better meet the changing needs of our residents. Since its launch in January 2009, our residents have been utilizing our web-based resident internet portal on our website. Our residents have the ability to conduct business with us 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. In July 2010, we completed the roll out of online leasing renewals throughout our portfolio. As a result of transforming our operations through technology, resident’s satisfaction improved, and our operating teams have become more efficient. Web-based technologies have also resulted in declining marketing and advertising costs, improved cash management, and better pricing management of our available apartment homes.

In2012, UDR.com features and functionality were enhanced to increase a user’s engagement and search capability. Improvements included a new responsive website, new photography, enhancements to the online web forms and improved layout of the individual UDR community homepages. We also overhauled our mobile applications. These overall enhancements have increased our web visitor traffic year-over-year to almost 3.6 million visitors in 2012, up 16%, with mobile traffic at 1.1 million visitors, up 121%.










Portfolio Improvement

We are focused on increasing our presence in markets with favorable job formation, high propensity to rent, low single-family home affordability, and a favorable demand/supply ratio for multifamily housing. Portfolio investment decisions consider internal analyses and third-party research.

For the year endedDecember 31, 2012, approximately 63.3% of our same store net operating income (“NOI”) was generated by communities located in our core markets of: Seattle, Washington; San Francisco Bay Area, California; Los Angeles, California; Orange County, California; San Diego, California; Austin, Texas; Dallas, Texas; Boston, Massachusetts; Baltimore, Maryland; and Washington, D.C.

Operating Partnership Strategies and Vision

The Operating Partnership’s long-term strategic plan is to achieve greater operating efficiencies by investing in fewer, more concentrated markets and enhance resident and associate service through technology. As a result, the Operating Partnership has sought to expand its interests in communities located in New York, New York; San Francisco Bay Area, California; Boston, Massachusetts; and Washington D.C. markets over the past years. Prospectively, we plan to continue to channel new investments into those markets we believe will continue to provide the best investment returns. Markets will be targeted based upon defined criteria including above average job growth, low single-family home affordability and limited new supply for multifamily housing, which are three key drivers to strong rental growth.

Markets and Competitive Conditions

During the year endedDecember 31, 2012, 63.3% of our consolidated same store net operating income was generated from apartment homes located in our core markets of: Seattle, Washington; San Francisco Bay Area, California; Los Angeles, California; Orange County, California; San Diego, California; Austin, Texas; Dallas, Texas; Boston, Massachusetts; Baltimore, Maryland; and Washington, D.C. AtDecember 31, 2012, the Company held 71.4% of its carrying value of its real estate portfolio in our core markets. During the year endedDecember 31, 2012, 66.3% of the Operating Partnership’s same store net operating income was generated from apartment homes located in our core markets of: Seattle, Washington; San Francisco Bay Area, California; Los Angeles, California; Orange County, California; San Diego, California; Austin, Texas; Dallas, Texas; Baltimore, Maryland; and Washington, D.C. AtDecember 31, 2012, the Operating Partnership held 81.0% of its carrying value of its real estate portfolio in its core markets. We believe that this diversification increases investment opportunity and decreases the risk associated with cyclical local real estate markets and economies, thereby increasing the stability and predictability of our earnings.

Competition for new residents is generally intense across all of our markets. Some competing communities offer features that our communities do not have. Competing communities can use concessions or lower rents to obtain temporary competitive advantages. Also, some competing communities are larger or newer than our communities. The competitive position of each community is different depending upon many factors including sub-market supply and demand. In addition, other real estate investors compete with us to acquire existing properties and to develop new properties. These competitors include insurance companies, pension and investment funds, public and private real estate companies, investment companies and other public and private apartment REITs, some of which may have greater resources, or lower capital costs, than we do.

We believe that, in general, we are well-positioned to compete effectively for residents and investments. We believe our competitive advantages include:

•a fully integrated organization with property management, development, redevelopment, acquisition, marketing, sales and financing expertise;

•scalable operating and support systems, which include automated systems to meet the changing electronic needs of our residents and to effectively focus on our Internet marketing efforts;

•access to sources of capital;

•geographic diversification with a presence in 23 markets across the country; and

•significant presence in many of our major markets that allows us to be a local operating expert.

Moving forward, we will continue to optimize lease management, improve expense control, increase resident retention efforts and align employee incentive plans with our bottom line performance. We believe this plan of operation, coupled with the portfolio’s strengths in targeting renters across a geographically diverse platform, should position us for continued operational upside in spite of a weak economic environment.










Communities

AtDecember 31, 2012, our apartment portfolio included145consolidated communities having a total of41,571completed apartment homes and an additional2,622apartment homes under development, which included the Operating Partnership’s apartment portfolio of72consolidated communities having a total of21,660completed apartment homes. The overall quality of our portfolio enables us to raise rents and to attract residents with higher levels of disposable income who are more likely to absorb such rents.

AtDecember 31, 2012, the Company is developingeightwholly-owned communities with2,622apartment homes,76of which have been completed. Of these eight development communities, the Operating Partnership is developing two wholly-owned communities totaling 652 homes, none of which have been completed atDecember 31, 2012.

AtDecember 31, 2012, the Company is redevelopingfourwholly-owned communities with2,253apartment homes,602of which have been completed. Of these four redevelopment communities, the Operating Partnership is redeveloping two wholly-owned communities with 964 apartment homes, of which 121 have been completed atDecember 31, 2012.

Same Store Community Comparison

We believe that one pertinent quantitative measurement of the performance of our portfolio is tracking the results of our same store communities’ net operating income (“NOI”), which is total rental revenue, less rental expenses excluding property management and other operating expenses. Our same store community population are operating communities which we own and have stabilized occupancy, revenues and expenses as of the beginning of the prior year.

For the year endedDecember 31, 2012, our same store NOIincreasedby$21.6 millionor6.6%compared to the prior year. Theincreasein NOI for the33,823apartment homes, or70%of our portfolio, which make up the same store population was driven by an increase in rental rates, fee and reimbursement income, and increased occupancy, partially offset by an increase in operating expenses.

For the year endedDecember 31, 2012, the Operating Partnership’s same store NOIincreasedby$12.4 millionor6.5%compared to the prior year. Theincreasein NOI for the17,880apartment homes, or72%of the Operating Partnerships portfolio, which make up the same store population was driven by an increase in rental rates, and fee and reimbursement income, partially offset by an increase in operating expenses.

Revenue growth in 2013 may be impacted by general adverse conditions affecting the economy, reduced occupancy rates, increased rental concessions, increased bad debt and other factors which may adversely impact our ability to increase rents.

Tax Matters

UDR has elected to be taxed as a REIT under the Code. To continue to qualify as a REIT, UDR must continue to meet certain tests that, among other things, generally require that our assets consist primarily of real estate assets, our income be derived primarily from real estate assets, and that we distribute at least 90% of our REIT taxable income (other than net capital gains) to our stockholders annually. Provided we maintain our qualification as a REIT, we generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income taxes at the corporate level on our net income to the extent such net income is distributed to our stockholders annually. Even if we continue to qualify as a REIT, we will continue to be subject to certain federal, state and local taxes on our income and property.

We may utilize our TRS to engage in activities that REITs may be prohibited from performing, including the provision of management and other services to third parties and the conduct of certain nonqualifying real estate transactions. Our TRS generally is taxable as a regular corporation, and therefore, subject to federal, state and local income taxes.

The Operating Partnership intends to qualify as a partnership for federal income tax purposes. As a partnership, the Operating Partnership generally is not a taxable entity and does not incur federal income tax liability. However, any state or local revenue, excise or franchise taxes that result from the operating activities of the Operating Partnership are incurred at the entity level.

Inflation

We believe that the direct effects of inflation on our operations have been immaterial. While the impact of inflation primarily impacts our results through wage pressures, property taxes, utilities and material costs, substantially all of our leases are for a term of one year or less, which generally enables us to compensate for any inflationary effects by increasing rents on our apartment homes. Although an escalation in energy and food costs could have a negative impact on our residents and their










ability to absorb rent increases, we do not believe this has had a material impact on our results for the year endedDecember 31, 2012.

Environmental Matters

Various environmental laws govern certain aspects of the ongoing operation of our communities. Such environmental laws include those regulating the existence of asbestos-containing materials in buildings, management of surfaces with lead-based paint (and notices to residents about the lead-based paint), use of active underground petroleum storage tanks, and waste-management activities. The failure to comply with such requirements could subject us to a government enforcement action and/or claims for damages by a private party.

To date, compliance with federal, state and local environmental protection regulations has not had a material effect on our capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position. We have a property management plan for hazardous materials. As part of the plan, Phase I environmental site investigations and reports have been completed for each property we acquire. In addition, all proposed acquisitions are inspected prior to acquisition. The inspections are conducted by qualified environmental consultants, and we review the issued report prior to the purchase or development of any property. Nevertheless, it is possible that our environmental assessments will not reveal all environmental liabilities, or that some material environmental liabilities exist of which we are unaware. In some cases, we have abandoned otherwise economically attractive acquisitions because the costs of removal or control of hazardous materials have been prohibitive or we have been unwilling to accept the potential risks involved. We do not believe we will be required to engage in any large-scale abatement at any of our properties. We believe that through professional environmental inspections and testing for asbestos, lead paint and other hazardous materials, coupled with a relatively conservative posture toward accepting known environmental risk, we can minimize our exposure to potential liability associated with environmental hazards.

Federal legislation requires owners and landlords of residential housing constructed prior to 1978 to disclose to potential residents or purchasers of the communities any known lead paint hazards and imposes treble damages for failure to provide such notification. In addition, lead based paint in any of the communities may result in lead poisoning in children residing in that community if chips or particles of such lead based paint are ingested, and we may be held liable under state laws for any such injuries caused by ingestion of lead based paint by children living at the communities.

We are unaware of any environmental hazards at any of our properties that individually or in the aggregate may have a material adverse impact on our operations or financial position. We have not been notified by any governmental authority, and we are not otherwise aware, of any material non-compliance, liability, or claim relating to environmental liabilities in connection with any of our properties. We do not believe that the cost of continued compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations will have a material adverse effect on us or our financial condition or results of operations. Future environmental laws, regulations, or ordinances, however, may require additional remediation of existing conditions that are not currently actionable. Also, if more stringent requirements are imposed on us in the future, the costs of compliance could have a material adverse effect on us and our financial condition.

Insurance

We carry comprehensive general liability coverage on our communities, with limits of liability customary within the multi-family apartment industry to insure against liability claims and related defense costs. We are also insured, with limits of liability customary within the multi-family apartment industry, against the risk of direct physical damage in amounts necessary to reimburse us on a replacement cost basis for costs incurred to repair or rebuild each property, including loss of rental income during the reconstruction period.
