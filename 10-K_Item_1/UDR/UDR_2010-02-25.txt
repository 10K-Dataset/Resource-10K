Item 1.BUSINESS



General



UDR, Inc. is a self administered real estate investment trust,
    or REIT, that owns, acquires, renovates, develops, and manages
    apartment communities nationwide. At December 31, 2009, our
    consolidated apartment portfolio included 165 communities
    located in 23 markets, with a total of 45,913 completed
    apartment homes. In addition, we have an ownership interest in
    3,992 apartment homes through our unconsolidated joint ventures.



We have elected to be taxed as a REIT under the Internal Revenue
    Code of 1986, as amended, which we refer to in this Report as
    the “Code”. To continue to qualify as a REIT, we must
    continue to meet certain tests which, among other things,
    generally require that our assets consist primarily of real
    estate assets, our income be derived primarily from real estate
    assets, and that we distribute at least 90% of our REIT taxable
    income (other than our net capital gains) to our stockholders
    annually. As a qualified REIT, we generally will not be subject
    to U.S. federal income taxes at the corporate level on our
    net income to the extent we distribute such net income to our
    stockholders annually. In 2009, we declared total distributions
    of $0.845 per common share. Dividends paid in 2009 include a
    special dividend of $0.96 per common share that was declared in
    the fourth quarter of 2008 and paid to our common stockholders
    in the first quarter of 2009. Beginning with the dividend
    declared in the second quarter of 2009, we reduced the regularly
    declared quarterly dividend on our common stock to $0.18 per
    share in order to increase our retained capital.

We were formed in 1972 as a Virginia corporation. In June 2003,
    we changed our state of incorporation from Virginia to Maryland.
    Our corporate offices are located at 1745 Shea Center Drive,
    Suite 200, Highlands Ranch, Colorado. As of
    February 12, 2010, we had 1,280 full-time employees
    and 83 part-time employees.



Our subsidiaries include two operating partnerships, Heritage
    Communities L.P., a Delaware limited partnership, and United
    Dominion Realty L.P., a Delaware limited partnership, and RE3,
    our subsidiary that focuses on development, land entitlement and
    short-term hold investments. Unless the context otherwise
    requires, all references in this Report to “we,”
    “us,” “our,” “the Company,” or
    “UDR” refer collectively to UDR, Inc. its
    subsidiaries, and its consolidated joint ventures.



Business
    Objectives



Our principal business objective is to maximize the economic
    returns of our apartment communities to provide our stockholders
    with the greatest possible total return and value. To achieve
    this objective, we intend to continue to pursue the following
    goals and strategies:



•own and operate apartments in markets that have the best growth
    prospects based on favorable job formation and low home
    affordability, thus enhancing stability and predictability of
    returns to our stockholders;•manage real estate cycles by taking an opportunistic approach to
    buying, selling, renovating, and building apartment communities;•empower site associates to manage our communities efficiently
    and effectively;•measure and reward associates based on specific performance
    targets; and•manage our capital structure to help enhance predictability of
    earnings and dividends.







    Accomplishments





•Repaid $159.6 million of secured debt and
    $658.2 million of unsecured debt (represents the notional
    amount of debt repaid and excludes the gain on extinguishment).
    The $658.2 million of unsecured debt includes the
    prepayment of our $240 million term loan,
    $141.9 million for maturing medium-term notes and
    $276.3 million for the repurchase of unsecured debt. The
    unsecured debt repurchases includes the tender offer of
    $37.5 million in aggregate principle amount of our 8.50%,
    debentures due September 15, 2024 for $41.2 million of
    cash.



•We repurchased unsecured debt with a notional amount of
    $238.9 million for $222.3 million, which is included
    in the $658.2 million above, resulting in a gain on
    extinguishment of $9.8 million, net of deferred finance
    charges. The unsecured debt repurchased by the Company matured
    in 2009, 2011, 2013, 2024 and 2035.



•We closed on a $200 million secured credit facility. At
    December 31, 2009, $106.9 million of the amount drawn
    under the facility matures October 2019 and carries a fixed rate
    of 5.38% and $88.9 million of the amount drawn under the
    facility matures December 2019 and carries a fixed interest rate
    of 5.16%. The Company has one year from September 11, 2009
    to draw on the remaining $4.2 million of capacity.



•Initiated an “At the Market” equity distribution
    program pursuant to which we may sell up to 15 million
    shares of common stock from time to time to or through sales
    agents, by means of ordinary brokers’ transactions on the
    New York Stock Exchange at prevailing market prices at the time
    of sale, or as otherwise agreed with the applicable agent. As of
    December 31, 2009, the Company sold 4,460,032 shares
    of common stock under the program at an average price per share
    of $15.48, for aggregate gross proceeds of approximately
    $69.1 million. Aggregate net proceeds from such sales,
    after deducting commissions paid to the sales agents of
    approximately $1.4 million and related issuance costs of
    approximately $500,000, were approximately $67.2 million.



•We established a joint venture with Kuwait Finance House for the
    investment of up to $450.0 million in multifamily
    properties located in key, high barrier to entry markets.



•We acquired a newly constructed community with 289 units
    located in Dallas, Texas for approximately $28.5 million.



•We completed development on three wholly-owned communities with
    831 apartment homes at a total cost of $119.5 million.



UDR’s
    Strategies and Vision



UDR previously announced its vision to be the innovative
    multifamily public real estate investment of choice. We
    identified the following strategies to guide decision-making and
    growth:



1. Strengthen our portfolio



2. Continually improve operations



3. Maintain access to low-cost capital



Strengthen
    our Portfolio



UDR is focused on increasing its presence in markets with
    favorable job formation, low single-family home affordability,
    and a favorable demand/supply ratio for multifamily housing.
    Portfolio decisions consider third-party research, taking into
    account job growth, multifamily permitting and housing
    affordability.



In 2008, UDR sold a portfolio of properties in 86 communities
    for total consideration of approximately $1.7 billion. This
    portfolio sale dramatically accelerated our transformation to
    focus on markets that have the best growth prospects based on
    favorable job formation and low single-family home
    affordability. At





December 31, 2009, approximately 56.8% of the
    Company’s same store net operating income was provided by
    our communities located in California, Metropolitan
    Washington, D.C., Oregon and Washington State.



Acquisitions
    and Dispositions



During 2009, in conjunction with our strategy to strengthen our
    portfolio, UDR acquired a new constructed community with 289
    apartment homes for approximately $28.5 million. UDR
    targets apartment community acquisitions in markets where job
    growth expectations are favorable, single-family home
    affordability is low, and the demand/supply ratio for
    multi-family housing is favorable.



When evaluating potential acquisitions, we consider:



•population growth, cost of alternative housing, overall
    potential for economic growth and the tax and regulatory
    environment of the community in which the property is located;•geographic location, including proximity to jobs, entertainment,
    transportation, and our existing communities which can deliver
    significant economies of scale;•construction quality, condition and design of the community;•current and projected cash flow of the property and the ability
    to increase cash flow;•potential for capital appreciation of the property;•ability to increase the value and profitability of the property
    through upgrades and repositioning;•terms of resident leases, including the potential for rent
    increases;•occupancy and demand by residents for properties of a similar
    type in the vicinity;•prospects for liquidity through sale, financing, or refinancing
    of the property; and•competition from existing multifamily communities and the
    potential for the construction of new multifamily properties in
    the area.



We regularly monitor our assets to increase the quality and
    performance of our portfolio. Factors we consider in deciding
    whether to dispose of a property include:



•current market price for an asset compared to projected
    economics for that asset;•potential increases in new construction in the market area;•areas where the economy is not expected to grow
    substantially; and•markets where we do not intend to establish long-term
    concentration.



We did not have any dispositions of properties in 2009.

    acquisitions, apartment community dispositions, and our year-end

Redevelopment
    Activities



During 2009, we continued to reposition properties in targeted
    markets where we concluded there was an opportunity to add
    value. During the year ended December 31, 2009, we incurred
    $33.5 million in major renovations, which include major
    structural changesand/orarchitectural revisions to existing buildings.



Joint
    Venture Activities



The Company has an interest in a consolidated joint venture,
    which has the following project under development as of
    December 31, 2009 (amounts are based on 100% ownership
    interest):

(a)This represents cost incurred to date and does not include fair
    value and other-than-temporary decline in value adjustments.



On October 16, 2009, our partner in the joint venture,
    noted in the table above, resigned as managing member and
    appointed UDR as managing member. In addition, our partner
    relinquished its voting rights and approval rights and its
    ability to substantively participate in the decision-making
    process of the joint venture. As a result of UDR’s control
    of the joint venture, the Company is required to consolidate the
    joint venture. On December 30, 2009, UDR entered into an
    agreement with our partner to purchase its 49% interest in
    Elements Too for $3.2 million (outstanding at
    December 31, 2009). Upon the closing of the agreement, the
    Company’s equity interest in Elements Too will be 98%.



UDR is a partner with an unaffiliated third party in a joint
    venture (“989 Elements”) which owns and operates a
    23-story, 166 home high-rise apartment community in the central
    business district of Bellevue, Washington. At closing, UDR owned
    49% of the joint venture. Our initial investment was
    $11.8 million. On December 30, 2009, UDR entered into
    an agreement with our partner to purchase its 49% interest in
    989 Elements for $7.8 million (outstanding at
    December 31, 2009). Concurrently, our partner resigned as
    managing member and appointed UDR as managing member. In
    addition, our partner relinquished its voting rights and
    approval rights and its ability to substantively participate in
    the decision-making process of the joint venture. At closing,
    the Company’s equity interest in 989 Elements will increase
    to 98%.



UDR is a partner with an unaffiliated third party in a joint
    venture (“Bellevue Plaza”) which owns an operating
    retail site in Bellevue, Washington. The Company initially
    planned to develop a 430 home high rise





apartment building with ground floor retail on an existing
    operating retail center. However, during the year ended
    December 31, 2009, the joint venture decided to continue to
    operate the retail property as opposed to developing a high rise
    apartment building on the site. On December 30, 2009, UDR
    entered into an agreement with our partner to purchase its 49%
    interest in Bellevue Plaza for $5.2 million (outstanding at
    December 31, 2009). In addition, our partner resigned as
    managing member and appointed UDR as managing member. Concurrent
    with its resignation, our partner relinquished its voting rights
    and approval rights and its ability to substantively participate
    in the decision-making process of the joint venture. At closing,
    the Company’s equity interest in Bellevue Plaza will
    increase from 49% to 98%.



For additional information regarding these consolidated joint
    ventures, see Note 4 “Joint Ventures” to the
    Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Report.



During 2009, the Company established a joint venture with Kuwait
    Finance House for the investment of up to $450.0 million in
    multifamily properties located in key, high barrier to entry
    markets. The partners will contribute equity of
    $180.0 million of which the Company’s maximum equity
    contribution will be 30% or $54.0 million when fully
    invested. At closing, we owned 30% of the joint venture. Our
    investment at December 31, 2009 was $242,000. At
    December 31, 2009, the joint venture did not own any
    multi-family properties. The joint venture intends to be fully
    invested over a two year investment period, and the Company will
    receive asset and property management fees from the jont venture.



Continually
    Improve Operations



The Company continues to make progress on automating its
    business as a way to drive operating efficiencies and to better
    meet the changing needs of our residents. Since its launch in
    January 2009, UDR residents have been utilizing the resident
    internet portal on our website. UDR’s residents have access
    to conduct business with us 24 hours a day, 7 days a
    week to pay rent on line and to submit service requests. As a
    result of transforming operations through technology our
    residents get the convenience they want and our operating teams
    have become more efficient. These improvements in adopting the
    web as a way to conduct business with the Company have also
    resulted in a decline in marketing and advertising costs and
    improved cash management.



During 2009, UDR continually enhancedwww.udr.comand individual community websites through deploying an
    innovative customized room painter selection program, apartment
    floor selector application, and updating the websites source
    code to make the webpages load faster. In addition to
    improvements to UDR.com, we also added an augmented reality
    apartment search application, an iPhone apartment search
    application and soon to be released Android, BlackBerry and Palm
    Pre apartment search applications. These enhancements have
    increased overall web visitor traffic to over 1.9 million
    visitors and almost 1.2 million organic search engine
    visitors which contributed to a 78%year-over-yearlead stream increase.



Maintaining
    Access to Low-Cost Capital



We seek to maintain a capital structure that allows us to seek,
    and not just react to, opportunities available in the
    marketplace. We have structured our borrowings to stagger our
    debt maturities and to be able to opportunistically access both
    secured and unsecured debt.



Special
    Dividend



On November 5, 2008, our Board of Directors declared a
    dividend on a pre-adjusted basis of $1.29 per share (“the
    Special Dividend”). The Special Dividend was paid on
    January 29, 2009 to stockholders of record on
    December 9, 2008. The dividend represented the
    Company’s fourth quarter recurring distribution of $0.33
    per share and an additional special distribution of $0.96 per
    share due to taxable income arising from our dispositions
    occurring during the year. Subject to the Company’s right
    to pay the entire Special Dividend in cash, stockholders had the
    option to make an election to receive payment in cash or in
    shares, however, the aggregate amount of cash payable to
    stockholders, other than cash payable in lieu of fractional
    shares, would not be less than $44.0 million.

Financing
    Activities



As part of our plan to strengthen our capital structure, we
    utilized proceeds from debt and equity offerings and
    refinancings to extend maturities, pay down existing debt, and
    acquire apartment communities. The following is a summary of our
    major financing activities in 2009:





•Repaid $159.6 million of secured debt and
    $658.2 million of unsecured debt (represents the notional
    amount of debt repaid and excludes the gain on extinguishment).
    The $658.2 million of unsecured debt includes the
    prepayment of our $240 million term loan,
    $141.9 million for maturing medium-term notes and
    $276.3 million for the repurchase of unsecured debt. The
    unsecured debt repurchases includes the tender offer of
    $37.5 million in aggregate principle amount of our
    8.50% debentures due September 15, 2024 for
    $41.2 million of cash.



•Repurchased unsecured debt with a notional amount of
    $238.9 million for $222.3 million, which is included
    in the $658.2 million above, resulting in a gain on
    extinguishment of $9.8 million, net of deferred finance
    charges. The unsecured debt repurchased by the Company matured
    in 2009, 2011, 2013, 2024 and 2035.



•Closed on a $200 million secured credit facility. At
    December 31, 2009, $106.9 million of the amount drawn
    under the facility matures October 2019 and carries a fixed rate
    of 5.38% and $88.9 million of the amount drawn under the
    facility matures December 2019 and carries a fixed interest rate
    of 5.16%. The Company has one year from September 11, 2009
    to draw on the remaining $4.2 million of capacity.



•Repurchased 997,738 shares of our 6.75% Series G
    Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock for $21.5 million,
    less than their liquidation value of $24.9 million.



•Initiated an “At the Market” equity distribution
    program pursuant to which we may sell up to 15 million
    shares of common stock from time to time to or through sales
    agents, by means of ordinary brokers’ transactions on the
    New York Stock Exchange at prevailing market prices at the time
    of sale, or as otherwise agreed with the applicable agent. As of
    December 31, 2009, the Company sold 4,460,032 shares
    of common stock under the program at an average price per share
    of $15.48, resulting in gross proceeds of approximately
    $69.1 million. Aggregate net proceeds from such sales,
    after deducting commissions paid to the sales agents of
    approximately $1.4 million and related issuance costs of
    approximately $500,000, were approximately $67.2 million.



Markets
    and Competitive Conditions



At December 31, 2009, 56.8% of the Company’s same
    store net operating income was generated from apartment homes
    located in California, Metropolitan Washington D.C., Oregon, and
    Washington State. We





believe that this diversification increases investment
    opportunity and decreases the risk associated with cyclical
    local real estate markets and economies, thereby increasing the
    stability and predictability of our earnings.



Competition for new residents is generally intense across all of
    our markets. Some competing communities offer features that our
    communities do not have. Competing communities can use
    concessions or lower rents to obtain temporary competitive
    advantages. Also, some competing communities are larger or newer
    than our communities. The competitive position of each community
    is different depending upon many factors includingsub-marketsupply and demand. In addition, other real estate investors
    compete with us to acquire existing properties and to develop
    new properties. These competitors include insurance companies,
    pension and investment funds, public and private real estate
    companies, investment companies and other public and private
    apartment REITs, some of which may have greater resources, or
    lower capital costs, than we do.



We believe that, in general, we are well-positioned to compete
    effectively for residents and investments. We believe our
    competitive advantages include:



•a fully integrated organization with property management,
    development, redevelopment, acquisition, marketing, sales and
    financing expertise;•scalable operating and support systems, which include automated
    systems to meet the changing electronic needs of our residents
    and to effectively focus on our Internet marketing efforts;•purchasing power;•geographic diversification with a presence in 23 markets across
    the country; and•significant presence in many of our major markets that allows us
    to be a local operating expert.



Moving forward, we will continue to emphasize aggressive lease
    management, improved expense control, increased resident
    retention efforts and the alignment of employee incentive plans
    tied to our bottom line performance. We believe this plan of
    operation, coupled with the portfolio’s strengths in
    targeting renters across a geographically diverse platform,
    should position us for continued operational improvement in
    spite of the difficult economic environment.



Communities



At December 31, 2009, our apartment portfolio included 165
    consolidated communities having a total of 45,913 completed
    apartment homes and an additional 1,415 under development. The
    overall quality of our portfolio enables us to raise rents and
    to attract residents with higher levels of disposable income who
    are more likely to accept the transfer of expenses, such as
    water and sewer costs, from the landlord to the resident. In
    addition, it potentially reduces recurring capital expenditures
    per apartment home, and therefore should result in increased
    cash flow in the future.



Same
    Community Comparison



We believe that one pertinent qualitative measurement of the
    performance of our portfolio is tracking the results of our same
    store community’s net operating income (“NOI”),
    which is total rental revenue, less rental expenses excluding
    property management and other operating expenses. Our same store
    population are operating communities which we own and have
    stabilized occupancy, revenues and expenses as of the beginning
    of the prior year. For the year ended December 31, 2009,
    our same store NOI decreased by $6.6 million or 2.2%
    compared to the prior year. The decrease in NOI for the 33,166
    apartment homes which make up the same store population was
    driven by a decrease in revenue rental rates which was partially
    offset by increased occupancy and a decrease in expenses.



Revenue growth in 2010 may be impacted by general adverse
    conditions affecting the economy, reduced occupancy rates,
    increased rental concessions, increased bad debt and other
    factors which may adversely impact our ability to increase rents.





Tax
    Matters



We have elected to be taxed as a REIT under the Code. To
    continue to qualify as a REIT, we must continue to meet certain
    tests that, among other things, generally require that our
    assets consist primarily of real estate assets, our income be
    derived primarily from real estate assets, and that we
    distribute at least 90% of our REIT taxable income (other than
    net capital gains) to our stockholders annually. Provided we
    maintain our qualification as a REIT, we generally will not be
    subject to U.S. federal income taxes at the corporate level
    on our net income to the extent such net income is distributed
    to our stockholders annually. Even if we continue to qualify as
    a REIT, we will continue to be subject to certain federal, state
    and local taxes on our income and property.



We may utilize taxable REIT subsidiaries to engage in activities
    that REITs may be prohibited from performing, including the
    provision of management and other services to third parties and
    the conduct of certain nonqualifying real estate transactions.
    Taxable REIT subsidiaries generally are taxable as regular
    corporations and therefore are subject to federal, state and
    local income taxes.



Inflation



We believe that the direct effects of inflation on our
    operations have been immaterial. While the impact of inflation
    primarily impacts our results through wage pressures, utilities
    and material costs, substantially all of our leases are for a
    term of one year or less, which generally enables us to
    compensate for any inflationary effects by increasing rents on
    our apartment homes. Although an extreme escalation in energy
    and food costs could have a negative impact on our residents and
    their ability to absorb rent increases, we do not believe this
    has had a material impact on our results for the year ended
    December 31, 2009.



Environmental
    Matters



Various environmental laws govern certain aspects of the ongoing
    operation of our communities. Such environmental laws include
    those regulating the existence of asbestos-containing materials
    in buildings, management of surfaces with lead-based paint (and
    notices to residents about the lead-based paint), use of active
    underground petroleum storage tanks, and waste-management
    activities. The failure to comply with such requirements could
    subject us to a government enforcement actionand/orclaims for damages by a private party.





Federal legislation requires owners and landlords of residential
    housing constructed prior to 1978 to disclose to potential
    residents or purchasers of the communities any known lead paint
    hazards and imposes treble damages for failure to provide such
    notification. In addition, lead based paint in any of the
    communities may result in lead poisoning in children residing in
    that community if chips or particles of such lead based paint
    are ingested, and we may be held liable under state laws for any
    such injuries caused by ingestion of lead based paint by
    children living at the communities.



We are unaware of any environmental hazards at any of our
    properties that individually or in the aggregate may have a
    material adverse impact on our operations or financial position.
    We have not been





notified by any governmental authority, and we are not otherwise
    aware, of any material non-compliance, liability, or claim
    relating to environmental liabilities in connection with any of
    our properties. We do not believe that the cost of continued
    compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations
    will have a material adverse effect on us or our financial
