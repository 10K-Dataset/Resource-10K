Item 1.Business

Overview

We are a
leading global provider of investment decision support tools, including indices, portfolio risk and performance analytics and corporate governance products and services. Our products and services address multiple markets, asset classes and
geographies and are sold to a diverse client base including asset owners, such as pension funds, endowments, foundations, central banks, family offices and insurance companies; institutional and retail asset managers, such as managers of pension
assets, mutual funds, exchange traded funds (“ETFs”), hedge funds and private wealth; financial intermediaries, such as banks, broker-dealers, exchanges, custodians and investment consultants; and corporate clients. As of December 31,
2011, we had approximately 6,200 clients across 82 countries. We had offices in 30 cities in 20 countries to help serve our diverse client base, with approximately 54.4% of our revenue from clients in the Americas, 31.9% in Europe, the Middle East
and Africa (“EMEA”) and 13.7% in Asia and Australia, based on revenues for the year ended December 31, 2011. See “—Clients” below for an explanation of how we calculate our number of clients.

The Company consists of two industry leading businesses: the Performance and Risk business and the Governance business. Together, these
businesses offer what we believe is the most comprehensive suite of performance, risk management and corporate governance products and services available in our industry. See “—Company History and Acquisitions” below.

Our Performance and Risk business is a leading global provider of investment decision support tools, including equity indices, portfolio
risk and performance analytics, credit analytics and environmental, social and governance (“ESG”) products. Our Performance and Risk products are used in many areas of the investment process, including portfolio construction and
rebalancing, performance benchmarking and attribution, risk management and analysis, index-linked investment product creation, asset allocation, assessment of social responsibility, environmental stewardship and the effects of climate change on
investments, investment manager selection and investment research.







Our Governance business is a leading provider of corporate governance and specialized
financial research and analysis services to institutional investors and corporations around the world. Among other things, the Governance business facilitates the voting of proxies by institutional investors and provides in-depth research and
analysis to help inform voting decisions and identify issuer-specific risk. The Governance business offers both global equity security coverage and fully integrated products and services, including proxy voting, policy creation, research, vote
recommendations, vote execution, post-vote disclosure and reporting and analytical tools. Within a firewall designed to separate it from the rest of the Governance business, a unit of the Governance business also provides products and services to
corporate clients who may use those products and services to learn about and improve their governance and executive compensation practices.

Our principal sales model in both of our business segments is to license annual, recurring subscriptions to our products and services for use at specified locations, often by a given number of users or
for a certain volume of services, for an annual fee paid up front. For the year ended December 31, 2011, approximately $732.5 million, or 81.3%, of our revenues was attributable to annual, recurring subscriptions. An additional $136.0 million
of our revenues comes from clients who use our indices as the basis for index-linked investment products such as ETFs. We also derive revenues from certain institutional clients that use our indices as the basis for passively managed funds and
separate accounts. These clients commonly pay us a license fee for the use of our intellectual property based on the investment product’s assets. We generate a limited amount of our revenues from certain exchanges that use our indices as the
basis for futures and options contracts and pay us a license fee for the use of our intellectual property based on their volume of trades. We also receive revenues from one-time fees related to implementation, historical or customized reports,
advisory and consulting services, overages relating to proxy research and voting services, fees relating to recovery of securities class action settlements and from certain products and services that are designed for one-time usage.

Company History and Acquisitions

We were a pioneer in developing the market for global equity index products and began licensing our first equity index products in 1969. We were incorporated in Delaware in 1998 and until we became a
public company in November 2007 our only two shareholders were Morgan Stanley and Capital Group International, Inc. (“Capital Group International”).

In June 2004, we acquired Barra, Inc. (“Barra”), a provider of portfolio risk analytics tools that launched its first risk analytics products in 1975, broadening our product range beyond index
products.

In November 2007, we completed an initial public offering (“IPO”) of approximately 16.1 million
shares of our class A common stock. In connection with the IPO, we reclassified our outstanding common stock into shares of class A common stock and class B common stock and immediately following the IPO, Morgan Stanley and Capital Group
International held approximately 81.0 million and 2.9 million shares of our class B common stock, respectively. Morgan Stanley and Capital Group International converted and sold their remaining shares of our class B common stock in
subsequent registered secondary equity offerings from May 2008 through May 2009. Although we began the transition to an independent, stand-alone public company at the time of our IPO in November 2007, we became an independent, stand-alone public
company following the May 2009 secondary offering.

In June 2010, we acquired RiskMetrics, a leading provider of, among other
things, risk management and governance products and services, in a cash-and-stock transaction valued at approximately $1,572.4 million. In addition to its risk management products and services, RiskMetrics owned ISS, a pioneer in the development of
policy-based proxy voting recommendations. ISS expands our product and service offerings to include a fully-outsourced proxy research, voting and vote reporting service, and corporate governance products and services. RiskMetrics acquired the Center
for Financial Research and Analysis (“CFRA”), Innovest Strategic Value Advisors, Inc. (“Innovest”) and KLD Research and Analytics, Inc. (“KLD”) in August 2007, March 2009 and October 2009, respectively. The
acquisitions of these companies permits us to offer financial research and







analysis products that provide our clients with research reports and analytical tools covering many investment criteria that we believe have become increasingly important to investors, including
accounting and compensation practices, and environmental, social and governance products and services.

In July 2010, we
acquired Measurisk, LLC (“Measurisk”), a provider of risk transparency and risk measurement tools for hedge fund investors, to aid us in developing a broad platform and setting the standard for analyzing and reporting hedge fund risk in
response to our clients’ demands for increasing levels of transparency from their hedge fund managers.

Over the course
of more than 40 years, we believe our organization has accumulated an in-depth understanding of the investment process worldwide. Based on this wealth of knowledge, we have created and continue to develop, enhance and refine sophisticated tools to
meet the growing, complex and diverse needs of our clients’ investment and governance processes. Our models and methodologies are the intellectual foundation of our business and include the innovative algorithms, formulas and analytical and
quantitative techniques that we use, together with market data, to produce our products. Our long history has allowed us to build extensive databases of proprietary index, risk and governance data, as well as accumulate valuable historical market
data, which we believe would be difficult to replicate and which provides us with a substantial competitive advantage.

We have
grown significantly, organically and through acquisitions, such as those described above, with respect to our number of employees and revenues. As we have grown, we have increased our operations outside of the United States. We currently have
branches or subsidiaries located in the following countries: Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, China, France, Germany, Hungary, India, Italy, Japan, Mexico, the Philippines, Singapore, South Africa, South Korea, Switzerland, United Arab Emirates,
the U.K. and the U.S.

Business Segments, Products and Services

We divide our business operations into two segments: the Performance and Risk business and the Governance business. Business segment
revenue, segment income from operations and assets attributable to foreign and domestic operations are set forth in Note 14, “Segment Information,” of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, included herein.

Performance and Risk Business Segment







Index and ESG Products

Our MSCI-branded equity indices are designed to measure returns available to investors across a wide variety of markets (e.g.,
Europe, Japan or emerging markets), sizes (e.g., small capitalization or large capitalization), styles (e.g., growth or value) and industries (e.g., banks or media). Our MSCI ESG indices are designed to help clients incorporate
environmental, social and governance factors into their investment decisions. As of December 31, 2011, we calculated over 150,000 indices daily.

In addition to delivering our products directly to our clients, as of December 31, 2011, we also had more than 65 third-party financial information and analytics software providers that distribute
our various equity index products worldwide. The performance of our equity indices is also frequently referenced when selecting investment managers, assigning return benchmarks in mandates, comparing performance and providing market and academic
commentary. The performance of certain of our equity indices is reported on a daily basis in the financial media.

Our primary
index products are:



•MSCI Global Equity Indices. The MSCI Global Equity Indices are our flagship index products. They are designed to measure returns available to
global investors across a variety of public equity markets. As of December 31, 2011, the MSCI Global Equity Indices provide exhaustive equity market coverage for over 70 countries in our developed, emerging and frontier market categories, as
well as various regional and composite indices built from the component country indices, including MSCI EAFE (Europe, Australasia, and Far East), MSCI World, MSCI ACWI IMI (All Country World Investable Market Index) and MSCI Emerging Market Indices.
In addition, the MSCI Global Equity Indices include industry indices, thematic and strategy indices, value and growth style indices and large-, mid-, small- and micro-capitalization size segment indices.

We believe that the MSCI Global Equity Indices are the most widely used benchmarks for cross-border equity funds. We
continue to enhance and expand this successful product offering. Recently, various pension plans have announced their adoption of our broad equity index, MSCI ACWI IMI, as the policy benchmark for their equities portfolios. We have also recently
introduced several new indices into our Risk Premia family, such as our award winning Risk Weighted index, and additional Value Weighted indices. Other new index launches include the MSCI EM 50 Index and other regional indices such as Overseas China
and Andean region, as well as new depository receipt indices, and a US tax exempt index series.



•MSCI US Equity Indices. The MSCI US Equity Indices are designed to reflect the full breadth of investment opportunities within the US equity
markets. The MSCI US Equity Indices include value and growth style indices, large-, mid-, small- and micro-capitalization size segment indices and sectors/industries indices.



•MSCI Custom Indices. Over the years we have significantly expanded our capabilities to calculate custom indices. We currently calculate
approximately 5,500 custom indices, which apply a client’s customization criteria to an existing MSCI index. Examples of customization criteria include currency, hedging, stock exclusions or special weighting. Custom indices can reflect
specific investment criteria, such as socially responsible investment requirements or regulatory constraints, and can be used for back-testing a strategy or developing a specialized investment product, minimizing portfolio tracking error and
constructing index-linked products.



•MSCI ESG Indices. The MSCI ESG Indices allow clients to more effectively benchmark ESG investment performance and manage, measure and report on
their compliance with ESG mandates, as well as to issue index-based ESG investment products. The MSCI ESG Indices include sustainability indices, indices that take into account certain values, norms or ethical standards, environmental-themed indices
such as alternative energy or clean technology and custom indices based on clients’ unique ESG requirements.







•Global Industry Classification Standard (GICS®). GICS was developed and is maintained jointly by MSCI and Standard & Poor’s Financial Services, LLC (a subsidiary of The McGraw-Hill Companies,
Inc.) (“Standard & Poor’s”). We designed this classification system to respond to our clients’ needs for a consistent, accurate and complete framework for classifying companies into industries. GICS has been widely
accepted as an industry analysis framework for investment research, portfolio management and asset allocation. Our equity index products classify constituent securities according to GICS.

We also offer GICS Direct, a joint product of MSCI and Standards & Poor’s. GICS Direct is a database of more
than 42,000 active companies and over 47,000 securities classified by sector, industry group, industry and sub-industry in accordance with proprietary GICS methodology.



•MSCI ESG Products. MSCI ESG products and services help investors integrate ESG factors into their investment decisions. Investors integrate ESG
factors to better understand investment risk and opportunities and/or to align investment with a set of ESG values.

MSCI ESG products include research, screening and modeling tools that allow institutional investors and asset managers to: align investments with a set of ESG values such as perceptions of certain
business activities, religious views or international norms; generate buy/restricted lists of companies that meet those criteria; understand the implications of restrictions on portfolios; and examine company specific profiles.

MSCI ESG products also provide ESG ratings and analysis on thousands of companies worldwide. These sector based research
reports are designed to identify and analyze key ESG issues for the sector, which may include the intersection of a corporations’ major social and environmental impacts with its core business operations, thereby identifying potential risks and
opportunities for the company and its investors.

Risk Management Analytics Products

Our risk management analytics products offer a consistent risk assessment framework for managing and monitoring investments in a variety
of asset classes across an organization. The products are based on our proprietary integrated fundamental multi-factor risk models, value-at-risk methodologies and asset valuation models. They enable clients to identify, monitor, report and manage
potential market risks from equities, fixed income, derivatives contracts and alternative investments, and to analyze portfolios and systematically analyze risk and return across multiple asset classes, including equities, bonds, commodities,
foreign exchange, futures, options, derivatives, structured products, interest-rate products and credit products. Using these tools, clients can identify the drivers of market and credit risk across their investments, produce daily risk reports, run
pre-trade analysis, perform what-if stress-tests and simulation analysis and optimizations, evaluate and monitor multiple asset managers and investment teams and access correlations across a group of selected assets or portfolios.

We have two major products in this area, BarraOne and RiskManager:



•BarraOne. BarraOne, powered by the Barra Integrated Model, provides clients with global, multi-asset class risk analysis using Barra fundamental
factor technology. BarraOne also includes VaR simulation, stress testing, optimization and performance attribution modules that enable clients to manage multi-asset class portfolios, carry out risk allocation budgeting, manager monitoring,
performance attribution and regulatory risk reporting. The product is accessed by clients via a secure, interactive web-based session, web services or on an outsourced basis.



•RiskManager. RiskManager is an industry leader in VaR simulation and stress testing. Clients use RiskManager for daily analyzing, measuring and
monitoring of market risk at fund and firm level, for sensitivity and stress testing, and for interactive what-if analysis. RiskManager is a highly scalable platform accessed by clients via a license to a secure, interactive web-based application
service, as an outsourced risk reporting service or as a web service in which a client’s systems access RiskMetrics core risk elements by connecting directly to our systems. RiskManager includes, among other modules,







the CounterParty Risk Reporting module that provides clients with counterparty exposures and is offered as either a web service or a managed service in which our staff oversee the production of
CounterParty Risk reports on behalf of our clients.

In addition, we offer:



•Hedge Fund Risk Transparency Solutions. HedgePlatform, a reporting service, and InterSight, an interactive web-based reporting service, allow
clients that invest in hedge funds, including funds of funds, pension funds and endowments, to measure, evaluate and monitor the risk of their hedge fund investments across multiple hedge fund strategies. We collect position-level information from
hedge funds on a monthly basis and provide our clients with a risk report for each individual hedge fund in which they invest as well as an aggregate risk report for their overall portfolio of hedge funds. Our clients who use RiskManager to measure
the risk of their own holdings can further integrate the positions collected via our HedgePlatform and InterSight services to allow computation of risk across their entire portfolio, while the confidential and proprietary nature of the underlying
hedge fund holdings is maintained. HedgePlatform and InterSight reports include statistics such as exposure (long, short, net and gross), sensitivities, scenario analysis, stress tests and VaR analysis.



•DataMetrics.DataMetrics is a data service that allows clients to access the market data embedded in RiskManager for use in their own
proprietary or other third-party systems. In addition to direct access to market data time series, DataMetrics can provide clients with customized data processing services.



•WealthBench.WealthBench is an investment planning platform for private banks, financial advisors, brokerages and trust companies. WealthBench
assists users in delivering informed, tailored investment planning proposals for high net worth individuals reflecting their needs, goals and risk tolerances while remaining consistent with firm-driven investment and risk-based policies. WealthBench
incorporates robust analytics, market-consistent inputs and transparent methodologies.



•CreditManager. Our CreditManager product is a portfolio credit risk management system used primarily by banks to calculate economic capital and
credit scores, facilitate risk-based pricing and measure risk concentrations. The application is designed to consolidate and compare risks and opportunities across multiple credit exposures including bonds, credit derivatives and traditional
lending.

Portfolio Management Analytics Products

Our Barra-branded equity portfolio management analytics products are designed to assist investment professionals in analyzing and managing
risks and returns for equities at both the asset and portfolio level in developed, emerging and frontier equity markets. Barra equity models identify and analyze the factors that influence equity asset returns and risk. Our most widely used Barra
equity products utilize our fundamental multi-factor equity risk model data to help our clients construct, analyze, optimize and manage portfolios. Our multi-factor models identify common factors that influence stock price movements, such as
industry and style characteristics, based on market and fundamental data. The proprietary risk data available in our products identifies an asset’s or a portfolio’s sensitivities to these common factors.

Our global equity models include the following:



•Barra Global Equity Model (“GEM3”). GEM3 is a multi-factor risk model designed for use in global equity portfolio management and
construction. It uses a set of factors that explain the sources of global equity risk and returns.



•Barra Integrated Model (“BIM”).BIM provides a detailed view of risk across markets and asset classes, including currencies, equities,
fixed income assets, commodities, mutual fund assets and hedge fund assets. It begins by identifying the factors that affect the returns of equity and fixed income securities and currencies in each individual country or market. These factors are
then combined into a single global model that can forecast the risk of multi-asset class, global portfolios.







Our single country and regional risk models include the following:



•Barra Single Country Equity Models.Our single country equity models identify a set of factors to explain sources of risk and return of
portfolios in that country. Examples include the Barra US Equity Model (“USE4”) which models risk for U.S. equity assets and portfolios and the Barra UK Equity Model (“UKE7”) which models risk for United Kingdom equity assets and
portfolios.



•Barra Regional Equity Models. We produce two regional equity models, the Europe Equity Model (“EUE3”) and the Asia-Pacific Equity
Model (“ASE1”). These models are designed to be used across a broad range of applications and are available in different versions to reflect local and regional commonalities, as well as short-term and long-term investment horizons. The
EUE3 model covers approximately 16,200 stocks in 29 markets, including many emerging and frontier markets in Eastern Europe. The ASE1 model covers approximately 29,000 stocks in 15 markets, including emerging and frontier markets in the region.

When assigning investment mandates to asset managers, institutional asset owners often prescribe investment
restrictions for portfolio risk and tracking error that are measured, reported and monitored using Barra products. Our clients can use our portfolio analytics by installing our proprietary software applications and equity risk data in their
technology platforms, by accessing our software applications and risk data via the Internet, by integrating our equity risk data into their own applications or through third-party applications, like those provided by FactSet Research Systems Inc.
(“FactSet”), which have incorporated our equity risk data and analytics into their offerings.

Our primary portfolio
analytics products are:



•Barra Aegis. Barra Aegis is our flagship equity risk management and analytics system. It is a sophisticated software application for equity risk
management and portfolio analysis that is powered by our proprietary equity risk data. It is deployed by the client as a desktop application. Barra Aegis is an integrated suite of equity investment analytics modules, specifically designed to help
clients actively manage their equity risk against their expected returns. It also enables clients to construct optimized portfolios based on client-specified expectations and constraints.

Barra Aegis also provides a factor-based performance attribution module which allows clients to analyze realized returns
relative to risk factors by sectors, styles, currencies and regions. Barra Aegis’s tools also help clients identify returns attributable to stock selection skills. Additionally, using Barra Aegis’s advanced automation tools, clients can
back-test their portfolio construction strategies over time.



•Barra Portfolio Manager. Barra Portfolio Manager is an integrated risk and performance platform that is designed to help fund managers and their
teams gain additional portfolio insight, manage a more systematic investment process and make faster, more informed investment decisions. The hosted interactive user interface allows users to analyze risk and return, monitor portfolios and
conduct pre-trade what-if analysis across a number of scenarios. The platform supports optional data management services that allow users to outsource the loading and reconciliation of their portfolio and other proprietary data.



•Barra Equity Models Direct. Barra Equity Models Direct delivers our proprietary risk data to clients for integration into their own software
applications. The proprietary risk data in Barra Equity Models Direct is also available via third-party providers. We offer the proprietary risk data from global, regional and single country Barra risk models and most of these models are available
in short-term and long-term time horizons so that clients can select the risk data that best suits their investment processes.



•Barra Cosmos. Barra Cosmos enables global fixed income portfolio managers to manage risk and optimize return in a multi-currency, global bond
portfolio. This adaptable product integrates specific bond, derivative and currency strategies to reflect each user’s investment style, while monitoring the overall risk exposure of the portfolio. Barra Cosmos is deployed by the client as a
desktop application.







Energy and Commodity Analytics Products

Our Energy and Commodity Analytics products are software applications that offer a variety of quantitative analytics tools for valuing,
modeling and facilitating the hedging of physical assets and derivatives across a number of market segments including energy and commodity assets. These products are used by investors, traders and those hedging investments in these asset classes.

in sales for these products and services during fiscal year 2011. During fiscal year 2011, revenues related to our ISS Corporate Services products and services represented approximately 21.2% of our Governance business total revenues.

Growth Strategy

We have experienced growth in recent years with operating revenues and operating income increasing by 35.9% and 56.2%, respectively, for
the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to the year ended November 30, 2010, and by 49.7% and 36.5%, respectively, for the year ended November 30, 2010 compared to the year ended November 30, 2009. Excluding the impact of the
RiskMetrics and Measurisk acquisitions, our operating revenues and operating income increased by 13.4% and 26.7%, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to the year ended November 30, 2010.

We believe we are well-positioned for significant growth over time and have a multi-faceted growth strategy that builds on our strong
client relationships, products, brands and integral role in the investment and governance process. Set forth below are the principal elements of our strategy to grow our Company and meet the increasing needs of our clients for investment decision
support tools:



•Client Growth. We believe there are significant opportunities to increase the number of users and locations and the number of products we
license to existing client organizations, and to obtain new clients in both existing and new geographic markets and client types worldwide. We intend to:



•Increase product subscriptions and users within our current client base.Many of our clients use only one or a limited number of our products,
and we believe there are opportunities to cross-sell our other investment decision support tools as we have expanded our suite of equity index, ESG, risk, governance and research products. For example, we will continue to seek opportunities to sell







risk and portfolio analytics products to our existing index-only clients. In addition, we will continue to focus on adding new users, new locations and new modules for current products with
existing clients.



•Expand client base in current client types.We seek to add new clients by leveraging our brand strength, our products, our broad access to the
global investment community and our strong knowledge of the investment and governance processes. This includes client types in which we already have a strong penetration for our flagship global equity index, risk management analytics, portfolio
analytics and governance products.



•Increase licensing of indices for ETFs. We believe that there is potential for continued growth and expansion in the ETF market in the future
and we will continue to increase licensing of our indices for index-linked investment products to capitalize on their growth in number and variety. The table below illustrates the growth trend with respect to the number of primary exchange listings
of ETFs linked to MSCI equity indices.

•Product Growth. We plan to develop new product offerings and continue to enhance our existing products through internal product development.



•Create innovative new product offerings and enhancements.In order to maintain and enhance our leadership position, we plan to introduce
innovative new products and enhancements to existing products. We believe that the integration of product platforms, development of new models, expansion of the global coverage of current models, enhanced client customization capabilities, increased
data collection and the introduction of new governance products will increase the competitiveness of our Company. We also maintain an active dialogue with our clients in order to understand their needs and anticipate market developments.



•Expand our capacity to design and produce new products. We intend to increase our spending on product development teams, new model research,
data production systems and software application design to enable us to design and produce new products more quickly and cost-effectively. Increasing our ability to process additional models and data, and design and code software applications more
effectively, will allow us to respond faster to client needs and bring new products and product enhancements to the market more quickly.



•Growth through acquisitions. We intend to continue to seek to acquire products, technologies and companies that will enhance, complement or
expand our product offerings and client base, as well as increase our ability to provide investment decision support tools to equity, fixed income and multi-asset class investment institutions.







Competitive Advantages

We believe our competitive advantages include the following:



•Strong client relationships and deep understanding of their needs.Our consultative approach to product development, dedication to client
support and our range of products have helped us build strong relationships with investment institutions around the world. We believe the skills, knowledge and experience of our research, software engineering, data management and production and
product management teams enable us to develop and enhance our models, methodologies, data and software applications in accordance with client demands and needs. We consult with our clients and other market participants during the product development
and construction process to take into account their actual investment process requirements.



•Client reliance on our products. Many of our clients have come to rely on our products in their investment management processes, integrating our
products into their performance measurement and risk management processes, where they become an integral part of their daily portfolio management functions. In certain cases, our clients are requested by their customers to report using our tools or
data. Consequently, we believe that certain of our clients may experience business disruption and additional costs if they choose to cease using or replace our products.



•Strong brand recognition. Our Global Equity Indices and ESG products and services are marketed under the MSCI and MSCI ESG brands; our portfolio
risk and performance analytics covering global equity and fixed income are marketed under the Barra brand; our multi-asset class, market and credit risk analytics are marketed under the RiskMetrics, Barra and Measurisk brands, respectively; our
energy and commodity asset valuation analytics are marketed under the FEA brand; and our corporate governance products and services are marketed under the ISS brand. These brands are well-established and recognized throughout the investment
community worldwide. Our brand strength reflects the longstanding quality and widespread use of our products. We believe our products are well-positioned to be the tools of choice for investment institutions increasingly looking to third-party
products and services for help with benchmarking, index-linked product creation and portfolio risk management and for corporate clients for help with governance efforts.



•Sophisticated models with practical application. We have invested significant time and resources for more than three decades in developing
highly sophisticated and practical index methodologies and risk models that combine financial theory and investment practice. We enhance our existing models to reflect the evolution of markets and to incorporate methodological advances in risk
forecasting. New models and major enhancements to existing models are reviewed by our model review committee.



•Open architecture and transparency. We have an open architecture philosophy. Clients can access our data through our software applications,
third-party applications or their own applications. We also recognize that the marketplace is complex and that a competitor in one context may be a supplier or distributor in another context. For example, Standard & Poor’s competes
with us in index products, supplies index data that we distribute in our portfolio analytics software products and jointly developed and maintains GICS and GICS Direct with us. In order to provide transparency, we document and disclose many
details of our models and methodologies to our clients so that they can better understand and utilize the tools we offer. We strongly believe this open architecture approach benefits us and our clients.



•Scalable application platforms. We continue to make significant investments in our data centers and software services to provide highly scalable
solutions for the processing of large volumes of assets/portfolios. In doing so, we are able to offer clients computing grid capacity that they would otherwise not be able to economically access through internal development.



•Global products and operations. Our products cover most major investment markets throughout the world. For example, our MSCI Global Equity
Indices provide exhaustive equity market coverage for over 70 countries in our developed, emerging and frontier market categories; and we produced equity







risk data for single country models, regional equity models and an integrated multi-asset class risk model covering equity and fixed income markets. As of December 31, 2011 our clients were
located in 82 countries and many of them have a presence in multiple locations around the world. As of December 31, 2011, our employees were located in 20 countries in order to maintain close contact with our clients and the international
markets we follow and to maintain an appropriate cost structure. We believe our global presence and focus allow us to serve our clients well and capitalize on a great number of business opportunities in many countries and regions of the world.



•Highly skilled employees. Our workforce is highly skilled, technical and, in some instances, specialized. In particular, our research and
software application development departments include experts in advanced mathematics, statistics, finance, portfolio investment and software engineering, who combine strong academic credentials with market experience. Our employees’ experience
and knowledge gives us access to, and allows us to add value at, the highest levels of our clients’ organizations.



•Extensive historical databases. We have accumulated comprehensive databases of historical global market data, proprietary equity index and risk
data and governance data. We believe our substantial and valuable databases of proprietary index and risk data, including over 40 years of certain index data history, over 30 years of certain risk data history and over 15 years of certain historical
governance data, would be difficult and costly for another party to replicate. The information is not available from any single source and would require intensive data checking and quality assurance testing that we have performed over our many years
of accumulating this data. Historical data is a critical component of our clients’ investment processes, allowing them to research and back-test investment strategies and analyze portfolios over many investment and business cycles and under a
variety of historical situations and market environments.

Clients

Revenues from our ten largest clients contributed a total of 25.8%, 27.4% and 27.3% of our
total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2011 and November 30, 2010 and 2009, respectively.

In the
years ended December 31, 2011 and November 30, 2010 and 2009, our largest client organization by revenue, BlackRock and its affiliates (“BlackRock”), accounted for 8.1%, 9.9% and 9.9% of our operating revenues, respectively. For
the years ended December 31, 2011 and November 30, 2010 and 2009, approximately 83.9%, 82.9% and 87.5% of our revenues from BlackRock were attributable to fees based on the assets of ETFs linked to MSCI equity indices, including its
iShares ETF business.







Marketing

We market our products to investment institutions, financial service providers and corporations worldwide. See “—Clients” above. Our research and product management teams seek to understand
our clients’ investment and governance process and their needs and to design tools that help clients effectively and efficiently address them. Because of the sophisticated nature of our products, our main means of marketing is through
face-to-face meetings, hosted events, targeted campaigns and 24-hour client support, as described in “—Sales and Client Support” below. These marketing and support efforts are supplemented by our website, our email newsletters, our
client events, our participation in industry conferences, our ongoing product consultations and research papers, and our public relations efforts.

Members of our research team and other employees regularly speak at industry conferences, as well as at our own seminars. We hosted over 180 seminars, webinars, conferences and workshops in various
locations across the globe in fiscal 2011. These seminars, webinars, conferences and workshops bring our staff and our clients together, expose those clients to our latest research and product enhancements and give our staff an opportunity to gain
insight into our clients’ needs. Our marketing communications professionals also arrange interviews for our sales people in prominent industry journals and issue press releases on product developments and releases. We also communicate directly
with both clients and prospective clients through our email newsletters which deliver research, company news and product specific news to currently over 60,000 recipients who have opted to receive them. Our strategic marketing department
collaborates with our product specialists to analyze our clients’ use of our products and to analyze the competitive landscape for our products.

Sales and Client Support

As of December 31, 2011, our client coverage
offices included 200 sales people and over 250 client support people worldwide. Of these, over 95 were located in our New York offices and 80 were located in our London office. In the last few years we have expanded our sales efforts to grow
our revenues and our client service efforts to ensure client satisfaction and develop client loyalty. We have expanded our geographic presence by opening client coverage offices in Budapest, Dubai, Mumbai, Seoul, Shanghai, Monterrey, Mexico,
Boston and Chicago. We have also created more specialized sales and client support teams to increase our impact in each client segment, namely hedge funds, asset owners and broker dealers. Our sales and client support staff are based in 28
offices around the world enabling us to provide valuable face-to-face client service and focus efforts on developing new clients in more locations.

The sophisticated nature of our products and their uses demands a sales and client support staff with strong academic and financial backgrounds. Most new sales require several face-to-face meetings
with the prospective client and the sales process for large and complex sales is likely to involve a team from sales, client support, product management and research. For Barra and RiskMetrics-branded products, sales and client support
personnel are available to onboard new clients and new users, which includes, providing intensive on-site training in the use of the models, data and software applications underlying each product. Client support also provides ongoing support, which
may include on-site visits, telephone and e-mail support 24 hours, five days a week and routine client support needed in connection with the use of the product or how it can help investors improve their process, all of which are included in the
recurring subscription fee. We believe that the size, quality, knowledge and experience of our sales and client support staff, as well as their proximity to clients, differentiate us from our competitors.

Product Development and Production

We take a coordinated team approach to product development and production. Our product management, research, data operations and technology and software engineering departments are at the center of this
process. Despite the challenging market environment, we remained committed to our product development and production efforts and, in some cases, increased these efforts.







Utilizing a deep understanding of the investment process worldwide, our research department
develops, reviews and enhances our various methodologies and models. Our global data operations and technology team designs and manages our processes and systems for market data procurement, proprietary data production and quality control. Our
software engineering team builds our sophisticated software applications. As part of our product development process, we also frequently undertake extensive consultations with our clients and other market participants to understand their specific
needs and investment process requirements. Our product management team facilitates this collaborative product development and production approach.





•



Research.

Within the governance research department, ISS’s policy board works to ensure ISS’s voting policies are
developed and applied within a framework of corporate governance best practices. Each year, through an annual policy survey of our institutional clients and other forums, institutional investors are invited to share their ideas on corporate
governance issues including board structure, executive compensation, mergers and acquisitions and corporate accountability to ensure that our standard voting policies are aligned with the views of our institutional clients.



•Data Operations and Technology.Our data operations and technology team consists of a combination of information technology and operations
specialists. We licensed a large volume and variety of market data for every major market in the world, including fundamental and return data, from more than 200 third party sources in 2011. We apply our models and methodologies to this market data
to produce our proprietary index and risk data. Our data operations and technology team oversees this complex process. Our experienced information technology staff builds internal systems and proprietary software and databases that house all of the
data we license or produce in order for our data operations teams to perform data quality checks and run our data production systems. This data factory produces our proprietary index data such as end of day and real time equity indices, and our
proprietary risk data such as daily and monthly equity risk forecasts. We have data operations and technology offices in North America, Europe and Asia.



•Software Engineering.Certain of our proprietary risk data are made available to clients through our proprietary software applications, such as
Barra Aegis, Barra Cosmos, BarraOne, RiskManager, HedgePlatform, WealthBench, Credit Manager, ESG Manager and Proxy Exchange. Our software engineering team consists of individuals with significant experience in both the finance and software
industries. Our staff has an extensive skill set, including expertise in both the Java-based technologies used in our web-based, on-demand software application tool for multi-asset class risk analysis and reporting and Microsoft-based technologies
used in our desktop equity and fixed income analytics software products. We also have extensive experience with database technologies, computational programming techniques, scalability and performance analysis and tuning and quality assurance. We
use a customized software development methodology that leverages best practices from the software







industry, including agile programming, test-driven development, parallel tracking, iterative cycles, prototyping and beta releases. We build our software applications by compiling multiple
components, which enables us to reuse designs and codes in multiple products. Our software development projects involve extensive collaboration with our product management team and directly with clients. We have software engineering offices in the
U.S., Europe and Asia.
