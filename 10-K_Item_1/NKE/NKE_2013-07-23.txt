ITEM 1. Business



General

NIKE, Inc. was incorporated in 1968 under the laws of the state of Oregon. As used in this report, the terms “we,” “us,” “NIKE” and the “Company” refer to NIKE, Inc. and its predecessors, subsidiaries and affiliates, collectively, unless the context indicates otherwise. Our internet address iswww.nike.com.On our NIKE Corporate website, located atwww.nikeinc.com,we post the following filings as soon as reasonably practicable after they are electronically filed with or furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission: our annual report on Form 10-K, our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, our current reports on Form 8-K and any amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. All such filings on our NIKE Corporate website are available free of charge. Also available on the NIKE Corporate website are the charters of the committees of our board of directors, as well as our corporate governance guidelines and code of ethics; copies of any of these documents will be provided in print to any shareholder who submits a request in writing to NIKE Investor Relations, One Bowerman Drive, Beaverton, Oregon 97005-6453.

Our principal business activity is the design, development and worldwide marketing and selling of athletic footwear, apparel, equipment, accessories and services. NIKE is the largest seller of athletic footwear and athletic apparel in the world. We sell our products to retail accounts, through NIKE-owned retail stores and internet websites (which we refer to as our “Direct to Consumer” operations) and through a mix of independent distributors and licensees, in virtually all countries around the world. Virtually all of our products are manufactured by independent contractors. Virtually all footwear and apparel products are produced outside the United States, while equipment products are produced both in the United States and abroad.



Products

We focus our NIKE Brand and Brand Jordan product offerings in seven key categories: Running, Basketball, Football (Soccer), Men’s Training, Women’s Training, NIKE Sportswear (our sports-inspired lifestyle products), and Action Sports. We also market products designed for kids, as well as for other athletic and recreational uses such as baseball, cricket, golf, lacrosse, outdoor activities, football, tennis, volleyball, walking, and wrestling.

NIKE’s athletic footwear products are designed primarily for specific athletic use, although a large percentage of the products are worn for casual or leisure purposes. We place considerable emphasis on high quality construction and innovation in our products. NIKE Sportswear, Running, Basketball, Football (Soccer), and kids’ shoes are currently our top-selling footwear categories and we expect them to continue to lead in product sales in the near future.

We sell sports apparel and accessories covering most of the above-mentioned categories, which feature the same trademarks and are sold predominantly through the same marketing and distribution channels as athletic footwear. We often market footwear, apparel and accessories in “collections” of similar use or by category. We also market apparel with licensed college and professional team and league logos.

We sell a line of performance equipment under the NIKE Brand name, including bags, socks, sport balls, eyewear, timepieces, digital devices, bats, gloves, protective equipment, golf clubs, and other equipment designed for sports activities. We also sell small amounts of various plastic products to other manufacturers through our wholly-owned subsidiary, NIKE IHM, Inc.

Our wholly-owned subsidiary, Converse Inc. (“Converse”), headquartered in North Andover, Massachusetts, designs, distributes and licenses athletic and casual footwear, apparel and accessories under the Converse®, Chuck Taylor®, All Star®, One Star®, Star Chevron®and Jack Purcell®trademarks.

Our wholly-owned subsidiary, Hurley International LLC (“Hurley”), headquartered in Costa Mesa, California, designs and distributes a line of action sports and youth lifestyle apparel and accessories under the Hurley®trademark.

In addition to the products we sell to our wholesale customers and directly to consumers through our Direct to Consumer operations, we have also entered into license agreements that permit unaffiliated parties to manufacture and sell certain apparel, digital devices and applications and other equipment designed for sports activities.

As part of our long-term growth strategy, we continually evaluate our portfolio of businesses to ensure we are investing in those businesses that are accretive to the NIKE Brand with the largest growth potential and highest returns. On February 1, 2013, and November 30, 2012, we completed the divestitures of the Cole Haan and Umbro businesses, respectively, allowing us to better focus our resources on driving growth in the NIKE, Jordan, Converse and Hurley brands.



Sales and Marketing

Financial information about geographic and segment operations appears in Note 18 — Operating Segments and Related Information of the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

We experience moderate fluctuations in aggregate sales volume during the year. Historically, revenues in the first and fourth fiscal quarters have slightly exceeded those in the second and third quarters. However, the mix of product sales may vary considerably as a result of changes in seasonal and geographic demand for particular types of footwear, apparel, and equipment.

Because NIKE is a consumer products company, the relative popularity of various sports and fitness activities and changing design trends affect the demand for our products. We must, therefore, respond to trends and shifts in consumer preferences by adjusting the mix of existing product offerings, developing new products, styles and categories, and influencing sports and fitness preferences through extensive marketing. Failure to respond in a timely and adequate manner could have a material adverse effect on our sales and profitability. This is a continuing risk.

We report our NIKE Brand operations based on our internal geographic organization. Each NIKE Brand geography operates predominantly in one industry: the design, development, marketing and selling of athletic footwear, apparel, equipment, accessories, and services. Our reportable operating









segments for the NIKE Brand are: North America, Western Europe, Central & Eastern Europe, Greater China, Japan, and Emerging Markets. Our NIKE Brand Direct to Consumer operations are managed within each geographic segment.



United States Market

In fiscal 2013, sales in the United States, including U.S. sales of our Other Businesses, accounted for approximately 45% of total revenues, compared to 42% in both fiscal 2012 and fiscal 2011. Converse and Hurley, our affiliate brands, and NIKE Golf comprise our Other Businesses. We sell to thousands of retail accounts in the United States, including a mix of footwear stores, sporting goods stores, athletic specialty stores, department stores, skate, tennis and golf shops, and other retail accounts. During fiscal 2013, our three largest customers accounted for approximately 25% of sales in the United States.

We make substantial use of our futures ordering program, which allows retailers to order five to six months in advance of delivery with the commitment that their orders will be delivered within a set time period at a fixed price. In fiscal 2013, 87% of our U.S. wholesale footwear shipments (excluding our Other Businesses) were made under the futures program, compared to 86% in fiscal 2012 and 87% in fiscal 2011. In fiscal 2013, 67% of our U.S. wholesale apparel shipments (excluding our Other Businesses) were made under the futures program, compared to 64% in fiscal 2012 and 60% in fiscal 2011.

We utilize NIKE sales offices to solicit sales in the United States as well as independent sales representatives to sell specialty products for golf, skateboarding, and snowboarding. In addition, our Direct to Consumer operations sell NIKE Brand products to consumers through our internet website,www.nike.com, and through the following number of retail stores in the United States:

U.S. Retail StoresNumberNIKE Brand factory stores171NIKE Brand in-line stores, including NIKETOWNs and employee-only stores33Converse stores (including factory stores)72Hurley stores (including factory and employee stores)27TOTAL303



NIKE has five primary distribution centers in the United States located in Memphis, Tennessee, three of which are leased. NIKE Brand apparel and equipment products are also shipped from our Foothill Ranch, California distribution center. Converse and Hurley products are shipped primarily from Ontario, California.



International Markets

In fiscal 2013, non-U.S. sales including non-U.S. sales of our Other Businesses accounted for 55% of total revenues, compared to 58% in both fiscal 2012 and fiscal 2011. We sell our products to retail accounts, through our own Direct to Consumer operations, and through a mix of independent distributors, licensees, and sales representatives around the world. We sell to thousands of retail accounts and operate 16 distribution centers outside of the United States. In many countries and regions, including Canada, Asia, some Latin American countries, and Europe, we have a futures ordering program for retailers similar to the United States futures ordering program described above. During fiscal 2013, NIKE’s three largest customers outside of the U.S. accounted for approximately 6% of total non-U.S. sales.

Our Direct to Consumer business operates the following number of retail stores outside the United States:

Non-U.S. Retail StoresNumberNIKE Brand factory stores388NIKE Brand in-line stores, including NIKETOWNs and employee-only stores59Converse stores (including factory stores)3TOTAL450

International branch offices and subsidiaries of NIKE are located in Argentina, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Bermuda, Brazil, Canada, Chile, China, Costa Rica, Croatia, Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hong Kong, Hungary, India, Indonesia, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan, Korea, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, the Netherlands, Norway, the Philippines, Poland, Portugal, Russia, Singapore, Slovakia, Slovenia, South Africa, Spain, Sri Lanka, Sweden, Switzerland, Taiwan, Thailand, Turkey, the United Arab Emirates, the United Kingdom, Uruguay and Vietnam.



Significant Customer

No customer accounted for 10% or more of our worldwide net sales during fiscal 2013.



Orders

Worldwide futures orders for NIKE Brand athletic footwear and apparel, scheduled for delivery from June through November 2013, were $12.1 billion compared to $11.2 billion for the same period last year. This futures orders amount is calculated based upon our forecast of the actual exchange rates under which our revenues will be translated during this period. Reported futures orders are not necessarily indicative of our expectation of revenues for this period. This is because the mix of orders can shift between futures and at-once orders and the fulfillment of certain of these futures orders may fall outside of the scheduled time period noted above. In addition, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations as well as differing levels of discounts, order cancellations and returns can cause differences in the comparisons between futures orders and actual revenues. Moreover, a significant portion of our revenue is not derived from futures orders, including at-once and close-out sales of NIKE Brand footwear and apparel, sales of NIKE Brand equipment, sales from our Direct to Consumer operations, and sales from our Other Businesses.



Product Research and Development

We believe our research and development efforts are a key factor in our success. Technical innovation in the design and manufacturing process of footwear, apparel, and athletic equipment receive continued emphasis as NIKE strives to produce products that help to reduce injury, enhance athletic performance and maximize comfort.

In addition to NIKE’s own staff of specialists in the areas of biomechanics, chemistry, exercise physiology, engineering, industrial design, sustainability, and related fields, we also utilize research committees and advisory boards made up of athletes, coaches, trainers, equipment managers, orthopedists, podiatrists, and other experts who consult with us and review designs, materials, concepts for product and manufacturing process improvements and compliance with product safety regulations around the world. Employee athletes, athletes engaged under sports marketing contracts and other athletes wear-test and evaluate products during the design and development process.



Manufacturing

Virtually all of our footwear is manufactured outside of the United States by independent contract manufacturers. In fiscal 2013, contract factories in Vietnam, China and Indonesia manufactured approximately 42%, 30%, and 26% of total NIKE Brand footwear, respectively. We also have manufacturing agreements with independent factories in Argentina, Brazil, India, and Mexico to manufacture footwear for sale primarily within those countries. The largest single footwear factory with which we have contracted accounted for approximately 6% of total fiscal 2013 NIKE Brand footwear production. Almost all of NIKE Brand apparel is manufactured outside of the United States by independent contract manufacturers located in 28 countries. Most of this apparel production occurred in China, Vietnam, Thailand, Indonesia, Sri Lanka, Pakistan, Malaysia, Turkey, Mexico, and Cambodia. The largest single apparel factory that we have contracted with accounted for approximately 6% of total fiscal 2013 apparel production.

The principal materials used in our footwear products are natural and synthetic rubber, plastic compounds, foam cushioning materials, nylon, leather, canvas, and polyurethane films used to make Air-Sole cushioning components. During fiscal 2013, NIKE IHM, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of NIKE, Inc., with facilities in Beaverton, Oregon and St. Louis, Missouri, as well as independent contractors in China and Vietnam, were our largest suppliers of the Air-Sole cushioning components used in footwear. The principal materials used in our apparel products are natural and synthetic fabrics and threads, plastic and metal hardware, and specialized performance fabrics designed to repel rain and snow, retain heat, or efficiently wick moisture away from the body. NIKE’s independent contractors and suppliers buy raw materials in bulk for the manufacturing of our footwear, apparel and equipment products. Most raw materials are available and purchased by those independent contractors and suppliers in the countries where manufacturing takes place. We have thus far experienced little difficulty in satisfying our raw material requirements.

Since 1972, Sojitz Corporation of America (“Sojitz America”), a large Japanese trading company and the sole owner of our redeemable preferred stock, has performed significant import-export financing services for us. During fiscal 2013, Sojitz America provided financing and purchasing services for NIKE Brand products sold in Argentina, Uruguay, Canada, Brazil, India, Indonesia, the Philippines, Malaysia, South Africa, Korea, and Thailand, excluding products produced and sold in the same country. Approximately 13% of NIKE Brand sales occurred in those countries. Any failure of Sojitz America to provide these services or any failure of Sojitz America’s banks could disrupt our ability to acquire products from our suppliers and to deliver products to our customers in those markets. Such a disruption could result in canceled orders that would adversely affect sales and profitability. However, we believe that any such disruption would be short-term in duration due to the ready availability of alternative sources of financing at competitive rates. Our current agreements with Sojitz America expire on May 31, 2014.



International Operations and Trade

Our international operations and sources of supply are subject to the usual risks of doing business abroad, such as possible revaluation of currencies, export and import duties, anti-dumping measures, quotas, safeguard measures, trade restrictions, restrictions on the transfer of funds and, in certain parts of the world, political instability and terrorism. We have not, to date, been materially affected by any such risk, but cannot predict the likelihood of such material effects occurring in the future.

In recent years, uncertain global and regional economic conditions have affected international trade and caused a rise in protectionist actions around the world.These trends are affecting many global manufacturing and service sectors, and the footwear and apparel industries, as a whole, are not immune. Companies in our industry are facing trade protectionism in many different regions, and in nearly all cases we are working together with industry groups to address trade issues and reduce the impact to the industry, while observing applicable competition laws. Notwithstanding our efforts, such protectionist measures, if implemented, could result in increases in the cost of our products, which may in turn adversely affect our sales or profitability as well as the imported footwear and apparel industry as a whole.

We monitor protectionist trends and developments throughout the world that may materially impact our industry and engage in administrative and judicial processes to mitigate trade restrictions. In Brazil, we are actively monitoring for dumping investigations against products from China and other countries that may result in additional anti-dumping measures and could affect our industry. We are also monitoring for and advocating against other impediments that may increase customs clearance times for imports of footwear, apparel and equipment. Moreover, with respect to trade restrictions targeting China, which represents an important sourcing and consumer marketing country for us, we are working with a broad coalition of global businesses and trade associations representing a wide variety of sectors to help ensure that any legislation enacted and implemented (i)addresses legitimate and core concerns, (ii)is consistent with international trade rules, and (iii)reflects and considers China's domestic economy and the important role it has in the global economic community.

Where trade protection measures are implemented, we believe that we have the ability to develop, over a period of time, adequate alternative sources of supply for the products obtained from our present suppliers. If events prevented us from acquiring products from our suppliers in a particular country, our operations could be temporarily disrupted and we could experience an adverse financial impact. However, we believe we could abate any such disruption, and that much of the adverse impact on supply would, therefore, be of a short-term nature, although alternate sources of supply might not be as cost effective and could have an ongoing adverse impact on profitability.













Competition

The athletic footwear, apparel, and equipment industry is highly competitive in the United States and on a worldwide basis. We compete internationally with a significant number of athletic and leisure footwear companies, athletic and leisure apparel companies, sports equipment companies, and large companies having diversified lines of athletic and leisure footwear, apparel, and equipment, including adidas, V.F. Corp., Puma, Li Ning and Under Armour, among others. We also compete with a number of vertical retailers such as Lululemon and Uniqlo. The intense competition and the rapid changes in technology and consumer preferences in the markets for athletic and leisure footwear and apparel, and athletic equipment, constitute significant risk factors in our operations.



NIKE is the largest seller of athletic footwear, apparel, and equipment in the world. Important aspects of competition in this industry are:

•Product quality; performance and reliability; new product innovation and development; and consumer price/value;

•Consumer connection and affinity for brands and products, developed through marketing and promotion; customer support and service; identification with prominent and influential athletes, coaches, teams, colleges and sports leagues who endorse our brands and use our products; and active engagement through sponsored sporting events and clinics; and

•Effective distribution of products, with attractive merchandising and presentation at retail, in store and online.



We believe that we are competitive in all of these areas.



Trademarks and Patents

We utilize trademarks on nearly all of our products and believe having distinctive marks that are readily identifiable is an important factor in creating a market for our goods, in identifying our brands and the Company, and in distinguishing our goods from the goods of others. We consider our NIKE® and Swoosh Design® trademarks to be among our most valuable assets and we have registered these trademarks in almost 170 jurisdictions. In addition, we own many other trademarks that we utilize in marketing our products. We continue to vigorously protect our trademarks against infringement.

NIKE has an exclusive, worldwide license to make and sell footwear using patented “Air” technology. The process utilizes pressurized gas encapsulated in polyurethane. Some of the early NIKE AIR® patents have expired, which may enable competitors to use certain types of similar technology. Subsequent NIKE AIR® patents will not expire for several years.

We also file and maintain many U.S. and foreign utility patents, as well as many U.S. and foreign design patents covering components, manufacturing techniques and features used in various athletic and leisure footwear, apparel, athletic equipment, digital devices and golf products. These patents expire at various times, and patents issued for applications filed this year in the U.S. will last until 2027 for design patents and until 2033 for utility patents.

We believe our success depends primarily upon our capabilities in design, research and development, production, and marketing rather than exclusively upon our patent position. However, we have followed a policy of filing patent applications for the United States and foreign patents on inventions, designs, and improvements that we deem valuable.



Employees

As of May 31, 2013, we had approximately 48,000 employees worldwide, including retail and part-time employees. Management considers its relationship with employees to be excellent. None of our employees are represented by a union, except for certain employees in the Emerging Markets geography, where local law requires those employees to be represented by a trade union. Also, in some countries outside of the United States, local laws require employee representation by works councils (which may be entitled to information and consultation on certain Company decisions) or by organizations similar to a union. In certain European countries, we are required by local law to enter into and/or comply with industry-wide or national collective bargaining agreements. NIKE has never experienced a material interruption of operations due to labor disagreements.
