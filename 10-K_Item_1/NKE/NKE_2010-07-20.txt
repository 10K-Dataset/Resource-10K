Item 1.Business

General

NIKE, Inc. was incorporated in 1968 under the laws of the state of Oregon. As used in this report, the terms
“we”, “us”, “NIKE” and the “Company” refer to NIKE, Inc. and its predecessors, subsidiaries and affiliates, unless the context indicates otherwise. Our Internet address iswww.nike.com.On our NIKE
Corporate web site, located atwww.nikebiz.com,we post the following filings as soon as reasonably practicable after they are electronically filed with or furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission: our annual report on
Form 10-K, our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, our current reports on Form 8-K and any amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. All such
filings on our NIKE Corporate web site are available free of charge. Also available on the NIKE Corporate web site are the charters of the committees of our board of directors, as well as our corporate governance guidelines and code of ethics;
copies of any of these documents will be provided in print to any shareholder who submits a request in writing to NIKE Investor Relations, One Bowerman Drive, Beaverton, Oregon 97005-6453.

Our principal business activity is the design, development and worldwide marketing of high quality footwear, apparel, equipment, and
accessory products. NIKE is the largest seller of athletic footwear and athletic apparel in the world. We sell our products to retail accounts, through NIKE-owned retail including stores and internet sales, and through a mix of independent
distributors and licensees, in over 170 countries around the world. Virtually all of our products are manufactured by independent contractors. Virtually all footwear and apparel products are produced outside the United States, while equipment
products are produced both in the United States and abroad.

Products

NIKE’s athletic footwear products are designed primarily for specific athletic use, although a large percentage of the products are
worn for casual or leisure purposes. We place considerable emphasis on high quality construction and innovation in products designed for men, women and children. Running, training, basketball, soccer, sport-inspired casual shoes, and kids’
shoes are currently our top-selling footwear categories and we expect them to continue to lead in product sales in the near future. We also market footwear designed for aquatic activities, baseball, cheerleading, football, golf, lacrosse, outdoor
activities, skateboarding, tennis, volleyball, walking, wrestling, and other athletic and recreational uses.

We sell sports
apparel and accessories covering most of the above categories, sports-inspired lifestyle apparel, as well as athletic bags and accessory items. NIKE apparel and accessories feature the same trademarks and are sold through the same marketing and
distribution channels. We often market footwear, apparel and accessories in “collections” of similar design or for specific purposes. We also market apparel with licensed college and professional team and league logos.

We sell a line of performance equipment under the NIKE Brand name, including bags, socks, sport balls, eyewear, timepieces, electronic
devices, bats, gloves, protective equipment, golf clubs, and other equipment designed for sports activities. We also sell small amounts of various plastic products to other manufacturers through our wholly-owned subsidiary, NIKE IHM, Inc.

In addition to the products we sell directly to customers, we have entered into license agreements that permit unaffiliated
parties to manufacture and sell certain apparel, electronic devices and other equipment designed for sports activities.

Our wholly-owned subsidiary, Cole Haan (“Cole Haan”), headquartered in Yarmouth, Maine, designs and
distributes dress and casual footwear, apparel and accessories for men and women under the Cole Haan®trademark.







Our wholly-owned subsidiary, Converse Inc. (“Converse”),
headquartered in North Andover, Massachusetts, designs, distributes and licenses athletic and casual footwear, apparel and accessories under the
Converse®, Chuck
Taylor®, All
Star®, One
Star®, Star Chevron and Jack
Purcell®trademarks.

Our wholly-owned subsidiary, Hurley International LLC (“Hurley”), headquartered in Costa Mesa, California,
designs and distributes a line of action sports and youth lifestyle apparel and accessories under the Hurley®trademark.

Our wholly-owned subsidiary, Umbro Ltd. (“Umbro”), headquartered in Cheadle,
England, designs, distributes and licenses athletic and casual footwear, apparel and equipment, primarily for the sport of football (soccer), under the
Umbro®trademark.

Sales and Marketing

Financial information about geographic and segment operations appears in Note 19 of the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial
Statements on page 88.

We experience moderate fluctuations in aggregate sales volume during the year. Historically, revenues
in the first and fourth fiscal quarters have slightly exceeded those in the second and third quarters. However, the mix of product sales may vary considerably as a result of changes in seasonal and geographic demand for particular types of footwear,
apparel and equipment.

Because NIKE is a consumer products company, the relative popularity of various sports and fitness
activities and changing design trends affect the demand for our products. We must therefore respond to trends and shifts in consumer preferences by adjusting the mix of existing product offerings, developing new products, styles and categories, and
influencing sports and fitness preferences through aggressive marketing. Failure to respond in a timely and adequate manner could have a material adverse effect on our sales and profitability. This is a continuing risk.

We report our NIKE Brand operations based on our internal geographic organization. Each NIKE Brand geography operates predominantly
in one industry: the design, production, marketing and selling of sports and fitness footwear, apparel, and equipment. In the third quarter of fiscal 2009, we initiated a reorganization of the NIKE Brand into a new model consisting of six
geographies. Effective June 1, 2009, we began operating under our new organizational structure for the NIKE Brand, which consists of the following geographies: North America, Western Europe, Central and Eastern Europe, Greater China,
Japan, and Emerging Markets. Previously, NIKE Brand operations were organized into the following four geographic regions: U.S.; Europe; Middle East and Africa (collectively, “EMEA”); Asia Pacific; and Americas.

United States Market

In fiscal 2010 and 2009, sales in the United States including U.S. sales of our Other Businesses accounted for approximately 42% of total
revenues, compared to 43% in fiscal 2008. For fiscal 2010 and 2009, our Other Businesses were primarily comprised of Cole Haan, Converse, Hurley, NIKE Golf and Umbro (which was acquired on March 3, 2008). For fiscal 2008, our Other
Businesses were primarily comprised of Cole Haan, Converse, Exeter (whose primary business was the Starter brand business which was sold on December 17, 2007), Hurley, NIKE Bauer Hockey (which was sold on April 17, 2008), NIKE Golf
and Umbro. We estimate that we sell to more than 23,000 retail accounts in the United States. The NIKE Brand domestic retail account base includes a mix of footwear stores, sporting goods stores, athletic specialty stores, department stores, skate,
tennis and golf shops, and other retail accounts. During fiscal 2010, our three largest customers accounted for approximately 24% of sales in the United States.

We make substantial use of our “futures” ordering program, which allows retailers to order five to six months in advance
of delivery with the commitment that their orders will be delivered within a set time







period at a fixed price. In fiscal 2010 and 2009, 89% of our U.S. wholesale footwear shipments (excluding our Other Businesses) were made under the futures program, compared to 90% in fiscal
2008. In fiscal 2010, 62% of our U.S. wholesale apparel shipments (excluding our Other Businesses) were made under the futures program, compared to 60% in fiscal 2009 and 62% in fiscal 2008.

We utilize 19 NIKE sales offices to solicit sales in the United States. We also utilize 4 independent sales representatives to sell
specialty products for golf and 5 for skateboarding and outdoor products. In addition, we sell NIKE Brand products through our internet website,www.nikestore.com, and we operate the following retail outlets in the United States:



U.S. Retail StoresNumberNIKE factory stores (which carry primarily overstock and close-out merchandise)145NIKE stores (including one NIKE Women store)12NIKETOWNs (designed to showcase NIKE products)11NIKE employee-only stores3Cole Haan stores (including factory stores)106Converse factory stores51Hurley stores (including factory and employee stores)18Total346

NIKE’s three United States distribution centers
for NIKE Brand footwear are located in Memphis, Tennessee. NIKE Brand apparel and equipment products are shipped from our Memphis, Tennessee and Foothill Ranch, California distribution centers. Cole Haan products are distributed primarily from
Greenland, New Hampshire, Converse products are shipped primarily from Ontario, California, and Hurley products are distributed from Irvine, California.

International Markets

In fiscal 2010 and 2009, non-U.S. sales (including non-U.S. sales of our Other Businesses) accounted for 58% of total revenues, compared
to 57% in fiscal 2008. We sell our products to retail accounts, through NIKE-owned retail stores, and through a mix of independent distributors and licensees around the world. We estimate that we sell to more than 24,000 retail accounts outside the
United States, excluding sales by independent distributors and licensees. We operate 14 distribution centers outside of the United States. In many countries and regions, including Canada, Asia, some Latin American countries, and Europe, we have a
futures ordering program for retailers similar to the United States futures program described above. During fiscal 2010, NIKE’s three largest customers outside of the U.S. accounted for approximately 8% of total non-U.S. sales.

We operate the following retail outlets outside the United States:

International branch offices and subsidiaries of NIKE
are located in Argentina, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Bermuda, Brazil, Canada, Chile, China, Croatia, Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France,







Germany, Greece, Hong Kong, Hungary, Indonesia, India, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan, Korea, Lebanon, Macau, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, the Netherlands, Norway, the Philippines, Poland,
Portugal, Russia, Singapore, Slovakia, Slovenia, South Africa, Spain, Sri Lanka, Sweden, Switzerland, Taiwan, Thailand, Turkey, the United Arab Emirates, the United Kingdom, Uruguay and Vietnam.

Significant Customer

No customer accounted for 10% or more of our net sales during fiscal 2010.

Orders

Worldwide futures and advance orders for NIKE Brand athletic footwear and apparel, scheduled for delivery from June through November 2010,
were $8.8 billion compared to $7.8 billion for the same period last year. This futures and advance order amount is calculated based upon our forecast of the actual exchange rates under which our revenues will be translated during this period, which
approximate current spot rates. Reported futures and advance orders are not necessarily indicative of our expectation of revenues for this period. This is because the mix of orders can shift between advance/futures and at-once orders and the
fulfillment of certain of these advance/futures orders may fall outside of the scheduled time period noted above. In addition, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations as well as differing levels of order cancellations and discounts can cause
differences in the comparisons between futures and advance orders and actual revenues. Moreover, a significant portion of our revenue is not derived from futures and advance orders, including at-once and close-out sales of NIKE footwear and apparel,
wholesale sales of equipment, Cole Haan, Converse, Hurley, Umbro, NIKE Golf, and certain retail sales across all brands.

Product Research and Development

We believe our research and development efforts are a key factor in our past and
future success. Technical innovation in the design of footwear, apparel, and athletic equipment receive continued emphasis as NIKE strives to produce products that help to reduce injury, enhance athletic performance and maximize comfort.

In addition to NIKE’s own staff of specialists in the areas of biomechanics, chemistry, exercise physiology, engineering, industrial
design, and related fields, we also utilize research committees and advisory boards made up of athletes, coaches, trainers, equipment managers, orthopedists, podiatrists, and other experts who consult with us and review designs, materials, and
concepts for product improvement. Employee athletes, athletes engaged under sports marketing contracts and other athletes wear-test and evaluate products during the design and development process.

Manufacturing

Virtually all of our footwear is produced by factories we contract with outside of the United States. In fiscal 2010, contract factories
in Vietnam, China, Indonesia, Thailand, and India manufactured approximately 37%, 34%, 23%, 2% and 1% of total NIKE Brand footwear, respectively. We also have manufacturing agreements with independent factories in Argentina, Brazil, India, and
Mexico to manufacture footwear for sale primarily within those countries. The largest single footwear factory that we have contracted with accounted for approximately 5% of total fiscal 2010 footwear production.

Almost all of NIKE Brand apparel is manufactured outside of the United States by independent contract manufacturers located in 33
countries. Most of this apparel production occurred in China, Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia, Vietnam, Sri Lanka, Turkey, Cambodia, El Salvador, Mexico, and Taiwan. The largest single apparel factory that we have contracted with accounted for
approximately 7% of total fiscal 2010 apparel production. The principal materials used in our footwear products are natural and synthetic rubber, plastic compounds, foam cushioning materials, nylon, leather, canvas, and polyurethane films used to
make Air-Sole cushioning







components. During fiscal 2010, NIKE IHM, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of NIKE, and independent contractors in China and Taiwan, were our largest suppliers of the Air-Sole cushioning
components used in footwear. The principal materials used in our apparel products are natural and synthetic fabrics and threads, plastic and metal hardware, and specialized performance fabrics designed to repel rain, retain heat, or efficiently
transport body moisture. NIKE’s contractors and suppliers buy raw materials in bulk. Most raw materials are available in the countries where manufacturing takes place. We have thus far experienced little difficulty in satisfying our raw
material requirements.

Since 1972, Sojitz Corporation of America (“Sojitz America”), a large Japanese trading
company, has performed significant import-export financing services for us. During fiscal 2010, Sojitz America provided financing and purchasing services for NIKE Brand products sold in Argentina, Uruguay, Canada, Brazil, India, Indonesia, the
Philippines, Malaysia, South Africa, China, Korea, and Thailand, excluding products produced and sold in the same country. Approximately 17% of NIKE Brand sales occurred in those countries. Any failure of Sojitz America to provide these services or
any failure of Sojitz America’s banks could disrupt our ability to acquire products from our suppliers and to deliver products to our customers outside of the United States, Europe, Middle East, Africa and Japan. Such a disruption could result
in cancelled orders that would adversely affect sales and profitability. However, we believe that any such disruption would be short-term in duration due to the ready availability of alternative sources of financing at competitive rates. Our current
agreements with Sojitz America expire on May 31, 2011.

International Operations and Trade

Our international operations and sources of supply are subject to the usual risks of doing business abroad, such as possible revaluation
of currencies, export and import duties, anti-dumping measures, quotas, safeguard measures, trade restrictions, restrictions on the transfer of funds and, in certain parts of the world, political instability and terrorism. We have not, to date, been
materially affected by any such risk, but cannot predict the likelihood of such developments occurring.

The current global
economic recession has resulted in a significant slow down in international trade and a sharp rise in protectionist actions around the world. These trends are affecting many global manufacturing and service sectors, and the footwear and apparel
industries, as a whole, are not immune. Companies in our industry are facing trade protectionist challenges in many different regions, and in nearly all cases we are working together to address trade issues to reduce the impact to the industry,
while observing applicable competition laws. Notwithstanding our efforts, such actions, if implemented, could result in increases in the cost of our products, which could adversely affect our sales or profitability and the imported footwear and
apparel industry as a whole. Accordingly, we are actively monitoring the developments described below.

Footwear Imports
into the European Union

In 2005, at the request of the European domestic footwear industry, the European Commission
(“EC”) initiated investigations into leather footwear imported from China and Vietnam. Together with other companies in our industry, we took the position that Special Technology Athletic Footwear (STAF) (i) should not be within the
scope of the investigation, and (ii) does not meet the legal requirements of injury and price in an anti-dumping investigation. Our arguments were successful and the EU agreed in October 2006 on definitive duties of 16.5% for China and 10% for
Vietnam for non-STAF leather footwear, but excluded STAF from the final measures. Prior to the scheduled expiration in October 2008 of the measures imposed on the non-STAF footwear, the domestic industry requested and the EC agreed to review a
petition to extend these restrictions on non-STAF leather footwear. In December 2009, following a review of the ongoing restrictions, EU member states voted to extend the measures for an additional 15 months, until March 31, 2011. We expect
that a decision by the EC on whether to initiate a review on these measures for a second time will take place before the end of calendar 2010.







On February 3, 2010, the Chinese government announced it would be seeking to refer the
EU decision (both on the original measures and subsequent review decision) to the World Trade Organization (“WTO”), and on May 18, 2010, the Dispute Settlement Body of the WTO agreed to establish a panel to rule on China’s claims
against the EU with respect to current anti-dumping measures in force for leather footwear exports.

Footwear Imports into
Brazil and Argentina

At the request of certain domestic footwear industry participants, both Brazil and Argentina have
initiated independent anti-dumping investigations against footwear made in China. Over the last two years, we have been working in broad coalition with other companies in our industry to challenge these cases on the basis that the athletic footwear
being imported from China (i) should not be within the scope of the investigation, and (ii) does not meet the legal requirements of injury and price in an anti-dumping investigation. In the case of Argentina, in 2010, the final
determination made by the administering authorities was favorable to us. In the case of Brazil, the administering authorities agreed to impose an anti-dumping duty against nearly all footwear from China, which we believe will impact all brands in
the footwear industry. Although we do not currently expect that this decision will materially affect us, we are working with the same broad coalition of footwear companies to challenge this decision in domestic Brazilian courts as well as
international forums such as the WTO.

Footwear Imports into Turkey

In 2006, Turkey introduced safeguard measures in the form of additional duties on all imported footwear into Turkey with the goal of
protecting its local shoe manufacturing industry until August 2009. In June 2009, Turkish shoe-manufacturers submitted, and the Turkish Government agreed to review, a request for extension of the safeguard measures claiming that the rehabilitation
process of the local Turkish industry was interrupted due to the continuing increase of footwear imports. Despite the importers opposition to the continuation of the safeguard measures, the Turkish authorities extended these safeguard measures until
August 2012, but reduced the duty from $3 per pair of footwear to $1.60 per pair of footwear. As a result of this decision, Vietnam and Indonesia each initiated discussions with Turkey and each is seeking compensation from Turkey, which is possible
under current WTO rules. These bilateral discussions are currently ongoing, and one potential outcome could involve Turkey awarding trade concessions on other products — or the exclusion from the safeguard measure of certain categories of
footwear. A conclusion of the first round of talks between the exporting countries is expected in September 2010.

Trade
Relations with China

China represents an important sourcing and marketing country for us. Many governments around the
world are concerned about China’s growing and fast-paced economy, compliance with WTO rules, currency valuation, and high trade surpluses. As a result, a wide range of legislative proposals have been introduced to address these concerns. While
some of these concerns may be justified, we are working with broad coalitions of global businesses and trade associations representing a wide variety of sectors (e.g., services, manufacturing, and agriculture) to help ensure any legislation enacted
and implemented (i) addresses legitimate and core concerns, (ii) is consistent with international trade rules, and (iii) reflects and considers China’s domestic economy and the important role it has in the global economic
community. We believe other companies in our industry as well as most other multi-national companies are in a similar position regarding these trade measures.

In the event any of these trade protection measures are implemented, we believe that we have the ability to develop, over a period of
time, adequate alternative sources of supply for the products obtained from our present suppliers. If events prevented us from acquiring products from our suppliers in a particular country, our operations could be temporarily disrupted and we
could experience an adverse financial impact. However, we believe we could abate any such disruption, and that much of the adverse impact on supply would, therefore, be of a short-term nature. We believe our principal competitors are subject to
similar risks.







Competition

The athletic footwear, apparel, and equipment industry is keenly competitive in the United States and on a worldwide basis. We compete
internationally with a significant number of athletic and leisure shoe companies, athletic and leisure apparel companies, sports equipment companies, and large companies having diversified lines of athletic and leisure shoes, apparel, and equipment,
including Adidas, Puma, and others. The intense competition and the rapid changes in technology and consumer preferences in the markets for athletic and leisure footwear and apparel, and athletic equipment, constitute significant risk factors in our
operations.

NIKE is the largest seller of athletic footwear and athletic apparel in the world. Performance and reliability of
shoes, apparel, and equipment, new product development, price, product identity through marketing and promotion, and customer support and service are important aspects of competition in the athletic footwear, apparel, and equipment industry. To help
market our products, we contract with prominent and influential athletes, coaches, teams, colleges and sports leagues to endorse our brands and use our products, and we actively sponsor sporting events and clinics. We believe that we are competitive
in all of these areas.

Trademarks and Patents

We utilize trademarks on nearly all of our products and believe having distinctive marks that are readily identifiable
is an important factor in creating a market for our goods, in identifying the Company, and in distinguishing our goods from the goods of others. We consider our
NIKE®and Swoosh
Design®trademarks to be among our most valuable assets and we have registered these trademarks in over 150
countries. In addition, we own many other trademarks that we utilize in marketing our products. We continue to vigorously protect our trademarks against infringement.

NIKE has an exclusive, worldwide license to make and sell footwear using patented “Air” technology. The
process utilizes pressurized gas encapsulated in polyurethane. Some of the early NIKE AIR®patents have expired,
which may enable competitors to use certain types of similar technology. Subsequent NIKE AIR®patents will not
expire for several years. We also have hundreds of U.S. and foreign utility patents, and thousands of U.S. and foreign design patents covering components and features used in various athletic and leisure shoes, apparel, and equipment. These patents
expire at various times, and patents issued for applications filed this year will last from now to 2024 for design patents, and from now to 2030 for utility patents. We believe our success depends primarily upon skills in design, research and
development, production, and marketing rather than upon our patent position. However, we have followed a policy of filing applications for United States and foreign patents on inventions, designs, and improvements that we deem valuable.

Employees

We had approximately 34,400 employees at May 31, 2010. Management considers its relationship with employees to be excellent. None of
our employees is represented by a union, except for certain employees in the Emerging Markets geography, where local law requires those employees to be represented by a trade union, and in the United States, where certain employees of Cole Haan are
represented by a union. Also, in some countries outside of the United States, local laws require representation for employees by works councils (such as in certain countries in the European Union, in which they are entitled to information and
consultation on certain Company decisions) or other employee representation by an organization similar to a union, and in certain European countries, we are required by local law to enter into and/or comply with (industry wide or national)
collective bargaining agreements. There has never been a material interruption of operations due to labor disagreements.
