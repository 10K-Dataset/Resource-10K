Item 1.Business

General

NIKE, Inc. was incorporated in 1968 under the laws of the state of Oregon. As used in this report, the terms
“we”, “us”, “NIKE” and the “Company” refer to NIKE, Inc. and its predecessors, subsidiaries and affiliates, unless the context indicates otherwise. Our Internet address iswww.nike.com.On our NIKE
Corporate web site, located atwww.nikebiz.com,we post the following filings as soon as reasonably practicable after they are electronically filed with or furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission: our annual report on
Form 10-K, our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, our current reports on Form 8-K and any amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. All such
filings on our NIKE Corporate web site are available free of charge. Also available on the NIKE Corporate web site are the charters of the committees of our board of directors, as well as our corporate governance guidelines and code of ethics;
copies of any of these documents will be provided in print to any shareholder who submits a request in writing to NIKE Investor Relations, One Bowerman Drive, Beaverton, Oregon 97005-6453.

Our principal business activity is the design, development and worldwide marketing and selling of high quality footwear, apparel,
equipment, and accessory products. NIKE is the largest seller of athletic footwear and athletic apparel in the world. We sell our products to retail accounts, through NIKE-owned retail stores and internet sales, which we refer to as our “Direct
to Consumer” operations, and through a mix of independent distributors and licensees, in over 170 countries around the world. Virtually all of our products are manufactured by independent contractors. Virtually all footwear and apparel products
are produced outside the United States, while equipment products are produced both in the United States and abroad.

Products

NIKE’s athletic footwear products are designed primarily for specific athletic use, although a large percentage of the products are worn for casual or leisure purposes. We place considerable emphasis
on high quality construction and innovation in products designed for men, women and children. Running, training, basketball, soccer, sport-inspired casual shoes, and kids’ shoes are currently our top-selling footwear categories and we expect
them to continue to lead in product sales in the near future. We also market footwear designed for baseball, cheerleading, football, golf, lacrosse, outdoor activities, skateboarding, tennis, volleyball, walking, wrestling, and other athletic and
recreational uses.

We sell sports apparel and accessories covering most of the above categories, sports-inspired lifestyle
apparel, as well as athletic bags and accessory items. NIKE apparel and accessories feature the same trademarks and are sold through the same marketing and distribution channels. We often market footwear, apparel and accessories in
“collections” of similar design or for specific purposes. We also market apparel with licensed college and professional team and league logos.

We sell a line of performance equipment under the NIKE Brand name, including bags, socks, sport balls, eyewear, timepieces, electronic devices, bats, gloves, protective equipment, golf clubs, and other
equipment designed for sports activities. We also sell small amounts of various plastic products to other manufacturers through our wholly-owned subsidiary, NIKE IHM, Inc.

In addition to the products we sell directly to customers through our Direct to Consumer operations, we have entered into license agreements that permit unaffiliated parties to manufacture and sell
certain apparel, electronic devices and other equipment designed for sports activities.

Our wholly-owned
subsidiary, Cole Haan (“Cole Haan”), headquartered in New York, New York, designs and distributes dress and casual footwear, apparel and accessories for men and women under the Cole Haan®trademark.







Our wholly-owned subsidiary, Converse Inc. (“Converse”),
headquartered in North Andover, Massachusetts, designs, distributes and licenses athletic and casual footwear, apparel and accessories under the Converse®, Chuck Taylor®, All Star®, One Star®, Star Chevron and Jack
Purcell®trademarks.

Our wholly-owned subsidiary, Hurley International LLC (“Hurley”), headquartered in Costa Mesa, California,
designs and distributes a line of action sports and youth lifestyle apparel and accessories under the Hurley®trademark.

Our wholly-owned subsidiary, Umbro International Limited (“Umbro”), headquartered in
Cheadle, United Kingdom, designs, distributes and licenses athletic and casual footwear, apparel and equipment, primarily for the sport of football (soccer), under the Umbro®trademark.

Sales and
Marketing

Financial information about geographic and segment operations appears in Note 18 of the accompanying Notes to
the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 83.

We experience moderate fluctuations in aggregate sales volume during the
year. Historically, revenues in the first and fourth fiscal quarters have slightly exceeded those in the second and third quarters. However, the mix of product sales may vary considerably as a result of changes in seasonal and geographic demand for
particular types of footwear, apparel and equipment.

Because NIKE is a consumer products company, the relative popularity of
various sports and fitness activities and changing design trends affect the demand for our products. We must therefore respond to trends and shifts in consumer preferences by adjusting the mix of existing product offerings, developing new products,
styles and categories, and influencing sports and fitness preferences through aggressive marketing. Failure to respond in a timely and adequate manner could have a material adverse effect on our sales and profitability. This is a continuing risk.

We report our NIKE Brand operations based on our internal geographic organization. Each NIKE Brand geography operates
predominantly in one industry: the design, development, marketing and selling of athletic footwear, apparel, and equipment. Effective June 1, 2009, we began operating under our new organizational structure for the NIKE Brand, which
consists of the following six geographies: North America, Western Europe, Central & Eastern Europe, Greater China, Japan, and Emerging Markets. Previously, NIKE Brand operations were organized into the following four geographic regions: U.S.,
Europe, Middle East and Africa (collectively, “EMEA”), Asia Pacific, and Americas. Our NIKE Brand Direct to Consumer operations are managed within each geographic segment.

United States Market

In fiscal 2011, sales in
the United States including U.S. sales of our Other Businesses accounted for approximately 43% of total revenues, compared to 42% in fiscal 2010 and 2009. Our Other Businesses were primarily comprised of our affiliate brands; Cole Haan,
Converse, Hurley and Umbro (which was acquired on March 3, 2008); and NIKE Golf. We estimate that we sell to more than 20,000 retail accounts in the United States. The NIKE Brand domestic retail account base includes a mix of footwear stores,
sporting goods stores, athletic specialty stores, department stores, skate, tennis and golf shops, and other retail accounts. During fiscal 2011, our three largest customers accounted for approximately 23% of sales in the United States.

We make substantial use of our “futures” ordering program, which allows retailers to order five to six months in advance
of delivery with the commitment that their orders will be delivered within a set time period at a fixed price. In fiscal 2011, 87% of our U.S. wholesale footwear shipments (excluding our Other Businesses) were made under the futures program,
compared to 89% in fiscal 2010 and 2009. In fiscal 2011, 60% of our U.S. wholesale apparel shipments (excluding our Other Businesses) were made under the futures program, compared to 62% in fiscal 2010 and 60% in fiscal 2009.







We utilize 18 NIKE sales offices to solicit sales in the United States. We also utilize 4
independent sales representatives to sell specialty products for golf and 5 for skateboarding and snowboarding products. In addition, our Direct to Consumer operations sell NIKE Brand products through our internet website,www.nikestore.com,
and the following retail outlets in the United States:

NIKE’s three significant distribution centers in the United States for NIKE Brand products,
including NIKE Golf, are located in Memphis, Tennessee. NIKE also operates and leases one facility in Memphis, Tennessee for NIKE Brand product returns. NIKE Brand apparel and equipment products are also shipped from our Foothill Ranch, California
distribution center. Cole Haan products are distributed primarily from Greenland, New Hampshire, and Converse and Hurley products are shipped primarily from Ontario, California.

International Markets

In fiscal 2011, non-U.S.
sales (including non-U.S. sales of our Other Businesses) accounted for 57% of total revenues, compared to 58% in fiscal 2010 and 2009. We sell our products to retail accounts, through our own Direct to Consumer operations, and through a mix of
independent distributors and licensees around the world. We estimate that we sell to more than 20,000 retail accounts outside the United States, excluding sales by independent distributors and licensees. We operate 16 distribution centers outside of
the United States. In many countries and regions, including Canada, Asia, some Latin American countries, and Europe, we have a futures ordering program for retailers similar to the United States futures program described above. During fiscal 2011,
NIKE’s three largest customers outside of the U.S. accounted for approximately 9% of total non-U.S. sales.

Our
Direct to Consumer business operates the following retail outlets outside the United States:

International branch offices and subsidiaries of NIKE are located in Argentina, Australia, Austria,
Belgium, Bermuda, Brazil, Canada, Chile, China, Croatia, Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hong Kong, Hungary, Indonesia, India, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan, Korea, Lebanon, Macau, Malaysia, Mexico,
New Zealand, the Netherlands, Norway, the Philippines, Poland, Portugal, Russia, Singapore, Slovakia, Slovenia, South Africa, Spain, Sri Lanka, Sweden, Switzerland, Taiwan, Thailand, Turkey, the United Arab Emirates, the United Kingdom, Uruguay
and Vietnam.







Significant Customer

No customer accounted for 10% or more of our net sales during fiscal 2011.

Orders

Worldwide futures and advance orders for
NIKE Brand athletic footwear and apparel, scheduled for delivery from June through November 2011, were $10.3 billion compared to $8.8 billion for the same period last year. This futures and advance order amount is calculated based upon our forecast
of the actual exchange rates under which our revenues will be translated during this period, which approximate current spot rates. Reported futures and advance orders are not necessarily indicative of our expectation of revenues for this period.
This is because the mix of orders can shift between futures/advance and at-once orders and the fulfillment of certain of these futures/advance orders may fall outside of the scheduled time period noted above. In addition, foreign currency exchange
rate fluctuations as well as differing levels of order cancellations and discounts can cause differences in the comparisons between futures and advance orders and actual revenues. Moreover, a significant portion of our revenue is not derived from
futures and advance orders, including at-once and close-out sales of NIKE Brand footwear and apparel, sales of NIKE Brand equipment, sales from our Direct to Consumer operations, and sales from our Other Businesses.

Product Research and Development

We believe our research and development efforts are a key factor in our past and future success. Technical innovation in the design of footwear, apparel, and athletic equipment receive continued emphasis
as NIKE strives to produce products that help to reduce injury, enhance athletic performance and maximize comfort.

In
addition to NIKE’s own staff of specialists in the areas of biomechanics, chemistry, exercise physiology, engineering, industrial design, and related fields, we also utilize research committees and advisory boards made up of athletes, coaches,
trainers, equipment managers, orthopedists, podiatrists, and other experts who consult with us and review designs, materials, concepts for product improvements and compliance with product safety regulations around the world. Employee athletes,
athletes engaged under sports marketing contracts and other athletes wear-test and evaluate products during the design and development process.

Manufacturing

Virtually all of our footwear is produced by factories we contract with outside of the United States. In fiscal 2011, contract factories in Vietnam, China, Indonesia, and India manufactured approximately
39%, 33%, 24% and 2% of total NIKE Brand footwear, respectively. We also have manufacturing agreements with independent factories in Argentina, Brazil, India, and Mexico to manufacture footwear for sale primarily within those countries. The largest
single footwear factory that we have contracted with accounted for approximately 6% of total fiscal 2011 NIKE Brand footwear production. Almost all of NIKE Brand apparel is manufactured outside of the United States by independent contract
manufacturers located in 33 countries. Most of this apparel production occurred in China, Thailand, Vietnam, Malaysia, Sri Lanka, Indonesia, Turkey, Cambodia, El Salvador, and Mexico. The largest single apparel factory that we have contracted with
accounted for approximately 7% of total fiscal 2011 apparel production.

The principal materials used in our footwear products
are natural and synthetic rubber, plastic compounds, foam cushioning materials, nylon, leather, canvas, and polyurethane films used to make Air-Sole cushioning components. During fiscal 2011, NIKE IHM, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of NIKE, as
well as independent contractors in China and Taiwan, were our largest suppliers of the Air-Sole cushioning components used in footwear. The principal materials used in our apparel products are natural and synthetic fabrics and threads, plastic and
metal hardware, and specialized performance fabrics designed to repel rain, retain heat, or efficiently transport body moisture. NIKE’s independent contractors and suppliers buy raw materials in bulk for the manufacturing of our footwear,
apparel and equipment products. Most raw materials are available and purchased







by those independent contractors and suppliers in the countries where manufacturing takes place. We have thus far experienced little difficulty in satisfying our raw material requirements.

Since 1972, Sojitz Corporation of America (“Sojitz America”), a large Japanese trading company and the sole owner
of our redeemable preferred stock, has performed significant import-export financing services for us. During fiscal 2011, Sojitz America provided financing and purchasing services for NIKE Brand products sold in Argentina, Uruguay, Canada, Brazil,
India, Indonesia, the Philippines, Malaysia, South Africa, China, Korea, and Thailand, excluding products produced and sold in the same country. Approximately 19% of NIKE Brand sales occurred in those countries. Any failure of Sojitz America to
provide these services or any failure of Sojitz America’s banks could disrupt our ability to acquire products from our suppliers and to deliver products to our customers in those jurisdictions. Such a disruption could result in cancelled orders
that would adversely affect sales and profitability. However, we believe that any such disruption would be short-term in duration due to the ready availability of alternative sources of financing at competitive rates. Our current agreements with
Sojitz America expire on May 31, 2014.

International Operations and Trade

Our international operations and sources of supply are subject to the usual risks of doing business abroad, such as possible revaluation
of currencies, export and import duties, anti-dumping measures, quotas, safeguard measures, trade restrictions, restrictions on the transfer of funds and, in certain parts of the world, political instability and terrorism. We have not, to date, been
materially affected by any such risk, but cannot predict the likelihood of such developments occurring.

The global economic
recession resulted in a significant slow-down in international trade and a sharp rise in protectionist actions around the world. These trends are affecting many global manufacturing and service sectors, and the footwear and apparel industries,
as a whole, are not immune. Companies in our industry are facing trade protectionist challenges in many different regions, and in nearly all cases we are working together to address trade issues to reduce the impact to the industry, while observing
applicable competition laws. Notwithstanding our efforts, such actions, if implemented, could result in increases in the cost of our products, which could adversely affect our sales or profitability and the imported footwear and apparel industry as
a whole. Accordingly, we are actively monitoring the developments described below.

Footwear Imports into the European
Union

In 2005, at the request of the European domestic footwear industry, the European Commission (“EC”)
initiated investigations into leather footwear imported from China and Vietnam. Together with other companies in our industry, we took the position that Special Technology Athletic Footwear (STAF) (i) should not be within the scope of the
investigation, and (ii) does not meet the legal requirements of injury and price in an anti-dumping investigation. Our arguments were successful and the EU agreed in October 2006 on definitive duties of 16.5% for China and 10% for Vietnam for
non-STAF leather footwear, but excluded STAF from the final measures. Prior to the scheduled expiration in October 2008 of the measures imposed on the non-STAF footwear, the domestic industry requested and the EC agreed to review a petition to
extend these restrictions on non-STAF leather footwear. In December 2009, following a review of the ongoing restrictions, EU member states voted to extend the measures for an additional 15 months, until March 31, 2011. In early 2011, the EC
declined to further extend the measures and since April 1, 2011 these restrictions have been terminated. The EC noted that it will be monitoring leather footwear imports from Vietnam and China over the next 12 months and it is hoped that any
increases will not result in renewed trade defense actions by the EC.

On February 3, 2010, the Chinese government
announced it would seek to refer the EU decision (both on the original measures and subsequent review decision) to the World Trade Organization (“WTO”) for its further review and decision. On May 18, 2010, the Dispute Settlement Body
of the WTO agreed to establish a panel to rule on China’s claims against the EU with respect to the above anti-dumping measures. The ruling from the WTO panel is expected in late July or August 2011, after which either party may accept or
appeal the findings.







Footwear, Apparel and Equipment Imports into Brazil and Argentina

At the request of certain domestic footwear industry participants, both Brazil and Argentina have initiated independent anti-dumping
investigations against footwear made in China. Over the last two years, we have been working with a broad coalition of other companies in our industry to challenge these cases on the basis that the athletic footwear being imported from China
(i) should not be within the scope of the investigation, and (ii) does not meet the legal requirements of injury and price in an anti-dumping investigation. In the case of Argentina, in 2010, the final determination made by the
administering authorities was favorable to us. In the case of Brazil, the administering authorities agreed to impose an anti-dumping duty against nearly all footwear from China, which we believe will impact all brands in the footwear industry.
Although we do not currently expect that this decision will materially affect us, we are working with the same broad coalition of footwear companies to challenge this decision in domestic Brazilian courts as well as international forums such as the
WTO.

Many products, including footwear, apparel and equipment products, that we and others in our industry import into
Argentina and Brazil are subject to the WTO non-automatic licensing requirements, which means that it may take up to 60 days for those products to clear customs and enter into those jurisdictions. From time to time, in addition to these WTO
licensing requirements, these jurisdictions impose further importation restrictions or limitations. As a result, we have experienced delays in our ability to import our products or it has taken longer than the time allowed under the WTO for us to
import our products. To date, our business has not been materially affected by these restrictions or delays. In the future, however, if we are unable to import our products into these jurisdictions due to these or other restrictions or if we
experience increasing or more frequent delays beyond the WTO-permitted 60 days to import our products, our business could be materially affected.

Footwear, Apparel and Equipment Imports into Turkey

In 2006, Turkey
introduced safeguard measures in the form of additional duties on all imported footwear into Turkey with the goal of protecting its local shoe manufacturing industry until August 2009. In June 2009, Turkish shoe-manufacturers submitted, and the
Turkish Government agreed to review, a request for extension of the safeguard measures claiming that the rehabilitation process of the local Turkish industry was interrupted due to the continuing increase of footwear imports. Despite the importers
opposition to the continuation of the safeguard measures, the Turkish authorities extended these safeguard measures until August 2012, but reduced the duty from $3 per pair of footwear to $1.60 per pair of footwear.

In 2011, two new safeguard measures and reviews were initiated by the Turkish Undersecretariat of Foreign Trade (“UFT”) on
apparel and equipment imports. In January 2011, the UFT began an investigation on apparel imports that could result in a 20-30% increase in import duties applied to imported apparel products, regardless of country of origin and with only a few
exceptions for countries that currently have a Free Trade Agreement with Turkey. A decision is expected in late July 2011 and if approved, these higher import duties will be in place through July 2014. Together with other companies in our industry,
we are advocating for exclusion of certain apparel products used for sporting activities that cannot be manufactured in Turkey and therefore should not be subject to a higher import duty. In February 2011, the UFT began a review of existing
safeguard measure on travel goods, handbags and similar accessories and containers listed under applicable regulations. One Turkish bag manufacturers association has requested the continuation of the safeguard measures through April 2014, with the
application of an additional import duty of 2.70 USD/kg (max. 4.25 USD/unit), regardless of country of origin. Together with other companies in our industry, we are advocating for the exclusion of non-leather bags from the scope of the continued
safeguards.

Trade Relations with China

China represents an important sourcing country and consumer marketing country for us. Many governments around the world are concerned about China’s growing and fast-paced economy, compliance with WTO
rules, currency valuation, and high trade surpluses. As a result, a wide range of legislative proposals have been introduced to address these concerns. While some of these concerns may be justified, we are working with broad







coalitions of global businesses and trade associations representing a wide variety of sectors (e.g., services, manufacturing, and agriculture) to help ensure any legislation enacted and
implemented (i) addresses legitimate and core concerns, (ii) is consistent with international trade rules, and (iii) reflects and considers China’s domestic economy and the important role it has in the global economic community.
We believe other companies in our industry as well as most other multi-national companies are in a similar position regarding these trade measures.

In the event any of these trade protection measures are implemented, we believe that we have the ability to develop, over a period of time, adequate alternative sources of supply for the products obtained
from our present suppliers. If events prevented us from acquiring products from our suppliers in a particular country, our operations could be temporarily disrupted and we could experience an adverse financial impact. However, we believe we
could abate any such disruption, and that much of the adverse impact on supply would, therefore, be of a short-term nature. We believe our principal competitors are subject to similar risks.

Competition

The athletic footwear, apparel, and
equipment industry is keenly competitive in the United States and on a worldwide basis. We compete internationally with a significant number of athletic and leisure shoe companies, athletic and leisure apparel companies, sports equipment companies,
and large companies having diversified lines of athletic and leisure shoes, apparel, and equipment, including Adidas, Puma, and others. The intense competition and the rapid changes in technology and consumer preferences in the markets for athletic
and leisure footwear and apparel, and athletic equipment, constitute significant risk factors in our operations.

NIKE is the
largest seller of athletic footwear and athletic apparel in the world. Performance and reliability of shoes, apparel, and equipment, new product development, price, product identity through marketing and promotion, and customer support and service
are important aspects of competition in the athletic footwear, apparel, and equipment industry. To help market our products, we contract with prominent and influential athletes, coaches, teams, colleges and sports leagues to endorse our brands and
use our products, and we actively sponsor sporting events and clinics. We believe that we are competitive in all of these areas.

Trademarks and Patents

We utilize trademarks on nearly all of our products and believe having
distinctive marks that are readily identifiable is an important factor in creating a market for our goods, in identifying our brands and the Company, and in distinguishing our goods from the goods of others. We consider our NIKE®and Swoosh Design®trademarks to be among our most valuable assets and we have registered these trademarks in over 150 countries. In addition, we own many other trademarks that we
utilize in marketing our products. We continue to vigorously protect our trademarks against infringement.

NIKE has an exclusive, worldwide license to make and sell footwear using patented “Air” technology. The
process utilizes pressurized gas encapsulated in polyurethane. Some of the early NIKE AIR®patents have expired,
which may enable competitors to use certain types of similar technology. Subsequent NIKE AIR®patents will not
expire for several years. We also have hundreds of U.S. and foreign utility patents, and thousands of U.S. and foreign design patents covering components and features used in various athletic and leisure shoes, apparel, and equipment. These patents
expire at various times, and patents issued for applications filed this year will last from now to 2025 for design patents, and from now to 2031 for utility patents. We believe our success depends primarily upon skills in design, research and
development, production, and marketing rather than upon our patent position. However, we have followed a policy of filing applications for United States and foreign patents on inventions, designs, and improvements that we deem valuable.

Employees

As of May 31, 2011, we had approximately 38,000 employees worldwide, which includes retail and part-time employees. Management considers its relationship with employees to be excellent. None of our
employees







is represented by a union, except for certain employees in the Emerging Markets geography, where local law requires those employees to be represented by a trade union, and in the United States,
where certain employees of Cole Haan are represented by a union. Also, in some countries outside of the United States, local laws require representation for employees by works councils (such as in certain countries in the European Union, in which
they are entitled to information and consultation on certain Company decisions) or other employee representation by an organization similar to a union, and in certain European countries, we are required by local law to enter into and/or comply with
(industry wide or national) collective bargaining agreements. There has never been a material interruption of operations due to labor disagreements.
