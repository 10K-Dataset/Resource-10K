Regions has several
subsidiaries and affiliates which are agents or reinsurers of credit life insurance products relating to the activities of certain affiliates of Regions.

Regions Equipment Finance Corporation, a subsidiary of Regions Bank, provides domestic and international equipment financing products, focusing on commercial clients.







Acquisition Program

A substantial portion of the growth of Regions from its inception as a bank holding company in 1971 has been through the acquisition of other financial institutions, including commercial banks and thrift
institutions, and the assets and deposits of those financial institutions. As part of its ongoing strategic plan, Regions continually evaluates business combination opportunities. Any future business combination or series of business combinations
that Regions might undertake may be material, in terms of assets acquired or liabilities assumed, to Regions’ financial condition. Historically, business combinations in the financial services industry have typically involved the payment of a
premium over book and market values. This practice could result in dilution of book value and net income per share for the acquirer.

Supervision and
Regulation

Introduction

Regions and its subsidiaries are subject to the extensive regulatory framework applicable to bank holding companies and their subsidiaries. Regulation of financial institutions such as Regions and its
subsidiaries is intended primarily for the protection of depositors, the deposit insurance fund of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) and the banking system as a whole, and generally is not intended for the protection of
stockholders or other investors. Described below are the material elements of selected laws and regulations applicable to Regions and its subsidiaries. The descriptions are not intended to be complete and are qualified in their entirety by reference
to the full text of the statutes and regulations described. As of the date of this document, substantial changes to the regulatory framework applicable to Regions and its subsidiaries are being considered by Congress and by U.S. bank regulatory
agencies. For a discussion of such proposed changes, please see “Recent Regulatory Developments” below. Changes in applicable law or regulation, and in their application by regulatory agencies, cannot be predicted, but they may have a
material effect on the business and results of Regions and its subsidiaries.

Regions is a bank holding company, registered
with the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the “Federal Reserve”) and a financial holding company under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (“BHC Act”). As such, Regions and its subsidiaries are
subject to the supervision, examination and reporting requirements of the BHC Act and the regulations of the Federal Reserve.

Under the BHC Act, an eligible bank holding company may elect to be a “financial holding company” and thereafter may engage in a range of activities that are financial in nature and that are not permissible for bank holding
companies that are not financial holding companies. A financial holding company may engage directly or through a subsidiary in the statutorily authorized activities of securities dealing, underwriting and market making, insurance underwriting and
agency activities, merchant banking and insurance company portfolio investments. A financial holding company also may engage in any activity that the Federal Reserve determines by rule or order to be financial in nature, incidental to such financial
activity, or complementary to a financial activity and that does not pose a substantial risk to the safety and soundness of an institution or to the financial system generally.

In addition to these activities, a financial holding company may engage in those activities permissible for a bank holding company that has
not elected to be treated as a financial holding company, including factoring accounts receivable, acquiring and servicing loans, leasing personal property, performing certain data processing services, acting as agent or broker in selling credit
life insurance and certain other types of insurance in connection with credit transactions and conducting certain insurance underwriting activities. The BHC Act does not place territorial limitations on permissible non-banking activities of bank
holding companies. The Federal







Reserve has the power to order any bank holding company or its subsidiaries to terminate any activity or to terminate its ownership or control of any subsidiary when the Federal Reserve has
reasonable grounds to believe that continuation of such activity or such ownership or control constitutes a serious risk to the financial soundness, safety or stability of any bank subsidiary of the bank holding company.

The BHC Act provides generally for “umbrella” regulation of financial holding companies by the Federal Reserve, and for functional
regulation of banking activities by bank regulators, securities activities by securities regulators, and insurance activities by insurance regulators.

For a bank holding company to be eligible for financial holding company status, all of its subsidiary insured depository institutions must be well capitalized and well managed. A bank holding company may
become a financial holding company by filing a declaration with the Federal Reserve that it elects to become a financial holding company. The Federal Reserve must deny expanded authority to any bank holding company with a subsidiary insured
depository institution that received less than a satisfactory rating on its most recent Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 (the “CRA”) review as of the time it submits its declaration. If, after becoming a financial holding company and
undertaking activities not permissible for a bank holding company that is not a financial holding company, the company fails to continue to meet any of the prerequisites for financial holding company status, the company must enter into an agreement
with the Federal Reserve to comply with all applicable capital and management requirements. If the company does not return to compliance within 180 days, the Federal Reserve may order the company to divest its subsidiary banks or the company may
discontinue or divest investments in companies engaged in activities permissible only for a bank holding company that has elected to be treated as a financial holding company.

The BHC Act requires every bank holding company to obtain the prior approval of the Federal Reserve before: (1) it may acquire direct
or indirect ownership or control of any voting shares of any bank or savings and loan association, if after such acquisition, the bank holding company will directly or indirectly own or control 5.0% or more of the voting shares of the institution;
(2) it or any of its subsidiaries, other than a bank, may acquire all or substantially all of the assets of any bank or savings and loan association; or (3) it may merge or consolidate with any other bank holding company.

The BHC Act further provides that the Federal Reserve may not approve any transaction that would result in a monopoly or would be in
furtherance of any combination or conspiracy to monopolize or attempt to monopolize the business of banking in any section of the United States, or the effect of which may be substantially to lessen competition or to tend to create a monopoly in any
section of the country, or that in any other manner would be in restraint of trade, unless the anticompetitive effects of the proposed transaction are clearly outweighed by the public interest in meeting the convenience and needs of the community to
be served. The Federal Reserve is also required to consider the financial and managerial resources and future prospects of the bank holding companies and banks concerned and the convenience and needs of the community to be served. Consideration of
financial resources generally focuses on capital adequacy, and consideration of convenience and needs issues includes the parties’ performance under the CRA, both of which are discussed below. In addition, the Federal Reserve must take into
account the institutions’ effectiveness in combating money laundering.

Regions Bank is a member of the FDIC, and, as
such, its deposits are insured by the FDIC to the extent provided by law. Regions Bank is an Alabama state-chartered bank and is a member of the Federal Reserve System. It is generally subject to supervision and examination by both the Federal
Reserve and the Alabama Department of Banking and subject to numerous statutes and regulations that affect its business activities and operations. The Federal Reserve and the Alabama Department of Banking regularly examine the operations of Regions
Bank and are given authority to approve or disapprove mergers, consolidations, the establishment of branches and similar corporate actions. The federal and state banking regulators also have the power to prevent the continuance or development of
unsafe or unsound banking practices or other violations of law. Various consumer laws and regulations also affect the operations of Regions Bank. In addition, commercial banks are affected significantly by the actions of the Federal Reserve as it
attempts to control money and credit availability in order to influence the economy.







For further discussion regarding the general regulatory environment applicable to Regions
and its subsidiaries, please see “General Regulatory Framework” below.

Recent Regulatory Developments

FDIC Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program.    Regions and Regions Bank have chosen to participate in the
FDIC’s Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program (the “TLGP”), which applies to, among others, all U.S. depository institutions insured by the FDIC and all United States bank holding companies, unless they have opted out. Under the TLGP,
the FDIC guarantees certain senior unsecured debt of Regions and Regions Bank, as well as non-interest bearing transaction account deposits at Regions Bank. Under the transaction account guarantee component of the TLGP, all non-interest bearing
transaction accounts maintained at Regions Bank are insured in full by the FDIC until June 30, 2010, regardless of the standard maximum deposit insurance amounts. Although the transaction account guarantee program was originally scheduled to
expire on December 31, 2009, the FDIC implemented a final rule, effective as of October 1, 2009, extending the transaction account guarantee program by six months until June 30, 2010 (subject to the option of participating
institutions to opt out of such six-month extension). Regions Bank did not choose to opt out of the six-month extension.

On
December 11, 2008, Regions Bank issued and sold $3.5 billion aggregate principal amount of its senior bank notes guaranteed under the TLGP. Regions Bank issued and sold an additional $250 million aggregate principal amount of guaranteed senior
bank notes on December 16, 2008. Under the debt guarantee component of the TLGP, the FDIC will pay the unpaid principal and/or interest on such FDIC-guaranteed debt instruments upon the uncured failure of Regions Bank to make a timely payment
of principal and/or interest. Neither Regions nor Regions Bank is permitted to use the proceeds from the sale of securities guaranteed under the TLGP to prepay any of its other debt that is not guaranteed by the FDIC. The deadline to issue debt
guaranteed by the FDIC under the debt guarantee component of the TLGP has expired and, therefore, neither Regions nor Regions Bank may in the future issue any new securities guaranteed under such program.

U.S. Treasury Capital Purchase Program

Comprehensive Financial Stability Plan of
2009.    On February 10, 2009, Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner announced a new comprehensive financial stability plan (the “Financial Stability Plan”), which earmarked the second $350 billion of unused
funds originally authorized under the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008.

The major elements of the Financial
Stability Plan included: (i) a capital assistance program that has invested in convertible preferred stock of certain qualifying institutions, (ii) a consumer and business lending







initiative to fund new consumer loans, small business loans and commercial mortgage asset-backed securities issuances, (iii) a public-private investment fund intended to leverage public and
private capital with public financing to purchase up to $500 billion to $1 trillion of legacy “toxic assets” from financial institutions, and (iv) assistance for homeowners by providing up to $75 billion to reduce mortgage payments
and interest rates and establishing loan modification guidelines for government and private programs.

In addition, pursuant
to the Federal Reserve’s Supervisory Capital Assessment Program (the “SCAP”), all banking institutions with assets over $100 billion, such as Regions, were required to undergo a comprehensive “stress test” to determine if
they had sufficient capital to continue lending and to absorb losses that could result from a more severe decline in the economy than projected. Pursuant to such stress test, it was determined that Regions was required to raise additional capital.
Regions fulfilled the SCAP requirement primarily through the issuance of common and preferred securities. The Company’s public equity offering of common stock, announced May 20, 2009, resulted in the issuance of 460 million shares at
$4 per share, generating proceeds of approximately $1.8 billion, net of issuance costs. At the same date, the Company issued 287,500 shares of mandatory convertible preferred stock, Series B, generating net proceeds of $278 million. In addition to
these offerings, the Company exchanged approximately 33 million common shares for $202 million of outstanding 6.625% trust preferred securities issued by an affiliated Trust. The Company also sold shares in Visa Inc. and other securities, which
generated additional capital.

Regulatory Reform.In June of 2009, the current administration
proposed a wide range of regulatory reforms that, if enacted, may have significant effects on the financial services industry in the United States. Significant aspects of the current administration’s proposals included, among other things,
proposals (i) that any financial firm whose combination of size, leverage and interconnectedness could pose a threat to financial stability (known as “Tier 1 FHCs”) be subject to certain enhanced regulatory requirements, as discussed
below, (ii) that federal bank regulators require loan originators or sponsors to retain part of the credit risk of securitized exposures, (iii) that there be increased regulation of broker-dealers and investment advisers, (iv) for the
creation of a federal consumer financial protection agency that would have broad authority to regulate providers of credit, savings, payment and other consumer financial products and services, (v) that there be comprehensive regulation of OTC
derivatives, (vi) that the controls on the ability of banking institutions to engage in transactions with affiliates be tightened, and (vii) that financial holding companies (such as Regions) be required to be “well-capitalized”
and “well managed” on a consolidated basis.

The U.S. Congress, state lawmaking bodies and federal and state
regulatory agencies continue to consider a number of wide-ranging and comprehensive proposals for altering the structure, regulation and competitive relationships of the nation’s financial institutions, including rules and regulations related
to the broad range of reform proposals set forth by the current administration described above. Separate comprehensive financial reform bills intended to address the proposals set forth by the current administration were introduced in both houses of
Congress in the second half of 2009 and remain under review by both the U.S. House of Representatives and the U.S. Senate. In addition, both the U.S. Treasury Department and the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (the “Basel
Committee”) have issued policy statements regarding proposed significant changes to the regulatory capital framework applicable to banking organizations. For a discussion of such proposals, please see “General Regulatory
Framework—Capital Adequacy” below.

It cannot be predicted whether or in what form further legislation and/or
regulations may be adopted or the extent to which Regions’ business may be affected thereby.

Tier 1 FHC
Status.    As noted above, the current administration has proposed that so-called Tier 1 FHCs be subject to certain enhanced regulatory requirements. If Regions were deemed to be a Tier 1 FHC, it would be subject to such
requirements. Among other things, Tier 1 FHCs would be subject to stricter and more conservative capital, liquidity and risk management standards, a new prompt corrective action regime (similar to that which already exists for insured depository
institutions), enhanced public disclosures, and a requirement that they have in place a credible plan for the rapid resolution of the firm in the event of severe financial distress. There would also be a focus on the sufficiency of high-quality
capital in stressed economic scenarios. Moreover,







Tier 1 FHC subsidiaries (whether regulated or unregulated) would be subject to consolidated supervision by the Federal Reserve, although functionally regulated subsidiaries (such as banks and
broker-dealers) would continue to be supervised by their primary federal regulators.

Incentive
Compensation

The scope and content of the U.S. banking regulators’ policies on executive compensation are continuing to develop and are likely to
continue evolving in the near future. It cannot be determined at this time whether compliance with such policies will adversely affect the ability of Regions and its subsidiaries to hire, retain and motivate their key employees.

Financial Crisis Responsibility Fees.    On January 14, 2010, the current administration announced a
proposal to impose a fee (the “Financial Crisis Responsibility Fee”) on those financial institutions that benefited from recent actions taken by the U.S. government to stabilize the financial system. If implemented as initially proposed,
the Financial Crisis Responsibility Fee will be applied to firms with over $50 billion in consolidated assets, and, therefore, by its terms would apply to Regions. The Financial Crisis Responsibility Fee would be collected by the Internal Revenue
Service and would be approximately fifteen basis points, or 0.15%, of an amount calculated by subtracting a covered institution’s Tier 1 capital and FDIC-assessed deposits (and/or an adjustment for insurance liabilities covered by state
guarantee funds) from such institution’s total assets.

The Financial Crisis Responsibility Fee, if implemented as
proposed by the current administration, would go into effect on June 30, 2010 and remain in place for at least ten years. The U.S. Treasury would be asked to report after five years on the effectiveness of the Financial Crisis Responsibility
Fee as well as its progress in repaying projected losses to the U.S. government as a result of the TARP. If losses to the U.S. government as a result of TARP have not been recouped after ten years, the Financial Crisis Responsibility Fee would
remain in place until such losses have been recovered.

General Regulatory Framework

Capital Adequacy.Regions and Regions Bank are required to comply with the applicable capital adequacy
standards established by the Federal Reserve. There are two basic measures of capital adequacy for bank holding companies that have been promulgated by the Federal Reserve: a risk-based measure and a leverage measure.

The risk-based capital standards are designed to make regulatory capital requirements more sensitive to differences in credit and market
risk profiles among banks and financial holding companies, to account for off-balance sheet exposure, and to minimize disincentives for holding liquid assets. Assets and off-balance sheet







items are assigned to broad risk categories, each with appropriate weights. The resulting capital ratios represent capital as a percentage of total risk-weighted assets and off-balance sheet
items.

The minimum guideline
to be considered “well capitalized” for Tier 1 Capital and Total Capital is 6.0% and 10.0%, respectively. At December 31, 2009, Regions’ consolidated Tier 1 Capital ratio was 11.54% and its Total Capital ratio was 15.78%. The
elements currently comprising Tier 1 Capital and Tier 2 Capital and the minimum Tier 1 Capital and Total Capital ratios may in the future be subject to change, as discussed in greater detail below.

In addition, the Federal Reserve has established minimum leverage ratio guidelines to be considered “well capitalized” for bank
holding companies. These guidelines provide for a minimum ratio of Tier 1 Capital to average total assets, less goodwill and certain other intangible assets (the “Leverage Ratio”), of 3.0% for bank holding companies that meet certain
specified criteria, including having the highest regulatory rating. All other bank holding companies generally are required to maintain a Leverage Ratio of at least 4%. Regions’ Leverage Ratio at December 31, 2009 was 8.90%.

In connection with the SCAP, banking regulators began supplementing their assessment of the capital adequacy of a bank based on tangible
common stockholders’ equity and a variation of Tier 1 Capital, known as Tier 1 common equity. While not formally defined, analysts and banking regulators have assessed Regions’ capital adequacy using the tangible common stockholders’
equity and/or the Tier 1 common equity measure. Because tangible common stockholders’ equity and Tier 1 common equity are not formally defined by GAAP or formalized in the federal banking regulations, these measures are considered to be
non-GAAP financial measures and other entities may calculate them differently than Regions’ disclosed calculations (see the “GAAP to Non-GAAP Reconciliation” section of Item 6. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operation” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details).

The guidelines
also provide that bank holding companies experiencing internal growth or making acquisitions will be expected to maintain strong capital positions substantially above the minimum supervisory levels without significant reliance on intangible assets.
Furthermore, the Federal Reserve has indicated that it will consider a “tangible Tier 1 Capital leverage ratio” (deducting all intangibles) and other indicators of capital strength in evaluating proposals for expansion or new activities.

A subsidiary bank is subject to substantially similar risk-based and leverage capital requirements as those applicable to
Regions. Regions Bank was in compliance with applicable minimum capital requirements as of December 31, 2009. Neither Regions nor Regions Bank has been advised by any federal banking agency of any specific minimum capital ratio requirement
applicable to it as of December 31, 2009.







Failure to meet capital guidelines could subject a bank to a variety of enforcement
remedies, including the termination of deposit insurance by the FDIC, and to certain restrictions on its business. See “Regulatory Remedies under the FDIA” below.

In July 2008,the U.S. bank regulatory agencies issued a proposed rule that would provide banking organizations that do not use the advanced approaches with the option to implement a new risk-based capital framework. This framework
would adopt the standardized approach of Basel II for credit risk, the basic indicator approach of Basel II for operational risk, and related disclosure requirements. While this proposed rule generally parallels the relevant approaches under Basel
II, it diverges where United States markets have unique characteristics and risk profiles, most notably with respect to risk weighting residential mortgage exposures. Comments on the proposed rule were due to the agencies by October 27, 2008,
but a definitive final rule had not been issued as of December 31, 2009. The proposed rule, if adopted, would replace the agencies’ earlier proposed amendments to existing risk-based capital guidelines to make them more risk sensitive
(formerly referred to as the “Basel I-A” approach).

On September 3, 2009, the United States Treasury
Department issued a policy statement (the “Treasury Policy Statement”) entitled “Principles for Reforming the U.S. and International Regulatory Capital Framework for Banking Firms.” The Treasury Policy Statement was developed in
consultation with the U.S. bank regulatory agencies and sets forth eight “core principles” intended to shape a new international capital accord. Six of the core principles relate directly to bank capital requirements. The Treasury Policy
Statement contemplates changes to the existing regulatory capital regime that would involve substantial revisions to, if not replacement of, major parts of the Basel I and Basel II capital frameworks and affect all regulated banking organizations
and other systemically important institutions. The Treasury Policy Statement repeatedly calls for higher and stronger capital requirements for Tier 1 FHCs that are deemed to pose a risk to financial stability due to their combination of size,
leverage, interconnectedness and liquidity risk. It is possible that Regions would be deemed a Tier 1 FHC and subject to such heightened capital requirements if implemented.

The Treasury Policy Statement suggested that changes to the regulatory capital framework be phased in over a period of several years. The
recommended schedule provides for a comprehensive international agreement by December 31, 2010, with the implementation of reforms by December 31, 2012, although it does remain possible that U.S. bank regulatory agencies could officially
adopt, or informally implement, new capital standards at an earlier date.

Following the issuance of the Treasury Policy
Statement on December 17, 2009, the Basel Committee issued a set of proposals (the “Capital Proposals”) that would significantly revise the definitions of Tier 1 Capital







and Tier 2 Capital, with the most significant changes being to Tier 1 Capital. Most notably, the Capital Proposals would disqualify certain structured capital instruments, such as trust preferred
securities, from Tier 1 Capital status. The Capital Proposals would also re-emphasize that common equity is the predominant component of Tier 1 Capital by adding a minimum common equity to risk-weighted assets ratio and requiring that goodwill,
general intangibles and certain other items that currently must be deducted from Tier 1 Capital instead be deducted from common equity as a component of Tier 1 Capital. The Capital Proposals also leave open the possibility that the Basel Committee
will recommend changes to the minimum Tier 1 Capital and Total Capital ratios of 4.0% and 8.0%, respectively.

Concurrently
with the release of the Capital Proposals, the Basel Committee also released a set of proposals related to liquidity risk exposure (the “Liquidity Proposals,” and together with the Capital Proposals, the “2009 Basel Committee
Proposals”). The Liquidity Proposals have three key elements, including the implementation of (i) a “liquidity coverage ratio” designed to ensure that a bank maintains an adequate level of unencumbered, high-quality assets
sufficient to meet the bank’s liquidity needs over a 30-day time horizon under an acute liquidity stress scenario, (ii) a “net stable funding ratio” designed to promote more medium and long-term funding of the assets and
activities of banks over a one-year time horizon, and (iii) a set of monitoring tools that the Basel Committee indicates should be considered as the minimum types of information that banks should report to supervisors and that supervisors
should use in monitoring the liquidity risk profiles of supervised entities.

Comments on the 2009 Basel Committee Proposals
are due by April 16, 2010, with the expectation that the Basel Committee will release a comprehensive set of proposals by December 31, 2010 and that final provisions will be implemented by December 31, 2012. The U.S. bank regulators
have urged comment on the 2009 Basel Committee Proposals. Ultimate implementation of such proposals in the U.S. will be subject to the discretion of the U.S. bank regulators, and the regulations or guidelines adopted by such agencies may, of course,
differ from the 2009 Basel Committee Proposals and other proposals that the Basel Committee may promulgate in the future.

Safety and Soundness Standards.



Regulatory Remedies under the FDIA.The FDIA establishes a system of regulatory remedies to resolve the
problems of undercapitalized institutions. The federal banking regulators have established five capital categories (“well capitalized,” “adequately capitalized,” “undercapitalized,” “significantly
undercapitalized” and “critically undercapitalized”) and must take certain mandatory supervisory actions, and are authorized to take







other discretionary actions, with respect to institutions in the three undercapitalized categories, the severity of which will depend upon the capital category in which the institution is placed.
Generally, subject to a narrow exception, the FDIA requires the banking regulator to appoint a receiver or conservator for an institution that is critically undercapitalized. The federal banking agencies have specified by regulation the relevant
capital level for each category.

An institution that is categorized as undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized or critically undercapitalized is required to submit an acceptable capital restoration plan to its appropriate
federal banking regulator. Under the FDIA, in order for the capital restoration plan to be accepted by the appropriate federal banking agency, a bank holding company must guarantee that a subsidiary depository institution will comply with its
capital restoration plan, subject to certain limitations. The bank holding company must also provide appropriate assurances of performance. The obligation of a controlling bank holding company under the FDIA to fund a capital restoration plan is
limited to the lesser of 5.0% of an undercapitalized subsidiary’s assets or the amount required to meet regulatory capital requirements. An undercapitalized institution is also generally prohibited from increasing its average total assets,
making acquisitions, establishing any branches or engaging in any new line of business, except in accordance with an accepted capital restoration plan or with the approval of the FDIC. In addition, the appropriate federal banking agency is given
authority with respect to any undercapitalized depository institution to take any of the actions it is required to or may take with respect to a significantly undercapitalized institution as described below if it determines “that those actions
are necessary to carry out the purpose” of the FDIA.

Institutions that are significantly undercapitalized or
undercapitalized and either fail to submit an acceptable capital restoration plan or fail to implement an approved capital restoration plan may be subject to a number of requirements and restrictions, including orders to sell sufficient voting stock
to become adequately capitalized, requirements to reduce total assets and cessation of receipt of deposits from correspondent banks. Critically undercapitalized depository institutions are subject to appointment of a receiver or conservator.

At December 31, 2009, Regions Bank had the requisite capital levels to qualify as well capitalized.

Payment of Dividends.Regions is a legal entity separate and distinct from its banking and other subsidiaries.
The principal source of cash flow of Regions, including cash flow to pay dividends to its stockholders and principal and interest on any debt of Regions, is dividends from Regions Bank. There are statutory and regulatory limitations on the payment
of dividends by Regions Bank to Regions, as well as by Regions to its stockholders.







As to the payment of dividends, Regions Bank is subject to the laws of the state of Alabama,
and the regulations of the Alabama State Banking Department, and of the Federal Reserve. The payment of dividends by Regions and Regions Bank may also be affected or limited by other factors, such as the requirement to maintain adequate capital
above regulatory guidelines.

If, in the opinion of a federal bank regulatory agency, an institution under its jurisdiction is
engaged in or is about to engage in an unsafe or unsound practice (which, depending on the financial condition of the institution, could include the payment of dividends), such agency may require, after notice and hearing, that such institution
cease and desist from such practice. The federal bank regulatory agencies have indicated that paying dividends that deplete an institution’s capital base to an inadequate level would be an unsafe and unsound banking practice. Under the FDIA, an
insured institution may not pay any dividend if payment would cause it to become “undercapitalized” or if it already is “undercapitalized.” See “Regulatory Remedies under the FDIA” above. Moreover, the Federal Reserve
and the FDIC have issued policy statements stating that bank holding companies and insured banks should generally pay dividends only out of current operating earnings.

However, the ability of Regions to pay dividends to its stockholders is not totally dependent on the receipt of dividends from Regions Bank,
as Regions has other cash available to make such payment. As of December 31, 2009, Regions had $8.0 billion of cash and cash equivalents on a consolidated basis, of which $4.1 billion is attributable to the parent company. These funds are
available for corporate purposes, including debt service and to pay dividends to its stockholders. This is compared to an anticipated common dividend requirement, assuming current dividend payment levels, of approximately $48 million and preferred
cash dividends of approximately $202 million for the full year 2010. Expected long-term borrowings maturities in 2010 are approximately $5.5 billion.

Although Regions currently has capacity to make common dividend payments in 2010, the payment of dividends by Regions and the dividend rate are subject to management review and approval by Regions’
Board of Directors on a quarterly basis. In the current financial and economic environment, the Federal Reserve has indicated that bank holding companies should carefully review their dividend policy and has discouraged payment ratios that are at
maximum allowable levels unless both asset quality and capital are very strong. Regions has reduced its quarterly dividend to $0.01 per share and does not expect to increase its quarterly dividend above such level for the foreseeable future.
Preferred dividends are to be paid in accordance with the terms of the CPP and Regions Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock, Series B. See Item 1A. “Risk Factors” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.

Prior to November 14, 2011, unless Regions has redeemed all of the Series A Preferred Stock issued to the U.S. Treasury
on November 14, 2008 or unless the U.S. Treasury has transferred all the preferred securities to a third party, the consent of the U.S. Treasury will be required for Regions to declare or pay any dividend or make any distribution on common
stock other than (i) regular quarterly cash dividends of not more than $0.10 per







share, as adjusted for any stock split, stock dividend, reverse stock split, reclassification or similar transaction, (ii) dividends payable solely in shares of common stock and
(iii) dividends or distributions of rights or junior stock in connection with a stockholders’ rights plan. Regions has reduced its quarterly dividend to $0.01 per share and does not expect to increase its quarterly dividend above such
level for the foreseeable future.

Support of Subsidiary Banks.Under Federal Reserve policy,
Regions is expected to act as a source of financial strength to, and to commit resources to support, its subsidiary bank. This support may be required at times when, absent such Federal Reserve policy, Regions may not be inclined to provide it. In
addition, any capital loans by a bank holding company to its subsidiary bank are subordinate in right of payment to deposits and to certain other indebtedness of such subsidiary bank. In the event of a bank holding company’s bankruptcy, any
commitment by the bank holding company to a federal bank regulatory agency to maintain the capital of a subsidiary bank will be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee and entitled to a priority of payment.

Cross-Guarantee Provisions.    Each insured depository institution “controlled” (as defined in the BHC
Act) by the same bank holding company can be held liable to the FDIC for any loss incurred, or reasonably expected to be incurred, by the FDIC due to the default of any other insured depository institution controlled by that holding company and for
any assistance provided by the FDIC to any of those banks that is in danger of default. Such a “cross-guarantee” claim against a depository institution is generally superior in right of payment to claims of the holding company and its
affiliates against that depository institution. At this time, Regions Bank is the only insured depository institution controlled by Regions for this purpose. If in the future, however, Regions were to control other insured depository institutions,
such cross-guarantee would apply to all such insured depository institutions.

FDIC Insurance
Assessments.Regions Bank pays deposit insurance premiums to the FDIC based on an assessment rate established by the FDIC. FDIC rates generally depend upon a combination of regulatory ratings and financial ratios.
Regulatory ratings reflect the applicable bank regulatory agency’s evaluation of the financial institution’s capital, asset quality, management, earnings, liquidity and sensitivity to risk. On February 27, 2009, the FDIC issued a
final rule (the “New Assessments Rule”) modifying the risk-based assessment system. The New Assessments Rule provides that the assessment rate for large institutions that have long-term debt issuer ratings will be determined using a
combination of the institution’s weighted average regulatory ratings, its long-term debt issuer ratings and the institution’s financial ratios, each equally weighted. The New Assessments Rule also introduced a new financial ratio into the
relevant set of calculations that is intended to capture certain brokered deposits (in excess of 10% of domestic deposits) that are used to fund rapid asset growth.

Initially, assessment rates for institutions that are in the lowest risk category, generally varied from five to seven basis points per $100 of insured deposits. On December 16, 2008, however, the
FDIC adopted a final rule, effective as of January 1, 2009, increasing risk-based assessment rates uniformly by seven basis points (on an annual basis) for the first quarter of 2009. The New Assessment Rule increases initial base assessment
rates







(beginning April 1, 2009) to twelve to forty-five basis points per $100 of insured deposits. Such base assessment rates are subject to adjustments based upon the institution’s ratio of
(i) long-term unsecured debt to its domestic deposits, (ii) secured liabilities to domestic deposits and (iii) brokered deposits to domestic deposits (if greater than 10%). The stated purposes of the New Assessments Rule is to make
the assessment system more sensitive to risk and more fair by limiting the subsidization of riskier institutions by safer institutions.

In addition, on November 17, 2009, the FDIC implemented a final rule requiring insured institutions, such as Regions Bank, to prepay their estimated quarterly risk-based assessments for the fourth
quarter of 2009, and for all of 2010, 2011 and 2012. Such prepaid assessments were paid on December 30, 2009, along with each institution’s quarterly risk-based deposit insurance assessment for the third quarter of 2009 (assuming 5% annual
growth in deposits between the third quarter of 2009 and the end of 2012 and taking into account, for 2011 and 2012, the annualized three basis point increase referred to in the following paragraph). The FDIC will begin to draw down an
institution’s prepaid assessments on March 30, 2010, representing payment for the regular quarterly risk-based assessment for the fourth quarter of 2009.

Under the FDI Reform Act and the FDIC’s revised premium assessment program, every
FDIC-insured institution will pay some level of deposit insurance assessments regardless of the level of the DRR. We cannot predict whether, as a result of an adverse change in economic conditions or other reasons, the FDIC will in the future
further increase deposit insurance assessment levels. The FDIC also adopted rules providing for a one-time credit assessment to each eligible insured depository institution based on the assessment base of the institution on December 31, 1996.
The credit was allowed to be applied against the institution’s 2007 assessment, and for the three years thereafter the institution was allowed to apply the credit against up to 90% of its assessment. Regions Bank qualified for a credit of
approximately $110 million, of which $34 million was applied in 2007, $41 million in 2008, and the remaining balance of $35 million in 2009, thereby exhausting the credit.For more information, see the “Bank Regulatory Capital
Requirements” section of Item 6. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

In addition, the Deposit Insurance Funds Act of 1996 authorized the Financing Corporation (“FICO”) to impose assessments on DIF
applicable deposits in order to service the interest on FICO’s bond obligations from deposit insurance fund assessments. The amount assessed on individual institutions by FICO will be in addition to the amount, if any, paid for deposit
insurance according to the FDIC’s risk-related assessment rate schedules. FICO assessment rates may be adjusted quarterly to reflect a change in assessment base. The FICO annual assessment rate for the fourth quarter of 2009 was 1.02 cents per
$100 deposits and will rise to 1.06 cents per $100 deposits for the first quarter of 2010. Regions Bank had a FICO assessment of $9 million in FDIC deposit premiums in 2009.







Under the FDIA, insurance of deposits may be terminated by the FDIC upon a finding that the
institution has engaged in unsafe and unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations, or has violated any applicable law, regulation, rule, order or condition imposed by the FDIC.

Depositor Preference.The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 provides that deposits and certain claims
for administrative expenses and employee compensation against an insured depository institution would be afforded a priority over other general unsecured claims against such an institution in the “liquidation or other resolution” of such
an institution by any receiver.

Regulation of Morgan Keegan.As a registered investment adviser
and broker-dealer, Morgan Keegan is subject to regulation and examination by the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (“FINRA”), the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”)
and other self-regulatory organizations (“SROs”), which may affect its manner of operation and profitability. Such regulations cover a broad range of subject matter. Rules and regulations for registered broker-dealers cover such issues as:
capital requirements; sales and trading practices; use of client funds and securities; the conduct of directors, officers and employees; record-keeping and recording; supervisory procedures to prevent improper trading on material non-public
information; qualification and licensing of sales personnel; and limitations on the extension of credit in securities transactions. Rules and regulations for registered investment advisers include limitations on the ability of investment advisers to
charge performance-based or non-refundable fees to clients, record-keeping and reporting requirements, disclosure requirements, limitations on principal transactions between an adviser or its affiliates and advisory clients, and anti-fraud
standards.

Morgan Keegan is subject to the net capital requirements set forth in Rule 15c3-1 of the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934. The net capital requirements measure the general financial condition and liquidity of a broker-dealer by specifying a minimum level of net capital that a broker-dealer must maintain, and by requiring that a significant portion of its assets
be kept liquid. If Morgan Keegan failed to maintain its minimum required net capital, it would be required to cease executing customer transactions until it came back into compliance. This could also result in Morgan Keegan losing its FINRA
membership, its registration with the SEC or require a complete liquidation.

The SEC’s risk assessment rules also apply
to Morgan Keegan as a registered broker-dealer. These rules require broker-dealers to maintain and preserve records and certain information, describe risk management policies and procedures, and report on the financial condition of affiliates whose
financial and securities activities are reasonably likely to have a material impact on the financial and operational condition of the broker-dealer. Certain “material associated persons” of Morgan Keegan, as defined in the risk assessment
rules, may also be subject to SEC regulation.

In addition to federal registration, state securities commissions require the
registration of certain broker-dealers and investment advisers. Morgan Keegan is registered as a broker-dealer with every state, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico. Morgan Keegan is registered as an investment adviser in over 40 states and
the District of Columbia.

Violations of federal, state and SRO rules or regulations may result in the revocation of
broker-dealer or investment adviser licenses, imposition of censures or fines, the issuance of cease and desist orders, and the suspension or expulsion of officers and employees from the securities business firm. In addition, Morgan Keegan’s
business may be materially affected by new rules and regulations issued by the SEC or SROs as well as any changes in the enforcement of existing laws and rules that affect its securities business.

Regulation of Insurers and Insurance Brokers.Regions’ operations in the areas of insurance brokerage and
reinsurance of credit life insurance are subject to regulation and supervision by various state insurance regulatory authorities. Although the scope of regulation and form of supervision may vary from state to state, insurance laws generally grant
broad discretion to regulatory authorities in adopting regulations and supervising







regulated activities. This supervision generally includes the licensing of insurance brokers and agents and the regulation of the handling of customer funds held in a fiduciary capacity. Certain
of Regions’ insurance company subsidiaries are subject to extensive regulatory supervision and to insurance laws and regulations requiring, among other things, maintenance of capital, record keeping, reporting and examinations.

Financial Privacy.    The federal banking regulators have adopted rules that limit the ability of banks and other
financial institutions to disclose non-public information about consumers to non-affiliated third parties. These limitations require disclosure of privacy policies to consumers and, in some circumstances, allow consumers to prevent disclosure of
certain personal information to a non-affiliated third party. These regulations affect how consumer information is transmitted through diversified financial companies and conveyed to outside vendors. In addition, consumers may also prevent
disclosure of certain information among affiliated companies that is assembled or used to determine eligibility for a product or service, such as that shown on consumer credit reports and asset and income information from applications. Consumers
also have the option to direct banks and other financial institutions not to share information about transactions and experiences with affiliated companies for the purpose of marketing products or services.

Office of Foreign Assets Control Regulation.    The United States has imposed economic sanctions that affect
transactions with designated foreign countries, nationals and others. These are typically known as the “OFAC” rules based on their administration by the U.S. Treasury Department Office of Foreign Assets Control







(“OFAC”). The OFAC-administered sanctions targeting countries take many different forms. Generally, however, they contain one or more of the following elements: (i) restrictions on
trade with or investment in a sanctioned country, including prohibitions against direct or indirect imports from and exports to a sanctioned country and prohibitions on “U.S. persons” engaging in financial transactions relating to making
investments in, or providing investment-related advice or assistance to, a sanctioned country; and (ii) a blocking of assets in which the government or specially designated nationals of the sanctioned country have an interest, by prohibiting
transfers of property subject to U.S. jurisdiction (including property in the possession or control of U.S. persons). Blocked assets (e.g., property and bank deposits) cannot be paid out, withdrawn, set off or transferred in any manner without a
license from OFAC. Failure to comply with these sanctions could have serious legal and reputational consequences.

Competition

All aspects of Regions’ business are highly competitive. Regions’ subsidiaries compete with other financial
institutions located in the states in which they operate and other adjoining states, as well as large banks in major financial centers and other financial intermediaries, such as savings and loan associations, credit unions, consumer finance
companies, brokerage firms, insurance companies, investment companies, mutual funds, mortgage companies and financial service operations of major commercial and retail corporations. Regions expects competition to intensify among financial services
companies due to the recent consolidation of certain competing financial institutions and the conversion of certain investment banks to bank holding companies.

Customers for banking services and other financial services offered by Regions’ subsidiaries are generally influenced by convenience, quality of service, personal contacts, price of services and
availability of products. Although Regions’ position varies in different markets, Regions believes that its affiliates effectively compete with other financial services companies in their relevant market areas.

Employees

As of
December 31, 2009, Regions and its subsidiaries had 28,509 employees.
