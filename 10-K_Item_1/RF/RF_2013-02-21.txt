Item 1.Business

Regions Financial Corporation (together with its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis, “Regions” or “Company”) is a financial holding company headquartered in Birmingham, Alabama,
which operates in the South, Midwest and Texas. Regions provides traditional commercial, retail and mortgage banking services, as well as other financial services in the fields of asset management, wealth management, securities brokerage, insurance
and other specialty financing. At December 31, 2012, Regions had total consolidated assets of approximately $121.3 billion, total consolidated deposits of approximately $95.5 billion and total consolidated stockholders’ equity of
approximately $15.5 billion.

Regions is a Delaware corporation and on July 1, 2004, became the successor by merger to
Union Planters Corporation and the former Regions Financial Corporation. Its principal executive offices are located at 1900 Fifth Avenue North, Birmingham, Alabama 35203, and its telephone number at that address is (800) 734-4667.

Banking Operations

Regions conducts its banking operations through Regions Bank, an Alabama chartered commercial bank that is a member of the Federal Reserve
System. At December 31, 2012, Regions operated approximately 2,100 ATMs and 1,700 banking offices in Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, North Carolina, South Carolina,
Tennessee, Texas and Virginia.

Other Financial Services Operations

In addition to its banking operations, Regions provides additional financial services through the following subsidiaries:

Regions Insurance Group, Inc., a subsidiary of Regions Financial Corporation, is an insurance broker that offers insurance products through its subsidiaries Regions Insurance, Inc., headquartered in
Birmingham, Alabama, and Regions Insurance Services, Inc., headquartered in Memphis, Tennessee. Through its insurance







brokerage operations in Alabama, Arkansas, Indiana, Georgia, Louisiana, Missouri, Mississippi, Tennessee and Texas, Regions Insurance, Inc. offers insurance coverage for various lines of personal
and commercial insurance, such as property, casualty, life, health and accident insurance. Regions Insurance Services, Inc. offers credit-related insurance products, such as title, mortgage, crop, term life, accidental death and dismemberment, and
environmental insurance, as well as debt cancellation products to customers of Regions. Regions Insurance Group, Inc. is one of the twenty-five largest insurance brokers in the United States based on annual revenues.

Regions has several subsidiaries and affiliates that are agents or reinsurers of debt cancellations products and credit life insurance
products relating to the activities of certain affiliates of Regions. Regions Investment Services, Inc., which sells annuities and life insurance products to Regions Bank customers, is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Regions Bank. Regions Equipment
Finance Corporation, a subsidiary of Regions Bank, provides domestic and international equipment financing products, focusing on commercial clients.

Also, Regions Bank has entered into an agreement with Cetera Financial Institutions to provide advisory and investment solutions to Regions customers. Through this agreement Regions Bank customers will
have access to a full range of financial advisory services, including managed accounts, mutual funds, annuities, financial aid, and financial and retirement planning tools, provided by licensed business consultants based in Regions Bank branches.

Acquisition Program

A substantial portion of the growth of Regions from its inception as a bank holding company in 1971 has been through the acquisition of other financial institutions, including commercial banks and thrift
institutions, and the assets and deposits of those financial institutions. As part of its ongoing strategic plan, Regions periodically evaluates business combination opportunities. Any future business combination or series of business combinations
that Regions might undertake may be material to Regions’ financial condition, in terms of assets acquired or liabilities assumed. Historically, business combinations in the financial services industry have typically involved the payment of a
premium over book and market values of assets and liabilities acquired. This practice could result in dilution of book value and net income per share for the acquirer.

Supervision and Regulation

Regions and its subsidiaries are subject to the
extensive regulatory framework applicable to bank holding companies and their subsidiaries. Regulation of financial institutions such as Regions and its subsidiaries is intended primarily for the protection of depositors, the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corporation’s (“FDIC”) Deposit Insurance Fund (the “DIF”) and the banking system as a whole, and generally is not intended for the protection of stockholders or other investors. Described below are the material
elements of selected laws and regulations applicable to Regions and its subsidiaries. The descriptions are not intended to be complete and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the full text of the statutes and regulations described.
Changes in applicable law or regulation, and in their interpretation and application by regulatory agencies and other governmental authorities, cannot be predicted, but they may have a material effect on the business and results of Regions and its
subsidiaries.

Overview

Regions is registered with the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the “Federal Reserve”) as a bank holding company and has elected to be treated as a financial holding company
under the Bank Holding







Company Act of 1956, as amended (“BHC Act”). As such, Regions and its subsidiaries are subject to the supervision, examination and reporting requirements of the BHC Act and the
regulations of the Federal Reserve.

Generally, the BHC Act provides for “umbrella” regulation of financial holding
companies by the Federal Reserve and functional regulation of holding company subsidiaries by applicable regulatory agencies. The BHC Act, however, requires the Federal Reserve to examine any subsidiary of a bank holding company, other than a
depository institution, engaged in activities permissible for a depository institution. The Federal Reserve is also granted the authority, in certain circumstances, to require reports of, examine and adopt rules applicable to any holding company
subsidiary.

Regions Bank is a member of the FDIC, and, as such, its deposits are insured by the FDIC to the
extent provided by law. Regions Bank is an Alabama state-chartered bank and a member of the Federal Reserve System. It is generally subject to supervision and examination by both the Federal Reserve and the Alabama Banking Department. The Federal
Reserve and the Alabama Banking Department regularly examine the operations of Regions Bank and are given authority to approve or disapprove mergers, acquisitions, consolidations, the establishment of branches and similar corporate actions. The
federal and state banking regulators also have the power to prevent the continuance or development of unsafe or unsound banking practices or other violations of law. Regions Bank is subject to numerous statutes and regulations that affect its
business activities and operations, including various consumer protection laws and regulations. As described below under “—Regulatory Reforms,” Regions Bank is also subject to supervision by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.
Some of Regions’ non-bank subsidiaries are also subject to regulation by various federal and state agencies.

Regulatory Reforms

The events of the past few years have led to numerous new laws and regulations in the United States applicable to
financial institutions. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the “Dodd-Frank Act”), which was enacted in July 2010, significantly restructures the financial regulatory regime in the United States and provides for
enhanced supervision and prudential standards for, among other things, bank holding companies like Regions that have total consolidated assets of $50 billion or more. The implications of the Dodd-Frank Act for our business will depend to a large
extent on the manner in which rules adopted pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act are implemented by the Federal Reserve, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the FDIC, the SEC, and other government agencies, as well as potential changes in market
practices and structures in response to the requirements of those rules.

New laws or regulations or changes to existing laws
and regulations (including changes in interpretation or enforcement) could materially adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations. As discussed







further in this section, many aspects of the Dodd-Frank Act are subject to further rulemaking and will take effect over several years, making it difficult to anticipate the overall financial
impact on Regions and its subsidiaries or the financial services industry generally. In addition to the discussion in this section, see “Risk Factors—Recent legislation regarding the financial services industry may have a significant
adverse effect on our operations” for a discussion of the potential impact legislative and regulatory reforms may have on our results of operations and financial condition.

Financial Stability Oversight Council.The Dodd-Frank Act creates a new systemic risk oversight body, the
Financial Stability Oversight Council (“FSOC”) to coordinate the efforts of the primary U.S. financial regulatory agencies (including the Federal Reserve, the FDIC and the SEC) in establishing regulations to address systemic financial
stability concerns. The Dodd-Frank Act directs the FSOC to make recommendations to the Federal Reserve regarding supervisory requirements and prudential standards applicable to systemically important financial institutions (often referred to as
“SIFI,” which includes bank holding companies with over $50 billion in assets, such as Regions), including capital, leverage, liquidity and risk-management requirements. The Dodd-Frank Act mandates that the requirements applicable to
systemically important financial institutions be more stringent than those applicable to other financial companies. The Federal Reserve has discretionary authority to establish additional prudential standards, on its own or at the FSOC’s
recommendation. The Dodd-Frank Act also requires the Federal Reserve to conduct annual analyses of such bank holding companies to evaluate whether the companies have sufficient capital on a total consolidated basis necessary to absorb losses as a
result of adverse economic conditions.

Enhanced Supervision and Prudential Standards.

Federal Reserve’s Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review”

Federal Reserve’s Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review.In November 2011, the Federal Reserve
published a final rule which requires U.S. bank holding companies with total consolidated assets of $50 billion or more (such as Regions) to submit annual capital plans, along with related stress test requirements, to the Federal Reserve for
approval. The capital analysis and review process provided for in the rule is known as the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (“CCAR”). The purpose of the capital plan is to ensure that these bank holding companies have robust,
forward-looking capital planning processes that account for each company’s unique risks and that permit continued operations during times of economic and financial stress. The capital plans are required to be submitted on an annual basis. Such
bank holding companies will also be required to collect and report certain related data on a quarterly basis to allow the Federal Reserve to monitor the companies’ progress against their annual capital plans. The comprehensive capital plans,
which Regions prepares using Basel I capital guidelines, include a view of capital adequacy under the stress test scenarios described below. The effect of the rules is that, among other things, a covered bank holding company may not make a







capital distribution unless it will meet all minimum regulatory capital ratios and will have a ratio of Tier 1 common equity to risk-weighted assets of at least 5% after making the distribution.
The rules also provide that the Federal Reserve may object to a capital plan if the plan does not show that the covered bank holding company will maintain a Tier 1 common equity ratio of at least 5% on a pro forma basis under expected and stressful
conditions throughout the nine-quarter planning horizon covered by the capital plan. Covered bank holding companies, including Regions, may execute capital actions such as paying dividends and repurchasing stock only in accordance with a capital
plan that has been reviewed and approved by the Federal Reserve. The CCAR rules, consistent with prior Federal Reserve guidance, provide that capital plans contemplating dividend payout ratios exceeding 30% of after-tax net income will receive
particularly close scrutiny.

The Proposed SIFI Rules, discussed earlier in this section under “Enhanced Supervision
and Prudential Standards,” proposed to expand the stress testing requirements to include, among other things, stress testing by the Federal Reserve under three economic and financial scenarios: baseline, adverse and severely adverse
scenarios. In October 2012, the Federal Reserve published final rules implementing that portion of the Proposed SIFI Rules expanding the stress testing requirements. Also, we are required to conduct our own semi-annual stress analysis (together with
the Federal Reserve’s stress analysis, the “Stress Tests”) to assess the potential impact on Regions, including our consolidated earnings, losses and capital, under each of the economic and financial conditions used as part of the
Federal Reserve’s annual stress analysis. The Federal Reserve may also use, and require companies to use, additional components in the adverse and severely adverse scenarios or additional or more complex scenarios designed to capture salient
risks to specific lines of business. Regions Bank is also required by final Federal Reserve rules to conduct annual stress testing and report the results to the Federal Reserve.

Under the Federal Reserve’s guidance, the CCAR annual process for 2013 will be implemented in conjunction with the stress testing
requirements described above. A summary of results of the Federal Reserve’s analysis under the severely adverse stress scenario will be publicly disclosed, and the bank holding companies subject to the rules, including Regions, must disclose a
summary of the company-run severely adverse stress test results. Regions is required to include in its disclosure a summary of the severely adverse scenario stress test conducted by Regions Bank using the scenarios defined by the Federal Reserve.
Regions submitted its 2013 CCAR rule capital plan to the Federal Reserve on January 7, 2013 and the Federal Reserve committed to responding by March 14, 2013.

Living Will Requirement.As required by the Dodd-Frank Act, the Federal Reserve and the FDIC have jointly
issued a final rule that requires certain organizations, including each bank holding company with consolidated assets of $50 billion or more, to report periodically to regulators a plan (a so-called “living will”) for their rapid and
orderly resolution in the event of material financial distress or failure. Regions’ resolution plan must, among other things, ensure that our depository institution subsidiary is adequately protected from risks arising from our other
subsidiaries. The final rule sets specific standards for the resolution plans, including requiring strategic analysis of the plan’s components, a description of the range of specific actions the company proposes to take in resolution, and a
description of the company’s organizational structure, material entities, interconnections and interdependencies, and management information systems, among other elements. The plan must be submitted annually for review to the Federal Reserve
and the FDIC.

In addition, the FDIC has issued a final rule that requires insured depository institutions with $50 billion or
more in total assets, such as Regions Bank, to submit to the FDIC for review periodic contingency plans for resolution in the event of the institution’s failure. The rule requires these insured institutions to submit a resolution plan that will
enable the FDIC, as receiver, to resolve the bank in a manner that ensures that depositors receive access to their insured deposits within one business day of the institution’s failure, maximizes the net-present-value return from the sale or
disposition of its assets, and minimizes the amount of any loss to be realized by the institution’s creditors. The final rule also sets specific standards for the resolution plans, including requiring a strategic analysis of the plan’s
components, a description of the strategies for achieving the least







costly resolution, and analyses of the financial company’s organization, material entities, interconnections and interdependencies, and management information systems, among other elements.
The two “living will” rules are complementary.

Consumer Financial Protection
Bureau.The Dodd-Frank Act created the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (the “CFPB”), a new consumer financial services regulator. The CFPB is directed to prevent unfair, deceptive and abusive practices and
ensure that all consumers have access to fair, transparent, and competitive markets for consumer financial products and services. The Dodd-Frank Act gives the CFPB authority to enforce and issue rules and regulations implementing existing consumer
protection laws and responsibility for all such existing regulations. Depository institutions with assets exceeding $10 billion, such as Regions Bank, their affiliates, and other “larger participants” in the markets for consumer financial
services (as determined by the CFPB) are subject to direct supervision by the CFPB, including any applicable examination, enforcement and reporting requirements the CFPB may establish.

Orderly Liquidation Authority.The Dodd-Frank Act creates the Orderly Liquidation Authority
(“OLA”), a resolution regime for systemically important non-bank financial companies and their non-bank affiliates, including bank holding companies, under which the FDIC may be appointed receiver to liquidate such a company if, among
other conditions, the company is in danger of default and presents a systemic risk to U.S. financial stability. This determination must come after supermajority recommendations by the Federal Reserve and the FDIC and consultation between the
Secretary of the U.S. Treasury and the President. This resolution authority is generally based on the FDIC resolution model for depository institutions, and substantial differences exist between the rights of creditors under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code
and in an orderly liquidation authority proceeding including the ability of the FDIC to disregard the strict priority of creditor claims in some circumstances, the use of an administrative claims procedure to determine creditors’ claims (as
opposed to the judicial procedure utilized in bankruptcy proceedings), and the ability of the FDIC to transfer claims to a “bridge” entity. In addition, OLA limits the ability of creditors to enforce contractual cross-defaults against
potentially viable affiliates of the institution in receivership.

An Orderly Liquidation Fund will fund OLA liquidation
proceedings through borrowings from the Treasury Department and risk-based assessments made, first, on entities that received more in the resolution than they would have received in liquidation to the extent of such excess, and second, if necessary,
on bank holding companies with total consolidated assets of $50 billion or more, such as Regions. If an orderly liquidation is triggered, Regions could face assessments for the Orderly Liquidation Fund. We do not yet have an indication of the level
of such assessments.

U.S. Department of Treasury’s Assessment Fee Program.In December
2011, the U.S. Department of the Treasury (“U.S. Treasury”) issued a proposed rule to implement Section 155 of the Dodd-Frank Act. Section 155 requires the U.S. Treasury to establish an assessment schedule for bank holding
companies with total consolidated assets of $50 billion or more. The rule became effective for bank holding companies on July 20, 2012, and, under the program, Regions is required to pay assessments on a semiannual basis to cover expenses
associated with the Office of Financial Research, the FSOC, and the FDIC’s Orderly Liquidation Authority. Regions believes the assessment will not be material to its consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

Volcker Rule.    The Dodd-Frank Act requires the federal financial regulatory agencies to adopt
rules that prohibit banks and their affiliates from engaging in proprietary trading and investing in and sponsoring certain unregistered investment companies (defined as hedge funds and private equity funds). The statutory provision is commonly
called the “Volcker Rule.” In October 2011, federal regulators proposed rules to implement the Volcker Rule that included an extensive request for comments on the proposal, which comment period closed in February 2012. The proposed rules
are highly complex, and, because final rules have not yet been adopted, many aspects of their application remain uncertain. Based on the proposed rules, Regions does not currently anticipate that the Volcker Rule will have a material effect on the
operations of Regions and its subsidiaries. Regions may







incur costs if it is required to adopt additional policies and systems to ensure compliance with the Volcker Rule. Until a final rule is adopted, the precise financial impact of the rule on
Regions, its customers or the financial industry more generally, cannot be determined.

Permissible Activities under the BHC Act

In general, the BHC Act limits the activities permissible for bank holding companies to the business of banking,
managing or controlling banks and such other activities as the Federal Reserve has determined to be so closely related to banking as to be properly incident thereto. A bank holding company electing to be treated as a financial holding company may
also engage in a range of activities that are (i) financial in nature or incidental to such financial activity or (ii) complementary to a financial activity and that do not pose a substantial risk to the safety and soundness of a
depository institution or to the financial system generally. These activities include securities dealing, underwriting and market making, insurance underwriting and agency activities, merchant banking and insurance company portfolio investments.

The BHC Act does not place territorial restrictions on permissible non-banking activities of bank holding companies. The
Federal Reserve has the power to order any bank holding company or its subsidiaries to terminate any activity or to terminate its ownership or control of any subsidiary when the Federal Reserve has reasonable grounds to believe that continuation of
such activity or such ownership or control constitutes a serious risk to the financial soundness, safety or stability of any bank subsidiary of the bank holding company.

Capital Requirements

Regions and Regions Bank are required to
comply with the applicable capital adequacy standards established by the Federal Reserve. There are two basic measures of capital adequacy for bank holding companies that have been promulgated by the Federal Reserve: a risk-based measure and a
leverage measure.

Risk-based Capital Standards.    The risk-based capital standards are designed
to make regulatory capital requirements more sensitive to differences in credit and market risk profiles among banks and financial holding companies, to account for off-balance sheet exposure, and to minimize disincentives for holding liquid assets.
Assets and off-balance sheet items are assigned to broad risk categories, each with appropriate weights. The resulting capital ratios represent capital as a percentage of total risk-weighted assets and off-balance sheet items.

Currently the minimum guideline to be considered well-capitalized for Tier 1 capital and Total capital is 6.0 percent and 10.0
percent, respectively. As of December 31, 2012, Regions’ consolidated Tier 1 capital to







risk-adjusted assets and Total capital to risk-adjusted assets ratios were 12.00 percent and 15.38 percent, respectively. The elements currently comprising Tier 1 capital and Tier 2 capital and
the minimum Tier 1 capital and Total capital ratios may be subject to change in the future, as discussed in greater detail below. The risk-based capital rules state that the capital requirements are minimum standards based primarily on broad
credit-risk considerations and do not take into account the other types of risk a banking organization may be exposed to (e.g., interest rate, market, liquidity and operational risks).

Basel I and II Standards.    Regions currently calculates its risk-based capital ratios under guidelines
adopted by the Federal Reserve based on the 1988 Capital Accord (“Basel I”) of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (the “Basel Committee”). In 2004, the Basel Committee published a new set of risk-based capital standards
(“Basel II”) to revise Basel I. Basel II provides two approaches for setting capital standards for credit risk—an internal ratings-based approach tailored to individual institutions’ circumstances and a standardized approach that
bases risk-weighting on external credit assessments to a much greater extent than permitted in the existing risk-based capital guidelines. Basel II also sets capital requirements for operational risk and refines the existing capital requirements for
market risk exposures.

A definitive final rule for implementing the advanced approaches of Basel II in the United States,
which applies only to internationally active banking organizations, or “core banks” (defined as those with consolidated total assets of $250 billion or more or consolidated on-balance sheet foreign exposures of $10 billion or more) became
effective on April 1, 2008. Other U.S. banking organizations may elect to adopt the requirements of this rule (if they meet applicable qualification requirements), but are not required to comply. The rule also allows a banking
organization’s primary federal supervisor to determine that application of the rule would not be appropriate in light of the bank’s asset size, level of complexity, risk profile or scope of operations. Regions Bank is currently not
required to comply with Basel II.

In July 2008, the U.S. bank regulatory agencies issued a proposed rule that would provide
banking organizations that do not use the advanced approaches with the option to implement a new risk-based capital framework. This framework would adopt the standardized approach of Basel II for credit risk, the basic indicator approach of Basel II
for operational risk, and related disclosure requirements. While this proposed rule generally parallels the relevant approaches under Basel II, it diverges where United States markets have unique characteristics and risk profiles, most notably with
respect to risk weighting residential mortgage exposures. Comments on the proposed rule were due to the agencies by October 27, 2008. The U.S. bank regulatory agencies did not take any other action on the 2008 proposed rule. On August 30,
2012, the agencies included in their Basel III rulemakings a proposed rule that builds on and expands the July 2008 proposed rule by, among other things, making the standardized approach applicable to all subject banks (a change from optional
application included in the 2008 rule), as discussed below.

In August 2012, the Federal Reserve, the FDIC, the Office of the
Comptroller of the Currency and the Department of the Treasury issued a revised Market Risk capital rule. The final rule applies to any U.S. banking organization, such as Regions, with combined trading assets and liabilities of at least $1 billion,
or 10 percent of its total assets, based on its most recent Call Report. Effective on January 1, 2013, the new, revised Market Risk Rule added additional modeling and reporting requirements, including Stressed Value-at-Risk (SVaR), and enhanced
profit and loss reporting and back-testing. The new Market Risk Rule increases the calculated risk-weighted assets attributable to trading market risk, but will not have a material impact on Regions’ total risk-weighted assets.

Basel III Standards.    In December 2010, the Basel Committee released its final framework for strengthening
international capital and liquidity regulation, now officially identified by the Basel Committee as “Basel III.” Basel III, when implemented by the U.S. bank regulatory agencies and fully phased-in, will require bank holding companies and
their bank subsidiaries to maintain substantially more capital, with a greater emphasis on common equity. Basel III provided that the capital calculation changes would become effective in stages, beginning January 1, 2013 and fully phased-in on
January 1, 2019. As noted below, the Federal Reserve has delayed indefinitely the effective dates for implementation of Basel III.







On August 30, 2012, the Federal Reserve, the FDIC and the Office of the Comptroller of
the Currency published notices of three proposed rules implementing the Basel III capital provisions (the “Basel III Proposed Rules”). Initial versions of the proposed rules were first published by the Federal Reserve on June 7, 2012.
The Basel III Proposed Rules generally follow the Basel III provisions, and, among other things, establish new risk-based and leverage capital ratios (described below) and narrow the definition of what constitutes capital for purposes of calculating
those ratios. Also included in the Basel III Proposed Rules is a proposed rule that revises and in effect replaces the general risk-based capital requirements currently in effect with a much more risk-sensitive standardized approach similar to the
standardized approach adopted by Basel II.

In particular, the Basel III Proposed Rules:



•introduce as a new capital measure “Common Equity Tier 1,”or “CET1,” specifies that Tier 1 capital consists of CET1 and
“Additional Tier 1 capital” instruments meeting specified requirements, defines CET1 narrowly by requiring that most adjustments to regulatory capital measures be made to CET1 and not to the other components of capital, and expand the
scope of the adjustments as compared to existing regulations;



•require banks to maintain once the Basel III provisions are fully phased in:



•as a newly adopted international standard, a minimum ratio of CET1 to risk-weighted assets of at least 4.5 percent, plus a 2.5 percent “capital
conservation buffer” (which is added to the 4.5 percent CET1 ratio as that buffer is phased in, effectively resulting in a minimum ratio of CET1 to risk-weighted assets of at least 7 percent);



•a minimum ratio of Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 6.0 percent, plus the capital conservation buffer (which is added to the 6.0
percent Tier 1 capital ratio as that buffer is phased in, effectively resulting in a minimum Tier 1 capital ratio of 8.5 percent upon full implementation);



•a minimum ratio of Total (that is, Tier 1 plus Tier 2) capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 8.0 percent, plus the capital conservation
buffer (which is added to the 8.0 percent total capital ratio as that buffer is phased in, effectively resulting in a minimum total capital ratio of 10.5 percent upon full implementation);



•for institutions with less than $250 billion in consolidated assets and on-balance sheet foreign exposures of less than $10 billion, a minimum leverage
ratio of 4.0 percent, calculated as the ratio of Tier 1 capital to total on-balance sheet exposures net of deductions from Tier 1 capital; and



•under some circumstances, a “countercyclical capital buffer,” generally to be imposed when national regulators determine that excess
aggregate credit growth becomes associated with a buildup of systemic risk, that would be a CET1 add-on to the capital conservation buffer in the range of 0 percent to 2.5 percent when fully implemented (potentially resulting in total buffers of
between 2.5 percent and 5 percent). Under the Basel III Proposed Rules, as originally drafted, the countercyclical capital buffer only applies to institutions with more than $250 billion in consolidated assets or on-balance sheet foreign exposures
greater than $10 billion.

The capital conservation buffer is designed to absorb losses during periods of
economic stress. Banking institutions with a ratio of CET1 to risk-weighted assets above the minimum but below the conservation buffer (or below the combined capital conservation buffer and countercyclical capital buffer, when the latter is applied)
will face constraints on dividends, equity repurchases and compensation based on the amount of the shortfall.

Citing the
large number of comments received in response to the Basel III Proposed Rules, on November 9, 2012 the Federal Reserve issued a press release indefinitely delaying the effective date of the proposed rules and the Basel III capital requirements.
As of February 2013, no additional guidance has been provided regarding the effective dates for the Basel III Proposed Rules and the Basel III capital framework.







In July 2011, the Basel Committee introduced a consultative document establishing a
requirement for a capital surcharge on certain globally systemically important banks (“G-SIBs”), and in November 2011, the Basel Committee issued final provisions substantially unchanged from the previous proposal. An “indicator-based
approach” will be used to determine whether a bank is a G-SIB and the appropriate level of the surcharge to be applied. The “indicator-based approach” consists of five broad categories: size, interconnectedness, lack of
substitutability, cross-jurisdictional activity and complexity. Under Basel III, banks found to be G-SIBs will be subject to a progressive CET1 surcharge ranging from 1% to 3.5% over the Basel III 7% CET1 requirement. The Basel III Proposed Rules do
not address this surcharge although the U.S. bank regulatory agencies indicated in the proposed rules that they plan to implement a surcharge for all, or a portion, of the banks with $50 billion or more in consolidated assets, based on the approach
taken by the Basel Committee. The surcharge was originally intended to become fully effective on January 1, 2019. Regions is not currently subject to this CET1 surcharge. However, it is possible that regional banking organizations may be
subject to CET1 or other surcharges in the future.

The Basel III Proposed Rules contemplated that the Basel III final
framework would become effective January 1, 2013, with the full requirements being phased in over a number of years. Under the proposed rules, banking institutions initially would be required to meet the following minimum capital ratios:



•3.5 percent CET1 to risk-weighted assets;



•4.5 percent Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets; and



•8.0 percent Total capital to risk-weighted assets.

Because the Federal Reserve has delayed indefinitely the effective date of the Basel III Proposed Rules, these minimum capital ratios are not currently in effect.

The Basel III final framework provides for a number of new deductions from and adjustments to CET1, such as the requirement that mortgage
servicing rights, deferred tax assets and significant investments in non-consolidated financial entities be deducted from CET1.

Under Basel III, implementation of the deductions and other adjustments to CET1 would have begun on January 1, 2014, with a
five-year phase-in period (20 percent per year). The capital conservation buffer would have been implemented on January 1, 2016 at 0.625 percent and phased in over a four-year period (increasing by 0.625 percent on each subsequent
January 1, until it reached 2.5 percent on January 1, 2019).

Leverage
Requirements.    Neither Basel I nor Basel II includes a leverage requirement as an international standard; however, the Federal Reserve has established minimum leverage ratio guidelines for bank holding companies to be
considered well-capitalized. These guidelines provide for a minimum ratio of Tier 1 capital to total consolidated quarterly average assets (as defined for regulatory purposes), net of the loan loss reserve, goodwill and certain other intangible
assets (the “leverage ratio”), of 4.0 percent for all bank holding companies, with a lower 3.0 percent minimum for bank holding companies that meet certain specified criteria, including having the highest regulatory rating. The Basel III
Proposed Rules would remove the more permissive 3.0 percent leverage ratio currently available under the rules for certain highly rated banking organizations.

Regions’ leverage ratio at December 31, 2012 as defined under Basel I was 9.65 percent.

The guidelines also provide that bank holding companies experiencing internal growth or making acquisitions will be expected to maintain strong capital positions substantially above the minimum
supervisory levels without significant reliance on intangible assets. Furthermore, the Federal Reserve has indicated that it will consider a “tangible Tier 1 capital leverage ratio” (deducting all intangibles) and other indicators of
capital strength in evaluating proposals for expansion or new activities.







Liquidity Requirements

As discussed above under
“—Regulatory Reforms,” the Proposed SIFI Rules address liquidity requirements for bank holding companies including Regions, with $50 billion or more in total consolidated assets. In the release accompanying those rules, the Federal
Reserve states a general intention to incorporate the Basel III liquidity framework for the bank holding companies covered by the Proposed SIFI Rules or a “subset” of those bank holding companies. Although these rules do not include
prescriptive ratios like the LCR and NSFR, they do include detailed liquidity-related requirements, including requirements for cash flow projections, liquidity stress testing (including, at a minimum, over time horizons that include an overnight
time horizon, a 30-day time horizon, a 90-day time horizon and a 1-year time horizon), and a requirement that covered bank holding companies maintain a liquidity buffer of unencumbered highly liquid assets sufficient to meet projected net cash
outflows and the projected loss or impairment of existing funding sources for 30 days over a range of liquidity stress scenarios. As discussed under “—Enhanced Supervision and Prudential Standards” above, in October 2012 the
Federal Reserve published final rules implementing that portion of the Proposed SIFI Rules that addresses stress testing. As of February 2013, final SIFI rules addressing liquidity requirements for bank holding companies have not been adopted.

Capital Requirements of Regions Bank.    Regions Bank is subject to substantially similar capital
requirements as those applicable to Regions. As of December 31, 2012, Regions Bank was in compliance with applicable minimum capital requirements. Failure to meet capital guidelines could subject a bank to a variety of enforcement remedies,
including the termination of deposit insurance by the FDIC, and to certain restrictions on its business. See “—Regulatory Remedies under the FDIA” below.

Safety and Soundness Standards

Guidelines adopted by the federal
bank regulatory agencies pursuant to the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, as amended (the “FDIA”), establish general standards relating to internal controls and information systems, internal audit systems, loan documentation, credit
underwriting, interest rate exposure, asset growth and compensation, fees and benefits. In general, these guidelines require, among other things, appropriate systems and practices to identify and manage the risk and exposures specified in the
guidelines. Additionally, the agencies adopted regulations that authorize, but do not require, an agency to order an institution that has been







given notice by an agency that it is not satisfying any of such safety and soundness standards to submit a compliance plan. If, after being so notified, an institution fails to submit an
acceptable compliance plan or fails in any material respect to implement an acceptable compliance plan, the agency must issue an order directing action to correct the deficiency and may issue an order directing other actions of the types to which an
undercapitalized institution is subject under the FDIA. See “—Regulatory Remedies under the FDIA” below. If an institution fails to comply with such an order, the agency may seek to enforce such order in judicial proceedings and to
impose civil money penalties.

Regulatory Remedies under the FDIA

The FDIA establishes a system of regulatory remedies to resolve the problems of undercapitalized institutions. The federal banking
regulators have established five capital categories (“well-capitalized,” “adequately capitalized,” “undercapitalized,” “significantly undercapitalized” and “critically undercapitalized”) and must
take certain mandatory supervisory actions, and are authorized to take other discretionary actions, with respect to institutions which are undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized or critically undercapitalized. The severity of these
mandatory and discretionary supervisory actions depends upon the capital category in which the institution is placed. Generally, subject to a narrow exception, the FDIA requires the banking regulator to appoint a receiver or conservator for an
institution that is critically undercapitalized. The federal bank regulatory agencies have specified by regulation the current relevant capital levels for each category:



“Well-Capitalized”“Adequately Capitalized”Leverage ratio of 5 percent,Tier 1 capital ratio of 6 percent,Total capital
ratio of 10 percent, andNot subject to a written agreement, order, capital directive or regulatory remedy directive requiring a specific
capital level.Leverage ratio of 4 percent,Tier 1 capital ratio of 4 percent, andTotal
capital ratio of 8 percent.“Undercapitalized”“Significantly Undercapitalized”Leverage ratio less than 4 percent,Tier 1 capital ratio less than 4 percent, orTotal capital ratio less than 8
percent.Leverage ratio less than 3 percent,Tier 1 capital ratio less than 3 percent, orTotal capital ratio less than 6
percent.“Critically Undercapitalized”Tangible equity to total assets less than 2 percent.

For purposes of these regulations, the term “tangible equity” includes core capital elements
counted as Tier 1 capital for purposes of the risk-based capital standards plus the amount of outstanding cumulative perpetual preferred stock (including related surplus), minus all intangible assets with certain exceptions. An institution that is
classified as well-capitalized based on its capital levels may be classified as adequately capitalized, and an institution that is adequately capitalized or undercapitalized based upon its capital levels may be treated as though it were
undercapitalized or significantly undercapitalized, respectively, if the appropriate federal banking agency, after notice and opportunity for hearing, determines that an unsafe or unsound condition or an unsafe or unsound practice warrants such
treatment.

The Basel III Proposed Rules discussed above under “-Capital Requirements” would amend the prompt
corrective action requirements in certain respects, including adding a CET1 risk-based capital ratio as one of the metrics (with a minimum of 6.5% for well-capitalized status) and increasing the Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio required at various
levels (for example, from 6.0% to 8.0% for well-capitalized status).

An institution that is categorized as undercapitalized,
significantly undercapitalized or critically undercapitalized is required to submit an acceptable capital restoration plan to its appropriate federal banking







Payment of Dividends

Regions is a legal entity separate and distinct from its banking and other subsidiaries. The principal source of cash
flow to Regions, including cash flow to pay dividends to its stockholders and principal and interest on any of its outstanding debt, is dividends from Regions Bank. There are statutory and regulatory limitations on the payment of dividends by
Regions Bank to Regions, as well as by Regions to its stockholders.

If, in the opinion of a federal bank regulatory agency,
an institution under its jurisdiction is engaged in or is about to engage in an unsafe or unsound practice (which, depending on the financial condition of the institution, could include the payment of dividends), such agency may require, after
notice and hearing, that such institution cease and desist from such practice. The federal bank regulatory agencies have indicated that paying dividends that deplete an institution’s capital base to an inadequate level would be an unsafe and
unsound banking practice. Under the FDIA, an insured institution may not pay a dividend if payment would cause it to become undercapitalized or if it already is undercapitalized. See “—Regulatory Remedies under the FDIA” above.
Moreover, the Federal Reserve and the FDIC have issued policy statements stating that bank holding companies and insured banks should generally pay dividends only out of current operating earnings.

Payment of Dividends by Regions Bank.    Under the Federal Reserve’s Regulation H, Regions Bank may not,
without approval of the Federal Reserve, declare or pay a dividend to Regions if the total of all dividends declared in a calendar year exceeds the total of (a) Regions Bank’s net income for that year and (b) its retained net income
for the preceding two calendar years, less any required transfers to additional paid-in capital or to a fund for the retirement of preferred stock.

Under Alabama law, Regions Bank may not pay a dividend in excess of 90 percent of its net earnings until the bank’s surplus is equal to at least 20 percent of capital. Regions Bank is also required
by Alabama law to seek the approval of the Alabama Superintendent of Banking prior to the payment of dividends if the total of all dividends declared by Regions Bank in any calendar year will exceed the total of (a) Regions Bank’s net
earnings for that year, plus (b) its retained net earnings for the preceding two years, less any required transfers to surplus. The statute defines net earnings as the remainder of all earnings from current operations plus actual recoveries on
loans and investments and other assets, after deducting from the total thereof all current operating expenses, actual losses, accrued dividends on preferred stock, if any, and all federal, state and local taxes. Regions Bank cannot, without approval
from the Federal Reserve and the Alabama Superintendent of Banking, declare or pay a dividend to Regions unless Regions Bank is able to satisfy the criteria discussed above. In addition to dividend restrictions, Federal statutes also prohibit
unsecured loans from banking subsidiaries to the parent company, as discussed below under “—Transactions with Affiliates”.

Payment of Dividends by Regions.    The payment of dividends by Regions and the dividend rate are subject to management review and approval by Regions’ Board of Directors
on a quarterly basis. Regions’ dividend







payments, as well as share repurchases, are also subject to the oversight of the Federal Reserve. Under a final rule issued by the Federal Reserve in November 2011, the dividend policies and
share repurchases of a large bank holding company, such as Regions, will be reviewed by the Federal Reserve based on capital plans and stress tests as submitted by the bank holding company, and will be assessed against, among other things, the bank
holding company’s ability to achieve the Basel III capital ratio requirements referred to above as they are phased in by U.S. regulators. Specifically, financial institutions must maintain a Tier 1 common risk-based capital ratio greater than 5
percent, under both ordinary and adverse circumstances. The Federal Reserve will only approve capital distributions for companies whose capital plans adhere to the criteria described in the CCAR, as described above under “—Regulatory
Reforms”.

Support of Subsidiary Banks

Under longstanding Federal Reserve policy which has been codified by the Dodd-Frank Act, Regions is expected to act as a source of financial strength to, and to commit resources to support, its subsidiary
bank. This support may be required at times when Regions may not be inclined to provide it. In addition, any capital loans by a bank holding company to its subsidiary bank are subordinate in right of payment to deposits and to certain other
indebtedness of such subsidiary bank. In the event of a bank holding company’s bankruptcy, any commitment by the bank holding company to a federal bank regulatory agency to maintain the capital of a subsidiary bank will be assumed by the
bankruptcy trustee and entitled to a priority of payment.

Transactions with Affiliates

Deposit
Insurance

Regions Bank accepts deposits, and those deposits have the benefit of FDIC insurance up to the applicable
limits. The applicable limit for FDIC insurance for most types of accounts is $250,000. Under the FDIA, insurance of deposits may be terminated by the FDIC upon a finding that the insured depository institution has engaged in unsafe and unsound
practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations or has violated any applicable law, regulation, rule, order or condition imposed by a bank’s federal regulatory agency.







Deposit Insurance Assessments.

Regions began using the New Assessment Rule for FDIC expense calculations beginning
with the second quarter of 2011. During 2011, FDIC insurance expense decreased $3 million to $217 million. Regions insurance expense further decreased by $55 million to $162 million during 2012. The level of FDIC deposit expense is expected to
fluctuate over time depending on the results of the calculations using the factors discussed above.







We cannot predict whether, as a result of an adverse change in economic conditions or other
reasons, the FDIC will in the future further increase deposit insurance assessment levels. For more information, see the “Deposit Administrative Fees” section of Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operation” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

FICO
Assessments.In addition, the Deposit Insurance Funds Act of 1996 authorized the Financing Corporation (“FICO”) to impose assessments on DIF applicable deposits in order to service the interest on
FICO’s bond obligations from deposit insurance fund assessments. The amount assessed on individual institutions by FICO will be in addition to the amount, if any, paid for deposit insurance according to the FDIC’s risk-related assessment
rate schedules. FICO assessment rates may be adjusted quarterly to reflect a change in assessment base. Regions Bank had a FICO assessment of $7 million in FDIC deposit premiums in 2012.

Acquisitions

The BHC Act requires every bank holding company to
obtain the prior approval of the Federal Reserve before: (1) it may acquire direct or indirect ownership or control of any voting shares of any bank or savings and loan association, if after such acquisition, the bank holding company will
directly or indirectly own or control 5 percent or more of the voting shares of the institution; (2) it or any of its subsidiaries, other than a bank, may acquire all or substantially all of the assets of any bank or savings and loan
association; or (3) it may merge or consolidate with any other bank holding company. Financial holding companies and bank holding companies with consolidated assets exceeding $50 billion must (i) obtain prior approval from the Federal
Reserve before acquiring certain non-bank financial companies with assets exceeding $10 billion and (ii) provide prior written notice to the Federal Reserve before acquiring direct or indirect ownership or control of any voting shares of any
company having consolidated assets of $10 billion or more. Bank holding companies seeking approval to complete an acquisition must be well-capitalized and well-managed.

The BHC Act further provides that the Federal Reserve may not approve any transaction that would result in a monopoly or would be in furtherance of any combination or conspiracy to monopolize or attempt
to monopolize the business of banking in any section of the United States, or the effect of which may be substantially to lessen competition or to tend to create a monopoly in any section of the country, or that in any other manner would be in
restraint of trade, unless the anticompetitive effects of the proposed transaction are clearly outweighed by the public interest in meeting the convenience and needs of the community to be served. The Federal Reserve is also required to consider the
financial and managerial resources and future prospects of the bank holding companies and banks concerned and the convenience and needs of the community to be served. Consideration of financial resources generally focuses on capital adequacy, and
consideration of convenience and needs issues includes the parties’ performance under the CRA, both of which are discussed below. The Federal Reserve must also take into account the institutions’ effectiveness in combating money
laundering. In addition, pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, the BHC Act was amended to require the Federal Reserve to, when evaluating a proposed transaction, consider the extent to which the transaction would result in greater or more concentrated
risks to the stability of the United States banking or financial system.

Depositor Preference

Under federal law, depositors and certain claims for administrative expenses and employee compensation against an insured depository
institution would be afforded a priority over other general unsecured claims against such an institution in the “liquidation or other resolution” of such an institution by any receiver.

Incentive Compensation

Guidelines adopted by the federal banking agencies pursuant to the FDIA prohibit excessive compensation as an unsafe and unsound practice and describe compensation as excessive when the amounts paid are
unreasonable or disproportionate to the services performed by an executive officer, employee, director or principal stockholder.







In January 2010, the FDIC announced that it would seek public comment on whether banks
with compensation plans that encourage risky behavior should be charged higher deposit assessment rates than such banks would otherwise be charged. The comment period ended in February 2010. As of February 2013, a final rule has not been adopted.

The scope and content of the U.S. banking regulators’ policies on incentive compensation are continuing to develop. It cannot be determined at this time whether a final rule will be adopted and
whether compliance with such a final rule will adversely affect the ability of Regions and its subsidiaries to hire, retain and motivate their key employees.

Financial Privacy

The federal banking regulators have adopted rules
that limit the ability of banks and other financial institutions to disclose non-public information about consumers to non-affiliated third parties. These limitations require disclosure of privacy policies to consumers and, in some circumstances,
allow consumers to prevent disclosure of certain personal information to a non-affiliated third party. These regulations affect how consumer information is transmitted through diversified financial companies and conveyed to outside vendors. In
addition, consumers may also prevent disclosure of certain information among affiliated companies that is assembled or used to determine eligibility for a product or service, such as that shown on consumer credit reports and asset and







income information from applications. Consumers also have the option to direct banks and other financial institutions not to share information about transactions and experiences with affiliated
companies for the purpose of marketing products or services.

Community Reinvestment Act

USA PATRIOT Act

Office of Foreign Assets Control Regulation

The United States has imposed economic sanctions that affect transactions with designated foreign countries, nationals and others. These are typically known as the “OFAC” rules based on their
administration by the U.S. Treasury Department Office of Foreign Assets Control (“OFAC”). The OFAC-administered sanctions targeting countries take many different forms. Generally, however, they contain one or more of the following
elements: (i) restrictions on trade with or investment in a sanctioned country, including prohibitions against direct or indirect imports from and exports to a sanctioned country and prohibitions on “U.S. persons” engaging in
financial transactions relating to, making investments in, or providing investment-related advice or assistance to, a sanctioned country; and (ii) a blocking of assets in which the government or specially designated nationals of the sanctioned
country have an interest, by prohibiting transfers of property subject to U.S. jurisdiction (including property in the possession or control of U.S. persons). Blocked assets (e.g., property and bank deposits) cannot be







paid out, withdrawn, set off or transferred in any manner without a license from OFAC. Failure to comply with these sanctions could have serious legal and reputational consequences.

Regulation of Insurers and Insurance Brokers

Regions’ operations in the areas of insurance brokerage and reinsurance of credit life insurance are subject to regulation and supervision by various state insurance regulatory authorities. Although
the scope of regulation and form of supervision may vary from state to state, insurance laws generally grant broad discretion to regulatory authorities in adopting regulations and supervising regulated activities. This supervision generally includes
the licensing of insurance brokers and agents and the regulation of the handling of customer funds held in a fiduciary capacity. Certain of Regions’ insurance company subsidiaries are subject to extensive regulatory supervision and to insurance
laws and regulations requiring, among other things, maintenance of capital, record keeping, reporting and examinations.

Regulation of
Residential Mortgage Loan Originators

On July 28, 2010, the Federal Reserve and other Federal bank regulatory
authorities adopted a final rule on the Secure and Fair Enforcement for Mortgage Licensing Act of 2008 (“S.A.F.E. Act”). Under the S.A.F.E. Act, residential mortgage loan originators employed by banks, such as Regions Bank, must register
with the Nationwide Mortgage Licensing System and Registry, obtain a unique identifier from the registry, and maintain their registration. Any residential mortgage loan originator who fails to satisfy these requirements will not be permitted to
originate residential mortgage loans.

Competition

All aspects of Regions’ business are highly competitive. Regions’ subsidiaries compete with other financial institutions located in the states in which they operate and other adjoining states,
as well as large banks in major financial centers and other financial intermediaries, such as savings and loan associations, credit unions, consumer finance companies, brokerage firms, insurance companies, investment companies, mutual funds,
mortgage companies and financial service operations of major commercial and retail corporations. Regions expects competition to intensify among financial services companies due to the sustained low interest rate and ongoing low-growth economic
environment.

Customers for banking services and other financial services offered by Regions’ subsidiaries are generally
influenced by convenience, quality of service, personal contacts, price of services and availability of products. Although Regions’ position varies in different markets, Regions believes that its affiliates effectively compete with other
financial services companies in their relevant market areas.

Employees

As of December 31, 2012, Regions and its subsidiaries had 23,427 employees.
