ITEM 1.  BUSINESS

DuPont is a Delaware corporation formed in 2015 (formerly, DowDuPont Inc.), for the purpose of effecting an all-stock merger of equals transactions between The Dow Chemical Company ("Historical Dow") and E. I. du Pont de Nemours and Company ("Historical EID"). Effective August 31, 2017, pursuant to the merger of equals transaction contemplated by the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of December 11, 2015, as amended on March 31, 2017 ("DWDP Merger Agreement"), Historical Dow and Historical EID each merged with subsidiaries of DowDuPont Inc. ("DowDuPont") and, as a result, Historical Dow and Historical EID became subsidiaries of DowDuPont (the "Merger"). Prior to the Merger, DowDuPont did not conduct any business activities other than those required for its formation and matters contemplated by the DWDP Merger Agreement. For purposes of DowDuPont's financial statement presentation, Historical Dow was determined to be the accounting acquirer in the Merger and Historical EID's assets and liabilities are reflected at fair value as of the Merger Effectiveness Time. The financial statements of Historical Dow for periods prior to the Merger are considered to be the historical financial statements of the Company.



Effective as of 5:00 p.m. on April 1, 2019, DowDuPont completed the separation of its materials science business into a separate and independent public company by way of a distribution of Dow through a pro rata dividend in-kind of all of the then-issued and outstanding shares of Dow’s common stock, par value $0.01 per share (the “Dow Common Stock”), to holders of the Company’s common stock, par value $0.01 per share (the “DowDuPont common stock”), as of the close of business on March 21, 2019 (the “Dow Distribution”).



Effective as of 12:01 a.m. on June 1, 2019, DuPont de Nemours, Inc. (formerly known as DowDuPont Inc.), completed the separation of its agriculture business into a separate and independent public company by way of a distribution of Corteva through a pro rata dividend in-kind of all of the then-issued and outstanding shares of Corteva’s common stock, par value $0.01 per share (the “Corteva Common Stock”), to holders of the Company’s common stock, par value $0.01 per share, as of the close of business on May 24, 2019 (the “Corteva Distribution” and, together with the Dow Distribution, the “Distributions”).



Following the Corteva Distribution, the Company holds the specialty products business. On June 1, 2019, DowDuPont changed its registered name from "DowDuPont Inc." to "DuPont de Nemours, Inc." doing business as "DuPont" (the "Company"). Beginning on June 3, 2019, the Company's common stock is traded on the NYSE under the ticker symbol "DD".



Today, DuPont is a global innovation leader with technology-based materials, ingredients and solutions that help transform industries and everyday life by applying diverse science and expertise to help customers advance their best ideas and deliver essential innovations in key markets including electronics, transportation, building and construction, health and wellness, food and worker safety. The Company had approximately 35,000 employees as of December 31, 2019. The Company has subsidiaries in about 70 countries worldwide and manufacturing operations in about 40 countries. See Note24to the Consolidated Financial Statements for details on the location of the Company's sales and property.













At DuPont's election (subject to certain restrictions), the N&B Distribution may be effected by means of a pro rata dividend in a spin-off transaction or an exchange offer for outstanding DuPont shares in a split-off transaction (or a combination of both). If DuPont elects a spin-off transaction, all DuPont stockholders will participate on a pro rata basis. If DuPont elects a split-off, then it will conduct an exchange offer and all DuPont stockholders will elect whether to exchange DuPont shares for shares of N&B Inc. (subject to any terms and conditions announced by DuPont with respect thereto). However, to the extent the split-off does not result in the distribution of all of the outstanding shares of N&B Inc., the additional shares of N&B Inc. still held by DuPont would be distributed in a spin-off transaction on a pro rata basis to all DuPont stockholders.



The Proposed N&B Transaction is expected to close by the end of the first quarter of 2021, subject to approval by IFF stockholders and other customary closing conditions, including regulatory approvals and receipt by DuPont of an opinion of tax counsel.

INDUSTRY SEGMENTS AND GEOGRAPHIC REGION RESULTS

See Note5to the Consolidated Financial Statements for net sales by business or major product line.



Sales by geographic region are included within Part II, Item 7 "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations", "Results of Operations." See Note24to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding total net sales, pro forma net sales, pro forma Operating EBITDA and total assets by segment, as well as net sales and long-lived assets by geographic region.



SIGNIFICANT CUSTOMERS AND COMPETITION

In 2019, no significant portion of the Company's sales was dependent upon a single customer. The markets in which the Company participates compete primarily through technology, range of products and services, performance, quality, reliability, brand, reputation, service and support. The Company provides extensive support, technical services and testing services for its customers, in addition to new product development. The Company believes that its proprietary product and process technologies, robust product and application development pipelines, customer intimacy, global manufacturing capability and local service capability enable it  to compete successfully.



Against this competitive backdrop, value-in-use is the primary driver of price for the Company’s products, although price is impacted by many factors including, among others, fluctuations in supply and demand, and availability and cost of key manufacturing inputs including raw materials and energy.



DISTRIBUTION

Most products are marketed primarily through the Company's sales organization, although in some regions, more emphasis is placed on sales through distributors. The Company has a diverse worldwide network which markets and distributes the Company's brands to customers globally. This network consists of the Company's sales and marketing organization partnering with distributors, independent retailers, cooperatives and agents throughout the world.



BACKLOG

In general, the Company does not manufacture its products against a backlog of orders and does not consider backlog to be a significant indicator of the level of future sales activity. Production and inventory levels are based on the level of incoming orders as well as projections of future demand. Therefore, the Company believes that backlog information is not meaningful to understanding its overall business and should not be considered a reliable indicator of the Company's ability to achieve any particular level of revenue or financial performance.



INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY

Trade Secrets:Trade secrets are an important part of the Company's intellectual property. Many of the processes used to make products are kept as trade secrets which, from time to time, may be licensed to third parties. DuPont vigilantly protects all of its intellectual property including its trade secrets. When the Company discovers that its trade secrets have been unlawfully taken, it reports the matter to governmental authorities for investigation and potential criminal action, as appropriate. In addition, the Company takes measures to mitigate any potential impact, which may include civil actions seeking redress, restitution and/or damages based on loss to the Company and/or unjust enrichment.











Patents:The Company continually applies for and obtains patents in many countries, including the U.S., and has access to a large patent portfolio, both owned and licensed. DuPont’s rights under these patents and licenses, as well as the products made and sold under them, are important to the Company in the aggregate. The protection afforded by these patents varies based on country, scope of individual patent coverage, as well as the availability of legal remedies in each country. The term of these patents is generally about twenty years, but varies depending on country. This significant patent estate may be leveraged to align with the Company’s strategic priorities within and across product lines. At December 31, 2019, the Company owned more than 27,000 patents and patent applications globally. Approximately 80% of the Company’s patent estate has a remaining term of more than 5 years.



Trademarks:The Company owns or licenses many trademarks that have significant recognition at the consumer retail level and/or has a product line to product line level. Ownership rights in trademarks do not expire if the trademarks are continued in use and properly protected.



DowDuPont Intellectual Property Agreements:In connection with the separation and distribution of Dow and Corteva, effective April 1, 2019 and June 1, 2019, respectively, the Company entered into intellectual property license agreements related to fields of use within the scope of the respective businesses, (together, the “IP License Agreements”). The IP License Agreements set forth the terms and conditions under which the applicable parties may use in their respective businesses, certain know-how (including trade secrets), copyrights, trademarks, and software, and certain patents and standards, allocated to another party pursuant to the DowDuPont Separation and Distribution Agreement.
