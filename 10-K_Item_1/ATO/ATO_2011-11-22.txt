ITEM 1.Business.



Overview
    and Strategy



Atmos Energy Corporation, headquartered in Dallas, Texas, is
    engaged primarily in the regulated natural gas distribution and
    transmission and storage businesses as well as other
    nonregulated natural gas businesses. Since our incorporation in
    Texas in 1983, we have grown primarily through a series of
    acquisitions, the most recent of which was the acquisition in
    October 2004 of the natural gas distribution and pipeline
    operations of TXU Gas Company. We are also incorporated in the
    state of Virginia.



Today, we distribute natural gas through regulated sales and
    transportation arrangements to over three million residential,
    commercial, public authority and industrial customers in
    12 states located primarily in the South, which makes us
    one of the country’s largest natural-gas-only distributors
    based on number of customers. In May 2011, we announced that we
    had entered into a definitive agreement to sell our natural gas
    distribution operations in Missouri, Illinois and Iowa,
    representing approximately 84,000 customers. After the closing
    of this transaction, we will operate in nine states. We also
    operate one of the largest intrastate pipelines in Texas based
    on miles of pipe.



Through our nonregulated businesses, we primarily provide
    natural gas management and marketing services to municipalities,
    other local gas distribution companies and industrial customers
    principally in the Midwest and Southeast and natural gas
    transportation along with storage services to certain of our
    natural gas distribution divisions and third parties.



Our overall strategy is to:



•deliver superior shareholder value,•improve the quality and consistency of earnings growth, while
    safely operating our regulated and nonregulated businesses
    exceptionally well and•enhance and strengthen a culture built on our core values.



We have continued to grow our earnings after giving effect to
    our acquisitions and have experienced more than 25 consecutive
    years of increasing dividends. Historically, we achieved this
    record of growth through acquisitions while efficiently managing
    our operating and maintenance expenses and leveraging our
    technology to achieve more efficient operations. In recent
    years, we have also achieved growth by implementing rate designs
    that reduce or eliminate regulatory lag and separate the
    recovery of our approved margins from customer usage patterns.
    In addition, we have developed various commercial opportunities
    within our regulated transmission and storage operations.



Our core values include focusing on our employees and customers
    while conducting our business with honesty and integrity. We
    continue to strengthen our culture through ongoing
    communications with our employees and enhanced employee training.



Operating
    Segments



We operate the Company through the following three segments:



•Thenatural gas distribution segment, which includes our
    regulated natural gas distribution and related sales operations,•Theregulated transmission and storage segment, which
    includes the regulated pipeline and storage operations of our
    Atmos Pipeline — Texas Division and







•Thenonregulated segment, which includes our nonregulated
    natural gas management, nonregulated natural gas transmission,
    storage and other services.



These operating segments are described in greater detail below.



Natural
    Gas Distribution Segment Overview



Our natural gas distribution segment consists of the following
    six regulated divisions, presented in order of total rate base,
    covering service areas in 12 states:



•Atmos Energy Mid-Tex Division,•Atmos Energy Kentucky/Mid-States Division,•Atmos Energy Louisiana Division,•Atmos Energy West Texas Division,•Atmos Energy Mississippi Division and•Atmos Energy Colorado-Kansas Division



Our natural gas distribution business is a seasonal business.
    Gas sales to residential and commercial customers are greater
    during the winter months than during the remainder of the year.
    The volumes of gas sales during the winter months will vary with
    the temperatures during these months.



Revenues in this operating segment are established by regulatory
    authorities in the states in which we operate. These rates are
    intended to be sufficient to cover the costs of conducting
    business and to provide a reasonable return on invested capital.
    Our primary service areas are located in Colorado, Kansas,
    Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Tennessee and Texas. We have
    more limited service areas in Georgia, Illinois, Iowa, Missouri
    and Virginia. See Note 6 in the consolidated financial
    statements for a complete description of the anticipated sale of
    our Illinois, Iowa and Missouri service areas. In addition, we
    transport natural gas for others through our distribution system.



Rates established by regulatory authorities often include cost
    adjustment mechanisms for costs that (i) are subject to
    significant price fluctuations compared to our other costs,
    (ii) represent a large component of our cost of service and
    (iii) are generally outside our control.



Purchased gas cost adjustment mechanisms represent a common form
    of cost adjustment mechanism. Purchased gas cost adjustment
    mechanisms provide natural gas utility companies a method of
    recovering purchased gas costs on an ongoing basis without
    filing a rate case because they provide adollar-for-dollaroffset to increases or decreases in natural gas distribution gas
    costs. Therefore, although substantially all of our natural gas
    distribution operating revenues fluctuate with the cost of gas
    that we purchase, natural gas distribution gross profit (which
    is defined as operating revenues less purchased gas cost) is
    generally not affected by fluctuations in the cost of gas.



Additionally, some jurisdictions have introduced
    performance-based ratemaking adjustments to provide incentives
    to natural gas utilities to minimize purchased gas costs through
    improved storage management and use of financial instruments to
    lock in gas costs. Under the performance-based ratemaking
    adjustment, purchased gas costs savings are shared between the
    utility and its customers.



Finally, regulatory authorities have approved weather
    normalization adjustments (WNA) for approximately
    94 percent of residential and commercial margins in our
    service areas as a part of our rates. WNA minimizes the effect
    of weather that is above or below normal by allowing us to
    increase customers’ bills to offset lower gas usage when
    weather is warmer than normal and decrease customers’ bills
    to offset higher gas usage when weather is colder than normal.





As of September 30, 2011 we had WNA for our residential and
    commercial meters in the following service areas for the
    following periods:



Georgia, Kansas, West TexasOctober — MayKentucky, Mississippi, Tennessee, Mid-TexNovember — AprilLouisianaDecember — MarchVirginiaJanuary — December





Our supply of natural gas is provided by a variety of suppliers,
    including independent producers, marketers and pipeline
    companies and withdrawals of gas from proprietary and contracted
    storage assets. Additionally, the natural gas supply for our
    Mid-Tex Division includes peaking and spot purchase agreements.



Supply arrangements consist of both base load and swing supply
    (peaking) quantities and are contracted from our suppliers on a
    firm basis with various terms at market prices. Base load
    quantities are those that flow at a constant level throughout
    the month and swing supply quantities provide the flexibility to
    change daily quantities to match increases or decreases in
    requirements related to weather conditions.



Except for local production purchases, we select our natural gas
    suppliers through a competitive bidding process by periodically
    requesting proposals from suppliers that have demonstrated that
    they can provide reliable service. We select these suppliers
    based on their ability to deliver gas supply to our designated
    firm pipeline receipt points at the lowest cost. Major suppliers
    during fiscal 2011 were Anadarko Energy Services, BP Energy
    Company, ConocoPhillips, Devon Gas Services, L.P., Enbridge
    Marketing (US) L.P., Iberdrola Renewables, Inc., National Fuel
    Marketing Company, LLC, ONEOK Energy Services Company L.P.,
    Tenaska Marketing and Atmos Energy Marketing, LLC, our natural
    gas marketing subsidiary.



The combination of base load, peaking and spot purchase
    agreements, coupled with the withdrawal of gas held in storage,
    allows us the flexibility to adjust to changes in weather, which
    minimizes our need to enter into long-term firm commitments. We
    estimate ourpeak-dayavailability of natural gas supply to be approximately
    4.4 Bcf. Thepeak-daydemand for our natural gas distribution operations in fiscal
    2011 was on February 2, 2011, when sales to customers
    reached approximately 4.4 Bcf.



Currently, our natural gas distribution divisions, except for
    our Mid-Tex Division, utilize 45 pipeline transportation
    companies, both interstate and intrastate, to transport our
    natural gas. The pipeline transportation agreements are firm and
    many of them have “pipeline no-notice” storage
    service, which provides for daily balancing between system
    requirements and nominated flowing supplies. These agreements
    have been negotiated with the shortest term necessary while
    still maintaining our right of first refusal. The natural gas
    supply for our Mid-Tex Division is delivered primarily by our
    Atmos Pipeline — Texas Division.



To maintain our deliveries to high priority customers, we have
    the ability, and have exercised our right, to curtail deliveries
    to certain customers under the terms of interruptible contracts
    or applicable state regulations or statutes. Our customers’
    demand on our system is not necessarily indicative of our
    ability to meet current or anticipated market demands or
    immediate delivery requirements because of factors such as the
    physical limitations of gathering, storage and transmission
    systems, the duration and severity of cold weather, the
    availability of gas reserves from our suppliers, the ability to
    purchase additional supplies on a short-term basis and actions
    by federal and state regulatory authorities. Curtailment rights
    provide us the flexibility to meet the human-needs requirements
    of our customers on a firm basis. Priority allocations imposed
    by federal and state regulatory agencies, as well as other
    factors beyond our control, may affect our ability to meet the
    demands of our customers. We anticipate no problems with
    obtaining additional gas supply as needed for our customers.



Below, we briefly describe our six natural gas distribution
    divisions. We operate in our service areas under terms of
    non-exclusive franchise agreements granted by the various cities
    and towns that we serve. At September 30, 2011, we held
    1,116 franchises having terms generally ranging from five to
    35 years. A significant number of our franchises expire
    each year, which require renewal prior to the end of their
    terms. We believe that we will be able to renew our franchises
    as they expire. Additional information concerning our natural
    gas distribution divisions is presented under the caption
    “Operating Statistics”.





Atmos Energy Mid-Tex Division.Our Mid-Tex
    Division serves approximately 550 incorporated and
    unincorporated communities in the north-central, eastern and
    western parts of Texas, including the Dallas/Fort Worth
    Metroplex. The governing body of each municipality we serve has
    original jurisdiction over all gas distribution rates,
    operations and services within its city limits, except with
    respect to sales of natural gas for vehicle fuel and
    agricultural use. The Railroad Commission of Texas (RRC) has
    exclusive appellate jurisdiction over all rate and regulatory
    orders and ordinances of the municipalities and exclusive
    original jurisdiction over rates and services to customers not
    located within the limits of a municipality.



Prior to fiscal 2008, this division operated under one
    system-wide rate structure. However, in fiscal 2008, we reached
    a settlement with cities representing approximately
    80 percent of this division’s customers (Settled
    Cities) that has allowed us, beginning in fiscal 2008, to update
    rates for customers in these cities through an annual rate
    review mechanism (RRM). Rates for the remaining 20 percent
    of this division’s customers, primarily the City of Dallas,
    continue to be updated through periodic formal rate proceedings
    and filings made under Texas’ Gas Reliability
    Infrastructure Program (GRIP). GRIP allows us to include in our
    rate base annually approved capital costs incurred in the prior
    calendar year provided that we file a complete rate case at
    least once every five years. In June 2011, we reached an
    agreement with the City of Dallas to enter into the Dallas
    Annual Rate Review (DARR). This rate review provides for an
    annual rate review without the necessity of filing a general
    rate case. The first filing made under this mechanism will be in
    January 2012.



Atmos Energy Kentucky/Mid-States Division.Our
    Kentucky/Mid-States Division operates in more than 420
    communities across Georgia, Illinois, Iowa, Kentucky, Missouri,
    Tennessee and Virginia. The service areas in these states are
    primarily rural; however, this division serves Franklin,
    Tennessee and other suburban areas of Nashville. We update our
    rates in this division through periodic formal rate filings made
    with each state’s public service commission.



In May 2011, we announced that we had entered into a definitive
    agreement to sell our natural gas distribution operations in
    Missouri, Illinois and Iowa, representing approximately 189
    communities, some of which of the Missouri communities are
    located in our Atmos Energy Colorado-Kansas Division.



Atmos Energy Louisiana Division.In Louisiana,
    we serve nearly 300 communities, including the suburban areas of
    New Orleans, the metropolitan area of Monroe and western
    Louisiana. Direct sales of natural gas to industrial customers
    in Louisiana, who use gas for fuel or in manufacturing
    processes, and sales of natural gas for vehicle fuel are exempt
    from regulation and are recognized in our nonregulated segment.
    Our rates in this division are updated annually through a rate
    stabilization clause filing without filing a formal rate case.



Atmos Energy West Texas Division.Our West
    Texas Division serves approximately 80 communities in West
    Texas, including the Amarillo, Lubbock and Midland areas. Like
    our Mid-Tex Division, each municipality we serve has original
    jurisdiction over all gas distribution rates, operations and
    services within its city limits, with the RRC having exclusive
    appellate jurisdiction over the municipalities and exclusive
    original jurisdiction over rates and services provided to
    customers not located within the limits of a municipality. Prior
    to fiscal 2008, rates were updated in this division through
    formal rate proceedings. However, the West Texas Division
    entered into agreements with its West Texas service areas during
    fiscal 2008 and its Amarillo and Lubbock service areas during
    fiscal 2009 to update rates for customers in these service areas
    through an RRM.



Atmos Energy Mississippi Division.In
    Mississippi, we serve about 110 communities throughout the
    northern half of the state, including the Jackson metropolitan
    area. Our rates in the Mississippi Division are updated annually
    through a stable rate filing without filing a formal rate case.





Atmos Energy Colorado-Kansas Division.Our
    Colorado-Kansas Division serves approximately 170 communities
    throughout Colorado and Kansas and parts of Missouri, including
    the cities of Olathe, Kansas, a suburb of Kansas City and
    Greeley, Colorado, located near Denver. We update our rates in
    this division through periodic formal rate filings made with
    each state’s public service commission.

Notes to preceding tables:



(1)A heating degree day is equivalent to each degree that the
    average of the high and the low temperatures for a day is below
    65 degrees. The colder the climate, the greater the number of
    heating degree days.





Heating degree days are used in the natural gas industry to
    measure the relative coldness of weather and to compare relative
    temperatures between one geographic area and another. Normal
    degree days are based on National Weather Service data for
    selected locations. For service areas that have weather
    normalized operations, normal degree days are used instead of
    actual degree days in computing the total number of heating
    degree days.(2)Sales volumes, revenues, operating margins, operating expense
    and operating income reflect segment operations, including

Regulated
    Transmission and Storage Segment Overview



Our regulated transmission and storage segment consists of the
    regulated pipeline and storage operations of our Atmos
    Pipeline — Texas Division. This division transports
    natural gas to our Mid-Tex Division, transports natural gas for
    third parties and manages five underground storage reservoirs in
    Texas. We also provide ancillary services customary in the
    pipeline industry including parking and lending arrangements and
    sales of inventory on hand. Parking arrangements provide
    short-term interruptible storage of gas on our pipeline. Lending
    services provide short-term interruptible loans of natural gas
    from our pipeline to meet market demands. Gross profit earned
    from our Mid-Tex Division and through certain other
    transportation and storage services is subject to traditional
    ratemaking governed by the RRC. Rates are updated through
    periodic formal rate proceedings and filings made under
    Texas’ Gas Reliability Infrastructure Program (GRIP). GRIP
    allows us to include in our rate base annually approved capital
    costs incurred in the prior calendar year provided that we file
    a complete rate case at least once every five years. Atmos
    Pipeline — Texas’ existing regulatory mechanisms
    allow certain transportation and storage services to be provided
    under market-based rates with minimal regulation.



These operations include one of the largest intrastate pipeline
    operations in Texas with a heavy concentration in the
    established natural gas-producing areas of central, northern and
    eastern Texas, extending into or near the major producing areas
    of the Texas Gulf Coast and the Delaware and Val Verde Basins of
    West Texas. Nine basins located in Texas are believed to contain
    a substantial portion of the nation’s remaining onshore
    natural gas reserves. This pipeline system provides access to
    all of these basins.

Nonregulated
    Segment Overview



Our nonregulated activities are conducted through Atmos Energy
    Holdings, Inc. (AEH), which is a wholly-owned subsidiary of
    Atmos Energy Corporation and operates primarily in the Midwest
    and Southeast areas of the United States.





AEH’s primary business is to deliver gas and provide
    related services by aggregating and purchasing gas supply,
    arranging transportation and storage logistics and ultimately
    delivering gas to customers at competitive prices. In addition,
    AEH utilizes proprietary and customer-owned transportation and
    storage assets to provide various delivered gas services our
    customers request, including furnishing natural gas supplies at
    fixed and market-based prices, contract negotiation and
    administration, load forecasting, gas storage acquisition and
    management services, transportation services, peaking sales and
    balancing services, capacity utilization strategies and gas
    price hedging through the use of financial instruments. As a
    result, AEH’s gas delivery and related services margins
    arise from the types of commercial transactions we have
    structured with our customers and our ability to identify the
    lowest cost alternative among the natural gas supplies,
    transportation and markets to which it has access to serve those
    customers.



AEH’s storage and transportation margins arise from
    (i) utilizing its proprietary21-milepipeline located in New Orleans, Louisiana to aggregate gas
    supply for our regulated natural gas distribution division in
    Louisiana, its gas delivery activities and, on a more limited
    basis, for third parties and (ii) managing proprietary
    storage in Kentucky and Louisiana to supplement the natural gas
    needs of our natural gas distribution divisions during peak
    periods.



AEH also seeks to enhance its gross profit margin by maximizing,
    through asset optimization activities, the economic value
    associated with the storage and transportation capacity it owns
    or controls in our natural gas distribution and by its
    subsidiaries. We attempt to meet these objectives by engaging in
    natural gas storage transactions in which we seek to find and
    profit through the arbitrage of pricing differences in various
    locations and by recognizing pricing differences that occur over
    time. This process involves purchasing physical natural gas,
    storing it in the storage and transportation assets to which AEH
    has access and selling financial instruments at advantageous
    prices to lock in a gross profit margin. Certain of these
    arrangements are with regulatory affiliates, which have been
    approved by applicable state regulatory commissions.



Due to the nature of these operations, natural gas prices and
    differences in natural gas prices between the various markets
    that we serve (commonly referred to as basis differentials) have
    a significant impact on our nonregulated businesses. Within our
    delivered gas activities, basis differentials impact our ability
    to create value from identifying the lowest cost alternative
    among the natural gas supplies, transportation and markets to
    which we have access. Further, higher natural gas prices may
    adversely impact our accounts receivable collections, resulting
    in higher bad debt expense, and may require us to increase
    borrowings under our credit facilities resulting in higher
    interest expense. Higher gas prices, as well as competitive
    factors in the industry and general economic conditions may also
    cause customers to conserve or use alternative energy sources.
    Within our asset optimization activities, higher natural gas
    prices could also lead to increased borrowings under our credit
    facilities resulting in higher interest expense.



Volatility in natural gas prices also has a significant impact
    on our nonregulated segment. Increased price volatility often
    has a significant impact on the spreads between the market
    (spot) prices and forward natural gas prices, which creates
    opportunities to earn higher arbitrage spreads within our asset
    optimization activities. Volatility could also impact the basis
    differentials we capture in our delivered gas activities.
    However, increased volatility impacts the amounts of unrealized
    margins recorded in our gross profit and could impact the amount
    of cash required to collateralize our risk management
    liabilities.

Ratemaking
    Activity



Overview



The method of determining regulated rates varies among the
    states in which our natural gas distribution divisions operate.
    The regulatory authorities have the responsibility of ensuring
    that utilities in their jurisdictions operate in the best
    interests of customers while providing utility companies the
    opportunity to earn a reasonable return on their investment.
    Generally, each regulatory authority reviews rate requests and
    establishes a rate structure intended to generate revenue
    sufficient to cover the costs of conducting business and to
    provide a reasonable return on invested capital.



Our rate strategy focuses on reducing or eliminating regulatory
    lag, obtaining adequate returns and providing stable,
    predictable margins. Atmos Energy has annual ratemaking
    mechanisms in place in three states that provide for an annual
    rate review and adjustment to rates for approximately
    73 percent of our gross margin. We also have accelerated
    recovery of capital for approximately 11 percent of our
    gross margin. Combined, we have rate structures with accelerated
    recovery of all or a portion of our expenditures for
    approximately 84 percent of our gross margin. Additionally,
    we have WNA mechanisms in eight states that serve to minimize
    the effects of weather on approximately 94 percent of our
    gross margin. Finally, we have the ability to recover the gas
    cost portion of bad debts for approximately 73 percent of
    our gross margin. These mechanisms work in tandem to provide
    substantial insulation from volatile margins, both for the
    Company and our customers.



We will also continue to address various rate design changes,
    including the recovery of bad debt gas costs and inclusion of
    other taxes in gas costs in future rate filings. These design
    changes would address cost variations that are related to
    pass-through energy costs beyond our control.



Although substantial progress has been made in recent years by
    improving rate design across Atmos Energy’s operating
    areas, potential changes in federal energy policy and adverse
    economic conditions will necessitate continued vigilance by the
    Company and our regulators in meeting the challenges presented
    by these external factors.





Recent
    Ratemaking Activity



Substantially all of our natural gas distribution revenues in
    the fiscal years ended September 30, 2011, 2010 and 2009
    were derived from sales at rates set by or subject to approval
    by local or state authorities. Net operating income increases
    resulting from ratemaking activity totaling $72.4 million,
    $56.8 million and $54.4 million, became effective in
    fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009 as summarized below:

Our recent ratemaking activity is discussed in greater detail
    below.



Rate
    Case Filings



A rate case is a formal request from Atmos Energy to a
    regulatory authority to increase rates that are charged to
    customers. Rate cases may also be initiated when the regulatory
    authorities request us to justify our rates. This process is
    referred to as a “show cause” action. Adequate rates
    are intended to provide for recovery of the Company’s costs
    as well as a fair rate of return to our shareholders and ensure
    that we continue to





safely deliver reliable, reasonably priced natural gas service
    to our customers. The following table summarizes our recent rate

    increase in operating income from customers in the
    Dallas & Environs portion of the Mid-Tex Division.
    Operating income should increase $0.2 million, net of the
    GRIP 2008 rates that will be superseded. The ruling also
    provided for regulatory accounting treatment for certain costs
    related to storage assets and costs moving from our Mid-Tex
    Division within our natural gas distribution segment to our
    regulated transmission and storage segment.17






Infrastructure
    Programs



As discussed above in “Natural Gas Distribution Segment
    Overview,” infrastructure programs such as GRIP allow
    natural gas distribution companies the opportunity to include in
    their rate base annually approved capital costs incurred in the
    prior calendar year. We currently have infrastructure programs
    in Texas, Georgia, Missouri and Kentucky. The following table
    summarizes our infrastructure program filings with effective

Annual
    Rate Filing Mechanisms



As an instrument to reduce regulatory lag, annual rate filing
    mechanisms allow us to refresh our rates on a periodic basis
    without filing a formal rate case. However, these filings still
    involve discovery by the appropriate regulatory authorities
    prior to the final determination of rates under these
    mechanisms. As discussed above in “Natural Gas Distribution
    Segment Overview,” we currently have annual rate filing
    mechanisms in our Louisiana and Mississippi divisions and in
    significant portions of our Mid-Tex and West Texas divisions.
    These mechanisms are referred to as rate review mechanisms in
    our Mid-Tex and West Texas divisions, stable rate filings in the
    Mississippi Division and the rate stabilization clause in the
    Louisiana Division. The following table summarizes filings made
    under our various annual rate filing mechanisms:

In June 2011, we reached an agreement with the City of Dallas to
    enter into the DARR. This rate review provides for an annual
    rate review without the necessity of filing a general rate case.
    The first filing made under this mechanism will be in January
    2012.





In August 2010, we reached an agreement to extend the RRM in our
    Mid-Tex Division for an additional two-year period beginning
    October 1, 2010; however, the Mid-Tex Division will be
    required to file a general system-wide rate case on or before
    June 1, 2013. This extension provides for an annual rate
    adjustment to reflect changes in the Mid-Tex Division’s
    costs of service and additions to capital investment from year
    to year, without the necessity of filing a general rate case.



The settlement also allows us to expand our existing program to
    replace steel service lines in the Mid-Tex Division’s
    natural gas delivery system. On October 13, 2010, the City
    of Dallas approved the recovery of the return, depreciation and
    taxes associated with the replacement of 100,000 steel service
    lines across the Mid-Tex Division by September 30, 2012.
    The RRM in the Mid-Tex Division was entered into as a result of
    a settlement in the September 20, 2007 Statement of Intent
    case filed with all Mid-Tex Division cities. Of the 440
    incorporated cities served by the Mid-Tex Division, 439 of these
    cities are part of the RRM process.



The West Texas RRM was entered into in August 2008 as a result
    of a settlement with the West Texas Coalition of Cities. The
    Lubbock and Amarillo RRMs were entered into in the spring of
    2009. The West Texas Coalition of Cities agreed to extend its
    RRM for one additional cycle as part of the settlement of this
    fiscal year’s filing.



During fiscal 2011, the RRC’s Division of Public Safety
    issued a new rule requiring natural gas distribution companies
    to develop and implement a risk-based program for the renewal or
    replacement of distribution facilities, including steel service
    lines. The rule allows for the deferral of all expense
    associated with capital expenditures incurred pursuant to this
    rule, including the recording of interest on the deferred
    expenses.

Other
    Regulation



Each of our natural gas distribution divisions is regulated by
    various state or local public utility authorities. We are also
    subject to regulation by the United States Department of
    Transportation with respect to safety requirements in the
    operation and maintenance of our gas distribution facilities. In
    addition, our distribution operations are also subject to
    various state and federal laws regulating environmental matters.
    From time to time we receive inquiries regarding various
    environmental matters. We believe that our properties and
    operations substantially comply with, and are operated in
    substantial conformity with, applicable safety and environmental
    statutes and regulations. There are no administrative or
    judicial proceedings arising under environmental quality
    statutes pending or known to be contemplated by governmental
    agencies which would have a material adverse effect on us or our
    operations. Our environmental claims have arisen primarily from
    former manufactured gas plant sites in Tennessee, Iowa and
    Missouri.



The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) allows, pursuant
    to Section 311 of the Natural Gas Policy Act, gas
    transportation services through our Atmos Pipeline —
    Texas assets “on behalf of” interstate pipelines or
    local distribution companies served by interstate pipelines,
    without subjecting these assets to the jurisdiction of the FERC.
    Additionally, the FERC has regulatory authority over the sale of
    natural gas in the wholesale gas market and the use and release
    of interstate pipeline and storage capacity, as well as
    authority to detect and prevent market manipulation and to
    enforce compliance with FERC’s other rules, policies and
    orders by companies engaged in the sale, purchase,
    transportation or storage of natural gas in interstate commerce.
    We have taken what we believe are the necessary and appropriate
    steps to comply with these regulations.



Competition



Although our natural gas distribution operations are not
    currently in significant direct competition with any other
    distributors of natural gas to residential and commercial
    customers within our service areas, we do compete with other
    natural gas suppliers and suppliers of alternative fuels for
    sales to industrial customers. We compete in all aspects of our
    business with alternative energy sources, including, in
    particular, electricity. Electric utilities offer electricity as
    a rival energy source and compete for the space heating, water
    heating and cooking markets. Promotional incentives, improved
    equipment efficiencies and promotional rates all contribute to
    the acceptability of electrical equipment. The principal means
    to compete against alternative fuels is lower prices, and
    natural gas historically has maintained its price advantage in
    the residential, commercial and industrial markets.



Our regulated transmission and storage operations historically
    have faced limited competition from other existing intrastate
    pipelines and gas marketers seeking to provide or arrange
    transportation, storage and other services for customers.
    However, in the last few years, several new pipelines have been
    completed, which has increased the level of competition in this
    segment of our business.



Within our nonregulated operations, AEM competes with other
    natural gas marketers to provide natural gas management and
    other related services primarily to smaller customers requiring
    higher levels of balancing, scheduling and other related
    management services. AEM has experienced increased competition
    in recent years primarily from investment banks and major
    integrated oil and natural gas companies who offer lower cost,
    basic services. The increased competition has reduced margins
    most notably on its high-volume accounts.



Employees



At September 30, 2011, we had 4,949 employees,
    consisting of 4,817 employees in our regulated operations
    and 132 employees in our nonregulated operations.
