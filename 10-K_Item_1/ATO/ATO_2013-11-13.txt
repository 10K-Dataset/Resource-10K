ITEM 1.Business.

Overview and Strategy

Atmos Energy Corporation, headquartered in Dallas, Texas, and incorporated in Texas and Virginia, is engaged primarily in the regulated natural gas distribution and transmission and storage businesses as well as other nonregulated natural gas businesses. We deliver natural gas through regulated sales and transportation arrangements to over three million residential, commercial, public authority and industrial customers in eight states located primarily in the South, which makes us one of the country’s largest natural-gas-only distributors based on number of customers. We also operate one of the largest intrastate pipelines in Texas based on miles of pipe.

Over the last two fiscal years, we have sold our natural gas distribution operations in four states to streamline our regulated operations. On April 1, 2013, we completed the divestiture of our natural gas distribution operations in Georgia, representing approximately 64,000 customers, and in August 2012, we completed the sale of our natural gas distribution operations in Missouri, Illinois and Iowa, representing approximately 84,000 customers.

Through our nonregulated businesses, we provide natural gas management, marketing, transportation and storage services to municipalities, local gas distribution companies, including certain of our natural gas distribution divisions and industrial customers principally in the Midwest and Southeast.

Our overall strategy is to:

•deliver superior shareholder value,

•improve the quality and consistency of earnings growth, while operating our business exceptionally well

•invest in our people and infrastructure

•enhance our culture.

We have delivered excellent shareholder value by growing our earnings and increasing our dividends for over 25 consecutive years. Over the last five years, we have achieved growth by implementing rate designs that reduce or eliminate regulatory lag and separate the recovery of our approved margins from customer usage patterns. In addition, we have developed various commercial opportunities within our regulated transmission and storage operations.

Our core values include focusing on our employees and customers while conducting our business with honesty and integrity. We continue to strengthen our culture through ongoing communications with our employees and enhanced employee training.

Operating Segments

We operate the Company through the following three segments:

•Thenatural gas distribution segment, which includes our regulated natural gas distribution and related sales operations,

•Theregulated transmission and storage segment, which includes the regulated pipeline and storage operations of our Atmos Pipeline — Texas Division and

•Thenonregulated segment, which includes our nonregulated natural gas management, nonregulated natural gas transmission, storage and other services.



These operating segments are described in greater detail below.









Natural Gas Distribution Segment Overview

Our natural gas distribution segment is comprised of our six regulated natural gas distribution divisions.  This segment represents approximately 65 percent of our consolidated net income.   The following table summarizes key information about these divisions, presented in order of total rate base.  See Note 16 in the consolidated financial statements for a description of the completed sales of our Missouri, Illinois, Iowa and Georgia service areas. We operate in our service areas under terms of non-exclusive franchise agreements granted by the various cities and towns that we serve. At September 30, 2013, we held 998 franchises having terms generally ranging from five to 35 years. A significant number of our franchises expire each year, which require renewal prior to the end of their terms. We believe that we will be able to renew our franchises as they expire.

Our natural gas distribution business is a seasonal business. Gas sales to residential and commercial customers are greater during the winter months than during the remainder of the year. The volumes of gas sales during the winter months will vary with the temperatures during these months.  Historically, this generally has resulted in higher operating revenues and net income during the period from October through March of each fiscal year and lower operating revenues and either lower net income or net losses during the period from April through September of each fiscal year.  However, rate design changes implemented during the first quarter of fiscal 2013 in our Mid-Tex and West Texas Divisions should change this trend. The rate design approved in these regulatory proceedings includes an increase to the customer base charge and a decrease in the consumption charge applied to customer usage. The effect of this change in rate design allows our rates to be more closely aligned with the natural gas distribution industry standard rate design. In addition, we anticipate these divisions, which represent approximately 50 percent of the operating income for our natural gas distribution segment, will earn their operating income more ratably over the fiscal year as they are now less dependent on customer consumption.

Revenues in this operating segment are established by regulatory authorities in the states in which we operate. These rates are intended to be sufficient to cover the costs of conducting business and to provide a reasonable return on invested capital.  In addition, we transport natural gas for others through our distribution system.

Rates established by regulatory authorities often include cost adjustment mechanisms for costs that (i) are subject to significant price fluctuations compared to our other costs, (ii) represent a large component of our cost of service and (iii) are generally outside our control.

Purchased gas cost adjustment mechanisms represent a common form of cost adjustment mechanism. Purchased gas cost adjustment mechanisms provide natural gas distribution companies a method of recovering purchased gas costs on an ongoing basis without filing a rate case because they provide a dollar-for-dollar offset to increases or decreases in natural gas distribution gas costs. Therefore, although substantially all of our natural gas distribution operating revenues fluctuate with the cost of gas that we purchase, natural gas distribution gross profit (which is defined as operating revenues less purchased gas cost) is generally not affected by fluctuations in the cost of gas.

Additionally, some jurisdictions have introduced performance-based ratemaking adjustments to provide incentives to natural gas distribution companies to minimize purchased gas costs through improved storage management and use of financial instruments to lock in gas costs. Under the performance-based ratemaking adjustment, purchased gas costs savings are shared between the utility and its customers.











Regulatory authorities have approved weather normalization adjustments (WNA) for approximately 97 percent of residential and commercial margins in our service areas as a part of our rates. WNA minimizes the effect of weather that is above or below normal by allowing us to increase customers’ bills to offset the effect of lower gas usage when weather is warmer than normal and decrease customers’ bills to offset the effect of higher gas usage when weather is colder than normal.

The following table provides a jurisdictional rate summary for our regulated operations. This information is for regulatory purposes only and may not be representative of our actual financial position.

Our supply of natural gas is provided by a variety of suppliers, including independent producers, marketers and pipeline companies and withdrawals of gas from proprietary and contracted storage assets. Additionally, the natural gas supply for our Mid-Tex Division includes peaking and spot purchase agreements.

Supply arrangements consist of both base load and swing supply (peaking) quantities and are contracted from our suppliers on a firm basis with various terms at market prices. Base load quantities are those that flow at a constant level throughout the month and swing supply quantities provide the flexibility to change daily quantities to match increases or decreases in requirements related to weather conditions.

Except for local production purchases, we select our natural gas suppliers through a competitive bidding process by periodically requesting proposals from suppliers that have demonstrated that they can provide reliable service. We select these suppliers based on their ability to deliver gas supply to our designated firm pipeline receipt points at the lowest reasonable cost. Major suppliers during fiscal2013were Anadarko Energy Services Company, BP Energy Company, ConocoPhillips Company, Devon Gas Services, L.P., Enterprise Products Operating LLC, Iberdrola Energy Services, LLC, Sequent Energy Management, L.P., Targa Gas Marketing LLC, Tenaska Marketing Ventures, Texla Energy Management, Inc. and Atmos Energy Marketing, LLC, our natural gas marketing subsidiary.

The combination of base load, peaking and spot purchase agreements, coupled with the withdrawal of gas held in storage, allows us the flexibility to adjust to changes in weather, which minimizes our need to enter into long-term firm commitments. We estimate our peak-day availability of natural gas supply to be approximately 4.4 Bcf. The peak-day demand for our natural gas distribution operations in fiscal2013was on January 15, 2013, when sales to customers reached approximately 3.1 Bcf.

Currently, our natural gas distribution divisions, except for our Mid-Tex Division, utilize 35 pipeline transportation companies, both interstate and intrastate, to transport our natural gas. The pipeline transportation agreements are firm and many of them have “pipeline no-notice” storage service, which provides for daily balancing between system requirements and nominated flowing supplies. These agreements have been negotiated with the shortest term necessary while still maintaining our right of first refusal. The natural gas supply for our Mid-Tex Division is delivered primarily by our Atmos Pipeline — Texas Division.

To maintain our deliveries to high priority customers, we have the ability, and have exercised our right, to curtail deliveries to certain customers under the terms of interruptible contracts or applicable state regulations or statutes. Our customers’ demand on our system is not necessarily indicative of our ability to meet current or anticipated market demands or immediate delivery requirements because of factors such as the physical limitations of gathering, storage and transmission systems, the duration and severity of cold weather, the availability of gas reserves from our suppliers, the ability to purchase additional supplies on a short-term basis and actions by federal and state regulatory authorities. Curtailment rights provide us the flexibility to meet the human-needs requirements of our customers on a firm basis. Priority allocations imposed by federal and state regulatory agencies, as well as other factors beyond our control, may affect our ability to meet the demands of our customers. We anticipate no problems with obtaining additional gas supply as needed for our customers.

Regulated Transmission and Storage Segment Overview

Our regulated transmission and storage segment consists of the regulated pipeline and storage operations of our Atmos Pipeline — Texas Division (APT).  APT is one of the largest intrastate pipeline operations in Texas with a heavy concentration in the established natural gas-producing areas of central, northern and eastern Texas, extending into or near the major producing areas of the Texas Gulf Coast and the Delaware and Val Verde Basins of West Texas.  It transports natural gas to our Mid-Tex Division, transports natural gas for third parties and manages five underground storage reservoirs in Texas. We also provide ancillary services customary in the pipeline industry including parking and lending arrangements and sales of excess gas.  This segment represents approximately 30 percent of our consolidated operations.

Gross profit earned from our Mid-Tex Division and through certain other transportation and storage services is subject to traditional ratemaking governed by the RRC. Rates are updated through periodic formal rate proceedings and filings made under Texas’ Gas Reliability Infrastructure Program (GRIP). GRIP allows us to include in our rate base annually approved capital costs incurred in the prior calendar year provided that we file a complete rate case at least once every five years. Atmos Pipeline–Texas’ existing regulatory mechanisms allow certain transportation and storage services to be provided under market-based rates with minimal regulation.











Nonregulated Segment Overview

Our nonregulated operations are conducted through Atmos Energy Holdings, Inc. (AEH),  a wholly-owned subsidiary of Atmos Energy Corporation, and represent approximately five percent of our consolidated net income.

AEH's primary business is to buy, sell and deliver natural gas at competitive prices to approximately 1,000 customers located primarily in the Midwest and Southeast areas of the United States.  AEH accomplishes this objective by aggregating and purchasing gas supply, arranging transportation and storage logistics and effectively managing commodity price risk.

AEH also earns storage and transportation demand fees primarily from our regulated natural gas distribution operations in Louisiana and Kentucky.  These demand fees are subject to regulatory oversight and are renewed periodically.

Ratemaking Activity

Overview

The method of determining regulated rates varies among the states in which our regulated businesses operate. The regulatory authorities have the responsibility of ensuring that utilities in their jurisdictions operate in the best interests of customers while providing utility companies the opportunity to earn a reasonable return on their investment. Generally, each regulatory authority reviews rate requests and establishes a rate structure intended to generate revenue sufficient to cover the costs of conducting business and to provide a reasonable return on invested capital.

Our rate strategy focuses on reducing or eliminating regulatory lag, obtaining adequate returns and providing stable, predictable margins, which benefit both our customers and the Company. As a result of our ratemaking efforts in recent years, Atmos Energy has:

•Annual ratemaking mechanisms in place in four states that provide for an annual rate review and adjustment to rates for approximately 69 percent of our natural gas distribution gross margin.

•Accelerated recovery of capital for approximately 74 percent of our natural gas distribution gross margin.

•Enhanced rate design that allows us to defer certain elements of our cost of service until they are included in rates, such as depreciation, ad valorem taxes and pension costs.

•WNA mechanisms in seven states that serve to minimize the effects of weather on approximately 97 percent of our natural gas distribution gross margin.

•The ability to recover the gas cost portion of bad debts for approximately 75 percent of our natural gas distribution gross margin.

Although substantial progress has been made in recent years by improving rate design across Atmos Energy’s operating areas, we will continue to seek improvements in rate design to address cost variations that are related to pass-through energy costs beyond our control. Further, potential changes in federal energy policy and adverse economic conditions will necessitate continued vigilance by the Company and our regulators in meeting the challenges presented by these external factors.

Recent Ratemaking Activity

Substantially all of our regulated revenues in the fiscal years endedSeptember 30, 2013,2012and2011were derived from sales at rates set by or subject to approval by local or state authorities. Net operating income increases resulting from ratemaking activity totaling$98.1 million,$30.7 millionand$72.4 million, became effective in fiscal2013,2012and2011, as summarized below:

The first filing under the mechanism was made in July of 2013 and has been settled for $12.5 million to be implemented on November 1, 2013.

(5)The Stable Rate Filing shows no deficiency, thus no change in operating income is anticipated from the current year filing.















Our recent ratemaking activity is discussed in greater detail below.



Infrastructure Programs

As discussed above in “Natural Gas Distribution Segment Overview” and “Regulated Transmission and Storage Segment Overview,” infrastructure programs such as GRIP allow our regulated divisions the opportunity to include in their rate base annually approved capital costs incurred in the prior calendar year. We currently have infrastructure programs in Texas, Kansas,  Kentucky and Virginia.

Annual Rate Filing Mechanisms

As an instrument to reduce regulatory lag, annual rate filing mechanisms allow us to refresh our rates on a periodic basis without filing a formal rate case. However, these filings still involve discovery by the appropriate regulatory authorities prior to the final determination of rates under these mechanisms. We currently have annual rate filing mechanisms in our Louisiana and Mississippi divisions and in a portion of our Texas divisions. These mechanisms are referred to as Dallas annual rate review (DARR) and rate review mechanisms (RRM) in our Mid-Tex Division, stable rate filings in the Mississippi Division and the rate stabilization clause in the Louisiana Division. The following table summarizes filings made under our various annual rate filing mechanisms:

The increase in operating income arising from the implementation of new rates is included as a component of discontinued operations through March 31, 2013.



From 2008 through fiscal 2011, the Mid-Tex Division had an annual rate review mechanism (RRM) for approximately 80 percent of its customers, which allowed it to update rates annually without the necessity of filing a general rate case.  In fiscal 2013, a new RRM was approved for these customers.

Since June 2011, the Mid-Tex Division has operated under a Dallas Annual Rate Review Mechanism (DARR) that provides the ability for it to annually update rates for its City of Dallas customers without the necessity of filing a general rate case. The first rates were implemented under the DARR in June 2012.

During fiscal 2011, the RRC’s Division of Public Safety issued a new rule requiring natural gas distribution companies with operations in Texas to develop and implement a risk-based program for the renewal or replacement of distribution facilities, including steel service lines. The rule allows for the deferral of all expenses associated with capital expenditures incurred pursuant to this rule until the expenses are included in rates, including the recording of interest on the deferred expenses.











Rate Case Filings

A rate case is a formal request from Atmos Energy to a regulatory authority to increase rates that are charged to customers. Rate cases may also be initiated when the regulatory authorities request us to justify our rates. This process is referred to as a “show cause” action. Adequate rates are intended to provide for recovery of the Company’s costs as well as a fair rate of return to our shareholders and ensure that we continue to safely deliver reliable, reasonably priced natural gas service to our customers. The following table summarizes our recent rate cases:

Other Regulation

Each of our natural gas distribution divisions and our regulated transmission and storage division is regulated by various state or local public utility authorities. We are also subject to regulation by the United States Department of Transportation with respect to safety requirements in the operation and maintenance of our transmission and distribution facilities. In addition, our distribution operations are also subject to various state and federal laws regulating environmental matters. From time to time









we receive inquiries regarding various environmental matters. We believe that our properties and operations substantially comply with, and are operated in substantial conformity with, applicable safety and environmental statutes and regulations. There are no administrative or judicial proceedings arising under environmental quality statutes pending or known to be contemplated by governmental agencies which would have a material adverse effect on us or our operations. Our environmental claims have arisen primarily from former manufactured gas plant sites.

The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) allows, pursuant to Section 311 of the Natural Gas Policy Act, gas transportation services through our Atmos Pipeline—Texas assets “on behalf of” interstate pipelines or local distribution companies served by interstate pipelines, without subjecting these assets to the jurisdiction of the FERC. Additionally, the FERC has regulatory authority over the sale of natural gas in the wholesale gas market and the use and release of interstate pipeline and storage capacity. The FERC also has authority to detect and prevent market manipulation and to enforce compliance with FERC’s other rules, policies and orders by companies engaged in the sale, purchase, transportation or storage of natural gas in interstate commerce. We have taken what we believe are the necessary and appropriate steps to comply with these regulations.

Competition

Although our natural gas distribution operations are not currently in significant direct competition with any other distributors of natural gas to residential and commercial customers within our service areas, we do compete with other natural gas suppliers and suppliers of alternative fuels for sales to industrial customers. We compete in all aspects of our business with alternative energy sources, including, in particular, electricity. Electric utilities offer electricity as a rival energy source and compete for the space heating, water heating and cooking markets. Promotional incentives, improved equipment efficiencies and promotional rates all contribute to the acceptability of electrical equipment. The principal means to compete against alternative fuels is lower prices, and natural gas historically has maintained its price advantage in the residential, commercial and industrial markets.

Our regulated transmission and storage operations historically have faced limited competition from other existing intrastate pipelines and gas marketers seeking to provide or arrange transportation, storage and other services for customers. However, in the last few years, several new pipelines have been completed, which has increased the level of competition in this segment of our business.

Within our nonregulated operations, AEM competes with other natural gas marketers to provide natural gas management and other related services primarily to smaller customers requiring higher levels of balancing, scheduling and other related management services. AEM has experienced increased competition in recent years primarily from investment banks and major integrated oil and natural gas companies who offer lower cost, basic services.
