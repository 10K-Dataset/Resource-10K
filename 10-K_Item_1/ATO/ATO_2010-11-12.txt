ITEM 1.Business.



Overview
    and Strategy



Atmos Energy Corporation, headquartered in Dallas, Texas, is
    engaged primarily in the regulated natural gas distribution and
    transmission and storage businesses as well as other
    nonregulated natural gas businesses. Since our incorporation in
    Texas in 1983, we have grown primarily through a series of
    acquisitions, the most recent of which was the acquisition in
    October 2004 of the natural gas distribution and pipeline
    operations of TXU Gas Company. We are also incorporated in the
    state of Virginia.



Today, we distribute natural gas through regulated sales and
    transportation arrangements to over three million residential,
    commercial, public authority and industrial customers in
    12 states located primarily in the South, which makes us
    one of the country’s largest natural-gas-only distributors
    based on number of customers. We also operate one of the largest
    intrastate pipelines in Texas based on miles of pipe.



Through our nonregulated businesses, we primarily provide
    natural gas management and marketing services to municipalities,
    other local gas distribution companies and industrial customers
    principally in the Midwest and Southeast and natural gas
    transportation along with storage services to certain of our
    natural gas distribution divisions and third parties.



Our overall strategy is to:



•deliver superior shareholder value,•improve the quality and consistency of earnings growth, while
    operating our regulated and nonregulated businesses
    exceptionally well and•enhance and strengthen a culture built on our core values.



We have continued to grow our earnings after giving effect to
    our acquisitions and have experienced more than 25 consecutive
    years of increasing dividends and earnings. Historically, we
    achieved this record of growth through acquisitions while
    efficiently managing our operating and maintenance expenses and
    leveraging our technology to achieve more efficient operations.
    In recent years, we have also achieved growth by implementing
    rate designs that reduce or eliminate regulatory lag and
    separate the recovery of our approved margins from customer
    usage patterns. In addition, we have developed various
    commercial opportunities within our regulated transmission and
    storage operations.



Our core values include focusing on our employees and customers
    while conducting our business with honesty and integrity. We
    continue to strengthen our culture through ongoing
    communications with our employees and enhanced employee training.



Operating
    Segments



We operate the Company through the following four segments:



•Thenatural gas distribution segment, which includes our
    regulated natural gas distribution and related sales operations.•Theregulated transmission and storage segment, which
    includes the regulated pipeline and storage operations of our
    Atmos Pipeline — Texas Division.•Thenatural gas marketing segment, which includes a
    variety of nonregulated natural gas management services.







•Thepipeline, storage and other segment, which is
    comprised of our nonregulated natural gas gathering,
    transmission and storage services.



These operating segments are described in greater detail below.



Natural
    Gas Distribution Segment Overview



Our natural gas distribution segment consists of the following
    six regulated divisions, presented in order of total rate base,
    covering service areas in 12 states:



•Atmos Energy Mid-Tex Division,•Atmos Energy Kentucky/Mid-States Division,•Atmos Energy Louisiana Division,•Atmos Energy West Texas Division,•Atmos Energy Colorado-Kansas Division and•Atmos Energy Mississippi Division



Our natural gas distribution business is a seasonal business.
    Gas sales to residential and commercial customers are greater
    during the winter months than during the remainder of the year.
    The volumes of gas sales during the winter months will vary with
    the temperatures during these months.



Revenues in this operating segment are established by regulatory
    authorities in the states in which we operate. These rates are
    intended to be sufficient to cover the costs of conducting
    business and to provide a reasonable return on invested capital.
    Our primary service areas are located in Colorado, Kansas,
    Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Tennessee and Texas. We have
    more limited service areas in Georgia, Illinois, Iowa, Missouri
    and Virginia. In addition, we transport natural gas for others
    through our distribution system.



Rates established by regulatory authorities often include cost
    adjustment mechanisms for costs that (i) are subject to
    significant price fluctuations compared to our other costs,
    (ii) represent a large component of our cost of service and
    (iii) are generally outside our control.



Purchased gas cost adjustment mechanisms represent a common form
    of cost adjustment mechanism. Purchased gas cost adjustment
    mechanisms provide natural gas utility companies a method of
    recovering purchased gas costs on an ongoing basis without
    filing a rate case because they provide adollar-for-dollaroffset to increases or decreases in natural gas distribution gas
    costs. Therefore, although substantially all of our natural gas
    distribution operating revenues fluctuate with the cost of gas
    that we purchase, natural gas distribution gross profit (which
    is defined as operating revenues less purchased gas cost) is
    generally not affected by fluctuations in the cost of gas.



Additionally, some jurisdictions have introduced
    performance-based ratemaking adjustments to provide incentives
    to natural gas utilities to minimize purchased gas costs through
    improved storage management and use of financial instruments to
    lock in gas costs. Under the performance-based ratemaking
    adjustment, purchased gas costs savings are shared between the
    utility and its customers.



Finally, regulatory authorities have approved weather
    normalization adjustments (WNA) for approximately
    94 percent of residential and commercial margins in our
    service areas as a part of our rates. WNA minimizes the effect
    of weather that is above or below normal by allowing us to
    increase customers’ bills to offset lower gas usage when
    weather is warmer than normal and decrease customers’ bills
    to offset higher gas usage when weather is colder than normal.





As of September 30, 2010 we had WNA for our residential and
    commercial meters in the following service areas for the
    following periods:



Georgia, Kansas, West TexasOctober — MayKentucky, Mississippi, Tennessee, Mid-TexNovember — AprilLouisianaDecember — MarchVirginiaJanuary — December





Our supply of natural gas is provided by a variety of suppliers,
    including independent producers, marketers and pipeline
    companies and withdrawals of gas from proprietary and contracted
    storage assets. Additionally, the natural gas supply for our
    Mid-Tex Division includes peaking and spot purchase agreements.



Supply arrangements consist of both base load and swing supply
    (peaking) quantities and are contracted from our suppliers on a
    firm basis with various terms at market prices. Base load
    quantities are those that flow at a constant level throughout
    the month and swing supply quantities provide the flexibility to
    change daily quantities to match increases or decreases in
    requirements related to weather conditions.



Except for local production purchases, we select our natural gas
    suppliers through a competitive bidding process by requesting
    proposals from suppliers that have demonstrated that they can
    provide reliable service. We select these suppliers based on
    their ability to deliver gas supply to our designated firm
    pipeline receipt points at the lowest cost. Major suppliers
    during fiscal 2010 were Anadarko Energy Services, BP Energy
    Company, Devon Gas Services, L.P., Enbridge Marketing (US) L.P.,
    Iberdrola Renewables, Inc., National Fuel Marketing Company,
    LLC, ONEOK Energy Services Company L.P., Tenaska Marketing,
    Texla Energy Management, Inc. and Atmos Energy Marketing, LLC,
    our natural gas marketing subsidiary.



The combination of base load, peaking and spot purchase
    agreements, coupled with the withdrawal of gas held in storage,
    allows us the flexibility to adjust to changes in weather, which
    minimizes our need to enter into long-term firm commitments. We
    estimate ourpeak-dayavailability of natural gas supply to be approximately
    4.2 Bcf. Thepeak-daydemand for our natural gas distribution operations in fiscal
    2010 was on January 8, 2010, when sales to customers
    reached approximately 4.0 Bcf.



Currently, all of our natural gas distribution divisions, except
    for our Mid-Tex Division, utilize 39 pipeline transportation
    companies, both interstate and intrastate, to transport our
    natural gas. The pipeline transportation agreements are firm and
    many of them have “pipeline no-notice” storage
    service, which provides for daily balancing between system
    requirements and nominated flowing supplies. These agreements
    have been negotiated with the shortest term necessary while
    still maintaining our right of first refusal. The natural gas
    supply for our Mid-Tex Division is delivered solely by our Atmos
    Pipeline — Texas Division.



To maintain our deliveries to high priority customers, we have
    the ability, and have exercised our right, to curtail deliveries
    to certain customers under the terms of interruptible contracts
    or applicable state regulations or statutes. Our customers’
    demand on our system is not necessarily indicative of our
    ability to meet current or anticipated market demands or
    immediate delivery requirements because of factors such as the
    physical limitations of gathering, storage and transmission
    systems, the duration and severity of cold weather, the
    availability of gas reserves from our suppliers, the ability to
    purchase additional supplies on a short-term basis and actions
    by federal and state regulatory authorities. Curtailment rights
    provide us the flexibility to meet the human-needs requirements
    of our customers on a firm basis. Priority allocations imposed
    by federal and state regulatory agencies, as well as other
    factors beyond our control, may affect our ability to meet the
    demands of our customers. We anticipate no problems with
    obtaining additional gas supply as needed for our customers.



The following briefly describes our six natural gas distribution
    divisions. We operate in our service areas under terms of
    non-exclusive franchise agreements granted by the various cities
    and towns that we serve. At September 30, 2010, we held
    1,115 franchises having terms generally ranging from five to
    35 years. A significant number of our franchises expire
    each year, which require renewal prior to the end of their
    terms. We believe that we will be able to renew our franchises
    as they expire. Additional information concerning our natural
    gas distribution divisions is presented under the caption
    “Operating Statistics”.





Atmos Energy Mid-Tex Division.Our Mid-Tex
    Division serves approximately 550 incorporated and
    unincorporated communities in the north-central, eastern and
    western parts of Texas, including the Dallas/Fort Worth
    Metroplex. The governing body of each municipality we serve has
    original jurisdiction over all gas distribution rates,
    operations and services within its city limits, except with
    respect to sales of natural gas for vehicle fuel and
    agricultural use. The Railroad Commission of Texas (RRC) has
    exclusive appellate jurisdiction over all rate and regulatory
    orders and ordinances of the municipalities and exclusive
    original jurisdiction over rates and services to customers not
    located within the limits of a municipality.



Prior to fiscal 2008, this division operated under one
    system-wide rate structure. However, in 2008, we reached a
    settlement with cities representing approximately
    80 percent of this division’s customers (Settled
    Cities) that has allowed us, beginning in 2008, to update rates
    for customers in these cities through an annual rate review
    mechanism. Rates for the remaining 20 percent of this
    division’s customers, primarily the City of Dallas,
    continue to be updated through periodic formal rate proceedings
    and filings made under Texas’ Gas Reliability
    Infrastructure Program (GRIP). GRIP allows us to include in our
    rate base annually approved capital costs incurred in the prior
    calendar year provided that we file a complete rate case at
    least once every five years.



Atmos Energy Kentucky/Mid-States Division.Our
    Kentucky/Mid-States Division operates in more than 420
    communities across Georgia, Illinois, Iowa, Kentucky, Missouri,
    Tennessee and Virginia. The service areas in these states are
    primarily rural; however, this division serves Franklin,
    Tennessee, and other suburban areas of Nashville. We update our
    rates in this division through periodic formal rate filings made
    with each state’s public service commission.



Atmos Energy Louisiana Division.In Louisiana,
    we serve nearly 300 communities, including the suburban areas of
    New Orleans, the metropolitan area of Monroe and western
    Louisiana. Direct sales of natural gas to industrial customers
    in Louisiana, who use gas for fuel or in manufacturing
    processes, and sales of natural gas for vehicle fuel are exempt
    from regulation and are recognized in our natural gas marketing
    segment. Our rates in this division are updated annually through
    a rate stabilization clause filing without filing a formal rate
    case.



Atmos Energy West Texas Division.Our West
    Texas Division serves approximately 80 communities in West
    Texas, including the Amarillo, Lubbock and Midland areas. Like
    our Mid-Tex Division, each municipality we serve has original
    jurisdiction over all gas distribution rates, operations and
    services within its city limits, with the RRC having exclusive
    appellate jurisdiction over the municipalities and exclusive
    original jurisdiction over rates and services provided to
    customers not located within the limits of a municipality. Prior
    to fiscal 2008, rates were updated in this division through
    formal rate proceedings. However, the West Texas Division
    entered into agreements with its West Texas service areas during
    2008 and its Amarillo and Lubbock service areas during 2009 to
    update rates for customers in these service areas through an
    annual rate review mechanism.



Atmos Energy Colorado-Kansas Division.Our
    Colorado-Kansas Division serves approximately
    170 communities throughout Colorado and Kansas and parts of
    Missouri, including the cities of Olathe, Kansas, a suburb of
    Kansas City and Greeley, Colorado, located near Denver. We
    update our rates in this division through periodic formal rate
    filings made with each state’s public service commission.





Atmos Energy Mississippi Division.In
    Mississippi, we serve about 110 communities throughout the
    northern half of the state, including the Jackson metropolitan
    area. Our rates in the Mississippi Division are updated annually
    through a stable rate filing without filing a formal rate case.

Notes to preceding tables:



(1)A heating degree day is equivalent to each degree that the
    average of the high and the low temperatures for a day is below
    65 degrees. The colder the climate, the greater the number of
    heating degree days. Heating degree days are used in the natural
    gas industry to measure the relative coldness of weather and to
    compare relative temperatures between one geographic area and
    another. Normal degree days are based on National Weather
    Service data for selected locations. For service areas that have
    weather normalized operations, normal degree days are used
    instead of actual degree days in computing the total number of
    heating degree days.(2)Sales volumes, revenues, operating margins, operating expense

Regulated
    Transmission and Storage Segment Overview



Our regulated transmission and storage segment consists of the
    regulated pipeline and storage operations of our Atmos
    Pipeline — Texas Division. This division transports
    natural gas to our Mid-Tex Division, transports natural gas for
    third parties and manages five underground storage reservoirs in
    Texas. We also





provide ancillary services customary in the pipeline industry
    including parking arrangements, lending and sales of excess gas.
    Parking arrangements provide short-term interruptible storage of
    gas on our pipeline. Lending services provide short-term
    interruptible loans of natural gas from our pipeline to meet
    market demands. Gross profit earned from our Mid-Tex Division
    and through certain other transportation and storage services is
    subject to traditional ratemaking governed by the RRC. Rates are
    updated through periodic formal rate proceedings and filings
    made under Texas’ Gas Reliability Infrastructure Program
    (GRIP). GRIP allows us to include in our rate base annually
    approved capital costs incurred in the prior calendar year
    provided that we file a complete rate case at least once every
    five years. Atmos Pipeline — Texas’ existing
    regulatory mechanisms allow certain transportation and storage
    services to be provided under market-based rates with minimal
    regulation.



These operations include one of the largest intrastate pipeline
    operations in Texas with a heavy concentration in the
    established natural gas-producing areas of central, northern and
    eastern Texas, extending into or near the major producing areas
    of the Texas Gulf Coast and the Delaware and Val Verde Basins of
    West Texas. Nine basins located in Texas are believed to contain
    a substantial portion of the nation’s remaining onshore
    natural gas reserves. This pipeline system provides access to
    all of these basins.

Natural
    Gas Marketing Segment Overview



Our natural gas marketing activities are conducted through Atmos
    Energy Marketing (AEM), which is wholly-owned by Atmos Energy
    Holdings, Inc. (AEH). AEH is a wholly-owned subsidiary of AEC
    and operates primarily in the Midwest and Southeast areas of the
    United States.



AEM’s primary business is to aggregate and purchase gas
    supply, arrange transportation and storage logistics and
    ultimately deliver gas to customers at competitive prices. In
    addition, AEM utilizes proprietary and customer-owned
    transportation and storage assets to provide various services
    our customers request, including furnishing natural gas supplies
    at fixed and market-based prices, contract negotiation and
    administration, load forecasting, gas storage acquisition and
    management services, transportation services, peaking sales and
    balancing services, capacity utilization strategies and gas
    price hedging through the use of financial instruments. AEM
    serves most of its customers under contracts generally having
    one to two year terms and sells natural gas to some of its
    industrial customers on a delivered burner tip basis under
    contract terms ranging from 30 days to two years. As a
    result, AEM’s margins arise from the types of commercial
    transactions we have structured with our customers and our
    ability to identify the lowest cost alternative among the
    natural gas supplies, transportation and markets to which it has
    access to serve those customers.



AEM also seeks to maximize, through asset optimization
    activities, the economic value associated with the storage and
    transportation capacity we own or control in our natural gas
    distribution and natural gas marketing segments. We attempt to
    meet this objective by engaging in natural gas storage
    transactions in





which we seek to find and profit through the arbitrage of
    pricing differences in various locations and by recognizing
    pricing differences that occur over time. This process involves
    purchasing physical natural gas, storing it in the storage and
    transportation assets to which AEM has access and selling
    financial instruments at advantageous prices to lock in a gross
    profit margin.

Pipeline,
    Storage and Other Segment Overview



Our pipeline, storage and other segment primarily consists of
    the operations of Atmos Pipeline and Storage, LLC (APS), which
    is wholly-owned by AEH. APS is engaged in nonregulated
    transmission, storage and natural gas gathering services. Its
    primary asset is a proprietary 21 mile pipeline located in
    New Orleans, Louisiana. It also owns or controls additional
    pipeline and storage capacity including interests in underground
    storage fields in Kentucky and Louisiana that are used to reduce
    the need of our natural gas distribution divisions to contract
    for pipeline capacity to meet customer demand during peak
    periods.



APS’ primary business is to provide storage and
    transportation services to our Louisiana and Kentucky/Mid-States
    regulated natural gas distribution divisions, to our natural gas
    marketing segment and, on a more limited basis, to third
    parties. APS earns transportation fees and storage demand
    charges to aggregate and provide gas supply, provide access to
    storage capacity and transport gas for these customers.



APS also engages in various asset optimization activities.
    APS’ primary asset optimization activity involves the
    administration of two asset management plans with regulated
    affiliates of the Company. These arrangements provide APS the
    opportunity to maximize the economic value associated with the
    transportation and storage capacity assigned to these plans. APS
    attempts to meet this objective through a variety of activities
    including engaging in natural gas storage transactions and
    utilizing excess asset capacity to find and profit through the
    arbitrage of pricing differences in various locations and by
    recognizing pricing differences that occur over time. These
    plans require APS to share a portion of the economic value
    created by these activities with the regulated customers served
    by these affiliates. These arrangements have been approved by
    applicable state regulatory commissions and are subject to
    annual regulatory review intended to ensure proper allocation of
    economic value between our regulated customers and APS.



APS also seeks to maximize the economic value associated with
    the storage and transportation capacity it owns or controls. We
    attempt to meet this objective by engaging in natural gas
    storage transactions in which we seek to find and profit through
    the arbitrage of pricing differences in various locations and by
    recognizing pricing differences that occur over time. This
    process involves purchasing physical natural gas, storing it in
    the storage and transportation assets to which APS has access
    and, in transactions involving storage capacity, selling
    financial instruments at advantageous prices to lock in a gross
    profit margin.

Ratemaking
    Activity



Overview



The method of determining regulated rates varies among the
    states in which our natural gas distribution divisions operate.
    The regulatory authorities have the responsibility of ensuring
    that utilities in their jurisdictions operate in the best
    interests of customers while providing utility companies the
    opportunity to earn a reasonable return on their investment.
    Generally, each regulatory authority reviews rate requests and
    establishes a rate structure intended to generate revenue
    sufficient to cover the costs of conducting business and to
    provide a reasonable return on invested capital.



Our current rate strategy is to focus on reducing or eliminating
    regulatory lag, obtaining adequate returns and providing stable,
    predictable margins. Atmos Energy has annual ratemaking
    mechanisms in place in three states that provide for an annual
    rate review and adjustment to rates for approximately two-thirds
    of our gross margin. We also have accelerated recovery of only
    capital for approximately 20 percent of our gross margin.
    Combined, we have rate structures with accelerated recovery of
    all or a portion of our expenditures for over 80 percent of
    our gross margin. Additionally, we have WNA mechanisms in eight
    states that serve to minimize the effects of weather on
    approximately 94 percent of our gross margin. Finally, we
    have the ability to recover the gas cost portion of bad debts
    for approximately 70 percent of our gross margin. These
    mechanisms work in tandem to provide insulation from volatile
    margins, both for the Company and our customers.



We will also continue to address various rate design changes,
    including the recovery of bad debt gas costs and inclusion of
    other taxes in gas costs in future rate filings. These design
    changes would address cost variations that are related to
    pass-through energy costs beyond our control.



Although substantial progress has been made in recent years by
    improving rate design across Atmos’ operating areas,
    potential changes in federal energy policy and adverse economic
    conditions will necessitate continued vigilance by the Company
    and our regulators in meeting the challenges presented by these
    external factors.





Recent
    Ratemaking Activity



Substantially all of our natural gas distribution revenues in
    the fiscal years ended September 30, 2010, 2009 and 2008
    were derived from sales at rates set by or subject to approval
    by local or state authorities. Net operating income increases
    resulting from ratemaking activity totaling $56.8 million,
    $54.4 million and $40.6 million, became effective in
    fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008 as summarized below:

(1)The Pipeline Replacement Program (PRP) surcharge relates to a
    long-term cast iron replacement program.(2)The Company filed a Rate Review Mechanism (RRM) with the Mid-Tex
    Settled Cities requesting an operating income increase of
    $56.8 million. A settlement was reached, effective
    October 1, 2010, which resolves all issues in the annual
    RRM filing and increases operating income by $23.1 million.
    Additionally, the settlement allows the Mid-Tex Division to
    expand its existing program to replace steel service lines which
    will replace approximately 100,000 steel service lines by
    September 30, 2012 at a total projected capital cost of
    $80-$120 million, utilizing an authorized return on equity
    of 9.0 percent, with the equity portion of the return based
    on the actual capital structure up to a maximum of
    50 percent.



Our recent ratemaking activity is discussed in greater detail
    below.





Rate
    Case Filings



A rate case is a formal request from Atmos Energy to a
    regulatory authority to increase rates that are charged to
    customers. Rate cases may also be initiated when the regulatory
    authorities request us to justify our rates. This process is
    referred to as a “show cause” action. Adequate rates
    are intended to provide for recovery of the Company’s costs
    as well as a fair rate of return to our shareholders and ensure
    that we continue to deliver reliable, reasonably priced natural
    gas service to our customers. The following table summarizes our
    recent rate cases:

(1)In its final order, the Railroad Commission of Texas (RRC)
    approved a $3.0 million increase in operating income from
    customers in the Dallas & Environs portion of the
    Mid-Tex Division. Operating income should increase
    $0.2 million, net of the GRIP 2008 rates that will be
    superseded. The ruling also provided for regulatory accounting
    treatment for certain costs related to storage assets and costs
    moving from our Mid-Tex Division within our natural gas
    distribution segment to our regulated transmission and storage
    segment.(2)Increase relates only to the City of Dallas and the
    unincorporated areas of the Mid-Tex Division.(3)Increase relates only to the Settled Cities area of the Mid-Tex
    Division.







GRIP
    Filings



As discussed above in “Natural Gas Distribution Segment
    Overview,” GRIP allows natural gas utility companies the
    opportunity to include in their rate base annually approved
    capital costs incurred in the prior calendar year. The following
    table summarizes our GRIP filings with effective dates during
    the fiscal years ended September 30, 2010, 2009 and 2008:

    the Lubbock Environs and the West Texas Cities Environs. GRIP
    implemented for this division include investments that related
    to both calendar years 2007 and 2008. The incremental investment
    is based on system-wide plant and additional annual operating
    revenue is applicable to environs customers only.



Annual
    Rate Filing Mechanisms



As an instrument to reduce regulatory lag, annual rate filing
    mechanisms allow us to refresh our rates on a periodic basis
    without filing a formal rate case. However, these filings still
    involve discovery by the appropriate regulatory authorities
    prior to the final determination of rates under these
    mechanisms. As discussed above in “Natural Gas Distribution
    Segment Overview,” we currently have annual rate filing
    mechanisms in our Louisiana and Mississippi divisions and in
    significant portions of our Mid-Tex and West Texas divisions.
    These mechanisms are referred to as rate review mechanisms in
    our Mid-Tex and West Texas





divisions, stable rate filings in the Mississippi Division and
    rate stabilization clause in the Louisiana Division. The
    following table summarizes filings made under our various annual
    rate filing mechanisms:

In August 2010, we reached an agreement to extend the rate
    review mechanism in our Mid-Tex Division for an additional
    two-year period beginning October 1, 2010; however, the
    Mid-Tex Division will be required to file a general system-wide
    rate case on or before June 1, 2013. This extension
    provides for an annual rate adjustment to reflect changes in the
    Mid-Tex Division’s costs of service and additions to
    capital investment from year to year, without the necessity of
    filing a general rate case.



The settlement also allows us to expand our existing program to
    replace steel service lines in the Mid-Tex Division’s
    natural gas delivery system. On October 13, 2010, the City
    of Dallas approved the recovery of the return, depreciation and
    taxes associated with the replacement of 100,000 steel service
    lines across the Mid-Tex Division by September 30, 2012.
    The RRM in the Mid-Tex Division was entered into as a result of
    a settlement in the September 20, 2007 Statement of Intent
    case filed with all Mid-Tex Division cities. Of the 440
    incorporated cities served by the Mid-Tex Division, 439 of these
    cities are part of the rate review mechanism process.



The West Texas rate review mechanism was entered into in August
    2008 as a result of a settlement with the West Texas Coalition
    of Cities. The Lubbock and Amarillo rate review mechanisms were
    entered into in the spring of 2009. The West Texas Coalition of
    Cities agreed to extend its RRM for one additional cycle as part
    of the settlement of this year’s filing.

    Consumer Counsel. The agreement called for a one-time refund to
    customers of $1.1 million made in January 2008.



Other
    Regulation



Each of our natural gas distribution divisions is regulated by
    various state or local public utility authorities. We are also
    subject to regulation by the United States Department of
    Transportation with respect to safety requirements in the
    operation and maintenance of our gas distribution facilities. In
    addition, our distribution operations are also subject to
    various state and federal laws regulating environmental matters.
    From time to time we receive inquiries regarding various
    environmental matters. We believe that our properties and
    operations substantially comply with and are operated in
    substantial conformity with applicable safety and environmental
    statutes and regulations. There are no administrative or
    judicial proceedings arising under environmental quality
    statutes pending or known to be contemplated by governmental
    agencies which would





have a material adverse effect on us or our operations. Our
    environmental claims have arisen primarily from former
    manufactured gas plant sites in Tennessee, Iowa and Missouri.



The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) allows, pursuant
    to Section 311 of the Natural Gas Policy Act, gas
    transportation services through our Atmos Pipeline —
    Texas assets “on behalf of” interstate pipelines or
    local distribution companies served by interstate pipelines,
    without subjecting these assets to the jurisdiction of the FERC.
    Additionally, the FERC has regulatory authority over the sale of
    natural gas in the wholesale gas market and the use and release
    of interstate pipeline and storage capacity, as well as
    authority to detect and prevent market manipulation and to
    enforce compliance with FERC’s other rules, policies and
    orders by companies engaged in the sale, purchase,
    transportation or storage of natural gas in interstate commerce.
    We have taken what we believe are the necessary and appropriate
    steps to comply with these regulations.



We have been replacing certain steel service lines in our
    Mid-Tex Division since our acquisition of the natural gas
    distribution system in 2004. We currently have an existing RRM
    that should allow us to recover the replacement costs through
    the end of fiscal 2012. On September 10, 2010, the Texas
    Railroad Commission (RRC) published for comment a proposed
    regulation dealing with distribution facility replacement. The
    proposed regulation would require each gas distribution system
    operator to develop a risk-based program for the removal or
    replacement of distribution facilities, including steel service
    lines. A number of Texas operators, industry groups and facility
    component manufacturers filed comments. The RRC is presently
    reviewing the comments with action related to this proposal
    anticipated later this year or early next year. We are committed
    to replacing the steel service lines on an accelerated schedule
    to ensure the safety and reliability of our distribution system,
    and as part of this commitment, we support the objectives of
    proposed rulemaking by the RRC for steel service-line
    replacements statewide. Due to the preliminary status of the
    rulemaking process, we cannot accurately anticipate the impact
    the proposed regulation would have on the Company, if adopted,
    or the expected cost of the replacement program.



Competition



Although our natural gas distribution operations are not
    currently in significant direct competition with any other
    distributors of natural gas to residential and commercial
    customers within our service areas, we do compete with other
    natural gas suppliers and suppliers of alternative fuels for
    sales to industrial customers. We compete in all aspects of our
    business with alternative energy sources, including, in
    particular, electricity. Electric utilities offer electricity as
    a rival energy source and compete for the space heating, water
    heating and cooking markets. Promotional incentives, improved
    equipment efficiencies and promotional rates all contribute to
    the acceptability of electrical equipment. The principal means
    to compete against alternative fuels is lower prices, and
    natural gas historically has maintained its price advantage in
    the residential, commercial and industrial markets. However,
    higher gas prices, coupled with the electric utilities’
    marketing efforts, have increased competition for residential
    and commercial customers.



Our regulated transmission and storage operations historically
    have faced limited competition from other existing intrastate
    pipelines and gas marketers seeking to provide or arrange
    transportation, storage and other services for customers.
    However, in the last two years, several new pipelines have been
    completed, which has increased the level of competition in this
    segment of our business.



Within our nonregulated operations, AEM competes with other
    natural gas marketers to provide natural gas management and
    other related services primarily to smaller customers requiring
    higher levels of balancing, scheduling and other related
    management services. AEM has experienced increased competition
    in recent years primarily from investment banks and major
    integrated oil and natural gas companies who offer lower cost,
    basic services. The increased competition has reduced margins
    most notably on its high-volume accounts.



Employees



At September 30, 2010, we had 4,913 employees,
    consisting of 4,776 employees in our regulated operations
    and 137 employees in our nonregulated operations.
