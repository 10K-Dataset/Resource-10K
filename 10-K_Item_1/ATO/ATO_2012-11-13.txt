ITEM 1.Business.

Overview and Strategy

Atmos Energy Corporation, headquartered in Dallas, Texas, and incorporated in Texas and Virginia, is engaged primarily in the regulated
natural gas distribution and transmission and storage businesses as well as other nonregulated natural gas businesses. We deliver natural gas through regulated sales and transportation arrangements to over three million residential, commercial,
public authority and industrial customers in nine states located primarily in the South, which makes us one of the country’s largest natural-gas-only distributors based on number of customers. We also operate one of the largest intrastate
pipelines in Texas based on miles of pipe.

In August 2012, we completed the sale of our natural gas distribution operations in
Missouri, Illinois and Iowa, representing approximately 84,000 customers and announced that we had entered into a definitive agreement to sell our natural gas distribution operations in Georgia, representing approximately 64,000 customers. After the
closing of the Georgia transaction, we will operate in eight states.

Through our nonregulated businesses, we primarily provide
natural gas management and marketing services to municipalities, other local gas distribution companies and industrial customers principally in the Midwest and Southeast and natural gas transportation along with storage services to certain of our
natural gas distribution divisions and third parties.

Our overall strategy is to:



Ÿdeliver superior shareholder value,



Ÿimprove the quality and consistency of earnings growth, while safely operating our regulated and nonregulated businesses exceptionally well and



Ÿenhance and strengthen a culture built on our core values.

We have delivered excellent shareholder value by growing our earnings and increasing our dividends for over 25 consecutive years. Through fiscal 2005, we achieved this record of growth through
acquisitions while efficiently managing our operating and maintenance expenses and leveraging our technology to achieve more efficient operations. Since that time, we have achieved growth by implementing rate designs that reduce or eliminate
regulatory lag and separate the recovery of our approved margins from customer usage patterns. In addition, we have developed various commercial opportunities within our regulated transmission and storage operations.

Our core values include focusing on our employees and customers while conducting our business with honesty and integrity. We continue to
strengthen our culture through ongoing communications with our employees and enhanced employee training.

Operating Segments

We operate the Company through the following three segments:



ŸThenatural gas distribution segment, which includes our regulated natural gas distribution and related sales operations,



ŸTheregulated transmission and storage segment, which includes the regulated pipeline and storage operations of our Atmos Pipeline — Texas
Division and



ŸThenonregulated segment, which includes our nonregulated natural gas management, nonregulated natural gas transmission, storage and other
services.







These operating segments are described in greater detail below.

Natural Gas Distribution Segment Overview

Our natural gas distribution segment represents approximately 65 percent of our consolidated net income. This segment is comprised of the following six regulated divisions, presented in order of total
rate base, covering service areas in nine states:



ŸAtmos Energy Mid-Tex Division,



ŸAtmos Energy Kentucky/Mid-States Division,



ŸAtmos Energy Louisiana Division,



ŸAtmos Energy West Texas Division,



ŸAtmos Energy Mississippi Division and



ŸAtmos Energy Colorado-Kansas Division

Our natural gas distribution business is a seasonal business. Gas sales to residential and commercial customers are greater during the winter months than during the remainder of the year. The volumes of
gas sales during the winter months will vary with the temperatures during these months.

Revenues in this operating segment are
established by regulatory authorities in the states in which we operate. These rates are intended to be sufficient to cover the costs of conducting business and to provide a reasonable return on invested capital. Our primary service areas are
located in Colorado, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Tennessee and Texas. We have more limited service areas in Georgia and Virginia. See Note 6 in the consolidated financial statements for a description of the completed sale of our
Missouri, Illinois and Iowa service areas and the anticipated sale of our Georgia distribution operations. In addition, we transport natural gas for others through our distribution system.

Rates established by regulatory authorities often include cost adjustment mechanisms for costs that (i) are subject to significant
price fluctuations compared to our other costs, (ii) represent a large component of our cost of service and (iii) are generally outside our control.

Purchased gas cost adjustment mechanisms represent a common form of cost adjustment mechanism. Purchased gas cost adjustment mechanisms provide natural gas utility companies a method of recovering
purchased gas costs on an ongoing basis without filing a rate case because they provide a dollar-for-dollar offset to increases or decreases in natural gas distribution gas costs. Therefore, although substantially all of our natural gas distribution
operating revenues fluctuate with the cost of gas that we purchase, natural gas distribution gross profit (which is defined as operating revenues less purchased gas cost) is generally not affected by fluctuations in the cost of gas.

Additionally, some jurisdictions have introduced performance-based ratemaking adjustments to provide incentives to natural gas utilities
to minimize purchased gas costs through improved storage management and use of financial instruments to lock in gas costs. Under the performance-based ratemaking adjustment, purchased gas costs savings are shared between the utility and its
customers.

Finally, regulatory authorities have approved weather normalization adjustments (WNA) for approximately 97 percent
of residential and commercial margins in our service areas as a part of our rates. WNA minimizes the effect of weather that is above or below normal by allowing us to increase customers’ bills to offset the effect of lower gas usage when
weather is warmer than normal and decrease customers’ bills to offset the effect of higher gas usage when weather is colder than normal.







As of September 30, 2012 we had WNA for our residential and commercial meters in the
following service areas for the following periods:



Georgia, Kansas, West TexasOctober — MayKentucky, Mississippi, Tennessee, Mid-TexNovember — AprilLouisianaDecember — MarchVirginiaJanuary — December

Our supply of natural gas is provided by a variety of suppliers, including independent producers,
marketers and pipeline companies and withdrawals of gas from proprietary and contracted storage assets. Additionally, the natural gas supply for our Mid-Tex Division includes peaking and spot purchase agreements.

Supply arrangements consist of both base load and swing supply (peaking) quantities and are contracted from our suppliers on a firm basis
with various terms at market prices. Base load quantities are those that flow at a constant level throughout the month and swing supply quantities provide the flexibility to change daily quantities to match increases or decreases in requirements
related to weather conditions.

Except for local production purchases, we select our natural gas suppliers through a
competitive bidding process by periodically requesting proposals from suppliers that have demonstrated that they can provide reliable service. We select these suppliers based on their ability to deliver gas supply to our designated firm pipeline
receipt points at the lowest reasonable cost. Major suppliers during fiscal 2012 were Anadarko Energy Services, BP Energy Company, ConocoPhillips, Devon Gas Services, L.P., Enbridge Marketing (US) L.P., Iberdrola Renewables, Inc., National Fuel
Marketing Company, LLC, Sequent Energy Management, L.P., Texla Energy Management, Inc. and Atmos Energy Marketing, LLC, our natural gas marketing subsidiary.

The combination of base load, peaking and spot purchase agreements, coupled with the withdrawal of gas held in storage, allows us the flexibility to adjust to changes in weather, which minimizes our need
to enter into long-term firm commitments. We estimate our peak-day availability of natural gas supply to be approximately 4.4 Bcf. The peak-day demand for our natural gas distribution operations in fiscal 2012 was on February 11, 2012, when
sales to customers reached approximately 3.0 Bcf.

Currently, our natural gas distribution divisions, except for our Mid-Tex
Division, utilize 43 pipeline transportation companies, both interstate and intrastate, to transport our natural gas. The pipeline transportation agreements are firm and many of them have “pipeline no-notice” storage service, which
provides for daily balancing between system requirements and nominated flowing supplies. These agreements have been negotiated with the shortest term necessary while still maintaining our right of first refusal. The natural gas supply for our
Mid-Tex Division is delivered primarily by our Atmos Pipeline — Texas Division.

To maintain our deliveries to high
priority customers, we have the ability, and have exercised our right, to curtail deliveries to certain customers under the terms of interruptible contracts or applicable state regulations or statutes. Our customers’ demand on our system is not
necessarily indicative of our ability to meet current or anticipated market demands or immediate delivery requirements because of factors such as the physical limitations of gathering, storage and transmission systems, the duration and severity of
cold weather, the availability of gas reserves from our suppliers, the ability to purchase additional supplies on a short-term basis and actions by federal and state regulatory authorities. Curtailment rights provide us the flexibility to meet the
human-needs requirements of our customers on a firm basis. Priority allocations imposed by federal and state regulatory agencies, as well as other factors beyond our control, may affect our ability to meet the demands of our customers. We anticipate
no problems with obtaining additional gas supply as needed for our customers.

Below, we briefly describe our six natural gas
distribution divisions. We operate in our service areas under terms of non-exclusive franchise agreements granted by the various cities and towns that we serve. At September 30, 2012, we held 1,006 franchises having terms generally ranging from
five to 35 years. A significant number of our franchises expire each year, which require renewal prior to the end of their terms. We believe that we will be able to renew our franchises as they expire. Additional information concerning our natural
gas distribution divisions is presented under the caption “Operating Statistics”.







Atmos Energy Mid-Tex Division.Our Mid-Tex
Division serves approximately 550 incorporated and unincorporated communities in the north-central, eastern and western parts of Texas, including the Dallas/Fort Worth Metroplex. The governing body of each municipality we serve has original
jurisdiction over all gas distribution rates, operations and services within its city limits, except with respect to sales of natural gas for vehicle fuel and agricultural use. The Railroad Commission of Texas (RRC) has exclusive appellate
jurisdiction over all rate and regulatory orders and ordinances of the municipalities and exclusive original jurisdiction over rates and services to customers not located within the limits of a municipality.

Prior to fiscal 2008, this division operated under one system-wide rate structure. In fiscal 2008, we reached a settlement with cities
representing approximately 80 percent of this division’s customers that allowed us to update rates for customers in these cities using an annual rate review mechanism (RRM) from fiscal 2008 through fiscal 2011, when the RRM was active. We filed
a formal rate case for the Mid-Tex Division in fiscal 2012. After the conclusion of this rate case, we expect to negotiate a new rate review mechanism process. In June 2011, we reached an agreement with the City of Dallas to enter into the Dallas
Annual Rate Review (DARR). This rate review provides for an annual rate review without the necessity of filing a general rate case. The first rates were implemented under the DARR in June 2012.

Atmos Energy Kentucky/Mid-States Division.Our Kentucky/Mid-States Division currently operates
in more than 230 communities across Georgia, Kentucky, Tennessee and Virginia. The service areas in these states are primarily rural; however, this division serves Franklin, Tennessee and other suburban areas of Nashville. We update our rates in
this division through periodic formal rate filings made with each state’s public service commission.

On August 1,
2012, we completed the divestiture of our natural gas distribution operations in Missouri, Illinois and Iowa, representing approximately 84,000 customers in 189 communities, with some of the Missouri communities located in our Atmos Energy
Colorado-Kansas Division. On August 8, 2012, we announced that we had entered into a definitive agreement to sell our natural gas distribution operations in Georgia, representing approximately 64,000 customers in 19 communities. See Note 6 in
the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding these divestitures.

Atmos Energy Louisiana
Division.In Louisiana, we serve nearly 300 communities, including the suburban areas of New Orleans, the metropolitan area of Monroe and western Louisiana. Direct sales of natural gas to industrial customers in
Louisiana, who use gas for fuel or in manufacturing processes, and sales of natural gas for vehicle fuel are exempt from regulation and are recognized in our nonregulated segment. Our rates in this division are updated annually through a rate
stabilization clause filing without filing a formal rate case.

Atmos Energy West Texas
Division.Our West Texas Division serves approximately 80 communities in West Texas, including the Amarillo, Lubbock and Midland areas. Like our Mid-Tex Division, each municipality we serve has original
jurisdiction over all gas distribution rates, operations and services within its city limits, with the RRC having exclusive appellate jurisdiction over the municipalities and exclusive original jurisdiction over rates and services provided to
customers not located within the limits of a municipality. Prior to fiscal 2008, rates were updated in this division through formal rate proceedings. In fiscal 2008 and 2009, we reached an agreement with the West Texas service areas and the Amarillo
and Lubbock service areas that allowed us to update rates for customers in these cities using an annual rate review mechanism (RRM) through fiscal 2011, when the RRM was active. We filed a formal rate case for the West Texas Division in fiscal 2012,
which was approved on October 2, 2012. We expect to negotiate a new rate review mechanism process in fiscal 2013.

Atmos Energy Mississippi Division.In Mississippi, we serve about 110 communities throughout the
northern half of the state, including the Jackson metropolitan area. Our rates in the Mississippi Division are updated annually through a stable rate filing without filing a formal rate case.

Atmos Energy Colorado-Kansas Division.Our Colorado-Kansas Division serves approximately 170
communities throughout Colorado and Kansas, including the cities of Olathe, Kansas, a suburb of Kansas City and Greeley, Colorado, located near Denver. We update our rates in this division through periodic formal rate filings and in Kansas through
periodic infrastructure replacement filings made with each state’s public service commission.

Regulated Transmission and Storage Segment Overview

Our regulated transmission and storage segment represents approximately 30 percent of our consolidated net income and consists of the
regulated pipeline and storage operations of our Atmos Pipeline — Texas Division. This division transports natural gas to our Mid-Tex Division, transports natural gas for third parties and manages five underground storage reservoirs in Texas.
We also provide ancillary services customary in the pipeline industry including parking and lending arrangements and sales of inventory on hand. Parking arrangements provide short-term interruptible storage of gas on our pipeline. Lending services
provide short-term interruptible loans of natural gas from our pipeline to meet market demands. Gross profit earned from our Mid-Tex Division and through certain other transportation and storage services is subject to traditional ratemaking governed
by the RRC. Rates are updated through periodic formal rate proceedings and filings made under Texas’ Gas Reliability Infrastructure Program (GRIP). GRIP allows us to include in our rate base annually approved capital costs incurred in the prior
calendar year provided that we file a complete rate case at least once every five years. Atmos Pipeline–Texas’ existing regulatory mechanisms allow certain transportation and storage services to be provided under market-based
rates with minimal regulation.

These operations include one of the largest intrastate pipeline operations in Texas
with a heavy concentration in the established natural gas-producing areas of central, northern and eastern Texas, extending into or near the major producing areas of the Texas Gulf Coast and the Delaware and Val Verde Basins of West Texas. Nine
basins located in Texas are believed to contain a substantial portion of the nation’s remaining onshore natural gas reserves with our pipeline system providing access to all of these basins.

Nonregulated Segment Overview

Our nonregulated activities are conducted through Atmos Energy Holdings, Inc. (AEH), which is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Atmos Energy Corporation and operates primarily in the Midwest and Southeast
areas of the United States. Currently, this segment represents less than five percent of our consolidated net income.

AEH’s primary business is to deliver gas and provide related services by aggregating and purchasing gas supply, arranging
transportation and storage logistics and ultimately delivering gas to customers at competitive prices. AEH also earns storage and transportation margins from (i) utilizing its proprietary 21-mile pipeline located in New Orleans, Louisiana to
aggregate gas supply for our regulated natural gas distribution division in Louisiana, its gas delivery activities and, on a more limited basis, for third parties and (ii) managing proprietary storage in Kentucky and Louisiana to supplement the
natural gas needs of our natural gas distribution divisions during peak periods. The majority of these margins are generated through demand fees established under contracts with certain of our natural gas distribution divisions that are renewed
periodically and subject to regulatory oversight.

AEH utilizes customer-owned or contracted storage capacity to serve its
customers. In an effort to offset the demand fees paid to contract for storage capacity and to maximize the value of this capacity, AEH sells financial







instruments in an effort to earn a gross profit margin through the arbitrage of pricing differences in various locations and by recognizing pricing differences that occur over time. Certain of
these arrangements are with regulated affiliates, which have been approved by applicable state regulatory commissions.

Ratemaking Activity

Overview

The method of determining regulated rates varies among the states in which our regulated businesses operate. The regulatory authorities have the responsibility of ensuring that utilities in their
jurisdictions operate in the best interests of customers while providing utility companies the opportunity to earn a reasonable return on their investment. Generally, each regulatory authority reviews rate requests and establishes a rate structure
intended to generate revenue sufficient to cover the costs of conducting business and to provide a reasonable return on invested capital.

Our rate strategy focuses on reducing or eliminating regulatory lag, obtaining adequate returns and providing stable, predictable margins, which benefit both our customers and the Company. As a result of
our ratemaking efforts in recent years, Atmos Energy has:



ŸAnnual ratemaking mechanisms in place in four states that provide for an annual rate review and adjustment to rates for approximately 77 percent of our
natural gas distribution gross margin.



ŸAccelerated recovery of capital for approximately 74 percent of our natural gas distribution gross margin.



ŸWNA mechanisms in eight states that serve to minimize the effects of weather on approximately 97 percent of our natural gas distribution gross margin.



ŸThe ability to recover the gas cost portion of bad debts for approximately 75 percent of our natural gas distribution gross margin.

Although substantial progress has been made in recent years by improving rate design across Atmos
Energy’s operating areas, we will continue to seek improvements in rate design to address cost variations that are related to pass-through energy costs beyond our control. Further, potential changes in federal energy policy and adverse economic
conditions will necessitate continued vigilance by the Company and our regulators in meeting the challenges presented by these external factors.

Recent Ratemaking Activity

Substantially all of our regulated
revenues in the fiscal years ended September 30, 2012, 2011 and 2010 were derived from sales at rates set by or subject to approval by local or state authorities. Net operating income increases resulting from ratemaking activity totaling $30.7
million, $72.4 million and $56.8 million, became effective in fiscal 2012, 2011 and 2010, as summarized below:

Our recent ratemaking activity is discussed in greater detail below.

Rate Case Filings

A rate case is a formal request from Atmos Energy to a regulatory authority to increase rates that are charged to customers. Rate cases may also be initiated when the regulatory authorities request us to
justify our rates. This process is referred to as a “show cause” action. Adequate rates are intended to provide for recovery of the Company’s costs as well as a fair rate of return to our shareholders and ensure that we continue to
safely deliver reliable, reasonably priced natural gas service to our customers. The following table summarizes our recent rate cases:

(1)In its final order, the RRC approved a $3.0 million increase in operating income from customers in the Dallas & Environs portion of the
Mid-Tex Division. Operating income should increase $0.2 million, net of the GRIP 2008 rates that will be superseded. The ruling also provided for regulatory accounting treatment for certain costs related to storage assets and costs moving from our
Mid-Tex Division within our natural gas distribution segment to our regulated transmission and storage segment.







Infrastructure Programs

As discussed above in “Natural Gas Distribution Segment Overview” and “Regulated Transmission and Storage Segment
Overview,” infrastructure programs such as GRIP allow our regulated companies the opportunity to include in their rate base annually approved capital costs incurred in the prior calendar year. We currently have infrastructure programs in Texas,
Georgia and Kentucky. The following table summarizes our infrastructure program filings with effective dates during the fiscal years ended September 30, 2012, 2011 and 2010:

Annual Rate Filing Mechanisms

As an instrument to reduce regulatory lag, annual rate filing mechanisms allow us to refresh our rates on a periodic basis without filing
a formal rate case. However, these filings still involve discovery by the appropriate regulatory authorities prior to the final determination of rates under these mechanisms. As discussed above in “Natural Gas Distribution Segment
Overview,” we currently have annual rate filing mechanisms in our Louisiana, Mississippi and Georgia divisions and in a portion of our Texas divisions. These mechanisms are referred to as Dallas annual rate review (DARR) in our Mid-Tex

Beginning in fiscal year 2008, we entered into RRM mechanisms within our Mid-Tex and West Texas divisions.
Throughout the period of fiscal 2008 through fiscal 2011, when the RRM mechanisms were active, we were able to successfully implement new base rates within the various cities of both divisions. In fiscal 2012, we filed a rate case in both the
Mid-Tex Division (for all cities except Dallas) and the West Texas Division. Following the conclusion of the Mid-Tex Division case, we expect to negotiate a new rate review mechanism process with each of the cities within both the Mid-Tex and West
Texas divisions.







We continue to operate under an annual rate mechanism, DARR, with the City of Dallas, which
was approved in June 2011. The first rates were implemented under the DARR in June 2012.

During fiscal 2011, the RRC’s
Division of Public Safety issued a new rule requiring natural gas distribution companies to develop and implement a risk-based program for the renewal or replacement of distribution facilities, including steel service lines. The rule allows for
the deferral of all expense associated with capital expenditures incurred pursuant to this rule, including the recording of interest on the deferred expenses.

Other Ratemaking Activity

The following table summarizes other
ratemaking activity during the fiscal years ended September 30, 2012, 2011 and 2010:

(1)The Ad Valorem filing relates to a collection of property taxes in excess of the amount included in our Kansas service area’s base rates.



(2)Automated Meter Infrastructure (AMI) relates to a pilot program in the Weld County area of our Colorado service area.

Other Regulation

Each
of our natural gas distribution divisions as well as our regulated transmission and storage division is regulated by various state or local public utility authorities. We are also subject to regulation by the United States Department of
Transportation with respect to safety requirements in the operation and maintenance of our transmission and distribution facilities. In addition, our distribution operations are also subject to various state and federal laws regulating environmental
matters. From time to time we receive inquiries regarding various environmental matters. We believe that our properties and operations substantially comply with, and are operated in substantial conformity with, applicable safety and environmental
statutes and regulations. There are no administrative or judicial proceedings arising under environmental quality statutes pending or known to be contemplated by governmental agencies which would have a material adverse effect on us or our
operations. Our environmental claims have arisen primarily from former manufactured gas plant sites.

The Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission (FERC) allows, pursuant to Section 311 of the Natural Gas Policy Act, gas transportation services through our Atmos Pipeline—Texas assets “on behalf of” interstate pipelines or local distribution companies
served by interstate pipelines, without subjecting these assets to the jurisdiction of the FERC. Additionally, the FERC has regulatory authority over the sale of natural gas in the wholesale gas market and the use and release of interstate pipeline
and storage capacity, as well as authority to detect and prevent market manipulation and to enforce compliance with FERC’s other rules, policies and orders







by companies engaged in the sale, purchase, transportation or storage of natural gas in interstate commerce. We have taken what we believe are the necessary and appropriate steps to comply with
these regulations.

Competition

Although our natural gas distribution operations are not currently in significant direct competition with any other distributors of natural gas to residential and commercial customers within our service
areas, we do compete with other natural gas suppliers and suppliers of alternative fuels for sales to industrial customers. We compete in all aspects of our business with alternative energy sources, including, in particular, electricity. Electric
utilities offer electricity as a rival energy source and compete for the space heating, water heating and cooking markets. Promotional incentives, improved equipment efficiencies and promotional rates all contribute to the acceptability of
electrical equipment. The principal means to compete against alternative fuels is lower prices, and natural gas historically has maintained its price advantage in the residential, commercial and industrial markets.

Our regulated transmission and storage operations historically have faced limited competition from other existing intrastate pipelines and
gas marketers seeking to provide or arrange transportation, storage and other services for customers. However, in the last few years, several new pipelines have been completed, which has increased the level of competition in this segment of our
business.

Within our nonregulated operations, AEM competes with other natural gas marketers to provide natural gas management
and other related services primarily to smaller customers requiring higher levels of balancing, scheduling and other related management services. AEM has experienced increased competition in recent years primarily from investment banks and major
integrated oil and natural gas companies who offer lower cost, basic services. The increased competition has reduced margins most notably on its high-volume accounts.

Employees

At September 30, 2012, we had 4,759 employees, consisting
of 4,646 employees in our regulated operations and 113 employees in our nonregulated operations.
