Overview

(together with its consolidated subsidiaries, the “Company,” the “Registrant,” “we,” “us” or “our”) is a leading benchmarks & ratings, analytics, data and research provider serving the global capital, commodities and commercial markets. The capital markets include asset managers, investment banks, commercial banks, exchanges, and issuers; the commodities markets include producers, traders and intermediaries within energy, metals, and agriculture; and the commercial markets include professionals and corporate executives within automotive and marketing / research information services. We serve our global customers through a broad range of products and services available through both third-party and proprietary distribution channels.

We were incorporated in December 1925 under the laws of the state of New York.



On November 3, 2014, we completed the sale of McGraw Hill Construction, which has historically been part of our Commodities & Commercial segment, to Symphony Technology Group for $320 million in cash, completing the portfolio rationalization to create McGraw Hill Financial. We recorded an after-tax gain on the sale of$160 million, which is included in income from discontinued operations, net of tax in the consolidated statement of income for the year endedDecember 31, 2014. We intend to use a portion of the after-tax proceeds to make selective acquisitions, investments, share repurchases and for general corporate purposes.



On March 22, 2013, we completed the sale of McGraw-Hill Education ("MHE") to investment funds affiliated with Apollo Global Management, LLC for a purchase price of $2.4 billion in cash. We recorded an after-tax gain on the sale of$589 million, which is included in income from discontinued operations, net of tax in the consolidated statement of income for the year ended  December 31, 2013. We have used a portion of the after-tax proceeds from the sale to pay down short-term debt, for the special dividend paid in 2012, and to continue share repurchases. We intend to continue to use a portion of the after-tax proceeds to make selective acquisitions, investments, share repurchases and for general corporate purposes.



In 2014, we continued to focus on investments in targeted financial assets, divested selected non-core assets, reductions in our real estate portfolio and increased shareholder return.



Investments in Targeted Financial Assets / Divested Selected Non-Core Assets

During 2014, we continued to execute our strategy of exiting non-core assets while investing for growth in markets that have size and scale.

•Commodities & Commercial—we acquired Eclipse Energy Group AS which complements our North American natural gas capabilities, which we obtained from our Bentek Energy LLC acquisition in 2011;

•S&P Ratings—we acquired BRC Investor Services S.A., a Colombia-based ratings firm providing risk classifications of banks, financial services providers, insurance companies, corporate bonds and structured issues that will expand our presence in the Latin American credit markets.

In 2014, in addition to the divestiture of McGraw Hill Construction discussed above, we streamlined our infrastructure by reducing our real estate footprint by selling our data facility, initiating the consolidation of our corporate headquarters with our operations in New York City, as well as disposing of our corporate aircraft.

During 2013, we acquired approximately 11 million equity shares representing 15.07% of CRISIL Limited's ("CRISIL") total outstanding equity shares for $214 million, increasing our ownership percentage in CRISIL to 67.84% from 52.77%.



In 2013, we also completed certain dispositions of our non-core assets that allow us to apply greater focus on our high-growth, high-margin benchmark businesses.

•Commodities & Commercial—we completed the sale of Aviation Week to Penton, a privately held business information company;

•S&P Capital IQ—we completed the sale of Financial Communications as well as the closure of several non-core businesses.



During 2012, we completed several acquisitions and formed a joint venture that we believe position us for long-term growth across all our segments.









•S&P Dow Jones Indices—our transaction with CME Group, Inc. and CME Group Index Services LLC to form a new company, S&P Dow Jones Indices LLC;

•S&P Capital IQ—Credit Market Analysis Limited, a provider of independent data concerning the over-the-counter markets; QuantHouse, an independent global provider of end-to-end systematic low-latency market data solutions; and R² Technologies, a provider of advanced risk and scenario-based analytics;

Increased Shareholder Return

During the three years endedDecember 31, 2014, we have returned$3.3 billionto our shareholders through a combination of share repurchases, our quarterly dividend and a special dividend.



We completed share repurchases of$1.6 billionand distributed regular quarterly dividends totaling approximately$920 millionduring the three years ended December 31, 2014. On December 6, 2012, our Board of Directors approved a special dividend in the amount of $2.50 per share on our common stock, payable on December 27, 2012 to shareholders of record on December 18, 2012. This returned an additional approximately $700 million to our shareholders. Also, on February 12, 2015, the Board of Directors approved an increase in the quarterly common stock dividend from $0.30 per share to $0.33 per share.



Our Businesses



Our operations consist of four reportable segments: Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services (“S&P Ratings”), S&P Capital IQ, S&P Dow Jones Indices ("S&P DJ Indices") and Commodities & Commercial (“C&C”).



S&P Ratings

S&P Ratings is an independent provider of credit ratings, research and analytics and offers investors and market participants information, ratings and benchmarks. Credit ratings are one of several tools that investors can use when making decisions about purchasing bonds and other fixed income investments. They are opinions about credit risk and our ratings express our opinion about the ability and willingness of an issuer, such as a corporation or state or city government, to meet its financial obligations in full and on time. Our credit ratings can also relate to the credit quality of an individual debt issue, such as a corporate or municipal bond, and the relative likelihood that the issuer may default.



With offices in over 25 countries around the world, S&P Ratings is an important part of the world's financial infrastructure and has played a leading role for over 150 years in providing investors with information and independent benchmarks for their investment and financial decisions as well as access to the capital markets. The key constituents S&P Ratings serves are investors; corporations; governments; municipalities; commercial and investment banks; insurance companies; asset managers; and other debt issuers.



As the capital markets continue to evolve, S&P Ratings is well-positioned to capitalize on opportunities driven by continuing regulatory changes through its global network, well-established position in corporate markets and strong investor reputation.



S&P Ratings differentiates its revenue between transaction and non-transaction. Transaction revenue primarily includes fees associated with:

•ratings related to new issuance of corporate and government debt instruments, and structured finance debt instruments;

•bank loan ratings; and

•corporate credit estimates, which are intended, based on an abbreviated analysis, to provide an indication of our opinion regarding creditworthiness of a company which does not currently have an S&P Ratings credit rating.



Non-transaction revenue primarily includes fees for surveillance of a credit rating, annual fees for customer relationship-based pricing programs and fees for entity credit ratings.

Our Strategy



We strive to be the leading provider of transparent and independent benchmarks & ratings, analytics, data and research in the global capital, commodities and commercial markets.

We intend to provide essential intelligence through benchmarks and ratings, analytics, data, and research that enables mission-critical decisions in investment management, investment banking, CBIS (commercial banking, insurance and specialty), and corporates.



We are aligning our efforts against two key strategic priorities: creating growth and driving performance.



Creating Growth

Driving Performance



•We will strive to boost operational excellence, productivity, risk management, and compliance; and to attract and develop the finest talent.



There can be no assurance that we will achieve success in implementing any one or more of these strategies as a variety of factors could unfavorably impact operating results, including prolonged difficulties in the global credit markets and a change in the regulatory environment affecting our businesses.
