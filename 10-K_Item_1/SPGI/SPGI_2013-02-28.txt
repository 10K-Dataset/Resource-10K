Item 1.Business



Overview



The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc. (together with its consolidated subsidiaries, the “Company,” the “Registrant,” “we,” “us” or “our”) is a leading content and analytics provider serving the capital, commodities and commercial markets. The capital markets include asset managers, banks, exchanges, issuers and financial advisors; the commodities markets include producers, traders and intermediaries within energy, metals, and agriculture; and the commercial markets include professionals and corporate executives within automotive, construction, aerospace and defense, and marketing / research information services. We serve our global customers through a broad range of products and services available through both third-party and proprietary distribution channels.



On September 12, 2011, we announced that our Board of Directors had unanimously approved a comprehensive Growth and Value Plan that includes separation into two companies: McGraw Hill Financial ("MHF"), focused on providing essential information to the capital, commodities and commercial markets, and McGraw-Hill Education ("MHE"), focused on education products and services and digital learning. The Growth and Value Plan has been focused on accelerating growth and increasing shareholder value through not only this separation, but also through substantial cost-cutting initiatives and increased share repurchases.



As we approach the completion of our Growth and Value Plan we have achieved our objectives under our Growth and Value Plan relating to the separation of MHE, cost reductions, increased shareholder return and investing / divesting in targeted assets that position us for long-term growth.



Separation of MHE

Our Board of Directors determined that the separation would provide benefits to the Company, including:

•Strategic Focus. Allow each independent company to design and implement corporate strategies and policies based on the industries that they serve and each specific business' unique characteristics, including customers, sales cycles and product life cycles.

•Management Focus. Allow management of both companies to design and implement plans and policies in line with the specific business characteristics and strategic objectives of the respective companies.

•Management and Employee Incentives. Enable both companies to create incentives for its management and employees that are more closely tied to its business performance. Separate compensation arrangements more closely align the interests of each company's management and employees with the interests of its stockholders and increase their ability to attract and retain personnel.

•Access to Capital. Remove the need for the businesses to compete internally for capital. Instead, both companies would have the ability to tailor their capital structures and financial policies to fit their individual business needs.

•Flexibility for Acquisitions and Partnerships. Provide each independent company increased strategic flexibility to make acquisitions and form partnerships and alliances in its target markets, unencumbered by considerations of the potential impact on the businesses of the other company.

•Investor Choice. Provide investors in each company with a more targeted investment opportunity with different investment and business characteristics, including different opportunities for growth, capital structure, business models and financial returns. This will allow investors to evaluate the separate and distinct merits, performance and future prospects of each company.



The timing of completing the separation has been dependent on many factors, including whether the separation occurs through a spin-off to our shareholders or a sale. After carefully considering all of the options for creating shareholder value, our Board of Directors concluded that a sale of MHE would generate the best value and certainty for our shareholders and most favorably position MHE for long-term success.



As such, on November 26, 2012, we entered into a definitive agreement to sell MHE to investment funds affiliated with Apollo Global Management, LLC, for a purchase price of $2.5 billion subject to certain closing adjustments. As part of this transaction, McGraw-Hill will receive $250 million in senior unsecured notes issued by the purchaser at an annual interest rate of 8.5%. We are currently in the process of determining the fair value of these notes. For all periods presented in this Form 10-K, the results of operations of MHE have been reclassified to reflect the business as a discontinued operation and the assets and liabilities of the business have been reclassified as held for sale in our consolidated balance sheets. The sale of MHE is subject to various









closing conditions and is anticipated to close in the first quarter of 2013. See Item 1a,Risk Factors,in this Form 10-K for updates to certain risk factors related to the sale.



We plan to use the proceeds of the sale to pay off any short-term borrowing obligations, to make selective acquisitions that enhance our portfolio of brands and to sustain our share repurchase program.



Cost Reductions

From the announcement of our Growth and Value Plan we have been committed to on-going cost savings by year-end of greater than $100 million. We have surpassed that goal by approaching $175 million in savings by the end of 2012 through a focused effort on our cost structure, including:

•select headcount reductions of approximately 670 employees within MHF and 530 employees within MHE,

•the migration of numerous accounting work-streams, human resource processes and selected information-technology support services to world-class partners that specialize in these operations, and

•redesigning the employee benefit plans including a freeze of our U.S. employee retirement plan.



These cost goals were focused across the entire Company, including MHE. Approximately two-thirds of these cost reductions benefited MHE. Cost savings at MHF were partially offset by costs that were previously allocated to MHE, such as costs for centralized departments, that could not be classified as discontinued operations due to the nature of the expense. We will continue to look to extend outsourcing efforts to enhance cost synergies and realign administrative support for a leaner overall cost structure.



Increased Shareholder Return

During the two years ended December 31, 2012, we have returned $3.1 billion to our shareholders through a combination of share repurchases, our quarterly dividend and a special dividend.



We completed share repurchases of $1.8 billion and distributed regularly quarterly dividends totaling approximately $600 million during the two years ended December 31, 2012. On December 6, 2012, our Board of Directors approved a special dividend in the amount of $2.50 per share on our common stock, payable on December 27, 2012 to shareholders on record on December 18, 2012. This returned an additional approximately $700 million to our shareholders. Also, on January 30, 2013, the Board of Directors approved an increase in the quarterly common stock dividend from $0.255 per share to $0.28 per share.



Investing / Divesting Targeted Assets

During 2012, we completed several acquisitions that we believe will position us for long-term growth across all our segments.

•S&P Dow Jones Indices- our transaction with CME Group, Inc. and CME Group Index Services LLC to form a new company, S&P Dow Jones Indices LLC;

•S&P Capital IQ- Credit Market Analysis Limited, a provider of independent data concerning the over-the-counter markets; QuantHouse, an independent global provider of end-to-end systematic low-latency market data solutions; and R² Technologies, a provider of advanced risk and scenario-based analytics;

•Commodities & Commercial- Kingsman SA, a privately-held, Switzerland-based provider of price information and analytics for the global sugar and biofuels markets;

•Standard & Poor's Ratings- Coalition Development Ltd., a privately-held U.K. analytics company.



Refer to "Acquisitions and Partnerships" below for further discussion.



We completed the sale of our Broadcasting Group, previously included in our Commodities & Commercial segment, on December 30, 2011 and, accordingly, for the year ended December 31, 2011 and prior periods, the results of operations of the Broadcasting Group have been reclassified to reflect the business as a discontinued operation and assets and liabilities of the business have been removed from our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2011.











The Growth and Value Plan has required us to incur non-recurring costs necessary to enable separation, reduce our cost structure, accelerate growth and increase shareholder value. The table below summarizes these costs including restructuring charges for the year ended December 31, 2012:

(in millions)ContinuingDiscontinuedProfessional fees$117$17Restructuring charges6839Transaction costs for our S&P Dow Jones Indices LLC joint venture15—Charges related to our lease commitments83Miscellaneous charges182$226$61



Total costs incurred since the Growth and Value Plan was announced in September of 2011 have been $297 million. These one-time expenses are largely professional fees, as we need the support of various consultants, business process and information technology firms, and financial advisors.



Our Businesses



As a result of our transaction with CME Group, Inc. and CME Group Index Services LLC to form a new company, S&P Dow Jones Indices LLC and how we are managing this company, combined with the formation of MHF, we have separated our previously reported S&P Capital IQ / S&P Indices segment into two separate reportable segments. Our operations now consist of four reportable segments: Standard & Poor’s Ratings (“S&P Ratings”), S&P Capital IQ, S&P Dow Jones Indices ("S&P DJ Indices") and Commodities & Commercial (“C&C”). Our previously reported MHE segment is reported as a discontinued operation as discussed previously under the heading, "Separation of MHE".



S&P Ratings

S&P Ratings is a provider of credit ratings, offering investors and market participants information and independent ratings benchmarks. Credit ratings are one of several tools that investors can use when making decisions about purchasing bonds and other fixed income investments. They are opinions about credit risk and our ratings express our opinion about the ability and willingness of an issuer, such as a corporation or state or city government, to meet its financial obligations in full and on time. Our credit ratings can also speak to the credit quality of an individual debt issue, such as a corporate or municipal bond, and the relative likelihood that the issue may default.



As the capital markets continue to evolve, S&P Ratings is well-positioned to capitalize on opportunities driven by continuing regulatory changes through its global network, well-established position in corporate markets and strong investor reputation.



With offices in over 23 countries around the world, S&P Ratings is an important part of the world's financial infrastructure and has played a leading role for over 150 years in providing investors with information and independent benchmarks for their investment and financial decisions as well as access to the capital markets. The key constituents S&P Ratings serves are investors; corporations; governments; municipalities; commercial and investment banks; insurance companies; asset managers; and other debt issuers.



S&P Ratings differentiates its revenue between transaction and non-transaction. Transaction revenue primarily includes fees associated with:

•ratings related to new issuance of corporate and government debt instruments, and structured finance debt instruments;

•bank loan ratings; and

•corporate credit estimates, which are intended, based on an abbreviated analysis, to provide an indication of our opinion regarding creditworthiness of a company which does not currently have an S&P Ratings credit rating.



Non-transaction revenue primarily includes fees for surveillance of a credit rating, annual fees for customer relationship-based pricing programs and fees for entity credit ratings.



S&P Capital IQ

S&P Capital IQ is a global provider of digital and traditional financial research and analytical tools for capital market participants. It deploys the latest technology-driven strategies to deliver to customers an integrated portfolio of cross-asset analytics, desktop services, and investment recommendations in the rapidly growing financial information, data and analytics market. The key









constituents S&P Capital IQ serves are asset managers; investment banks; investors; brokers; financial advisors; investment sponsors; and companies’ back-office functions, including compliance, operations, risk, clearance, and settlement.

S&P DJ Indices

S&P DJ Indices is a global index provider that maintains a wide variety of investable and benchmark indices to meet an array of investor needs. S&P DJ Indices generates subscription revenue but primarily derives revenue from non-subscription products based on the S&P and Dow Jones Indices, specifically through fees on exchange traded funds, mutual funds and insurance assets. Additionally, fees are generated through both over-the-counter derivative issuances as well as exchange traded derivatives.



S&P DJ Indices includes our transaction with CME Group, Inc. and CME Group Index Services LLC to form a new company, S&P Dow Jones Indices LLC. The combination of these businesses created the world's largest provider of market indices.



S&P DJ Indices generate revenue through investment vehicles such as:

•exchange traded funds, which are based on the S&P and Dow Jones Indices and generate revenue through fees based on assets and underlying funds;

•index-related licensing fees, which are generally either annual fees based on assets under management or flat fees for over-the-counter derivatives and retail-structured products;

•data subscriptions, which support index fund management, portfolio analytics and research; and

•listed derivatives, which generate royalties based on trading volumes of derivatives contracts.



Commodities & Commercial

C&C includes such brands as Platts, J.D. Power and Associates, McGraw-Hill Construction andAviation Week.

Our Strategy



We strive to be the foremost provider of essential information such as benchmarks, intelligence and analytics in the global capital, commodities and commercial markets. We seek to leverage the strength of our globally recognized brands to promote sustainable growth by bringing transparency and independent insights to those markets. Our strategy seeks to understand the key trends affecting our businesses and address them through the achievement of our enterprise objectives.



Four key trends are increasing the need for content and analytics in the markets we serve:

•The globalization of the capital markets: the global demand for capital and commodities markets trading and liquidity is expanding rapidly in both developed and growth markets;

•The need for data-driven decision making tools: developments in technology, communications and data processing have increased the demand for time-critical, multi-asset class data and solutions;

•Systemic regulatory change: new global legislation (e.g. Dodd-Frank, U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission and Basel III) is creating new and complex operating and capital models for banks and market participants; and

•Increased volatility and risk: amplified uncertainty and market volatility around short-term events are driving the need for new methodologies to measure risk, return and profitability.



We are focused on delivering against these enterprise objectives:

•Extend Market Leadership: extend our position as a global leader in our market segments

•Build Scalable Capabilities: further institutionalize key capabilities such as technology and risk management

•Foster Talent: attract and retain top talent

•Create Shareholder Value: deliver high top-line and bottom-line growth and positive returns to shareholders



Our enterprise strategy, which will support the achievement of these core objectives, includes the following components:

•Organic Growth: support a portfolio of leading market brands that delivers high top-line and bottom-line growth

•Global Expansion: expand our global footprint to capture opportunities in both mature and growth markets

•Acquisitions and Partnerships: supplement organic growth with acquisitions and partnerships

•Scalable Capabilities: create and leverage efficiency and effectiveness through common platforms, processes and standards

•Talent Retention and Acquisition: leverage our position as a market leader to become an employer of choice in our chosen markets and geographies



Organic Growth

Our businesses share a set of competitive advantages, including leading global brands, scalable technology and multi-channel distribution capabilities. We will leverage these capabilities to extend and expand our product offerings across high-value segments of the information value chain, such as benchmarks, pricing and valuation, analytics and tools, research and desktop / enterprise solutions. Additionally, we will seek out cross-business growth initiatives and synergies, in areas such as adjacent asset classes and parts of the value-chain. This will result in the creation of innovative new solutions that help investors face the evolving challenges of today's volatile and changing market landscape.



Global Expansion

Global growth remains a high priority for our Company as we continue to expand our footprint to capture opportunities in mature and growth markets. Our scale and leadership position within our core markets will enable us to identify and capitalize on growth trends and further extend our position in fast-developing growth markets. We are committed to enhancing our local data capabilities in growth markets for both local and global distribution.



Acquisitions and Partnerships

We will continue to drive acquisitions and partnerships that supplement organic growth and strengthen our market position in our target asset classes, high-value segments of the information value chain, and high-priority geographic markets. Our acquisition and partnership activity in 2012 included the following transactions across all our segments:











S&P DJ Indices

•On June 29, 2012, we closed our transaction with CME Group, Inc. (“CME Group”) and CME Group Index Services LLC, a joint venture between CME Group and Dow Jones & Company, Inc., to form a new company, S&P Dow Jones Indices LLC.

C&C

•On November 1, 2012, we completed the acquisition of Kingsman SA (“Kingsman”), a privately-held, Switzerland-based provider of price information and analytics for the global sugar and biofuels markets.

(“Coalition”), a privately-held U.K. analytics company, and its subsidiaries. Coalition provides high-end analytics to leading global investment banks and other financial services firms. Coalition will be integrated into CRISIL's Global Research & Analytics business.



Scalable Capabilities

We will maximize the capabilities of our entire portfolio of assets through an operating model that allows us to leverage infrastructure, and more quickly and effectively combine assets to create new solutions. We will further institutionalize enterprise-wide functions, including: technology and data operations; marketing, branding and communications; and risk management and compliance. This will allow us to create high-value, differentiated solutions and serve as a platform for growth.



Talent Retention and Acquisition

Consistent with our position as one of the leading content and analytics providers, we have a professional workforce of analysts, researchers and technologists, including the world's largest credit analytics teams, with over 1,400 analysts at S&P Ratings. We will promote a culture that is results-oriented and serves customers in a responsible and innovative way. We strive to recruit and retain the top talent required to deliver on our vision to be a leading provider of benchmarks, intelligence and analytics in the global capital, commodities and commercial markets.



There can be no assurance that we will achieve success in implementing any one or more of these strategies as a variety of factors could unfavorably impact operating results, including prolonged difficulties in the global credit markets and a change in the regulatory environment affecting our businesses.
