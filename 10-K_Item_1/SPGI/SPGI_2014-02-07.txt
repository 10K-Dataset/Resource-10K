Item 1.Business



Overview



McGraw Hill Financial, Inc. (together with its consolidated subsidiaries, the “Company,” the “Registrant,” “we,” “us” or “our”) is a leading ratings, benchmarks and analytics provider serving the global capital, commodities and commercial markets. The capital markets include asset managers, banks, exchanges, issuers and financial advisors; the commodities markets include producers, traders and intermediaries within energy, metals, and agriculture; and the commercial markets include professionals and corporate executives within automotive, construction and marketing / research information services. We serve our global customers through a broad range of products and services available through both third-party and proprietary distribution channels.



On March 22, 2013, we completed the sale of McGraw-Hill Education ("MHE") to investment funds affiliated with Apollo Global Management, LLC for a purchase price of $2.4 billion in cash. We recorded an after-tax gain on the sale of$589 million, which is included in income from discontinued operations, net of tax in the consolidated statement of income for the year endedDecember 31, 2013. We have used a portion of the after-tax proceeds from the sale to pay down short-term debt, for the special dividend paid in 2012, and to continue share repurchases. We intend to continue to use a portion of the after-tax proceeds to make selective acquisitions and investments.



The completion of the sale was a key milestone in our Growth and Value Plan that we began in September of 2011. In addition to the sale, we were also successful in other Growth and Value Plan objectives, including, increased shareholder return, investments in targeted financial assets, divested selected non-core assets and reductions in our real estate portfolio.



Increased Shareholder Return

During the three years ended December 31, 2013, we have returned $4.4 billion to our shareholders through a combination of share repurchases, our quarterly dividend and a special dividend.



We completed share repurchases of $2.8 billion and distributed regular quarterly dividends totaling approximately $900 million during the three years ended December 31, 2013. On December 6, 2012, our Board of Directors approved a special dividend in the amount of $2.50 per share on our common stock, payable on December 27, 2012 to shareholders of record on December 18, 2012. This returned an additional approximately $700 million to our shareholders. Also, on January 29, 2014, the Board of Directors approved an increase in the quarterly common stock dividend from $0.28 per share to $0.30 per share.



Investments in Targeted Financial Assets / Divested Selected Non-Core Assets

We continued to execute our strategy of exiting non-core assets while investing for growth in markets that have size and scale.



During 2013, we acquired approximately 11 million equity shares representing 15.07% of CRISIL's total outstanding equity shares for $214 million, increasing our ownership percentage in CRISIL to 67.84% from 52.77%.



In 2013, we also completed certain dispositions of our non-core assets that allow us to apply greater focus on our high-growth, high-margin benchmark businesses.

•Commodities & Commercial—we completed the sale of Aviation Week to Penton, a privately held business information company;

•S&P Capital IQ—we completed the sale of Financial Communications as well as the closure of several non-core businesses.



During 2012, we completed several acquisitions that we believe position us for long-term growth across all our segments.

•S&P Dow Jones Indices—our transaction with CME Group, Inc. and CME Group Index Services LLC to form a new company, S&P Dow Jones Indices LLC;

•S&P Capital IQ—Credit Market Analysis Limited, a provider of independent data concerning the over-the-counter markets; QuantHouse, an independent global provider of end-to-end systematic low-latency market data solutions; and R² Technologies, a provider of advanced risk and scenario-based analytics;

•Commodities & Commercial—Kingsman SA, a privately-held, Switzerland-based provider of price information and analytics for the global sugar and biofuels markets;

•Standard & Poor's Ratings—Coalition Development Ltd., a privately-held U.K. analytics company.











On December 30, 2011, we completed the sale of our Broadcasting Group, previously included in our Commodities & Commercial segment.



On July 11, 2013, our Board of Directors elected Douglas Peterson, President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company, effective November 1, 2013. He was also elected a member of the Company's Board of Directors, effective immediately. Mr. Peterson was President of Standard & Poor's Ratings. He succeeded Harold (Terry) McGraw III, who was Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company. Mr. McGraw has continued as Chairman of the Board of Directors.



Our Businesses



Our operations consist of four reportable segments: Standard & Poor’s Ratings (“S&P Ratings”), S&P Capital IQ, S&P Dow Jones Indices ("S&P DJ Indices") and Commodities & Commercial (“C&C”).



S&P Ratings

S&P Ratings is an independent provider of credit ratings, research and analytics, offering investors and market participants information, ratings and benchmarks. Credit ratings are one of several tools that investors can use when making decisions about purchasing bonds and other fixed income investments. They are opinions about credit risk and our ratings express our opinion about the ability and willingness of an issuer, such as a corporation or state or city government, to meet its financial obligations in full and on time. Our credit ratings can also relate to the credit quality of an individual debt issue, such as a corporate or municipal bond, and the relative likelihood that the issuer may default.



With offices in over 23 countries around the world, S&P Ratings is an important part of the world's financial infrastructure and has played a leading role for over 150 years in providing investors with information and independent benchmarks for their investment and financial decisions as well as access to the capital markets. The key constituents S&P Ratings serves are investors; corporations; governments; municipalities; commercial and investment banks; insurance companies; asset managers; and other debt issuers.



As the capital markets continue to evolve, S&P Ratings is well-positioned to capitalize on opportunities driven by continuing regulatory changes through its global network, well-established position in corporate markets and strong investor reputation.



S&P Ratings differentiates its revenue between transaction and non-transaction. Transaction revenue primarily includes fees associated with:

•ratings related to new issuance of corporate and government debt instruments, and structured finance debt instruments;

•bank loan ratings; and

•corporate credit estimates, which are intended, based on an abbreviated analysis, to provide an indication of our opinion regarding creditworthiness of a company which does not currently have an S&P Ratings credit rating.



Non-transaction revenue primarily includes fees for surveillance of a credit rating, annual fees for customer relationship-based pricing programs and fees for entity credit ratings.



S&P Capital IQ

S&P Capital IQ is a global provider of digital and traditional financial research and analytical tools for capital market participants.

•Non-subscription revenue—primarily from licensing of our proprietary market price data and price assessments to commodity exchanges, syndicated and proprietary research studies, conference sponsorship, consulting engagements and events.



Our Strategy



We strive to be the leading provider of essential intelligence such as ratings, benchmarks and analytics to the global capital and commodities markets. We also seek to leverage the strength of our globally recognized brands and content to promote sustainable growth by bringing transparency and independent insights to the markets we serve.



With the successful completion of the Growth & Value Plan, we are aligning our efforts against two key strategic priorities, growth and performance.



We will strive to deliver on our strategic priorities through a clear set of growth drivers which are underpinned by excellence in management and execution.



We believe the key drivers of our growth are:

•Serving our customers with innovative, must-have solutions;









•Leveraging our unique portfolio of powerful brands and distinctive opportunities in the financial and commodity markets; and

•Winning as a dynamic, global company.



We believe the key elements of management and execution are:

•Ensuring quality and excellence in everything we do;

•Attracting and developing top-performing people; and

•Delivering together as one connected company.



Integrating and leveraging our key capabilities will also be critical to improving performance and delivering against our strategic priorities. We will strive to enhance analytical and product quality through technology, data and process improvements. Our businesses will also strive to continue to extend efforts in external outreach and advocacy, control and compliance. We will seek to further engage the customer by strengthening our sales, customer service, customer management processes and global operations. Finally, we will look to continue to put efforts and resources into developing high-performing talent driving to a common purpose.



We believe our strategic priorities are designed to deliver global growth in both new and existing markets. We intend to expand our coverage of core customer segments and markets by leveraging existing products and capabilities while also developing new products and capabilities to meet evolving customer needs in new markets.



There can be no assurance that we will achieve success in implementing any one or more of these strategies as a variety of factors could unfavorably impact operating results, including prolonged difficulties in the global credit markets and a change in the regulatory environment affecting our businesses.
