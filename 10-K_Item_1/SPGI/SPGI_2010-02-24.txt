Item 1.Business

The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc. (the Registrant or the Company) is a leading global
information services provider serving the education, financial services, and business
information markets with a wide range of information products and services. Business
information markets include energy, automotive, construction, aerospace and defense.
We serve our customers through a broad range of distribution channels, including
printed books, magazines and newsletters, online via Internet Websites and digital
platforms, through wireless and traditional on-air broadcasting, and through a
variety of conferences and trade shows.

Education

Our McGraw-Hill Education segment is one of the premier global educational publishers.
This segment operates in the elementary and high school (“el-hi”), college and
university, professional, international and adult education markets.

•In the el-hi market, we sell textbooks (print and digital versions),
supplemental materials and provide assessment and reporting services. The market
for textbooks consists of adoption states, which are states that provide
educational funding to school districts for specific programs based on adoption
calendars, and open territory states, which are states that do not follow
adoption calendars.

•This market is influenced strongly by the size and
timing of state adoption opportunities and the availability of funds in
adoption states and in the open territory.

•The total state new adoption market is expected to increase from
approximately $500 million in 2009 to between $925 million and $975
million in 2010. According to the Association of American
Publishers (“AAP”) statistics through December 2009, basal and
supplemental sales in the adoption states and open territory
declined 13.8% versus the prior year.

•In the college and university market, and the international market, we sell
textbooks and other resources to higher education institutions. This market is
affected by enrollments, higher education funding and the number of courses
available to students.

•Enrollments in degree-granting higher education
institutions are projected to rise 13% to 20.6 million by 2018, according
to the National Center for Educational Statistics.•Online enrollments have continued to grow at rates in
excess of the total higher education school population.•Foreign student enrollments at American higher
education institutions, for the second year in a row, increased to record
numbers per the Institute of International Education.•The economic recession and related weak job market is
leading more individuals to seek additional education and training. In
2009, this trend was strengthened by provisions in the American Recovery
and Reinvestment Act that raised the maximum Pell Grant award available to
eligible students and increased the tax credit allowable to students or
their families for college tuition and other defined expenses.•Internationally, postsecondary enrollments are also
increasing in many regions, notably in India and China.

Financial Services

Our Financial Services segment operates under the Standard & Poor’s brand. This segment
provides services to investors, corporations, governments, financial institutions,
investment managers and advisors globally. The segment and the markets it serves are
impacted by interest rates, the state of global economies, credit quality and investor
confidence. The Financial Services segment consists of two operating groups: Credit
Market Services and Investment Services.

•Standard & Poor’s provides independent credit ratings, credit risk
evaluations, and credit ratings-related information and products. This operating
group also provides credit ratings-related information through its RatingsXpress
and RatingsDirect products.

•Credit ratings revenue is influenced by credit
markets and issuance levels which are dependant upon many factors,
including the general condition of the economy, interest rates, credit
quality and spreads, and the level of liquidity in the financial markets.







•Investment Services provides comprehensive value-added financial data,
information, indices and research. Revenue at Investment Services is influenced
by demand for company data and securities data as well as demand for investable
products and trading volumes in the financial markets.

Information & Media

Our Information & Media segment includes business, professional and broadcast media,
offering information, insight and analysis; and consists of two operating groups: the
Business-to-Business Group (including such brands as J.D. Power and Associates,
McGraw-Hill Construction, Platts andAviation Week) and the Broadcasting Group, which
operates nine television stations, four ABC affiliated and five Azteca America affiliated
stations.

•The segment’s business is driven by the need for information and transparency
in a variety of industries, and to a lesser extent, by advertising revenue.

Our 21,077 employees are located worldwide. They perform the vital functions of
analyzing the nature of changing demands for information and of channeling the
resources necessary to fill those demands. By virtue of the numerous copyrights and
licensing, trademark, and other agreements which are essential to such a business, we
are able to collect, compile, and disseminate this information. Our books and
magazines are printed by third parties. Our principal raw material is paper, and we
have assured sources of supply, at competitive prices, adequate for our business
needs.

Item 1a.Risk FactorsWe are providing the following cautionary statements which identify all known
material risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause our actual results
to differ materially from historical and expected results.We operate in the educational publishing, financial services and information & media
markets. Certain risk factors are applicable to individual markets while other risk
factors are applicable company-wide.Company-wide Risk FactorsOur ability to grow is dependent on a number of factors including the following:Introduction of new products, services or technologies could impact our profitability

•We operate in highly competitive markets that continue to change to adapt
to customer needs. In order to maintain a competitive position, we must
continue to invest in new offerings and new ways to deliver our products and
services.

•These investments may not be profitable or may be
less profitable than what we have experienced historically.

•We could experience threats to our existing businesses from the rise of
new competitors due to the rapidly changing environment within which we
operate.•We rely on our information technology environment and certain critical
databases, systems and applications to support key product and service
offerings. We believe we have appropriate policies, processes and internal
controls to ensure the stability of our information technology, provide
security from unauthorized access to our systems and maintain business
continuity, but our operating results may be adversely impacted by
unanticipated system failures or data corruption.

A significant increase in operating costs and expenses could have a material adverse
effect on our profitability

•Our major expenses include employee compensation and printing, paper, and
distribution costs for product-related manufacturing.

•We offer competitive salary and benefit packages
in order to attract and retain the quality employees required to grow
and expand our businesses. Compensation costs are influenced by
general economic factors, including those affecting the cost of health
insurance and postretirement benefits, and any trends specific to the
employee skill sets we require.•We could experience changes in pension costs and
funding requirements due to poor investment returns and/or changes in
pension.•Paper prices fluctuate based on the worldwide
demand and supply for paper in general and for the specific types of
paper used by us. Our overall paper price increase is currently
limited due to negotiated price reductions, long-term agreements, and
short-term price caps for a portion of paper purchases that are not
protected by long-term agreements.





•Our books and magazines are printed by third
parties and we typically have multi-year contracts for the production
of books and magazines in order to reduce price fluctuations over the
contract term.•We make significant investments in information
technology data centers and other technology initiatives as well as
significant investments in the development of programs for the el-hi
market place. Although we believe we are prudent in our investment
strategies and execution of our implementation plans, there is no
assurance as to the ultimate recoverability of these investments.

Our ability to protect our intellectual property rights could impact our competitive
position

•Our products contain intellectual property delivered through a variety of
media, including print, broadcast and digital. Our ability to achieve
anticipated results depends in part on our ability to defend our intellectual
property against infringement. Our operating results may be adversely
affected by inadequate legal and technological protections for intellectual
property and proprietary rights in some jurisdictions and markets.

Exposure to litigation could have a material effect on our financial position and
results of operations

•We are involved in legal actions and claims arising from our business
practices, as discussed in the Management’s Discussion and Analysis section
of our Annual Report to Shareholders, and face the risk that additional
actions and claims will be filed in the future. Due to the inherent
uncertainty of the litigation process, the resolution of any particular legal
proceeding or change in applicable legal standards could have a material
effect on our financial position and results of operations.

Risk of doing business abroad

•As we continue to expand our operations overseas, we face the increased
risks of doing business abroad, including inflation, fluctuation in interest
rates and currency exchange rates, changes in applicable laws and regulatory
requirements, export and import restrictions, tariffs, nationalization,
expropriation, limits on repatriation of funds, civil unrest, terrorism,
unstable governments and legal systems, and other factors. Adverse
developments in any of these areas could cause actual results to differ
materially from historical and/or expected operating results.

Risk Factors Specific to our Financial Services SegmentChanges in the volume of debt securities issued in domestic and/or global capital
markets and changes in interest rates and other volatility in the financial markets
could have a material impact on our results of operations

•Unfavorable financial or economic conditions that either reduce investor
demand for debt securities or reduce issuers’ willingness or ability to issue
such securities could reduce the number and dollar volume of debt issuance
for which Standard & Poor’s provides ratings services.•Increases in interest rates or credit spreads, volatility in financial
markets or the interest rate environment, significant political or economic
events, defaults of significant issuers and other market and economic factors
may negatively impact the general level of debt issuance, the debt issuance
plans of certain categories of borrowers, and/or the types of
credit-sensitive products being offered.•A sustained period of market decline or weakness could have a material
adverse effect on us.•Our results could be adversely affected because of public statements or
actions by market participants, government officials and others who may be
advocates of increased regulation, regulatory scrutiny or litigation.

Increased competition or regulation could result in a loss of market share or revenue

•The markets for credit ratings as well as research, investment and
advisory services are very competitive. Our Financial Services segment
competes domestically and internationally on the basis of a number of
factors, including quality of ratings, research and investment advice, client
service, reputation, price, geographic scope, range of products and services,
and technological innovation.•In addition, in some of the countries in which Standard & Poor’s competes,
governments may provide financial or other support to locally-based rating
agencies and may from time to time establish official credit rating agencies,
credit ratings criteria or procedures for evaluating local issuers.





•The financial services industry is subject to the potential for increasing
regulation in the United States and abroad. The businesses conducted by our
Financial Services segment are in certain cases regulated under the U.S.
Credit Rating Agency Reform Act of 2006, Investment Advisers Act of 1940, the
U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the National Association of Securities
Dealers and/or the laws of the states or other jurisdictions in which they
conduct business.

•In the past several years the U.S. Congress, the
Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), the European Commission,
through the Committee of European Securities Regulators (“CESR”) and
the International Organization of Securities Commissions (“IOSCO”), a
global group of securities commissioners, have been reviewing the role
of rating agencies and their processes and the need for greater
oversight or regulations concerning the issuance of credit ratings or
the activities of credit rating agencies.•Local, national and multinational bodies have
considered and adopted other legislation and regulations relating to
credit rating agencies from time to time.

•We do not believe that any such laws, regulations or rules
will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition
or results of operations.

•Other laws, regulations and rules relating to
credit rating agencies are being considered by local, national,
foreign and multinational bodies and are likely to continue to be
considered in the future. The impact on us of the adoption of any
such laws, regulations or rules remains uncertain.•Additional information regarding rating agencies
is provided in the Management’s Discussion and Analysis section of our
2009 Annual Report to Shareholders.

Consolidation of customers could impact our available markets and revenue growth

•Our investment services businesses have a customer base which is largely
comprised of members from the financial services industry. The current
challenging business environment and the consolidation of customers resulting
from mergers and acquisitions in the financial services industry can result
in reductions in the number of firms and workforce which can impact the size
of our customer base.

Risk Factors Specific to our McGraw-Hill Education Segment

Changes in educational funding could materially affect our education businesses

•Our U.S. educational textbook and testing businesses may be adversely
affected by changes in state educational funding as a result of changes in
legislation, both at the federal and state level, changes in the state
procurement process and changes in the condition of the local, state or U.S.
economy.•While in the past few years the availability of state and federal funding
for elementary and high school education had improved due to legislative
mandates such as No Child Left Behind (“NCLB”) and Reading First, future
changes in federal funding and the state and local tax base could create an
unfavorable environment, leading to budget issues resulting in a decrease in
educational funding.

Our education businesses operate in a cyclical environment

•A significant portion of our sales are to customers in educational
markets. Our School Education Group and the industry it serves are
influenced strongly by the magnitude and timing of state adoption
opportunities. Approximately 20 states currently use an adoption process to
purchase textbooks. In the remaining states, known as “open territories”,
textbooks are purchased independently by local districts or individual
schools.•Our internal estimate indicates that the 2010 el-hi market overall is
expected to increase 6% to 7%. In addition, despite the size of the market,
there is no guarantee that we will be successful in the state new adoption
market or in open territories.

Risk Factors Specific to our Information & Media Segment

Changes in the global advertising markets could materially impact our results

•Although advertising is less than 5% of our revenue, advertising is still
a significant source of revenue in our Information & Media segment. In
general, demand for advertising tends to correlate with changes in the level
of economic activity in the United States and in the markets we serve. In
addition, world, national and local events may affect advertising demand.•Competition from other forms of media such as other magazines,
broadcasters and Web sites, affects our ability to attract and retain
advertisers.





Our broadcasting operations are subject to regulatory development that could affect
their profitability•All television stations are subject to Federal Communications Commission
(“FCC”) regulation. Television stations broadcast under licenses that are
generally granted and renewed for a period of eight years. The FCC regulates
television station operations in several ways, including, but not limited to,
employment practices, political advertising, indecency and obscenity,
sponsorship identification, children’s programming, issue-responsive
programming, signal carriage, ownership, and engineering, transmissions,
antenna and other technical matters.Changes in the global automotive markets•Declines in the global automotive industry impacts our ability to sustain
or grow our revenue streams associated with business intelligence to that
market.Item 1b.Unresolved Staff CommentsNone.6

Item 9a.Controls and ProceduresDisclosure Controls and Procedures

We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that
information required to be disclosed in our reports filed with the Securities and
Exchange Commission (“SEC”) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within
the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and that such information





is accumulated
and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) and
Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”), as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding
required disclosure.

As of December 31, 2009, an evaluation was performed under the supervision and with
the participation of management, including the CEO and CFO, of the effectiveness of
the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in
Rules 13a-15(e) under the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934). Based on that
evaluation, management, including the CEO and CFO, concluded that our disclosure
controls and procedures were effective as of December 31, 2009.

Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (Section 404) and as
defined in Rules 13a-15(f) under the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934, management
is required to provide the following report on our internal control over financial
reporting:

1. Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal
control over financial reporting.

2. Management has evaluated the system of internal control using the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”) framework. Management
has selected the COSO framework for its evaluation as it is a control framework
recognized by the SEC and the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board that is free
from bias, permits reasonably consistent qualitative and quantitative measurement of
our internal controls, is sufficiently complete so that relevant controls are not
omitted and is relevant to an evaluation of internal controls over financial
reporting.

3. Based on management’s evaluation under this framework, management has concluded
that our internal controls over financial reporting were effective as of December 31,
2009. There are no material weaknesses in our internal control over financial
reporting that have been identified by management.

4. Our independent registered public accounting firm, Ernst & Young LLP, has audited
our consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2009, and has
issued their reports on the financial statements and the effectiveness of internal
controls over financial reporting. These reports are located on pages 83 and 84 of
the 2009 Annual Report to Shareholders.





Other Matters

There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during
the most recent quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to
materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

The following table details our equity compensation plans as of December 31, 2009:

(1)Included in this number are 31,406,183 shares to be issued upon
exercise of outstanding options under our Stock Incentive Plans and
271,813 deferred units already credited but to be issued under the
Director Deferred Stock Ownership Plan.(2)Included in this number are 264,466 shares reserved for
issuance under the Director Deferred Stock Ownership Plan. The remaining
18,955,827 shares are reserved for issuance under the 2002 Stock Incentive
Plan (the “2002 Plan”) for Performance Stock, Restricted Stock, Other
Stock-Based Awards, Stock Options and Stock Appreciation Rights (“SARs”).(3)Under the terms of the 2002 Plan, shares subject to an award
(other than a stock option, SAR, or dividend equivalent) or shares paid in
settlement of a dividend equivalent reduce the number of shares available
under the 2002 Plan by one share for each such share granted or paid;
shares subject to a stock option or SAR reduce the number of shares
available under the 2002 Plan by one-third of a share for each such share
granted. The 2002 Plan stipulates that in no case, as a result of such
share counting, may more





than 19,000,000 shares of stock be issued thereunder. Accordingly, for
purposes of setting forth the figures in this column, the base figure from
which issuances of stock awards are deducted, is deemed to be 19,000,000
shares for the 2002 Plan plus shares reserved for grant immediately prior to
the amendments to the 2002 Plan of April 28, 2004.The 2002 Plan is also governed by certain share recapture provisions. The
aggregate number of shares of stock available under the 2002 Plan for
issuance are increased by the number of shares of stock granted as an award
under the 2002 Plan or 1993 Employee Stock Incentive Plan (the “1993
Plan”)(other than stock option, SAR or 1993 Plan stock option awards) or by
one-third of the number of shares of stock in the case of stock option, SAR
or 1993 Plan stock option awards that are, in each case: forfeited, settled
in cash or property other than stock, or otherwise not distributable under an
award under the Plan; tendered or withheld to pay the exercise or purchase
