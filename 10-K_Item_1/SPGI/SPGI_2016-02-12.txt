Item 1.Business



Overview



McGraw Hill Financial, Inc. (together with its consolidated subsidiaries, the “Company,” the “Registrant,” “we,” “us” or “our”) is a leading benchmarks and ratings, analytics, data and research provider serving the global capital, commodities and commercial markets. The capital markets include asset managers, investment banks, commercial banks, insurance companies, exchanges, and issuers; the commodities markets include producers, traders and intermediaries within energy, metals, petrochemicals and agriculture; and the commercial markets include professionals and corporate executives within automotive, financial services, insurance and marketing / research information services. We serve our global customers through a broad range of products and services available through both third-party and proprietary distribution channels. We were incorporated in December of 1925 under the laws of the state of New York.



In the fourth quarter of 2015, we began exploring strategic alternatives for J.D. Power, included in our Commodities & Commercial segment. We committed to and initiated an active program to sell J.D. Power in its current state that we believe is probable in the next year. As a result, we have classified the assets and liabilities of  J.D. Power as held for sale in our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2015. The anticipated disposal does not represent a strategic shift that will have a major effect on operations and financial results, therefore, it is not classified as a discontinued operation.



On November 3, 2014, we completed the sale of McGraw Hill Construction, which has historically been part of our Commodities & Commercial segment, to Symphony Technology Group for $320 million in cash. We recorded an after-tax gain on the sale of$160 million, which is included in discontinued operations, net in the consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2014. We used the after-tax proceeds from the sale to make selective acquisitions, investments, share repurchases and for general corporate purposes.



On March 22, 2013, we completed the sale of McGraw-Hill Education ("MHE") to investment funds affiliated with Apollo Global Management, LLC for a purchase price of $2.4 billion in cash. We recorded an after-tax gain on the sale of$589 million, which is included in discontinued operations, net in the consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2013. We used the after-tax proceeds from the sale to pay down short-term debt for the special dividend paid in 2012, to make selective acquisitions, investments, share repurchases and for general corporate purposes.



In 2015, we continued to focus on investments in targeted financial assets, divesting selected non-core assets, reducing our real estate portfolio and increasing shareholder return.



In 2016, pending shareholder approval, the Company will be re-branded S&P Global. This name better leverages the Company's rich heritage as a financial data and analytics brand while signaling that we have a strong global footprint and broad portfolio.



Investments in Targeted Financial Assets / Divest Selected Non-Core Assets



During 2015, we continued to create a portfolio focused on scalable, industry leading, interrelated businesses in the capital and commodity markets.

•S&P Capital IQ and SNL—we acquired SNL Financial LC ("SNL"), a leading provider of news, data, and analytics to five sectors in the global economy: financial institutions, real estate, energy, media & communications, and metals & mining;

•Commodities & Commercial:

◦we acquired the entire issued share capital of Petromedia Ltd and its operating subsidiaries, an independent provider of data, intelligence, news and tools to the global fuels market that offers a suite of products providing clients with actionable data and intelligence that enables informed decisions, minimizes risk and increases efficiency;

◦we acquired  National Automobile Dealers Association's Used Car Guide, a leading provider of U.S. retail, trade-in and auction used-vehicle valuation products, services and information.

In 2015, we further reduced our real estate footprint by completing the consolidation of our corporate headquarters with our operations in New York City.











During 2014, we continued to execute our strategy of investing for growth in markets that have size and scale while exiting non-core assets.

•Commodities & Commercial—we acquired Eclipse Energy Group AS which complements our North American natural gas capabilities, which we obtained from our Bentek Energy LLC acquisition in 2011;

•S&P Ratings—we acquired BRC Investor Services S.A., a Colombia-based ratings firm providing risk classifications of banks, financial services providers, insurance companies, corporate bonds and structured issues that will expand our presence in the Latin American credit markets.

In 2014, in addition to the divestiture of McGraw Hill Construction discussed above, we streamlined our infrastructure by reducing our real estate footprint through selling our data facility, initiating the consolidation of our corporate headquarters with our operations in New York City, as well as disposing of our corporate aircraft.

During 2013, we acquired an incremental 11 million equity shares representing 15.07% of CRISIL's total outstanding equity shares for $214 million, concurrently increasing our ownership percentage in CRISIL to 67.84% from 52.77%.



In 2013, we also completed certain dispositions of our non-core assets that allow us to apply greater focus on our high-growth, high-margin benchmark businesses.

•Commodities & Commercial—we completed the sale of Aviation Week to Penton, a privately held business information company;

•S&P Capital IQ and SNL—we completed the sale of Financial Communications as well as the closure of several non-core businesses.



Increased Shareholder Return

During the three years endedDecember 31, 2015, we have returned$3.3 billionto our shareholders through a combination of share repurchases and our quarterly dividends: we completed share repurchases of$2.3 billionand distributed regular quarterly dividends totaling approximately$997 million. Also, on January 27, 2016, the Board of Directors approved an increase in the quarterly common stock dividend from $0.33 per share to $0.36 per share.

S&P Ratings

S&P Ratings is an independent provider of credit ratings, research and analytics to investors, issuers and market participants. Credit ratings are one of several tools that investors can use when making decisions about purchasing bonds and other fixed income investments. They are opinions about credit risk and our ratings express our opinion about the ability and willingness of an issuer, such as a corporation or state or city government, to meet its financial obligations in full and on time. Our credit ratings can also relate to the credit quality of an individual debt issue, such as a corporate or municipal bond, and the relative likelihood that the issuer may default.



With offices in over 25 countries around the world, S&P Ratings is an important part of the world's financial infrastructure and has played a leading role for over 150 years in providing investors with information and independent benchmarks for their investment and financial decisions as well as access to the capital markets. The key constituents S&P Ratings serves are investors, corporations, governments, municipalities, commercial and investment banks, insurance companies, asset managers, and other debt issuers.



As the capital markets continue to evolve, S&P Ratings is well-positioned to capitalize on opportunities, driven by continuing regulatory changes, through its global network, well-established position in corporate markets and strong investor reputation.



S&P Ratings differentiates its revenue between transaction and non-transaction. Transaction revenue primarily includes fees associated with:

•ratings related to new issuance of corporate and government debt instruments, and structured finance debt instruments;

•bank loan ratings; and









•corporate credit estimates, which are intended, based on an abbreviated analysis, to provide an indication of our opinion regarding creditworthiness of a company which does not currently have an S&P Ratings credit rating.



Non-transaction revenue primarily includes fees for surveillance of a credit rating, annual fees for customer relationship-based pricing programs and fees for entity credit ratings.

S&P DJ Indices’ mission is to provide transparent benchmarks to help with decision making, collaborate with the financial community to create innovative products and provide investors with tools to monitor world markets.

S&P DJ Indices primarily generates revenue from non-subscription products based on the S&P and Dow Jones Indices, and also generates subscription revenue. Specifically, S&P DJ Indices generate revenue from the following sources:

•Investment vehicles—such as exchange traded funds (“ETFs”), which are based on the S&P Dow Jones Indices' benchmarks and generate revenue through fees based on assets and underlying funds;

•Exchange traded derivatives—which generate royalties based on trading volumes of derivatives contracts listed on various exchanges;

•Index-related licensing fees—which are either fixed or variable annual and per-issue fees for over-the-counter derivatives and retail-structured products; and

•J.D. Power—provides essential consumer intelligence to help businesses measure, understand, and improve the key performance metrics that drive growth and profitability.











In the fourth quarter of 2015, we began exploring strategic alternatives for J.D. Power, included in our C&C segment. We committed to and initiated an active program to sell J.D. Power in its current state that we believe is probable in the next year. As a result, we have classified the assets and liabilities of  J.D. Power as held for sale in our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2015. The anticipated disposal does not represent a strategic shift that will have a major effect on operations and financial results, therefore, it is not classified as a discontinued operation.



The C&C business is driven by the need for high-value information and transparency in a variety of industries. C&C seeks to deliver premier content that is deeply embedded in customer workflows and decision making processes. Our commodities business serves producers, traders, and intermediaries within energy, metals and agriculture markets.

C&C's revenue is generated primarily through the following sources:

•Subscription revenue—subscriptions to our real-time news, market data and price assessments, along with other information products, primarily serving the energy and the automotive industry; and

•Non-subscription revenue—primarily from licensing of our proprietary market price data and price assessments to commodity exchanges, syndicated and proprietary research studies, commercial-oriented data and analytics, conference sponsorship, consulting engagements and events.



Our Strategy



Our vision is to be the leading provider of transparent and independent benchmarks and ratings, analytics, data and research in the global capital, commodities and corporate markets. Our mission is to promote sustainable growth in these markets by providing customers with essential intelligence and superior service.

We are aligning our efforts against two key strategic priorities: creating growth and driving performance.



Creating Growth



•We will strive to drive global growth by focusing on executing our strategic initiatives, strengthening core capabilities and collaborating across businesses.



Driving Performance



•We will strive to deliver operational excellence, manage and mitigate risk and enhance leadership and accountability.



There can be no assurance that we will achieve success in implementing any one or more of these strategies as a variety of factors could unfavorably impact operating results, including prolonged difficulties in the global credit markets and a change in the regulatory environment affecting our businesses. See Item 1a,Risk Factors, in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
