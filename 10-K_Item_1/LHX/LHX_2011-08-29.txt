    Melbourne, Florida 32919, and our telephone number is(321) 727-9100.Our common stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange under
    the symbol “HRS.” On July 1, 2011, we employed
    approximately 16,900 people. Unless the context otherwise
    requires, the terms “we,” “our,”
    “us,” “Company” and “Harris” as
    used in this Report refer to Harris Corporation and its
    subsidiaries.



General

We structure our operations primarily around the products and
    services we sell and the markets we serve, and we report the
    financial results of our operations in the following three
    reportable operating segments:



•Our RF Communications segment, comprised of
    (i) U.S. Department of Defense and International
    Tactical Communications and (ii) Public Safety and
    Professional Communications;•Our Integrated Network Solutions segment, comprised of
    (i) IT Services, (ii) Managed Satellite and
    Terrestrial Communications Solutions, (iii) Healthcare
    Solutions, (iv) Cyber Integrated Solutions and
    (v) Broadcast and New Media Solutions; and•Our Government Communications Systems segment, comprised of
    (i) Civil Programs, (ii) Defense Programs and
    (iii) National Intelligence Programs.



As previously reported and as discussed further inNote 25: Business Segmentsin the Notes to
    Consolidated Financial Statements in this Report (the
    “Notes”), our reportable operating segment structure
    reflects that, in the third quarter of fiscal 2011, we realigned
    our operations to provide increased market focus and address the
    fast-growing global market for integrated communications and
    information technology and services. As a result of the
    realignment of our operations, effective for the third quarter
    of fiscal 2011, we formed our Integrated Network Solutions
    segment as a new segment. The new segment realigns IT Services,
    Managed Satellite and Terrestrial





Communications Solutions, Healthcare Solutions and Cyber
    Integrated Solutions (all of which were formerly under our
    Government Communications Systems segment) with Broadcast and
    New Media Solutions (formerly a separate reportable segment
    called Broadcast Communications). Our RF Communications segment
    did not change. The historical results, discussion and
    presentation of our operating segments as set forth in this
    Report have been adjusted to reflect the impact of these changes
    to our reportable operating segment structure for all periods
    presented in this Report.



In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009, in connection with the
    May 27, 2009 spin-off (the “Spin-off”) in the
    form of a taxable pro rata dividend to our shareholders of all
    the shares of Harris Stratex Networks, Inc. (now known as Aviat
    Networks, Inc.) (“HSTX”) common stock owned by us, we
    eliminated our former HSTX operating segment. Our historical
    financial results have been restated to account for HSTX as
    discontinued operations for all periods presented in this
    Report, and unless otherwise specified, disclosures in this
    Report relate solely to our continuing operations. For
    additional information regarding discontinued operations, seeNote 3: Discontinued Operationsin the Notes.



Financial information with respect to all of our other
    activities, including corporate costs not allocated to the
    operating segments or discontinued operations, is reported as
    part of the “Unallocated corporate expense” or
    “Non-operating loss” line items in our Consolidated
    Financial Statements and accompanying Notes.



Recent
    Acquisitions

Acquisition of CapRock.On July 30, 2010,
    we acquired privately held CapRock Holdings, Inc. and its
    subsidiaries, including CapRock Communications, Inc.
    (collectively, “CapRock”), a global provider of
    mission-critical, managed satellite communications services for
    the government, energy and maritime industries. CapRock’s
    solutions include broadband Internet access, voice over Internet
    Protocol (“VOIP”) telephony, wideband networking and
    real-time video, delivered to nearly 2,000 customer sites around
    the world. The acquisition of CapRock increased the breadth of
    ourassured
    communications®capabilities, while enabling us to enter new vertical markets
    and increase our international presence. The total net purchase
    price for CapRock was $517.5 million. We report CapRock as
    part of Managed Satellite and Terrestrial Communications
    Solutions under our Integrated Network Solutions segment.



Acquisition of Schlumberger GCS.On
    April 4, 2011, we acquired from Schlumberger B.V. and its
    affiliates (“Schlumberger”) substantially all of the
    assets of the Schlumberger group’s Global Connectivity
    Services business (“Schlumberger GCS”), a provider of
    satellite and terrestrial communications services for the
    worldwide energy industry. The total net purchase price for
    Schlumberger GCS was $380.6 million, subject to
    post-closing adjustments. We report Schlumberger GCS as part of
    Managed Satellite and Terrestrial Communications Solutions under
    our Integrated Network Solutions segment.



Acquisition of Carefx.Also on April 4,
    2011, we acquired privately held Carefx Corporation
    (“Carefx”), a provider of interoperability workflow
    solutions for government and commercial healthcare providers.
    Carefx’s solution suite is used by more than 800 hospitals,
    healthcare systems and health information exchanges across
    North America, Europe and Asia. This acquisition expanded
    our presence in government healthcare, provided entry into the
    commercial healthcare market, and is expected to leverage the
    healthcare interoperability workflow products offered by Carefx
    and the broader scale of enterprise intelligence solutions and
    services that we provide. The total net purchase price for
    Carefx was $152.6 million, subject to post-closing
    adjustments. We report Carefx as part of Healthcare Solutions
    under our Integrated Network Solutions segment.



Subsequent
    Event — Share Repurchase Program

On July 30, 2011, our Board of Directors approved a new
    $1 billion share repurchase program (the “New
    Repurchase Program”) and increased the quarterly cash
    dividend rate on our common stock from $0.25 per share to $0.28
    per share. The New Repurchase Program replaced our prior share
    repurchase program (the “2009 Repurchase Program”),
    which had a remaining, unused authorization of approximately
    $200 million. The New Repurchase Program does not have a
    stated expiration date. We currently expect to repurchase up to
    $500 million in shares under the New Repurchase Program by
    the end of calendar year 2011. The New Repurchase Program is
    expected to result in repurchases well in excess of the dilutive
    effect of shares issued under our share-based incentive plans.
    However, the level of our repurchases depends on a number of
    factors, including our financial condition, capital
    requirements, results of operations, future business prospects
    and other factors our Board of Directors may deem relevant.
    Share repurchases are expected to be funded with available cash
    and commercial paper. Repurchases under the New Repurchase
    Program may be made through open market purchases, private
    transactions, transactions structured through investment banking
    institutions, or any combination thereof. The timing, volume and
    nature of





share repurchases are subject to market conditions, applicable
    securities laws and other factors and are at our discretion and
    may be suspended or discontinued at any time.

Description
    of Business by Segment



RF
    Communications

RF Communications is a global supplier of secure tactical radio
    communications and embedded high-grade encryption solutions for
    military, government and commercial organizations and also of
    secure communications systems and equipment for public safety,
    utility and transportation markets. RF Communications is
    comprised of (i) U.S. Department of Defense and
    International Tactical Communications and (ii) Public
    Safety and Professional Communications.



U.S. Department of Defense and International Tactical
    Communications:

®



Unlike many of our competitors in the U.S. Government
    market, we operate this business on a “commercial”
    customer-driven business model, as opposed to a government
    programs-driven business model. This means that we anticipate
    market needs, invest our internal research and development
    resources, build to our internal forecast, and provideready-to-ship,commercial,off-the-shelf(“COTS”) products to customers more quickly than
    customers can typically obtain similar products under
    government-funded programs.



Our Falcon
    III®family of radios is the next generation of multiband,
    multi-mission tactical radios supporting the
    U.S. military’s Joint Tactical Radio System
    (“JTRS”) requirements as well as network-centric
    operations worldwide. Our Falcon III radios address the
    full range of current mission and interoperability requirements
    and are fully upgradeable to address changing technical
    standards and mission requirements of the future. Advances in
    our Falcon III radios include extended frequency range,
    significant reductions in weight and size compared with previous
    generations and programmable encryption.



Our Falcon III multiband handheld radio, the AN/PRC-152(C)
    (“152C”), is the world’s most widely deployed
    JTRS-approved software-defined handheld radio and was our first
    Falcon III radio to be fielded. We have successfully
    fielded more than 100,000 152Cs, which are widely fielded by all
    branches of the DoD, many allies worldwide and U.S. Federal
    agencies. The 152C offers users a wide range of capabilities,
    such as legacy Single Channel Ground and Airborne System
    (“SINCGARS”) interoperability; UHFground-to-groundline-of-sightcommunications; close-air support; tactical SATCOM; and the
    Association of Public Safety Communications
    Officials — International (“APCO”) P25
    waveform to provide direct communications with first responders.
    The 152C also serves as the handheld-based transceiver of our
    Falcon III AN/VRC-110, a high-performance, multiband
    vehicular system that offers the added feature of easy vehicle
    dismount — a“grab-and-go”feature that delivers continuous communications when removed
    from the vehicle, an important capability in urban environments.



Our Falcon III multiband manpack radio, the AN/PRC-117G
    (“117G”), is the first JTRS Software Communications
    Architecture (“SCA”)-certified and National Security
    Agency (“NSA”) Type-1 certified manpack radio system
    providing wideband networking capability, enabling the
    transition to a networked battlefield communications environment
    and high-bandwidth applications, including streaming video,
    simultaneous voice and data feeds, intelligence reporting and
    analysis, collaborative chat, route planning, convoy tracking,
    checkpoint biometrics and connectivity to secure networks
    (“SIPRNet”). The 117G uses the Harris-developed
    Adaptive





Networking Wideband Waveform (“ANW2”) for high
    bandwidth data operation and is designed for future upgrade to
    the JTRS Soldier Radio Waveform (“SRW”). The
    117G’s wideband network access capabilities give
    warfighters and field commanders critical real-time information.
    The 117G has been deployed to all branches of the DoD and is
    being used in a wide variety of ground, vehicular and airborne
    applications, including intelligence, surveillance and
    reconnaissance (“ISR”). The 117G includes a Remote
    Operated Video Enhanced Receiver (“ROVER”)
    interoperable mode that provides warfighters on the battlefield
    with the ability to receive live video directly from unmanned
    aerial vehicles (“UAVs”). This capability allows users
    to receive video feeds directly from UAVs without an
    intermediary or having to pass that information from a base
    station.



Our cryptographic solutions encompass NSA-certified products and
    systems that range from single integrated circuits to major
    communications systems, including our
    Sierra®and
    Citadel®embedded encryption solutions and KGV-72 blue force tracking
    programmable encryption devices and our SecNet
    11®and SecNet
    54tmInternet Protocol (“IP”) communications families of
    communications security (“COMSEC”) terminals.

    communications®systems and equipment for public safety, federal, utility,
    commercial and transportation markets, with products ranging
    from completeend-to-endwireless network infrastructure solutions, including advanced IP
    voice and data networks, that support multiple platforms and
    provide interoperability among disparate systems, to portable
    and mobile single-band and multiband, multimode radios, to
    public safety-grade broadband voice, video and data solutions.
    On May 29, 2009, we acquired substantially all of the
    assets of the Tyco Electronics wireless systems business
    (“Wireless Systems”) (formerly known as M/A-COM). Our
    acquisition of Wireless Systems served to form our Public Safety
    and Professional Communications business. This business has more
    than 80 years of experience and supports over
    500 systems around the world.



As part of our business of designing, building, distributing,
    maintaining and supplying wireless communications systems, we
    offer our Voice, Interoperability, Data and Access
    (“VIDA”) network platform — a unifiedIP-basedvoice and data communication system based on APCO P25 industry
    standards that provides network-level interoperable
    communications among public safety agencies and that supports a
    full line of communications systems, including
    OpenSky®,

    NetworkFirst,
    P25IPand

    Enhanced Digital Access Communication System
    (“EDACS”), allowing seamless interconnection of
    diverse systems. Our VIDA network solutions currently serve as
    the backbone in some of the largest and most advanced statewide
    and regional communications networks in North America, including
    the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and State of Florida.

    with image-sharing capabilities under the DoD Military Health
    System global Healthcare Artifact and Image Management Solution
    (“HAIMS”) program.



In fiscal 2011, we were one of eight companies in the large
    business category awarded the five-year Transformation
    Twenty-One Total Technology (“T4”) IDIQ contracting
    vehicle from the Department of Veterans Affairs (“VA”)
    designed to upgrade the VA’s IT system and covering
    services that will streamline and modernize VA operations,
    including patient care delivery at more than 150 VA hospitals.
    We also were awarded a second VA contract vehicle, the Enhance
    the Veteran Experience and Access to HealthCare
    (“EVEAH”) blanket purchase agreement with a ceiling
    value of $199 million, and received initial task orders.
    After the close of fiscal 2011, we were awarded a contract from
    the VA for the Enterprise Management Foundation Federated Data
    Repository (“EMF FDR”) program to create a centralized
    network monitoring system that will provide the VA with a
    unified view of its critical infrastructure.



In addition, we have provided interoperability solutions for
    large-scale health information exchange enterprises such as the
    VA, the DoD and the Social Security Administration. We also have
    extended Federal interoperability solutions to the private
    sector where over half of all care is provided for active duty
    and retired service members. In





fiscal 2011, we were awarded a four-year contract by the State
    of Florida Agency for Health Care Administration
    (“AHCA”) to implement a statewide health information
    exchange (“HIE”) that will improve the delivery and
    coordination of healthcare. As described under
    “Item 1. Business — Recent
    Acquisitions” of this Report, we acquired Carefx during the
    fourth quarter of fiscal 2011. Carefx is a provider of
    interoperability workflow solutions for government and
    commercial healthcare providers, and its solution suite,
    Fusionfx, gives care providers a unified look at patient data
    and closes data gaps to ensure a more consistent, higher quality
    experience for the patient, reducing clinical errors and
    increasing individual productivity.



Also in fiscal 2011, we received an option year extension from
    the VA for healthcare imaging software and systems engineering
    services for the VistA imaging application, and we announced a
    joint venture with Johns Hopkins Medicine to focus on developing
    next-generation medical image management solutions to be
    deployed by the Johns Hopkins Health System and later, to
    hospitals and healthcare providers around the United States.



Cyber Integrated Solutions:We are working
    closely with government and commercial organizations in
    introducing a new offering to help them move part or all of
    their operations to a trusted cloud computing environment in an
    effective and efficient manner by using our cyber integration
    capabilities to bring together an innovative combination of
    patented trust methodologies, industry-leading technologies,
    partnerships with market leaders and world-class infrastructure.



For example, the Harris Trusted Enterprise
    Cloudtmis a newly launched cloud application hosting system that we
    offer as a unique Infrastructure-as-a-Service (“IaaS”)
    designed to enable clients to extend and enhance their IT
    operations in order to improve operational agility and reduce
    costs. Our Trusted Enterprise Cloud solution is delivered via
    The Harris Cyber Integration
    Centertm,

    located in our over 100,000-square-foot advanced data center
    facility in the Mid-Atlantic region. The center is an innovative
    cloud node that was designed from the ground up to offer
    technology and services that meet the highest industry and
    government standards for reliability and security.



Key differentiators in these offerings are our proprietary trust
    enablement technologies, including the Global
    Trust Repository and the Enterprise Trust Server,
    which provide continuous monitoring, assurance, and attestation
    that the software and configurations in the cloud computing
    environment are deployed and operating according to
    specification and have not been compromised, and which we also
    may license to partners and customers. In fiscal 2011, we
    announced a strategic alliance with EMC Corporation and the
    Virtual Computing Environment Company (“VCE”) to
    jointly develop and market new trusted multi-tenant cloud
    solutions to further accelerate the adoption of cloud computing
    IaaS by government and commercial enterprises.



In pursuing these new, high-value applications for our
    capabilities and technologies, we are seeking to leverage our
    experience as an industry leader in cyber security. For example,
    we have been usingstate-of-the-arttechnology assessment techniques and architecture engineering
    for decades to define and operate secure networks supporting
    nationally critical programs, including three of the U.S.’s
    largest, secure mission-critical networks — the
    Federal Aviation Administration Telecommunications
    Infrastructure (“FTI”) program network, the Patriot
    program network and the NMCI program network. Our technology,
    countermeasures and monitoring capabilities safeguard vital
    information systems that support the critical missions of
    U.S. military, intelligence and Federal law enforcement
    customers.



Broadcast and New Media Solutions:We offer
    hardware and software products, systems and services that
    provide interoperable workflow solutions for broadcast, cable,
    satellite andout-of-homenetworks worldwide. The Harris
    ONEtmsolution brings together highly integrated and cost-effective
    products that enable advanced media workflows for emerging
    content delivery business models. We are supporting customers as
    they upgrade media operations to digital and high definition
    (“HD”) services from analog and standard definition
    (“SD”) services and as they expand services for HD
    television (“HDTV”), IPTV,video-on-demandand interactive TV. We serve the global digital and analog media
    markets, providing infrastructure and networking products and
    solutions; media and server systems; and television and radio
    transmission equipment and systems.



Our infrastructure and networking solutions offerings enable
    media companies to streamline workflow from production through
    transmission. We offer a portfolio of advanced products,
    including signal processors, routers, master control and
    branding systems, network monitoring and control software, test
    and measurement instruments, multi-image display processors,
    broadcast graphics, and highly differentiated network access and
    multiplex platforms.



Our media and server systems offerings enable customers to
    manage their digital media workflow and storage, as well as
    other key facets of an increasingly file-based broadcast
    environment, through our portfolio of software solutions for
    advertising, media management (traffic, billing and program
    scheduling), digital signage, broadband, digital asset
    management and play-out automation, and our family of scalable,
    interoperable video servers.





We develop, manufacture and supply television and radio
    transmission systems for delivery of rich media over wireless
    broadcast terrestrial networks on a worldwide basis, including
    mobile TV applications. We can provide single products orend-to-endsystems, including nationwide networks with hundreds of
    transmitters.



In addition, supporting digitalout-of-homeadvertising is an emerging growth area, and our solutions enable
    advertisers to reach consumers on the move. We believe new
    systems will be increasingly deployed to deliver rich media
    content in live sports and entertainment venues and in retail
    establishments. For example, we helped design the system of
    IPTV, digital signage and IT infrastructure to create an
    in-arena network for the Orlando Magic’s new basketball
    arena, and we are providing hardware and software supporting
    content delivery for a project in collaboration with Digital
    Display Networks, Inc. and ABC to create one of the largest
    digitalout-of-homeadvertising networks in the world, 7-Eleven TV, which has been
    installed in over 3,000 7-Eleven stores. In fiscal 2011, we
    installed our first digital signage system in the United Kingdom
    at Harrods, a luxury department store, and began designing an
    advanced, digital,out-of-homeand IPTV network for the new Madison Square Garden
    Transformation project that will include 1,100 arena displays to
    deliver a dynamic viewing experience to fans.

Government
    Communications Systems

Government Communications Systems conducts advanced research and
    produces, integrates and supports highly reliable, net-centric
    communications and information technology that solve the
    mission-critical challenges of our civilian, defense and
    intelligence government customers, primarily the
    U.S. Government, and is comprised of (i) Civil
    Programs, (ii) Defense Programs and (iii) National
    Intelligence Programs.



Civil Programs:We provide highly reliable,
    mission-critical communications and information processing
    systems that meet the most demanding needs of customers in the
    U.S. civilian Federal market, including the Federal
    Aviation Administration (“FAA”) and the National
    Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (“NOAA”). We
    use our ability to implement and manage large, complex programs
    that integrate secure, advanced communications and information
    processing technologies in order to improve productivity and
    information processing and to achieve cost savings for our
    customers. Our networks and information systems for large-scale,
    geographically dispersed enterprises offer advanced capabilities
    for collecting, processing, analyzing, interpreting, displaying,
    distributing, storing and retrieving data. We are a leader in
    satellite ground data processing and missioncommand-and-control(“C2”) systems. Our ground data processing systems
    consist of complex suites of hardware and software that receive
    sensor data from satellites, turning it into useable
    information. Our C2 systems feature COTS design and high levels
    of flexibility, are designed for government and commercial
    applications, and support single-satellite missions as well as
    some of the largest and most complex satellite fleets deployed.



For example, we are the prime contractor and system architect
    under a15-yearcontract awarded in July 2002, with a potential value of
    $3.5 billion, for the FTI program to integrate, modernize,
    operate and maintain the communications infrastructure for the
    U.S. air traffic control system. FTI is a modern, secure
    and efficient network providing voice, data and video
    communications deployed at more than 4,500 FAA sites across the
    United States to enhance network efficiency, reliability and
    security and to improve service while reducing operating costs.
    We designed and deployed the FTI network and it is fully
    operational. The FTI network consists of the Operations Network,
    the Mission Support Network, the Satellite Network and the
    Microwave Network. The supporting infrastructure includes the
    Network Operations Control Centers (“NOCCs”) and
    Security Operations Control Centers (“SOCCs”). The FTI
    program has completed its equipment build-out phase and is
    transitioning to its telecommunication services and maintenance
    phase.



Other FAA programs under which we have developed solutions
    include the following:





•The Operational and Supportability Implementation System
    (“OASIS”), for which we are the prime contractor and
    which provides integrated weather briefing and flight planning
    capabilities for preflight weather briefings and in-flight
    updates for Alaska’s general aviation community. In fiscal
    2011, we were awarded a follow-on contract by the FAA to upgrade
    and manage the OASIS system;

•The Weather and Radar Processor (“WARP”) system, a
    meteorological data processing system serving the en-route air
    traffic control environment that generates radar mosaic data for
    air traffic controller displays and delivers weather data to
    critical subsystems within the National Airspace System
    (“NAS”). In fiscal 2010, we were awarded a six-year
    contract, with a potential value of $97 million, by the FAA
    under the WARP Maintenance and Sustainment Services II
    program to continue to maintain the WARP system by providing
    hardware and software maintenance, depot support,on-sitefield support and engineering services at 22 operational
    FAA facilities in the United States;

•The Voice Switching and Control System (“VSCS”), which
    provides the criticalair-to-groundcommunications links between en-route aircraft and air traffic
    controllers throughout the continental
    United States.; and

•The satellite-based Alaskan NAS Interfacility Communications
    System (“ANICS”), which links the Alaskan Air Route
    Traffic Control Center in Anchorage with 64 FAA facilities
    throughout the region. After the close of fiscal 2011, we were
    selected as the prime contractor under the Alaska Satellite
    Telecommunications Infrastructure (“ASTI”) program for
    a10-yearcontract, with a potential value of $85 million, from the
    FAA to upgrade the ANICS network by replacing and upgrading
    components and providing a new network management system, system
    security enhancements, logistics support and training in order
    to increase network performance and availability while reducing
    the FAA’s operating and maintenance costs.



Another example of our capabilities relates to NOAA’s
    Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite —
    Series R (“GOES-R”) Ground and Antenna Segment
    weather programs. Under two ten-year contracts, with an
    aggregate potential value of approximately $1 billion
    (including change orders), we are providing a complete,





end-to-endsolution in which we will design, develop, deploy and operate
    the ground segment system that will receive and process
    satellite data and generate and distribute weather data to more
    than 10,000 direct users, as well as providing the command and
    control of operational satellites. We also are supplying
    antennas and control systems that will provide communications
    links for command, telemetry and sensor data, as well as the
    communications link to direct data users. The new antennas will
    operate with next-generation GOES-R satellites and will be
    compatible with existing GOES-N through GOES-P satellites.



Defense Programs:We develop, supply and
    integrate communications and information processing products,
    systems and networks for a diverse base of aerospace,
    terrestrial and maritime applications supporting DoD missions,
    and we are committed to delivering leading-edge technologies
    that support the ongoing transformations of military
    communications for U.S. and international customers. Our
    technologies are providing advanced mobile wideband networking
    capabilities to assure timely and secure network-centric
    capabilities across strategic, operational and tactical
    boundaries in support of the DoD’s full spectrum of
    warfighting, intelligence and logistics missions. Our major
    technology capabilities include advanced ground control systems
    and SATCOM terminals for transportable ground, fixed-site and
    shipboard applications; flat-panel, phased-array and
    single-mission antennas; advanced aviation electronics for
    military jets, including digital maps, modems, sensors, data
    buses, fiber optics and microelectronics; and high-speed data
    links and data networks for wireless communications.



For example, our mobile ad hoc networking capability allows the
    military to take its communications infrastructure with it,
    creating mobile, robust, self-forming and self-healing networks
    across the battlefield. Our Highband Networking
    Radiotm(“HNR”) provides secure, wireless, high-bandwidth,on-the-movecommunications among users of widely dispersed local area
    networks (“LANs”) by establishingline-of-sightconnectivity using directive beam antenna technology and a
    Harris-developed waveform that automatically selects the best
    communications path available, allowing seamless communication
    of voice, video and data to all levels of command. We announced
    in fiscal 2009 that our HNR system was deployed to the
    U.S. Army 101st Airborne Division (Air Assault)
    2nd Brigade Combat Team in Iraq, which was the first combat
    deployment of the HNR system. In fiscal 2010, we were awarded a
    contract to provide HNRs to form the communications backbone of
    the U.S. Army’s new Integrated Air and Missile Defense
    Battle Command System (“IBCS”). We are currently
    producing and delivering HNRs under the U.S. Army’s
    Warfighter Information Network-Tactical (“WIN-T”)
    program, and also we were awarded a contract in the fourth
    quarter of fiscal 2011 from the U.S. Army for rapid
    deployment of HNRs into Afghanistan.



In fiscal 2011, we also introduced
    Knighthawktm3G, a ruggedized, highly mobile tactical base station that
    enables warfighters on the move to maintain third generation
    (“3G”) cellular services in locations with limited or
    no cellular connectivity. Knighthawk 3G is a customizable
    cellular network in a box compatible with COTS equipment,
    including smartphones and tablets.



Examples of ongoing programs for us include the following:





•The U.S. Army Modernization of Enterprise Terminals
    (“MET”) program, for which we are developing, under a
    ten-year contract, with a potential value of $600 million,
    awarded to us in fiscal 2009, next-generation large satellite
    earth stations to provide the worldwide backbone for
    high-priority military communications and missile defense
    systems and to support IP and Dedicated Circuit Connectivity
    within the Global Information Grid (“GIG”), providing
    critical reach-back capability for the warfighter;

•The F-35 Joint Strike Fighter (“F-35”), F-22 Raptor
    andF/A-18E/FSuper Hornet aircraft platform programs, for which we provide
    high-performance, advanced avionics such as high-speed fiber
    optic networking and switching, intra-flight data links, image
    processing, digital map software and other electronic
    components, including Multifunction Advanced Data Link
    (“MADL”) communications subsystems primarily intended
    for stealth platformair-to-aircommunications and which allow F-35s to communicate in a stealth
    fashion with other network nodes without revealing their
    positions;

•The WIN-T program for the U.S. Army, for which we are
    designing and testing the wireless transmission system
    architecture, applying our proven enabling technologies for
    wirelesson-the-movecommunications, including phased arrays and high-speed secure
    wireless network solutions such as our HNR system; and

•The Commercial Broadband Satellite Program (“CBSP”)
    for the U.S. Navy, for which we supply broadband multiband
    SATCOM terminals that support essential mission requirements and
    provide enhanced morale-related communications services such as
    high-speed Internet access and video communications.



National Intelligence Programs:A significant
    portion of this business involves classified programs. While
    classified programs generally are not discussed in this Report,
    the operating results relating to classified programs are
    included in our Consolidated Financial Statements. We believe
    that the business risks associated with those programs do not
    differ materially from the business risks of other
    U.S. Government programs.





We are a major developer, supplier and integrator of
    communications and information processing products, systems and
    networks for a diverse base of U.S. Intelligence Community
    programs, and we support the ongoing transformation of the
    Intelligence Community into a more collaborative enterprise.
    Serving primarily national intelligence and security agency
    customers, including NSA, NRO and the National
    Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (“NGA”), we provide
    integrated ISR solutions that improve situational awareness,
    data collection accuracy and product analysis by correlating
    near real-time mission data and intelligence reference data for
    display and analysis by strategic and tactical planners and
    decision makers. Our ISR systems help to integrate information
    across the analyst workflow, accelerating the movement of
    information that has been collected and processed. We strive to
    produce innovative ISR solutions that provide our customers with
    information dominance for battle-space superiority.



state-of-the-art



During fiscal 2011, we were awarded a number of new contracts
    and follow-on contracts under classified programs. We also were
    awarded a30-monthcontract by Sierra Nevada Corporation to design, build and
    integrate the synthetic aperture radar (“SAR”)
    satellite payload as part of NASA’s Rapid Response Space
    Works and Modular Space Vehicles program; a three-year contract

    contract from Boeing Space and Intelligence Systems for a
    22-meter deployable L-band reflector to support military and
    civil communications in Mexico.



In addition, our full motion video (“FMV”) initiatives
    support the ISR market for FMV products and systems, including
    all U.S. Government, international military and Federal law
    enforcement activities for the Harris Full Motion Video Asset
    Management Engine
    (“FAMEtm”)

    architecture and related technologies. FAME is a COTS-based
    collaborative platform that provides video, audio and metadata
    coding, video analytics, and archive capabilities —
    all within a unified digital asset management
    solution — giving our customers greater visibility and
    better access to increasing amounts of digital ISR information,
    including higher-resolution FMV, motion imagery and visual
    imagery, such as that collected from manned and unmanned
    aircraft and ground-based sensors.

    governmental customers for direct sales by us. Prices to the
    ultimate customer in many instances may be recommended or
    established by the independent representative and may be above
    or below our list prices. Our dealers and distributors generally
    receive a discount from our list prices and may mark up those
    prices in setting the final sales prices paid by the customer.
    Revenue from indirect sales channels in fiscal 2011 represented
    10 percent of our total revenue and approximately
    40 percent of our international revenue, compared with
    revenue from indirect sales channels in fiscal 2010 representing
    6 percent of our total revenue and approximately
    35 percent of our international revenue, and revenue from
    indirect sales channels in fiscal 2009 representing
    11 percent of our total revenue and approximately
    55 percent of our international revenue.



Fiscal 2011 international revenue came from a large number of
    countries, and no such single country accounted for more than
    4 percent of our total revenue. Some of our exports are
    paid for by letters of credit, with the balance carried either
    on an open account or installment note basis. Advance payments,
    progress payments or other similar payments received prior to or
    upon shipment often cover most of the related costs incurred.
    Significant foreign government contracts generally require us to
    provide performance guarantees. In order to stay competitive in
    international markets, we also sometimes enter into recourse and
    vendor financing arrangements to facilitate sales to certain
    customers.



The particular economic, social and political conditions for
    business conducted outside the United States differ from those
    encountered by domestic businesses. Our management believes that
    the overall business risk for the international business as a
    whole is somewhat greater than that faced by our domestic
    operations as a whole. A description of the types of risks to
    which we are subject in international business is contained in
    “Item 1A. Risk Factors” of this Report.
    Nevertheless, in the opinion of our management, these risks are
    partially mitigated by the diversification of the international
    business and the protection provided by letters of credit and
    advance payments.





Competition

We operate in highly competitive markets that are sensitive to
    technological advances. Although successful product and systems
    development is not necessarily dependent on substantial
    financial resources, many of our competitors in each of our
    businesses are larger than we are and can maintain higher levels
    of expenditures for research and development. In each of our
    businesses we concentrate on the market opportunities that our
    management believes are compatible with our resources, overall
    technological capabilities and objectives. Principal competitive
    factors in these businesses are product quality and reliability;
    technological capabilities; service; past performance; ability
    to develop and implement complex, integrated solutions; ability
    to meet delivery schedules; the effectiveness of third-party
    sales channels in international markets; and cost-effectiveness.
    Within the IT services market, there is intense competition
    among many companies. The ability to compete in the IT services
    market depends on a number of factors, including the capability
    to deploy skilled professionals at competitive prices across the
    diverse spectrum of the IT services market.



In the RF Communications segment, principal competitors include
    European Aeronautic Defence and Space Company N.V.
    (“EADS”), General Dynamics, ITT Industries, Motorola
    Solutions, Raytheon, Rohde & Schwarz, Tadiran and
    Thales.



In the Integrated Network Solutions segment, principal
    competitors include Avid, Computer Sciences Corporation, Evertz,
    EVS Corporation, General Dynamics, Globecomm, Harmonic,
    Hewlett Packard, Lockheed Martin, ManTech, Miranda, MTN, NCI
    Information Systems, NEC, Northrop Grumman, Omnibus, Raytheon,
    RigNet, Rohde & Schwarz, Sony Broadcast, Stratos, TCS,
    Technicolor, Tektronix/Danaher, Telos Corporation, Thomson, and
    Vizada, as well as other smaller companies and divisions of
    large companies.



In the Government Communications Systems segment, principal
    competitors include BAE Systems, Boeing, General Dynamics, L-3
    Communications, Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman, Raytheon and
    Rockwell Collins. We frequently “partner” or are
    involved in subcontracting and teaming relationships with
    companies that are, from time to time, competitors on other
    programs.



Principal
    Customers; Government Contracts

Sales to U.S. Government customers, including the DoD and
    intelligence and civilian agencies, as well as foreign military
    sales through the U.S. Government, whether directly or
    through prime contractors, were 72 percent of our total
    revenue in fiscal 2011 compared with 75 percent in fiscal
    2010 and 74 percent in fiscal 2009. No other customer
    accounted for more than 1 percent of our total revenue in
    fiscal 2011. Additional information regarding customers for each
    of our segments is provided under “Item 1.
    Business — Description of Business by Segment” of
    this Report. Our U.S. Government sales are predominantly
    derived from contracts with agencies of, and prime contractors
    to, the U.S. Government. Most of the sales of our
    Government Communications Systems segment and of the portions of
    our Integrated Networks Solutions segment’s IT services,
    managed satellite and terrestrial communications solutions and
    healthcare solutions operations in connection with
    U.S. Government programs are made directly or indirectly to
    the U.S. Government under contracts or subcontracts
    containing standard government contract clauses providing for
    redetermination of profits, if applicable, and for termination
    for the convenience of the U.S. Government or for default
    based upon performance.



Our U.S. Government contracts and subcontracts include both
    cost-reimbursable and fixed-price contracts. Governmentwide
    Acquisition Contracts (“GWACs”) and IDIQ contracts,
    which can include task orders for each contract type, require us
    to compete both for the initial contract and then for individual
    task or delivery orders under such contracts.



Our U.S. Government cost-reimbursable contracts provide for
    the reimbursement of allowable costs plus the payment of a fee.
    Our U.S. Government cost-reimbursable contracts fall into
    three basic types: (i) cost-plus fixed-fee contracts, which
    provide for the payment of a fixed fee irrespective of the final
    cost of performance; (ii) cost-plus incentive-fee
    contracts, which provide for increases or decreases in the fee,
    within specified limits, based upon actual results compared with
    contractual targets relating to factors such as cost,
    performance and delivery schedule; and (iii) cost-plus
    award-fee contracts, which provide for the payment of an award
    fee determined at the discretion of the customer based upon the
    performance of the contractor against pre-established
    performance criteria. Under our U.S. Government
    cost-reimbursable contracts, we are reimbursed periodically for
    allowable costs and are paid a portion of the fee based on
    contract progress. Some overhead costs have been made partially
    or wholly unallowable for reimbursement by statute or
    regulation. Examples are certain merger and acquisition costs,
    lobbying costs, charitable contributions and certain litigation
    defense costs.



Our U.S. Government fixed-price contracts are either firm
    fixed-price contracts or fixed-price incentive contracts. Under
    our U.S. Government firm fixed-price contracts, we agree to
    perform a specific scope of work for a





fixed price and, as a result, benefit from cost savings and
    carry the burden of cost overruns. Under our
    U.S. Government fixed-price incentive contracts, we share
    with the U.S. Government both savings accrued from
    contracts performed for less than target costs as well as costs
    incurred in excess of targets up to a negotiated ceiling price
    (which is higher than the target cost), but carry the entire
    burden of costs exceeding the negotiated ceiling price.
    Accordingly, under such incentive contracts, profit may also be
    adjusted up or down depending upon whether specified performance
    objectives are met. Under our U.S. Government firm
    fixed-price and fixed-price incentive contracts, we usually
    receive either milestone payments equaling 100 percent of
    the contract price or monthly progress payments from the
    U.S. Government in amounts equaling 80 percent of
    costs incurred under the contract. The remaining amounts,
    including profits or incentive fees, are billed upon delivery
    and final acceptance of end items and deliverables under the
    contract. Our U.S. Government fixed-price contracts
    generally have higher profit margins than our
    U.S. Government cost-reimbursable contracts. Our production
    contracts are mainly fixed-price contracts, and development
    contracts are generally cost-reimbursable contracts.





Funded
    and Unfunded Backlog

Our total company-wide funded and unfunded backlog was
    approximately $7,786 million at July 1, 2011 compared
    with approximately $6,526 million at July 2, 2010 and
    $6,317 million at July 3, 2009. The funded portion of
    this backlog was approximately $3,358 million at
    July 1, 2011 compared with approximately
    $3,250 million at July 2, 2010 and $2,315 million
    at July 3, 2009. The determination of backlog involves
    substantial estimating, particularly with respect to customer
    requirements contracts and development and production contracts
    of a cost-reimbursable or incentive nature.



We define funded backlog as unfilled firm orders for products
    and services for which funding has been authorized and, in the
    case of U.S. Government agencies, appropriated. We define
    unfunded backlog as primarily unfilled firm contract value for
    which funding has not yet been authorized or, in the case of
    U.S. Government agencies, appropriated, including the value
    of contract options in cases of material contracts that have
    options we believe are probable of being exercised. We do not
    include potential task or delivery orders under IDIQ contracts
    in our backlog. In fiscal 2012, we expect to fill approximately
    75 percent of our total funded backlog as of July 1,
    2011. However, we can give no assurance of such fulfillment or
    that our funded backlog will become revenue in any particular
    period, if at all. Backlog is subject to delivery delays and
    program cancellations, which are beyond our control. Additional
    information with regard to the backlog of each of our segments
    is provided under “Item 1. Business —
    Description of Business by Segment” of this Report.



Research,
    Development and Engineering

Research, development and engineering expenditures totaled
    approximately $983 million in fiscal 2011,
    $1,047 million in fiscal 2010 and $1,003 million in
    fiscal 2009. Company-sponsored research and product development
    costs, which included research and development for commercial
    products and services and independent research and development
    related to government products and services, as well as concept
    formulation studies and bid and proposal efforts, were
    approximately $336 million in fiscal 2011,
    $326 million in fiscal 2010 and $244 million in fiscal
    2009. A portion of our independent research and development
    costs are allocated among contracts and programs in process
    under U.S. Government contractual arrangements.
    Company-sponsored research and product development costs not
    otherwise allocable are charged to expense when incurred. The
    portion of total research, development and engineering
    expenditures that was not company-sponsored was funded by the
    U.S. Government and is included in our revenue.
    Customer-sponsored research and development was
    $647 million





in fiscal 2011, $721 million in fiscal 2010 and
    $759 million in fiscal 2009. Company-sponsored research is
    directed to the development of new products and services and to
    building technological capability in selected communications and
    electronic systems markets. U.S. Government-funded research
    helps strengthen and broaden our technical capabilities. All of
    our segments maintain their own engineering and new product
    development departments, with scientific assistance provided by
    advanced-technology departments. As of July 1, 2011, we
    employed approximately 7,100 engineers and scientists and are
    continuing efforts to make the technologies developed in any of
    our operating segments available for all other operating
    segments.

Environmental
    and Other Regulations

Note 1:
    Significant Accounting Policies



Electronic products are subject to governmental environmental
    regulation in a number of jurisdictions. Equipment produced by
    our Integrated Network Solutions segment, in particular, is
    subject to domestic and international requirements requiringend-of-lifemanagementand/orrestricting materials in products delivered to customers,
    including the European Union’s Directive 2002/96/EC on
    Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (“WEEE”) and
    Directive 2002/95/EC on the Restriction of the use of certain
    Hazardous Substances in Electrical and Electronic Equipment
    (“RoHS”), as amended. Other jurisdictions have adopted
    similar legislation. Such requirements typically are not
    applicable to most equipment produced by our Government
    Communications Systems





and RF Communications segments. We believe that we have complied
    with such rules and regulations, where applicable, with respect
    to our existing products sold into such jurisdictions. We intend
    to comply with such rules and regulations with respect to our
    future products.



Broadcast and wireless communications (whether TV, radio,
    satellite or telecommunications) are also subject to
    governmental regulation. Equipment produced by our Integrated
    Network Solutions and RF Communications segments, in particular,
    is subject to domestic and international requirements to avoid
    interference among users of radio and television frequencies and
    to permit interconnection of telecommunications equipment.
    Additionally, our managed satellite and terrestrial
    communications solutions operations hold licenses for very small
    aperture terminals (“VSATs”) and satellite earth
    stations, which authorize operation of networks and teleports.
    We are also required to comply with technical operating and
    licensing requirements that pertain to our wireless licenses and
    operations. We believe that we have complied with such rules and
    regulations and licenses with respect to our existing products
    and services, and we intend to comply with such rules and
    regulations and licenses with respect to our future products and
    services. Governmental reallocation of the frequency spectrum
    also could impact our business, financial condition and results
    of operations.



Raw
    Materials and Supplies



Seasonality

We do not consider any material portion of our business to be
    seasonal. Various factors can affect the distribution of our
    revenue between accounting periods, including the timing of
    contract awards and the timing and availability of
    U.S. Government funding, as well as the timing of product
    deliveries and customer acceptance.



Employees

We employed approximately 16,900 employees at the end of
    fiscal 2011 compared with approximately 15,800 employees at
    the end of fiscal 2010. Approximately 88 percent of our
    employees as of the end of fiscal 2011 were located in the
    United States. A significant number of employees in our
    Government Communications Systems segment possess a
    U.S. Government security clearance. We also utilize a
    number of independent contractors. None of our employees in the
    United States is represented by a labor union. In certain
    international subsidiaries, our employees are represented by
    workers’ councils or statutory labor unions. In general, we
    believe that our relations with our employees are good.
