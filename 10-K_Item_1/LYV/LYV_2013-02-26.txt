Our Strategy

Our strategy is to leverage our leadership position in live entertainment and our relationships with fans, venues, artists and advertisers to sell more tickets and grow our revenue, earnings and cash
flow. We pay artists, venues and teams to secure content and tickets; we invest in the technology to advance our ticketing, ecommerce and mobile platforms; and we are paid by sponsors and advertisers that aspire to connect their brands with our
passionate fan base.

Our core businesses surrounding the promotion of live events include ticketing and ecommerce,
sponsorship, and artist management. We believe our focus on growing these businesses will increase shareholder value as we continue to build all our revenue streams and achieve scale economies with our global platforms. We also continue to
strengthen our core operations, further expanding into additional global markets and optimizing our cost structure. Our strategy is to grow and innovate through the initiatives listed below.



•Expand our Platform to Sell more Tickets. We will build our fan base and sell more tickets by continuing to build our portfolio of global
festivals, expanding our electronic dance music (EDM) festival and show base, selectively growing into additional top global music markets and further building our market share in established markets.



•Drive Conversion of Ticket Sales through Social and Mobile Channels. We are focused on selling tickets through a wide set of sales channels,
including social media and mobile, and leveraging our extensive database we have built throughwww.livenation.comandwww.ticketmaster.comto better reach consumers. We are shifting marketing spend from traditional media outlets to
social media and digital platforms to more effectively reach our fans and drive more ticket sales. We will continue to develop new tools for mobile devices in additional markets to make it easier for our fans to get information on live events and
conveniently buy and sell tickets.



•Grow Sponsorship and Advertising. Our goal is to continue to drive growth in this area and capture a larger share of the music sponsorship
market. We will focus on expanding and developing new relationships with corporate sponsors to provide them with targeted strategic programs through our unique relationship with fans and artists, our distribution network of venues and our extensive
ticketing operations and online presence. In addition, we have established one of the few ecommerce sites that has a substantial and growing online advertising platform. We will continue to look for new innovative products and offerings that give
our sponsors and advertisers a unique ability to reach consumers through the power of live music.



•Sell more Tickets and Drive Reductions in the Cost to Sell a Ticket.We will continue to invest in our ticketing platforms and related venue and
fan products to strengthen the functionality of our system and drive additional ticket sales while also creating a more efficient system. We will also continue to deliver differentiated value to content owners and venues leveraging ticket buyer data
to effectively price and market shows, increasing attendance and optimizing revenues.



•Build Secondary Ticket Volume.We will grow the volume of secondary tickets sold in partnership with content owners to provide a trusted
environment for fan ticket exchanges. We will deliver an integrated inventory product that will allow our fans to have a dependable, secure location to come to for all available tickets for an event which they can access both online and via their
mobile devices.

Our Assets

We believe we have a unique portfolio of assets that is unmatched in the live entertainment industry.



•Fans. During 2012, our events were attended by nearly 49 million live music fans. Our database of our fans and their interests provides us
with the means to efficiently market our shows to these fans as well as offer them other music-related products and services. This fan database is an invaluable asset that we are able to use to provide unique services to our artists and corporate
clients.



•Artists. We have extensive relationships with artists ranging from those acts that are just beginning their careers to established superstars.
In 2012, we promoted shows or tours for over 2,300 artists globally. In addition, through our artist management companies, we manage approximately 230 artists. We believe our artist relationships are a competitive advantage and will help us pursue
our strategy to develop additional ancillary revenue streams around the ticket purchase, live event and the artists themselves.



•Online Services and Ticketing. We own and operate various branded websites, both in the United States and abroad, which are customized to
reflect services offered in each jurisdiction. Our primary online websites,www.livenation.comandwww.ticketmaster.com, together with our other branded ticketing websites, are designed to promote ticket sales for live events and to
disseminate event and related merchandise information online. Fans can accesswww.livenation.comandwww.ticketmaster.comdirectly, from affiliated websites and through numerous direct links from banners and event profiles hosted by
approved third-party websites. We have also launched mobile apps under both Live Nation and Ticketmaster that our fans can use to access event information and, in some cases, buy tickets to events.







•Distribution Network. We believe that our global distribution network of promoters, venues and festivals provides us with a strong position in
the live concert industry. We believe we have one of the largest global networks of live entertainment businesses in the world, with offices in 72 cities in North America and 24 countries worldwide. In addition, we own, operate, have booking rights
and/or have an equity interest in 139 venues located across six countries as of the end of 2012, making us, we believe, the second largest operator of music venues in the world. We also believe that we produce one of the largest networks of music
festivals in the world with more than 50 festivals globally. In addition, we believe that our global ticketing distribution network with one of the largest ecommerce sites on the internet, approximately 9,200 sales outlets and 16 call centers
serving more than 13,000 clients worldwide makes us the largest ticketing network in the industry.



•Sponsors. We employ a sales force of approximately 200 people that worked with approximately 800 sponsors during 2012, through a combination of
local venue-related deals and national deals, both in North America and internationally. Our sponsors include some of the most well-recognized national and global brands including O2, State Farm, Red Bull and Coca-Cola (each of these brands is a registered trademark of the sponsor).



•Employees. At December 31, 2012, we employed approximately 7,100 full-time employees who are dedicated to providing first-class service to
our artists, fans, ticketing clients and corporate sponsors. Many of our employees have decades of experience in promoting and producing live concerts, ticketing operations, sales and marketing, artist management and live event venue management.

Our History

We were incorporated in Delaware on August 2, 2005 in preparation for the contribution and transfer by Clear Channel of substantially all of its entertainment assets and liabilities to us. We
completed the separation on December 21, 2005, and became a publicly traded company on the New York Stock Exchange trading under the symbol “LYV.”

On January 25, 2010, we merged with Ticketmaster. Effective on the date of the Merger, Ticketmaster became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Live Nation and Live Nation, Inc. changed its name to Live
Nation Entertainment, Inc.

Our Industry

We operate in five main industries within the live entertainment business, including live music events, venue operations, ticketing services, sponsorship and advertising sales and artist management and
services.

The live music industry includes concert promotion and/or production of music events or tours. Typically, to
initiate live music events or tours, booking agents directly contract with artists to represent them for defined periods. Booking agents then contact promoters, who will contract with them or directly with artists to arrange events. Booking agents
generally receive fixed or percentage fees from artists for their services. Promoters earn revenue primarily from the sale of tickets. Artists are paid by the promoter under one of several different formulas, which may include fixed guarantees
and/or a percentage of ticket sales or event profits. In addition, promoters may also reimburse artists for certain costs of production, such as sound and lights. Under guaranteed payment formulas, promoters assume the risks of unprofitable events.
Promoters may renegotiate lower guarantees or cancel events because of insufficient ticket sales in order to reduce their losses. Promoters can also reduce the risk of losses by entering into global or national touring agreements with artists and
including the right to offset lower performing shows against higher performing shows on the tour in the determination of overall artist fees.

For music tours, one to four months typically elapse between booking artists and the first performances. Promoters, in conjunction with artists, managers and booking agents, set ticket prices and
advertise events. Promoters market events, sell tickets, rent or otherwise provide venues and arrange for local production services, such as stages and sets.

Venue operators typically contract with promoters to rent their venues for specific events on specific dates and receive fixed fees or percentages of ticket sales as rental income. In addition, venue
operators provide services such as concessions, parking, security, ushering and ticket-taking, and receive some or all of the revenue from concessions, merchandise, venue sponsorships, parking and premium seating.

Ticketing services include the sale of tickets primarily through online channels but also through phone, outlet and box office channels.
Ticketing companies will contract with venues and/or promoters to sell tickets to events over a period of time, generally three to five years. The ticketing company does not set ticket prices or seating charts for events as this information is given
to them by the venue and/or promoter in charge of the event. The ticketing company generally gets paid a fixed fee per ticket sold or a percentage of the total ticket service charges. Venues will often also sell tickets through a local box office at
the venue using the ticketing company’s technology; on these box office tickets, the ticketing company will generally not earn a fee. The ticketing company receives the cash for the ticket sales and related service charges at the time the
ticket is sold and periodically remits these receipts to the venue and/or promoter after deducting their fee. As ticket sales increase, related ticketing operating income generally increases as well.

Ticketing “resale” services refers to the sale of tickets by a holder who originally purchased the tickets from a venue,
promoter or other entity, or a ticketing services provider selling on behalf of a venue, promoter or other entity. Generally, the ticket reseller is paid a service charge when the ticket is resold and the negotiated ticket value is paid to the
holder.







Artist management primarily provides services to music recording artists to manage their
careers. The artist manager negotiates on behalf of the artist and is paid a fee, generally as a percentage of the artist’s earnings. Artist services sells merchandise associated with musical artists at live performances, to retailers and
directly to consumers via the internet and also sells premium ticket packages and services.

The sponsorship and advertising
industry within the live entertainment business involves the sale of international, national, regional and local advertising campaigns and promotional programs to a variety of companies desiring to advertise or promote their brand or
product. The advertising campaigns typically include venue naming rights, on-site venue signage, online banner advertisements and exclusive partner rights in various categories such as beverage, hotel and telecommunications. These
promotional programs may include event pre-sales and on-site product activation.

Our Business

Our reportable segments are Concerts, Ticketing, Artist Nation and Sponsorship & Advertising. Prior to 2012, we reported an
eCommerce segment, which is now included in our Ticketing and Sponsorship & Advertising segments. Specifically, all online advertising and online sponsorships previously reported in the eCommerce segment are now reported in the
Sponsorship & Advertising segment while all other activity has been included in the Ticketing segment. This change was made to be consistent with how the four key components of the business are now being managed. Information related to
these operating segments and other operations for 2012, 2011 and 2010 is included in Note 13—Segment Data in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.

Concerts.Our Concerts segment principally involves the global promotion of live music events in our owned and/or operated venues
and in rented third-party venues, the operation and management of music venues and the production of music festivals across the world. During 2012, our Concerts business generated approximately $3.9 billion, or 66.5%, of our total revenue. We
promoted 22,000 live music events in 2012, including artists such as Madonna, Lady Gaga, Coldplay, Roger Waters, Bruce Springsteen & the E Street Band, Van Halen and the Dave Matthews Band and through festivals such as Rock Werchter,
Download, Creamfields and Reading. While our Concerts segment operates year-round, we generally experience higher revenue during the second and third quarters due to the seasonal nature of shows at our outdoor amphitheaters and festivals, which
primarily occur May through September.

As a promoter, we earn revenue primarily from the sale of tickets and pay artists
under one of several formulas, including a fixed guaranteed amount and/or a percentage of ticket sales or event profits. For each event, we either use a venue we own and/or operate, or rent a third-party venue. Revenue is generally related to the
number of events, volume of ticket sales and ticket prices. Event costs such as artist fees and production service expenses are included in direct operating expenses and are typically substantial in relation to the revenue. As a result, significant
increases or decreases in promotion revenue do not typically result in comparable changes to operating income.

As a venue
operator, we generate revenue primarily from the sale of concessions, parking, premium seating, rental income, venue sponsorships and ticket rebates or service charges earned on tickets sold through our internal ticketing operations or by third
parties under ticketing agreements. In our amphitheaters, the sale of concessions is outsourced and we receive a share of the net revenue from the concessionaire which is recorded in revenue with no significant direct operating expenses associated
with it. Revenue generated from venue operations typically have a higher margin than promotion revenue and therefore typically have a more direct relationship to operating income.

As a festival operator, we typically book artists, secure festival sites, provide for third-party production services, sell tickets and
advertise events to attract fans. We also arrange for third-parties to provide operational services as needed such as concessions, merchandising and security. We earn revenue from the sale of tickets and typically pay artists a fixed
guaranteed amount. We also earn revenue from the sale of concessions, camping fees, festival sponsorships and ticket rebates or service charges earned on tickets sold. For each event, we either use a festival site we own or rent a third-party
festival site. Revenue is generally related to the number of events, volume of ticket sales and ticket prices. Event costs such as artist fees and production service expenses are included in direct operating expenses and are typically substantial in
relation to the revenue. As a result, significant increases or decreases in festival promotion revenue will generally result in comparable changes to operating income.

Ticketing. Our Ticketing segment is primarily an agency business that sells tickets for events on behalf of our clients and retains a convenience charge and order processing fee for our services.
We sell tickets for our events and also for third-party clients across multiple live event categories, providing ticketing services for leading arenas, stadiums, amphitheaters, music clubs, concert promoters, professional sports franchises and
leagues, college sports teams, performing arts venues, museums and theaters. We sell tickets through a combination of websites, telephone services, mobile devices and ticket outlets. During the year ended December 31, 2012, we sold 78%, 6%, 4%
and 12% of primary tickets through these channels, respectively. Our Ticketing segment also manages our online activities including enhancements to our websites and bundled product offerings. During 2012, our Ticketing business generated
approximately $1.4 billion, or 23.6%, of our total revenue, which excludes the face value of tickets sold. Through all of our ticketing services, we sold over 148 million tickets in 2012 and sold an additional 108 million tickets through
our venue clients’ box offices. Our ticketing sales are impacted by fluctuations in the availability of events for sale to the public, which may vary depending upon event scheduling by our clients.









We currently offer ticket resale services through
TicketsNow (in the United States and Canada), our TicketExchange service (in the United States, Europe and Canada) and GET ME IN! (in the United Kingdom). Through TicketsNow and GET ME IN!, we enter into listing agreements with ticket resellers to
post ticket inventory for sale at a purchase price equal to a ticket resale price determined by the ticket reseller plus an amount equal to a percentage of the ticket resale price and a pre-determined service fee. We remit the ticket resale price to
the ticket resellers and retain the remainder of the purchase price. While we do not generally acquire tickets for sale on our own behalf, we may do so from time to time on a limited basis. In addition to enabling premium primary ticket sales, the
TicketExchange service allows consumers to resell and purchase tickets online for certain events that were initially sold for our venue clients who elect to participate in the TicketExchange service. Sellers and buyers each pay a fee that has been
negotiated with the relevant client, a portion of which is shared with the client.

Artist Nation. Our Artist Nation
segment primarily provides management services to music artists in exchange for a commission on the earnings of these artists. Our Artist Nation segment also sells merchandise associated with musical artists at live performances, to retailers and
directly to consumers via the internet and also provides other services to artists. During 2012, our Artist Nation business generated approximately $400 million, or 6.9%, of our total revenue. Revenue earned from our Artist Nation segment is
impacted to a large degree by the touring schedules of the artists we represent. Generally, we experience higher revenue during the second and third quarters as the period from May through September tends to be a popular time for touring events.

Sponsorship & Advertising.Our Sponsorship & Advertising segment employs a sales force that creates
and maintains relationships with sponsors, through a combination of strategic, international, national and local opportunities for businesses to reach customers through our concert, venue, artist relationship and ticketing assets, including
advertising on our websites. We work with our corporate clients to help create marketing programs that promote their brand and/or product. During 2012, our Sponsorship & Advertising business generated approximately $248 million, or 4.3%, of
our total revenue.

We believe that we have a unique opportunity to connect the music fan to corporate sponsors and therefore
seek to optimize this relationship through strategic sponsorship programs. We continue to also pursue the sale of national and local sponsorships, both domestically and internationally, and placement of advertising, including signage, online
advertising and promotional programs. Many of our venues have venue naming rights sponsorship programs. We believe national and international sponsorships allow us to maximize our network of venues and to arrange multi-venue branding opportunities
for advertisers. Our sponsorship programs include companies such as Starwood, American Express, Vodafone, Anheuser Busch, Citi and Hertz (each of the preceding brands is a registered trademark of the sponsor). Our local and venue-focused
sponsorships include venue signage, promotional programs, on-site activation, hospitality and tickets, and are derived from a variety of companies across various industry categories.

2012 Acquisitions

The following list includes some of our larger
acquisitions during 2012:

Coppel— In April 2012, our Concerts segment acquired a 51% interest in Michael Coppel
Ventures Pty Ltd, a concert promotion business in Australia and New Zealand.

Cream— In May 2012, our Concerts
segment acquired a 90% interest in Cream Holdings Limited, an electronic dance music festival promoter based in the United Kingdom.

HARD— In June 2012, our Concerts segment acquired HARD Events LLC, an electronic dance music festival promoter based in Los Angeles, California.







Live Nation Venue Details

In the live entertainment industry, venue types generally consist of:



•Stadiums—Stadiums are multi-purpose facilities, often housing local sports teams. Stadiums typically have 30,000 or more seats. Although
they are the largest venues available for live music, they are not specifically designed for live music. At December 31, 2012, we had booking rights to two stadiums in North America.



•Amphitheaters—Amphitheaters are generally outdoor venues with between 5,000 and 30,000 seats that are used primarily in the summer season.
We believe they are popular because they are designed specifically for concert events, with premium seat packages and better lines of sight and acoustics. At December 31, 2012, we owned eight, leased 28, operated six and had booking rights for
seven amphitheaters located in North America.



•Arenas—Arenas are indoor venues that are used as multi-purpose facilities, often housing local sports teams. Arenas typically have between
5,000 and 20,000 seats. Because they are indoors, they are able to offer amenities that other similar-sized outdoor venues cannot, such as luxury suites and premium club memberships. As a result, we believe they have become increasingly popular for
higher-priced concerts aimed at audiences willing to pay for these amenities. At December 31, 2012, we owned one, leased three, operated four and had booking rights for three arenas located in North America, the United Kingdom, Ireland, the
Netherlands and Italy.



•Music Theaters—Music theaters are indoor venues that are built primarily for music events. These venues typically have a capacity between
1,000 and 6,500. Because these venues have a smaller capacity than an amphitheater, they do not offer as much economic upside on a per show basis. However, because music theaters can be used year-round, unlike most amphitheaters, they can generate
annual profits similar to those of an amphitheater. Music theaters represent less risk to concert promoters because they have lower fixed costs associated with hosting a concert and may provide a more appropriately-sized venue for developing artists
and more artists in general. At December 31, 2012, we owned seven, leased 25, operated three, had booking rights for seven and an equity interest in one music theaters located in North America and the United Kingdom.



•Clubs—Clubs are indoor venues that are built primarily for music events but may also include comedy clubs. These venues typically have a
capacity of less than 1,000 and often without full fixed seating. Because of their small size, they do not offer as much economic upside, but they also represent less risk to a concert promoter because they have lower fixed costs associated with
hosting a concert and also may provide a more appropriate sized venue for developing artists. Clubs can also be used year-round and can therefore generate higher profits for the year, even though per show profits are lower. At December 31,
2012, we owned three, leased ten and had booking rights for three clubs in North America and the United Kingdom.



•House of Blues—House of Blues venues are indoor venues that offer customers an integrated live music and dining experience. The live music
halls are specially designed to provide optimum acoustics and typically can accommodate between 1,000 to 2,000 guests. A full-service restaurant and bar is located adjacent to the live music hall. We believe that the high quality of the food,
service and unique atmosphere in our restaurants attracts customers to these venues independently from an entertainment event and generates a significant amount of repeat business from local customers. At December 31, 2012, we owned two and
leased ten House of Blues venues located in North America. One of the House of Blues venues is comprised of two buildings where we own one and lease the other. We have included this venue as an owned venue.



•Festival Sites—Festival sites are outdoor locations used primarily in the summer season to stage day-long or multi-day concert events
featuring several artists. Depending on the location, festival site capacities can range from 10,000 to 120,000. We believe they are popular because of the value provided to the fan by packaging several artists for a full-day or multi-day event.
While festival sites only host a few events each year, they can provide higher operating income because we are able to generate income from many different services provided at the event and they have lower costs associated with producing the event
and maintaining the site. At December 31, 2012, we owned four festival sites located in North America and the United Kingdom. One of the festival sites is comprised of two parcels of land where we own one and lease the other. We have included
this site as owned.



•Theatrical Theaters—Theatrical theaters are generally indoor venues that are built specifically for theatrical events, with substantial
aesthetic and acoustic consideration. These venues typically have less than 5,000 seats. Additionally, given their size, they are able to host events aimed at niche audiences. At December 31, 2012, we leased one theatrical theater located in
North America and operated one in Ireland.

Competition

Competition in the live entertainment industry is intense. We believe that we compete primarily on the basis of our ability to deliver quality music events, sell tickets and provide enhanced fan and
artist experiences. We believe that our primary strengths include:



•the quality of service delivered to our artists, fans and corporate sponsors;



•our track record in promoting and producing live music events and tours both domestically and internationally;



•artist relationships;



•our global footprint;



•ticketing software and services;



•our ecommerce site and associated database;



•distribution platform (venues);



•the scope and effectiveness in our expertise of marketing and sponsorship programs; and



•our financial stability.

Although we believe that our products and services currently compete favorably with respect to such factors, we cannot provide any assurance that we can maintain our competitive position against current
and potential competitors, especially those with significantly greater brand recognition, or financial, marketing, support, technical and other resources.

In the markets in which we promote music concerts, we face competition from both promoters and venue operators. We believe that barriers to entry into the promotion services business are low and that
certain local promoters are increasingly expanding the geographic scope of their operations.

Our main competitors in the live
music industry include AEG and C3 Presents, in addition to numerous smaller regional companies and various casinos in North America and Europe. Anschutz Entertainment Group operates under a number of different names including AEG Live, Concerts West
and The Messina Group. Some of our competitors in the live music industry have a stronger presence in certain markets, have access to other sports and entertainment venues and may have greater financial resources in those markets, which may enable
them to gain a greater competitive advantage in relation to us.

In markets where we own and/or operate a venue, we compete
with other venues to serve artists likely to perform in that general region. Consequently, touring artists have various alternatives to our venues when scheduling tours. Our main competitors in venue management include SMG, AEG and The Nederlander
Organization in addition to numerous smaller regional companies in North America and Europe. Some of our competitors in venue management have a greater number of venues in certain markets and may have greater financial resources in those markets.

The ticketing services industry includes the sale of tickets primarily through online channels, but also through telephone
services, mobile devices and ticket outlets. As online ticket purchases increase, related ticketing costs generally decrease, which has made it easier for technology-based companies to offer primary ticketing services and standalone, automated
ticketing systems that enable venues to perform their own ticketing services or utilize self-ticketing systems. In the online environment, we compete with other websites, online event sites and ticketing companies to provide event information, sell
tickets and provide other online services such as fan clubs and artist websites.







We experience competition from other national, regional and local primary ticketing service
providers to secure new venues and to reach fans for events. Resale ticketing services and the consolidation of the resale industry, which historically had been more fragmented and consisted of a significant number of local resellers with limited
inventory selling through traditional storefronts, has created more aggressive buying of primary tickets whereby brokers are using bot technology to attempt to buy the best tickets when they go on sale. The internet allows fans and other ticket
resellers to reach a vastly larger audience through the aggregation of inventory on online resale websites and marketplaces, and provides consumers with more convenient access to tickets for a larger number and greater variety of events. We also
face significant and increasing competition from companies that sell self-ticketing systems, as well as from venues that choose to integrate self-ticketing systems into their existing operations or acquire primary ticketing service providers. Our
main competitors include primary ticketing companies such as Tickets.com, AXS, Paciolan, Veritix and CTS Eventim, online and event companies such as Eventbrite, eTix and Ticketfly and secondary ticketing companies such as StubHub.

In the artist management business, we compete with other artist managers both at larger talent representation companies, such as Red
Light Management, as well as smaller artist management companies and individuals. In the artist services business, we compete with companies typically only involved in one or a few of the services we provide. Some of these competitors include Bill
Young Productions, Bravado, Artist Arena and Global Merchandising.

Our main competitors at the local market level for
sponsorships and advertising dollars include local sports teams, which often offer state of the art venues and strong local media packages. Additionally, our competitors locally can include festivals, theme parks and other local events. On the
national level, our competitors include the major sports leagues that all sell sponsorships combined with significant national media packages.

Government Regulations

We are subject to federal, state and local laws, both domestically and internationally, governing matters such as:



•construction, renovation and operation of our venues;



•licensing, permitting and zoning, including noise ordinances;



•human health, safety and sanitation requirements;



•the service of food and alcoholic beverages;



•working conditions, labor, minimum wage and hour, citizenship and employment laws;



•compliance with the ADA and the DDA;



•historic landmark rules;



•compliance with United States FCPA, the United Kingdom Bribery Act 2010 and similar regulations in other countries;



•hazardous and non-hazardous waste and other environmental protection laws;



•sales and other taxes and withholding of taxes;



•privacy laws and protection of personally identifiable information;



•marketing activities via the telephone and online; and



•primary ticketing and ticket resale services.



We believe that we are in material compliance with these laws. The regulations relating to our food service in our venues are many and
complex. A variety of regulations at various governmental levels relating to the handling, preparation and serving of food, the cleanliness of food production facilities and the hygiene of food-handling personnel are enforced primarily at the local
public health department level.

We also must comply with applicable licensing laws, as well as state and local service laws,
commonly called dram shop statutes. Dram shop statutes generally prohibit serving alcoholic beverages to certain persons such as an individual who is intoxicated or a minor. If we violate dram shop laws, we may be liable to third parties for the
acts of the customer. Although we generally hire outside vendors to provide these services at our larger operated venues and regularly sponsor training programs designed to minimize the likelihood of such a situation, we cannot guarantee that
intoxicated or minor customers will not be served or that liability for their acts will not be imposed on us.

We are also
required to comply with the ADA, the DDA and certain state statutes and local ordinances that, among other things, require that places of public accommodation, including both existing and newly constructed venues, be accessible to customers with
disabilities. The ADA and the DDA require that venues be constructed to permit persons with disabilities full use of a live entertainment venue. The ADA and the DDA may also require that certain modifications be made to existing venues to make them
accessible to customers and employees who are disabled. In order to comply with the ADA, the DDA and other similar ordinances, we may face substantial capital expenditures in the future.







We are required to comply with the laws of the countries we operate in and also the United
States FCPA and the United Kingdom Bribery Act 2010 regarding anti-bribery regulations. These regulations make it illegal for us to pay, promise to pay or receive money or anything of value to, or from, any government or foreign public official for
the purpose of directly or indirectly obtaining or retaining business. This ban on illegal payments and bribes also applies to agents or intermediaries who use funds for purposes prohibited by the statute.

We are required to comply with federal, state and international laws regarding privacy and the storing, sharing, use, disclosure and
protection of personally identifiable information and user data. Specifically, personally identifiable information is increasingly subject to legislation and regulations in numerous jurisdictions around the world, the intent of which is to protect
the privacy of personal information that is collected, processed and transmitted in or from the governing jurisdiction.

From
time to time, governmental bodies have proposed legislation that could have an effect on our business. For example, some legislatures have proposed laws in the past that would impose potential liability on us and other promoters and producers of
live music events for entertainment taxes and for incidents that occur at our events, particularly relating to drugs and alcohol. More recently, some jurisdictions have proposed legislation that would restrict ticketing methods, mandate ticket
inventory disclosure and attack current policies governing season tickets for sports teams.

In addition, we and our venues
are subject to extensive environmental laws and regulations relating to the use, storage, disposal, emission and release of hazardous and non-hazardous substances, as well as zoning and noise level restrictions which may affect, among other things,
the hours of operations of our venues.

Intellectual Property

We create, own and distribute intellectual property worldwide. It is our practice to protect our trademarks, brands, copyrights, patents and other original and acquired works, ancillary goods and
services. Our trademarks include, among others, the word marks “Live Nation,” “Ticketmaster,” “House of Blues” and “The Fillmore,” as well as the Live Nation, Ticketmaster, House of Blues and The Fillmore
logos. We have registered our most significant trademarks in numerous foreign countries. We believe that our trademarks and other proprietary rights have significant value and are important to our brand-building efforts and the marketing of our
services. We cannot predict, however, whether steps taken by us to protect our proprietary rights will be adequate to prevent misappropriation of these rights.

Employees

As of December 31, 2012, we had approximately 7,100
full-time employees, including 4,700 domestic and 2,400 international employees, of which approximately 6,900 were employed in our operations departments and approximately 200 were employed in our corporate group.
