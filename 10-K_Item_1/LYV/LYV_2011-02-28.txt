Our Strategy

Our strategy is to expand our presence in the world’s
largest markets and leverage our leadership position in live entertainment and ecommerce to sell more tickets and grow our revenue streams surrounding the ticket purchase and live event. We pay artists, venues and teams to secure content and tickets
and we provide the best access for fans to buy those tickets. Our business is converging around the online ticket purchase as a result of digital advances and our ability to aggregate and innovate how we deliver everything relevant about the artist,
event and venue via one location.

Our core businesses surrounding the live event include ticketing and ecommerce, artist
management, sponsorship and onsite ancillary spend. We believe our focus on growing these businesses will increase stockholder value as we increase our exposure to higher margin revenue streams. We are also strengthening our core operations by
expanding into top global markets and optimizing our cost structure. We will continue to execute on this strategy through pursuing the objectives listed below.



•Expand Ticketing and Online Services. Our goal is to strengthen our direct relationship with fans online through our leading live entertainment
and ticketing destination websites:www.livenation.comandwww.ticketmaster.com. Livenation.com offers an extensive inventory of live concerts, tickets and related products. Ticketmaster.com is the leading ticketing website and one of
the world’s top five ecommerce sites and provides information about live events in the music, sports, theater and family categories and access to tickets for these events. We plan on growing our websites by improving the online fan experience,
enhancing the ticket purchasing process, introducing upsell opportunities and generating additional revenue from online advertising and the sale of other goods and services. We plan on improving our ticketing software system over the next few years
in order to strengthen the functionality of our system and give our clients a better overall experience. We are also developing systems and products that will leverage our extensive data on fan purchasing behaviors to help our clients sell more
tickets.



•Improve the Profitability of Our Live Event Business. We are seeking to improve the profitability of our core live event operations by lowering
discretionary fixed costs, reducing event expenses, improving the price scaling of tickets and increasing ancillary sales per fan at all events and at all venues which we operate.



•Grow Sponsorships. Our goal is to expand and develop new relationships with corporate sponsors by providing targeted strategic programs that
deliver more value to the sponsor through our unique relationship with fans and artists, our distribution network of venues and our extensive ticketing operations and online presence.



•Expand our Global Platform. We will selectively expand our business into top music markets and population centers around the world. Our focus
internationally is on increasing our promoter and festival presence, extending our ticketing services and expanding our artist management. In North America, we continue to look for key opportunities for operation of strategic venues, to grow our
festival presence and to expand through strategic partnerships.

Our Assets

We believe we have a unique portfolio of assets that is unmatched in the live entertainment industry.



•Fans. During 2010, our events were attended by over 47 million live music fans. Our database provides us with the means to efficiently
market our shows to these fans as well as offer them other music-related products and services. This database is an invaluable asset that we are able to use to service our artists and corporate clients.



•Artists. We have extensive relationships with artists ranging from those acts that are just beginning their careers to established superstars.
In 2010, we promoted shows or tours for approximately 2,300 artists globally. In addition, through our artist management companies, we manage approximately 250 artists. We believe our artist relationships are a competitive advantage and will help us
pursue our strategy to develop additional ancillary revenue streams around the ticket purchase, live event and the artists themselves.



•Online Services and Ticketing. We own and operate various branded websites, both in the United States and abroad, which are customized to
reflect services offered in each jurisdiction. Our primary online websites,www.livenation.comandwww.ticketmaster.com, together with our branded ticketing websites, are designed to promote ticket sales for live events and to
disseminate event and related merchandise information online. Fans can accesswww.livenation.comandwww.ticketmaster.comdirectly, from affiliated websites and through numerous direct links from banners and event profiles hosted by
approved third party websites.







•Distribution Network. We believe that our global distribution network of promoters, venues and festivals provides us with a strong position in
the live concert industry. We believe we have one of the largest global networks of live entertainment businesses in the world, with offices in 76 cities in North America and a total of 22 countries worldwide. In addition, we own, operate, have
booking rights and/or have an equity interest in 128 venues located across six countries as of the end of 2010, making us, we believe, the second largest operator of music venues in the world. We also believe that we produce one of the largest
networks of music festivals in the world with almost 30 festivals globally. In addition, we believe that our global ticketing services distribution network with one of the largest ecommerce sites on the internet, approximately 7,100 independent
sales outlets and 18 worldwide call centers, serving more than 11,000 clients worldwide makes us the largest ticketing network in the industry.



•Sponsors. We employed a sales force of approximately 200 people that worked with approximately 800 sponsors during 2010, through a combination
of local venue related deals and national deals, both in North America and internationally. Our sponsors include some of the most well-recognized national and global brands including O2, State Farm, Red Bull and Coca-Cola.



•Employees. At December 31, 2010, we employed approximately 6,500 full-time employees who are dedicated to providing first-class service to
our artists, fans, ticketing venue clients and corporate sponsors. Many of our employees have decades of experience in promoting and producing live concerts, ticketing operations, sales and marketing, artist management and live event venue
management.

Our History

We were incorporated in Delaware on August 2, 2005 in preparation for the spin-off of substantially all of Clear Channel’s entertainment assets and liabilities. The Separation was completed
on December 21, 2005, at which point we became a publicly traded company on the New York Stock Exchange trading under the symbol “LYV”.

Our Merger with Ticketmaster

On January 25, 2010, we and Ticketmaster
completed our Merger. As part of the Merger, Ticketmaster stockholders received 1.4743728 shares of Live Nation common stock for each share of Ticketmaster common stock they owned. Effective on the date of the Merger, Ticketmaster became a
wholly-owned subsidiary of Live Nation named Ticketmaster Entertainment LLC and Live Nation, Inc. changed its name to Live Nation Entertainment, Inc. Subsequently, in connection with certain financing transactions completed on May 6, 2010,
Ticketmaster was merged into the Company and the separate corporate existence of Ticketmaster ceased.

Under the terms of the
agreement reached with the DOJ in connection with obtaining regulatory clearance for the Merger, we agreed to divest one of our ticketing subsidiaries, Paciolan, and to license the Ticketmaster ticketing system to AEG for a period of up to five
years, in addition to other terms intended to protect competitive conditions in ticketing and promotions. In March 2010, we sold Paciolan to Comcast.







Our Industry

We operate in four main industries within the live entertainment business, including live music events, ticketing software and services, artist management and artist services and venue operations.

The live music industry includes concert promotion and/or production of music tours. Typically, to initiate live music events
or tours, booking agents directly contract with performers to represent them for defined periods. Booking agents then contact promoters, who will contract with them or directly with performers to arrange events. Booking agents generally receive
fixed or percentage fees from performers for their services. Promoters earn revenue primarily from the sale of tickets. Performers are paid by the promoter under one of several different formulas, which may include fixed guarantees and/or a
percentage of ticket sales or event profits. In addition, promoters may also reimburse performers for certain costs of production, such as sound and lights. Under guaranteed payment formulas, promoters assume the risks of unprofitable events.
Promoters may renegotiate lower guarantees or cancel events because of insufficient ticket sales in order to reduce their losses. Promoters can also reduce the risk of losses by entering into global or national touring agreements with performers and
including the right to offset lower performing shows against higher performing shows on the tour in the determination of overall artist fees.

For music tours, one to four months typically elapse between booking performers and the first performances. Promoters, in conjunction with performers, managers and booking agents, set ticket prices and
advertise events. Promoters market events, sell tickets, rent or otherwise provide venues and arrange for local production services, such as stages and sets.

Venue operators typically contract with promoters to rent their venues for specific events on specific dates. Venue operators provide services such as concessions, parking, security, ushering and
ticket-taking, and receive some or all of the revenue from concessions, merchandise, sponsorships, parking and premium seats. For the events they host, venue operators typically receive fixed fees or percentages of ticket sales, as well as
percentages of total concession sales from the concessionaire and percentages of total merchandise sales from the merchandisers.

Ticketing services include the sale of tickets primarily through online channels but also through phone, outlet and box office channels. Ticketing companies will contract with venues and/or promoters to
sell tickets to events over a period of time, generally three to five years. The ticketing company does not set ticket prices or seating charts for events as this information is given to them by the venue and/or promoter in charge of the event. The
ticketing company generally gets paid a fixed fee per ticket sold or a percentage of the total ticket service charges. Venues will often also sell tickets through a local box office at the venue using the ticketing company’s technology; on
these box office tickets, the ticketing company will generally not earn a fee. The ticketing company receives the cash for the ticket sales and related service charges at the time the ticket is sold and periodically remits these receipts to the
venue and/or promoter after deducting their fee. As ticket purchases increase, related ticketing operating income generally increases as well.

Ticketing “resale” services refers to the sale of tickets by a holder who originally purchased the tickets from a venue, promoter or other entity, or a ticketing services provider selling on
behalf of a venue, promoter or other entity. Generally, the ticket reseller is paid a service charge when the ticket is resold and the negotiated ticket value is paid to the holder.

Artist services primarily provides management services to music recording artists in exchange for a commission on the earnings of these
artists. The artist manager negotiates on behalf of the artist and is paid a fee, generally as a percentage of the artist’s earnings. Artist services also sells merchandise associated with musical artists at live musical performances, to
retailers and directly to consumers via the internet and also sells premium ticket packages. Artist services is highly seasonal, with profitability related to the timing of tours and merchandise sales. Peak seasons are typically in the summer and in
the fall leading up to the holiday season.

The sponsorship and advertising industry within the live entertainment business
involves the sale of international, national, regional and local advertising campaigns and promotional programs to a variety of companies desiring to advertise or promote their brand or product. The advertising campaigns typically include
venue naming rights, on-site venue signage, online banner advertisements and exclusive partner rights in various categories such as beverage, hotel, and telecommunications. The promotional programs typically include event pre-sales and product
on-site activation.

Our Business

We operate in five reportable business segments: Concerts, Ticketing, Artist Nation, eCommerce and Sponsorship. Prior to 2010, our reportable operating segments were North American Music, International
Music and Ticketing. The Artist Nation segment is primarily made up of Front Line’s artist management and services businesses and our artist services







business which was previously reported as a component of the North American Music segment. Information related to these operating segments and other operations for 2010, 2009 and 2008 is included
in Note 18—Segment Data in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.

Concerts.Our Concerts
segment principally involves the global promotion of live music events in our owned and/or operated venues and in rented third-party venues, the operation and management of music venues and the production of music festivals across the world. During
2010, our Concerts business generated approximately $3.4 billion, or 67.6%, of our total revenue. We promoted over 21,000 live music events in 2010, including artists such as U2, Roger Waters and Lady Gaga and through festivals such as Rock
Werchter, Reading and Download. While our Concerts segment operates year-round, we experience higher revenue during the second and third quarters due to the seasonal nature of shows at our outdoor amphitheaters and international festivals, which
primarily occur May through September.

As a promoter, we earn revenue primarily from the sale of tickets and pay performers
under one of several formulas, including a fixed guaranteed amount and/or a percentage of ticket sales or event profits. For each event, we either use a venue we own and/or operate, or rent a third-party venue. Revenue is generally related to the
number of events, volume of ticket sales and ticket prices. Event costs such as artist and production service expenses are included in direct operating expenses and are typically substantial in relation to the revenue. As a result, significant
increases or decreases in promotion revenue do not typically result in comparable changes to operating income.

As a venue
operator, we generate revenue primarily from the sale of food and beverages, parking, premium seating, rental income, venue sponsorships and ticket rebates or service charges earned on tickets sold through our internal ticketing operations for
events we promote at our venues or by third parties under ticketing agreements. In our amphitheaters, the sale of food and beverages is outsourced and we receive a share of the net revenue from the concessionaire which is recorded in revenue with no
significant direct operating expenses associated with it. Revenue generated from venue operations typically have a higher margin than promotion revenue and therefore typically have a more direct relationship to operating income.

As a festival operator, we typically book performers, secure festival sites, provide for third-party production services, sell tickets
and advertise events to attract audiences. We also arrange for third-parties to provide operational services as needed such as concessions, merchandising and security. We earn revenue from the sale of tickets and typically pay
performers a fixed guaranteed amount. We also earn revenue from the sale of food and beverages, camping fees, festival sponsorships and ticket rebates or service charges earned on tickets sold. For each event, we either use a festival site we
own or rent a third-party festival site. Revenue is generally related to the number of events, volume of ticket sales and ticket prices. Event costs such as artist and production service expenses are included in direct operating expenses and are
typically substantial in relation to the revenue. As a result, significant increases or decreases in festival promotion revenue do not typically result in comparable changes to operating income.

Ticketing. Our Ticketing segment is primarily an agency business that sells tickets for events on behalf of our clients and
retains a convenience charge and order processing fee for our services. We sell tickets for our events and also for third-party clients including venues, promoters, sports leagues and teams, and museum and cultural institutions across multiple live
event categories, providing exclusive ticketing services for leading arenas, stadiums, amphitheaters, music clubs, concert promoters, professional sports franchises and leagues, college sports teams, performing arts venues, museums and theaters. We
sell tickets through a combination of websites, ticket outlets and telephone services. During the year ended December 31, 2010, we sold 76%,15% and 9% of primary tickets through these channels, respectively. During 2010, our Ticketing business
generated approximately $1.0 billion, or 20.5% of our total revenue. Through all of our ticketing services, we sold almost 120 million tickets in 2010 and sold an additional 112 million tickets through our venue clients’ box offices
and season ticket sales.

Our ticketing sales are impacted by fluctuations in the availability of events for sale to the
public, which may vary depending upon event scheduling by our clients. Generally, the first and second quarters of the year experience the highest domestic ticketing revenue, earned primarily in the concerts and sports categories. International
revenue is generally the highest in the fourth quarter of the year, earned primarily in the concerts category.

We
generally enter into written agreements with individual clients to provide primary ticketing services for specified multi-year periods, typically ranging from three to five years. Pursuant to these agreements, clients generally determine what
tickets will be available for sale, when such tickets will go on sale to the public and what the ticket face price will be. Agreements with venue clients generally grant us the right to sell tickets for all events presented at the relevant venue for
which tickets are made available to the general public. Agreements with promoter clients generally grant us the right to sell tickets for all events presented by a given promoter at any venue, unless that venue is already covered by an existing
exclusive agreement with our ticketing business or another ticketing service provider. Under our







exclusive contracts, clients may not utilize, authorize or promote the services of third-party ticketing companies or technologies while under contract with us. While we generally have the right
to sell a substantial portion of our clients’ tickets, venue and promoter clients often sell and distribute group sales and season tickets in-house. In addition, under many written agreements between promoters and our clients, the client often
allocates certain tickets for artist, promoter, agent and venue use and do not make those tickets available for sale by us. We also generally allow clients to make a certain limited number of tickets available for sale through fan clubs, or other
similar clubs, from which we generally derive no revenue unless selected by the club to facilitate the sales. As a result, we do not sell all of our clients’ tickets and the amount of tickets that we sell varies from client to client and from
event to event, and varies as to any single client from year to year.

We currently offer ticket resale services through
TicketsNow (in the U.S. and Canada), our TicketExchange service and GET ME IN! (in the U.K). Through TicketsNow and GET ME IN!, we enter into listing agreements with ticket resellers to post ticket inventory for sale at a purchase price equal to a
ticket resale price determined by the relevant ticket reseller, plus an amount equal to a percentage of the ticket resale price and a pre-determined service fee. We remit the reseller-determined ticket resale price to the ticket resellers and retain
the remainder of the purchase price. While we do not generally acquire tickets for sale on our own behalf, we may do so from time to time on a limited basis. In addition to enabling premium primary ticket sales, the TicketExchange service allows
consumers to resell and purchase tickets online for certain events that were initially sold for our venue clients in the U.S., Europe and Canada who elect to participate in the TicketExchange service. Sellers and buyers each pay a fee that has been
negotiated with the relevant client, a portion of which is shared with the client.

Artist Nation. Our Artist Nation
segment primarily provides management services to music recording artists in exchange for a commission on the earnings of these artists. Our Artist Nation segment also sells merchandise associated with musical artists at live musical performances,
to retailers, and directly to consumers via the internet and provides other services to artists. During 2010, our Artist Nation business generated approximately $362 million, or 6.9%, of our total revenue. Revenue earned from our Artist Nation
segment is impacted to a large degree by the touring schedules of the artists we represent. Generally, we experience higher revenue during the second and third quarters as the period from May through September tends to be a popular time for touring
events.

eCommerce.Our eCommerce segment manages our consumer websites,www.livenation.comandwww.ticketmaster.com.Through our websites, we sell tickets to our own events as well as tickets for our ticketing services clients and disseminate event and related merchandise information online. This segment records a fee per ticket that
is paid to it by the Ticketing segment on every ticket sold online viawww.livenation.comandwww.ticketmaster.comin the U.S. and Canada. During 2010, our eCommerce business generated approximately $88 million, or 1.7%, of our total
revenue.

Sponsorship.Our Sponsorship segment employs a sales force that creates and maintains relationships with
sponsors, through a combination of strategic, international, national and local opportunities for businesses to reach customers through our concert, venue, artist relationship and ticketing assets. During 2010, our Sponsorship business generated
approximately $162 million, or 3.2%, of our total revenue.

We believe that we have a unique opportunity
to connect the music fan to corporate sponsors and therefore seek to optimize this relationship through strategic sponsorship programs. We continue to also pursue the sale of national and local sponsorships, both domestically and internationally,
and placement of advertising, including signage and promotional programs. Many of our venues have venue naming rights sponsorship programs. We believe national and international sponsorships allow us to maximize our network of venues and to arrange
multi-venue branding opportunities for advertisers. Our sponsorship programs include companies such as Starwood, Vodafone, Anheuser Busch, Coca-Cola, Citi®and American Express. Our local and venue-focused sponsorships include venue signage, promotional programs, on-site activation, hospitality and tickets, and are
derived from a variety of companies across various industry categories.

Other.For 2010, our other businesses
generated approximately $4 million, or less than one percent, of our total revenue.

Live Nation Venue Details

In the live entertainment industry, venues generally consist of:



•Stadiums—Stadiums are multi-purpose facilities, often housing local sports teams. Stadiums typically have 30,000 or more seats. Although
they are the largest venues available for live music, they are not specifically designed for live music. At December 31, 2010, we had booking rights to one stadium in North America.







•Amphitheaters—Amphitheaters are generally outdoor venues with between 5,000 and 30,000 seats that are used primarily in the summer season.
We believe they are popular because they are designed specifically for concert events, with premium seat packages and better lines of sight and acoustics. At December 31, 2010, we owned eight, leased 28, operated five and had booking rights for
seven amphitheaters located in North America.



•Arenas—Arenas are indoor venues that are used as multi-purpose facilities, often housing local sports teams. Arenas typically have between
5,000 and 20,000 seats. Because they are indoors, they are able to offer amenities that other similar-sized outdoor venues cannot, such as luxury suites and premium club memberships. As a result, we believe they have become increasingly popular for
higher-priced concerts aimed at audiences willing to pay for these amenities. At December 31, 2010, we owned one, leased two, operated four and had booking rights for three arenas located in the United Kingdom, Ireland, The Netherlands, Italy
and North America.



•Music Theaters—Music theaters are indoor venues that are built primarily for music events. These venues typically have a capacity between
1,000 and 6,500. Because these venues have a smaller capacity than an amphitheater, they do not offer as much economic upside on a per show basis. However, because music theaters can be used year-round, unlike most amphitheaters, they can generate
annual profits similar to those of an amphitheater. Music theaters represent less risk to concert promoters because they have lower fixed costs associated with hosting a concert and may provide a more appropriately-sized venue for developing artists
and more artists in general. At December 31, 2010, we owned seven, leased 24, operated two, had booking rights for four and an equity interest in one music theater located in North America and the United Kingdom.



•Clubs—Clubs are indoor venues that are built primarily for music events but may also include comedy clubs. These venues typically have a
capacity of less than 1,000 and often without full fixed seating. Because of their small size, they do not offer as much economic upside, but they also represent less risk to a concert promoter because they have lower fixed costs associated with
hosting a concert and also may provide a more appropriate size venue for developing artists. Clubs can also be used year-round and can therefore generate higher profits for the year, even though per show profits are lower. At December 31, 2010,
we owned three, leased seven and had booking rights for three clubs in North America and the United Kingdom.



•House of Blues—House of Blues venues are indoor venues that offer customers an integrated live music and dining experience. The live music
halls are specially designed to provide optimum acoustics and typically can accommodate between 1,000 to 2,000 guests. A full-service restaurant and bar is located adjacent to the live music hall. We believe that the high quality of the food,
service and atmosphere in our restaurants attracts customers to these venues independently from an entertainment event, and generates a significant amount of repeat business from local customers. At December 31, 2010, we owned two and leased
ten House of Blues venues located in North America. One of the House of Blues venues is comprised of two buildings where we own one and lease the other. We have included this venue as an owned venue.



•Festival Sites—Festival sites are outdoor locations used primarily in the summer season to stage day-long or multi-day concert events
featuring several performers. Depending on the location, festival site capacities can range from 10,000 to 120,000. We believe they are popular because of the value provided to the fan by packaging several performers for a full-day or multi-day
event. While festival sites only host a few events each year, they can provide higher operating income because we are able to generate income from many different services provided at the event and they have lower costs associated with producing the
event and maintaining the site. At December 31, 2010, we owned four festival sites located in North America and the United Kingdom. One of the festival sites is comprised of two parcels of land where we own one and lease the other. We have
included this site as owned.



•Theatrical Theaters—Theatrical theaters are generally indoor venues that are built specifically for theatrical events, with substantial
aesthetic and acoustic consideration. These venues typically have less than 5,000 seats. Additionally, given their size, they are able to host events aimed at niche audiences. At December 31, 2010, we leased one theatrical theater located in
North America and operated one in Ireland.







Venues

At December 31, 2010, we owned, operated, had booking rights for and/or had an equity interest in the following domestic and
international venues primarily used for music events:

Competition

Competition in the live entertainment industry is intense. We believe that we compete primarily on the basis of our ability to deliver quality music products, sell tickets and provide enhanced fan and
artist experiences. We believe that our primary strengths include:



•the quality of service delivered to our artists, fans and corporate sponsors;



•our track record in promoting and producing live music events and tours both domestically and internationally;



•artist relationships;



•ticketing software and services;



•distribution platform (venues);



•the scope and effectiveness in our expertise of marketing and sponsorship programs; and



•our financial stability.

Although we believe that our products and services currently compete favorably with respect to such factors, we cannot provide any assurance that we can maintain our competitive position against current
and potential competitors, especially those with significantly greater brand recognition, financial, marketing, service, support, technical and other resources.

In the markets in which we promote music concerts, we face competition from promoters and venue operators. We believe that barriers to entry into the promotion services business are low and that certain
local promoters are increasingly expanding the geographic scope of their operations.

Our main competitors in the live music
industry include AEG, MLK, MSG Entertainment and C3 Presents, in addition to numerous smaller regional companies and various casinos in North America and Europe. Anschutz Entertainment Group operates under a number of different names including AEG
Live, Concerts West and The Messina Group. Some of our competitors in the live music industry have a stronger presence in certain markets, have access to other sports and entertainment venues, and have greater financial resources, which may enable
them to gain a greater competitive advantage in relation to us.

In markets where we own and/or operate a venue, we compete
with other venues to serve artists likely to perform in that general region. Consequently, touring artists have significant alternatives to our venues in scheduling tours. Our main competitors in venue management include SMG and Anschutz
Entertainment Group, in addition to numerous smaller regional companies in North America and Europe. Some of our competitors in venue management have a greater number of venues in certain markets as well as greater financial resources in those
markets.

The ticketing services industry includes the sale of tickets primarily through online channels
but also through phone, outlet and box office channels. As online ticket purchases increase, related ticketing costs generally decrease, which has made it easier for technology-based companies to offer primary ticketing services and standalone,
automated ticketing systems that enable venues to perform their own ticketing services or utilize self-ticketing systems. In the online environment, we compete with other websites, online event sites and ticketing companies to provide event
information, sell tickets and provide other online services such as fan clubs and artist websites. Our main competitors include Veritix®, Tickets.com, Outbox Technology Inc., Paciolan and CTS Eventim.

We experience competition from other national, regional and local primary ticketing service providers to secure new venues and to reach fans for events. The advent of online commerce has also contributed
to the growth of resale ticketing services and the consolidation of the resale industry, which historically had been more fragmented and consisted of a significant number of local resellers with limited inventory selling through traditional
storefronts. The internet has allowed fans and other ticket resellers to reach a vastly larger audience through the aggregation of inventory on online resale websites and marketplaces, and has provided consumers with more convenient access to
tickets for a larger number and greater variety of events. We also face significant and increasing competition from companies that sell self-ticketing systems, as well as from venues that choose to integrate self-ticketing systems into their
existing operations or acquire primary ticketing service providers. Our main competitors for online event sites include Tickets.com, as well as secondary ticketing companies such as Stubhub.







In the artist management and services business, we compete with other artist managers both
at large talent representation companies, such as CAA and William Morris Endeavor Entertainment, as well as smaller artist management companies and individuals. In the artist services business, we compete with companies typically only involved in
one or a few of the services we provide. Some of these competitors include Bill Young Productions and Bravado.

Our main
competitors at the local market level for sponsorships include local sports teams, which often offer state of the art venues and strong local media packages. Additionally, our competitors locally can include festivals, theme parks and other local
events. On the national level, our competitors include the major sports leagues that all sell sponsorships combined with significant national media packages.

Government Regulations

We are subject to federal, state and local laws,
both domestically and internationally, governing matters such as construction, renovation and operation of our venues, as well as:



•licensing, permitting and zoning, including noise ordinances;



•human health, safety and sanitation requirements;



•the service of food and alcoholic beverages;



•working conditions, labor, minimum wage and hour, citizenship and employment laws;



•compliance with ADA and DDA;



•compliance with U.S. FCPA and similar regulations in other countries;



•sales and other taxes and withholding of taxes;



•privacy laws and protection of personally identifiable information;



•historic landmark rules; and



•environmental protection.

We believe that we are in material compliance with these laws. The regulations relating to our food service in our venues are many and complex. A variety of regulations at various governmental levels
relating to the handling, preparation and serving of food, the cleanliness of food production facilities and the hygiene of food-handling personnel are enforced primarily at the local public health department level.

We also must comply with applicable licensing laws, as well as state and local service laws, commonly called dram shop statutes. Dram
shop statutes generally prohibit serving alcoholic beverages to certain persons such as an individual who is intoxicated or a minor. If we violate dram shop laws, we may be liable to third parties for the acts of the customer. Although we generally
hire outside vendors to provide these services at our larger operated venues and regularly sponsor training programs designed to minimize the likelihood of such a situation, we cannot guarantee that intoxicated or minor customers will not be served
or that liability for their acts will not be imposed on us.

We are also required to comply with the ADA, the DDA and certain
state statutes and local ordinances that, among other things, require that places of public accommodation, including both existing and newly constructed venues, be accessible to customers with disabilities. The ADA and DDA require that venues be
constructed to permit persons with disabilities full use of a live entertainment venue. The ADA and DDA may also require that certain modifications be made to existing venues in order to make them accessible to customers and employees who are
disabled. In order to comply with the ADA, DDA and other similar ordinances, we may face substantial capital expenditures in the future.

We are required to comply with the laws of the countries we operate in and also the U.S. FCPA regarding anti-bribery regulations. These regulations make it illegal for us to pay or promise to pay money or
anything of value to any government official for the purpose of directly or indirectly obtaining or retaining business. This ban on illegal payments and bribes also applies to agents or intermediaries who use funds for purposes prohibited by the
statute.

We are required to comply with federal, state and international laws regarding privacy and the storing, sharing,
use, disclosure and protection of personally identifiable information and user data. Specifically, personally identifiable information is increasingly subject to legislation and regulations in numerous jurisdictions around the world, the intent of
which is to protect the privacy of personal information that is collected, processed and transmitted in or from the governing jurisdiction.







From time to time, governmental bodies have proposed legislation that could have an effect
on our business. For example, some legislatures have proposed laws in the past that would impose potential liability on us and other promoters and producers of live music events for entertainment taxes and for incidents that occur at our events,
particularly relating to drugs and alcohol.

In addition, we and our venues are subject to extensive environmental laws and
regulations relating to the use, storage, disposal, emission and release of hazardous and non-hazardous substances, as well as zoning and noise level restrictions which may affect, among other things, the hours of operations of our venues.

Intellectual Property

We create, own and distribute intellectual property worldwide. It is our practice to protect our trademarks, brands, copyrights, patents and other original and acquired works, ancillary goods and
services. Our trademarks include, among others, the word marks “Live Nation,” “Ticketmaster,” “House of Blues” and “The Fillmore,” as well as the Live Nation, Ticketmaster, House of Blues, and The Fillmore
logos. We have registered our most significant trademarks in many foreign countries. We believe that our trademarks and other proprietary rights have significant value and are important to our brand-building efforts and the marketing of our
services. We cannot predict, however, whether steps taken by us to protect our proprietary rights will be adequate to prevent misappropriation of these rights.

Employees

As of December 31, 2010, we had approximately 6,500
full-time employees, including 4,100 domestic and 2,400 international employees, of which approximately 6,350 were employed in our operations departments and approximately 150 were employed in our corporate group.
