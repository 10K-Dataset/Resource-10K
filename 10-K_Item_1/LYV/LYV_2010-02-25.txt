ITEM 1.BUSINESS

Our Company

We believe that we are the largest producer of live music concerts in the world, based on total attendance at Live
Nation events as compared to events of other promoters, producing nearly 22,000 concerts for 2,000 artists in 42 countries during 2009. In 2009, over 52 million fans attended Live Nation concerts and the Company drove over 70 million
unique visitors towww.livenation.comand our other online properties. Globally, Live Nation owns, operates, has booking rights for and/or has an equity interest in 142 venues, includingHouse of Blues®music venues and prestigious locations such asThe Fillmorein San Francisco, the Hollywood Palladium,
the Heineken Music Hall in Amsterdam and the O2Dublin.

On February 10, 2009, we entered into a merger agreement with Ticketmaster. The Merger closed on January 25,
2010 and, pursuant to the merger agreement, Ticketmaster became our wholly owned subsidiary. For more information about Ticketmaster, please see Item 1 of Ticketmaster’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2009,
which Ticketmaster will file with the SEC, and the description under the heading “Information About Ticketmaster Entertainment’s Business” in our Registration Statement on Form S-4 declared effective on November 6, 2009, which we
have filed with the SEC and is incorporated by reference into this Annual Report.

On February 1, 2010, LMC Events, LLC,
a wholly owned subsidiary of Liberty Media, filed a Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO, or the Schedule TO, with the SEC to purchase up to 34,200,000 shares of our common stock at a purchase price of $12.00 net per share in cash, or the Tender
Offer. For more information about the Tender Offer, please see the Schedule TO and our Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9 filed with the SEC on February 12, 2010.

Our principal executive offices are located at 9348 Civic Center Drive, Beverly Hills, California 90210 (telephone: 310-867-7000). Our
principal website iswww.livenation.com. Live Nation is listed on the New York Stock Exchange, trading under the symbol “LYV”.

Our Strategy

Our strategy is to connect the artist to the fan. We believe that this focus will enable us to
increase stockholder value by developing new ancillary revenue streams around the live music event and the artist themselves. We will continue to focus on our live music assets and we plan to expand our business through building a stronger
connection with the fan through the live event and our online ticketing activities. We will seek to connect corporate sponsors with this fan through the live music experience. We will continue to execute on this strategy through pursuing the
objectives listed below.







•Improve the Profitability of Our Existing Core Business. We continue to focus on improving the profitability of our existing core live music
operations by implementing strategies to increase ancillary sales per fan at all events and at all venues we operate in, as well as continually striving to reduce the marketing and operating costs of an event.



•Extend Relationships with Artists and Sponsors. Our goal is to develop deeper relationships with touring artists centered on the live music
event. We are able to expand our relationship with the artist through longer-term and broader relationships by providing more services and partnering with the artist to grow their music properties. We believe that we can expand the business lines
related to the live music event, such as the sale of tour merchandise and live concert DVDs or downloads, as well as providing other products and services to fans and artists both before and after the concert, including the development of artist fan
clubs and websites. We also believe that we have an opportunity to expand our relationship with corporate sponsors by providing strategic programs that deliver more value to the sponsor through our unique relationship to the music fan and to the
artist and by utilizing our distribution network of venues and our extensive online presence.



•Expand Ticketing and Online Services. Our goal is to have a direct relationship with the music fan through ticketing and to be the leading
online live music destination website throughwww.livenation.com. Our website offers comprehensive information about live concerts, including shows that are not Live Nation promoted events, and access to tickets and artist merchandise. We
seek to continue to drive the growth of our website by expanding our online offering to increase traffic and generating incremental revenue from additional ticket sales, merchandise sales, online advertising and other goods and services.



•Increase Our Global Live Music Platform. We plan to selectively expand our promoter presence to include the top music markets and population
centers around the world. As of December 31, 2009, we operated in 19 countries. Our focus internationally is on increasing our promoter presence. We intend to expand our North American platform in key larger markets through ownership or
operation of key venues and by growing our festival presence.



•Divest Non-Core Assets. We are focused on building our live music business and ancillary services in major music markets around the world. As a
result, we expect, where it is economically justifiable, to continue to divest non-live music related assets and/or underperforming live music assets and use the net proceeds to re-invest in our core live music business, repay outstanding
indebtedness or for general corporate purposes.

In order to achieve our objectives and successfully
implement our strategies, we have made, and expect to continue to pursue, investments, acquisitions and divestitures that contribute to the above goals where the valuations, returns and growth potential are consistent with our long-term goal of
increasing stockholder value.

Our Assets

We believe we have a unique portfolio of assets that is unmatched in the live music industry.



•Fans. During 2009, our events and venues were attended by over 52 million live music fans. Our database provides us with the means to
efficiently market our shows to these fans as well as offer them other music-related products and services. This database is an invaluable asset that we are able to use to service our artists and corporate clients.



•Artists. We have extensive relationships with artists ranging from those acts that are just beginning their careers to superstars. In 2009, we
promoted shows or tours for approximately 2,000 artists globally. We believe our artist relationships are a competitive advantage and will help us pursue our strategy to develop additional ancillary revenue streams around the live music event and
the artists themselves.



•Online Services and Ticketing. Our primary online website,www.livenation.com, is designed to promote ticket sales for live events and to
disseminate event and related merchandise information online. Through this site, we sell tickets to our owned and/or operated venues in North America currently using an established ticketing software system that we have licensed and operate on
hardware we own.



•Distribution Network. We believe that our global distribution network of promoters, venues and festivals provides us with a strong position in
the live music industry. We believe we have one of the largest global networks of music promoters in the world, with offices in 28 cities in North America and a total of 19 countries worldwide. In addition, we own, operate, have booking rights
and/or have an equity interest in 142 venues located across seven countries as of the end of 2009, making us, we believe, the second largest operator of music venues in the world. We also believe that we produce one of the largest networks of music
festivals in the world with almost 30 festivals globally.





•Sponsors. We employed a sales force of approximately 200 people that worked with over 800 sponsors during 2009, through a combination of local
venue related deals and national deals, both in North America and internationally. Our sponsors include some of the most well-recognized national and global brands including O2, Blackberry and Citi®.







•Employees. At December 31, 2009, we employed approximately 4,300 full-time employees who are dedicated to providing first-class service to
our artists, fans and corporate sponsors. Many of our employees have decades of experience in promoting and producing live concerts, as well as operating live music venues.

Our History

We were formed
through acquisitions of various entertainment businesses and assets by our predecessors. In August 2005, we were incorporated in our current form as a Delaware corporation to own substantially all of the entertainment business of Clear Channel. In
December 2005, the separation of the business previously conducted by Clear Channel’s live entertainment segment and sports representation business, and the distribution by Clear Channel of all of our common stock to its stockholders, was
completed in a tax-free spin-off. Following our separation from Clear Channel, we became a separate publicly traded company on the New York Stock Exchange trading under the symbol “LYV”. As of January 25, 2010, in connection with our
merger with Ticketmaster, we changed our name from Live Nation, Inc. to Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.

Our Industry

The live music industry includes concert promotion and/or production. According toPollstar, North American gross concert revenue
increased from $3.9 billion in 2007 to $4.6 billion in 2009, a compound annual growth rate of approximately 9%. Excluding the impact of acquisitions, in the 2007 to 2009 period, our North American Music and International Music revenue, comprised
primarily of gross concert-related revenue, increased from $3.6 billion to $4.0 billion, a compound annual growth rate of 6%. We believe the industry growth was primarily due to increasing ticket prices for top-grossing acts and the desire of these
acts, such as U2 and Madonna, to tour; however, our growth was impacted by a decline in the number of events and attendance in North American Music.

Typically, to initiate live music events or tours, booking agents directly contract with performers to represent them for defined periods. Booking agents then contact promoters, who will contract with
them or directly with performers to arrange events. Booking agents generally receive fixed or percentage fees from performers for their services. Promoters earn revenue primarily from the sale of tickets. Performers are paid by the promoter under
one of several different formulas, which may include fixed guarantees and/or a percentage of ticket sales or event profits. In addition, promoters may also reimburse performers for certain costs of production, such as sound and lights. Under
guaranteed payment formulas, promoters assume the risks of unprofitable events. Promoters may renegotiate lower guarantees or cancel events because of insufficient ticket sales in order to reduce their losses. Promoters can also reduce the risk of
losses by entering into global or national touring agreements with performers and including the right to offset lower performing shows against higher performing shows on the tour in the determination of overall artist fees.

For music tours, one to four months typically elapse between booking performers and the first performances. Promoters, in conjunction with
performers, managers and booking agents, set ticket prices and advertise events. Promoters market events, sell tickets, rent or otherwise provide venues and arrange for local production services, such as stages and sets.

Venue operators typically contract with promoters to rent their venues for specific events on specific dates. Venue operators provide
services such as concessions, parking, security, ushering and ticket-taking, and receive some or all of the revenue from concessions, merchandise, sponsorships, parking and premium seats. For the events they host, venue operators typically receive
fixed fees or percentages of ticket sales, as well as percentages of total concession sales from the concessionaire and percentages of total merchandise sales from the merchandisers.

Ticketing services include the sale of tickets primarily through online channels but also through phone, outlet and box office channels.
Ticketing companies will contract with venues and/or promoters to sell tickets to events over a period of time, generally three to five years. The ticketing company does not set ticket prices or seating charts for events as this information is given
to them by the venue and/or promoter in charge of the event. The ticketing company generally gets paid a fixed fee per ticket sold or a percentage of the total ticket service charges. Venues will often also sell tickets through a local box office at
the venue using the ticketing company’s technology; on these box office tickets, the ticketing company will generally not earn a fee. The ticketing company receives the cash for the ticket sales and related service charges at the time the
ticket is sold and periodically remits these receipts to the venue and/or promoter after deducting their fee. As ticket purchases increase, related ticketing costs generally decrease.

Our Business

We operate in three reportable business segments: North
American Music, International Music and Ticketing. Prior to 2009, the Company reported an Artist Nation segment, which is now allocated between the North American Music and International Music segments. Information related to these operating
segments and other operations for 2009, 2008 and 2007 is included in Note 18—Segment Data in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.







North American Music.Our North American Music segment principally involves the
promotion of live music events in our owned and/or operated venues and in rented third-party venues and the operation and management of music venues primarily in the United States and Canada, as well as providing various services to artists. During
2009, our North American Music business generated approximately $2.6 billion, or 61.4%, of our total revenue. We promoted approximately 9,500 North American live music events in 2009, including artists such as U2, Jonas Brothers and Nickelback.
While our North American Music segment operates year-round, we experience higher revenue during the second and third quarters due to the seasonal nature of shows at our outdoor amphitheaters, which primarily occur May through September.

As a promoter, we typically book performers, arrange performances and tours, secure venues, provide for third-party production services,
sell tickets and advertise events to attract audiences. We earn revenue primarily from the sale of tickets and pay performers under one of several formulas, including a fixed guaranteed amount and/or a percentage of ticket sales or event profits.
For each event, we either use a venue we own and/or operate, or rent a third-party venue. Revenues are generally related to the number of events, volume of ticket sales and ticket prices. Event costs such as artist and production service expenses
are included in direct operating expenses and are typically substantial in relation to the revenue. As a result, significant increases or decreases in promotion revenue do not typically result in comparable changes to operating income.

As a venue operator, we contract with promoters, including our own, to rent our venues for events and provide operational services such
as concessions, merchandising, parking, security, ushering and ticket-taking. We generate revenue primarily from the sale of food and beverages, parking, premium seating, rental income, venue sponsorships and ticket rebates or service charges earned
on tickets sold through phone, outlet and internet by third parties under our ticketing agreements or through our internal ticketing operations for events we promote at our venues. In our amphitheaters, the sale of food and beverages is outsourced
and we receive a share of the net revenue from the concessionaire which is recorded in revenue with no significant direct operating expenses associated with it. Revenue generated from venue operations typically have a higher margin than promotion
revenue and therefore typically have a more direct relationship to operating income.

We believe that we
have a unique opportunity to connect the music fan to corporate sponsors and therefore seek to optimize this relationship through the development of strategic sponsorship programs. We continue to also pursue the sale of national and local
sponsorships and placement of advertising, including signage and promotional programs. Many of our venues have venue naming rights sponsorship programs. We believe national sponsorships allow us to maximize our network of venues and to arrange
multi-venue branding opportunities for advertisers. Our national sponsorship programs include companies such as Citi®and BlackBerry. Our local and venue-focused sponsorships include venue signage, promotional programs, on-site activation, hospitality and tickets, and are derived from a variety of companies across various industry categories.

International Music.Our International Music segment principally involves the promotion of live music events in our owned and/or
operated venues and in rented third-party venues, the production of music festivals and the operation and management of music venues outside of North America. For 2009, our International Music business generated approximately $1.5 billion, or 36.7%,
of our total revenue. We promoted and/or produced nearly 4,400 live music events internationally in 2009, including artists such as U2, Madonna, AC/DC, Coldplay and Depeche Mode, as well as several large festivals in Europe, such asRock
Werchterin Belgium,Lowlandsin the Netherlands, andReadingandLeeds, both in the United Kingdom. While our International Music segment operates year-round, we experience higher revenue during the second and third
quarters due to the seasonal nature of our international festivals, which primarily occur June through August.

As a promoter,
we typically book performers, arrange performances and tours, secure venues, provide for third-party production services, sell tickets and advertise events to attract audiences. We earn revenue primarily from the sale of tickets and pay performers
under one of several formulas, including a fixed guaranteed amount and/or a percentage of ticket sales or event profits. For each event, we either use a venue we own and/or operate, or rent a third-party venue. Revenues are generally related to the
number of events, volume of ticket sales and ticket prices. Event costs such as artist and production service expenses are included in direct operating expenses and are typically substantial in relation to the revenue. As a result, significant
increases or decreases in promotion revenue do not typically result in comparable changes to operating income.

As a venue
operator, we contract with promoters to rent our venues for events and provide operational services such as concessions, merchandising, security, ushering and ticket-taking. We generate revenue primarily from rental income, the sale of food and
beverages, venue sponsorships and ticket rebates earned on tickets sold through phone, outlet and internet by third parties under our ticketing agreements for events we promote. Revenue generated from venue operations typically have a higher margin
than promotion revenue and therefore typically have a more direct relationship to operating income.

Ticketing.Our
Ticketing segment principally involves the management of our ticketing operations and online and wireless distribution activities, including the continued enhancement of our primary website,www.livenation.com, in addition to management of
our information technology operations in North America. During 2009, our Ticketing business generated approximately $74 million, or 1.8% of our total revenue. Through all of our ticketing services, we sold 12.6 million tickets in 2009 in North
America, excluding 2.5 million tickets sold at our venue box offices. Our Ticketing segment sells tickets primarily for events at our owned and/or operated venues in North America.







This segment derives the majority of its revenue from service charges earned on tickets sold
through our internal ticketing operations and from sponsorships. During 2009, the tickets sold by this segment primarily represented those tickets at our owned and/or operated venues in North America. Ticketing pays our North American Music segment
a ticket rebate equivalent to the amount that they would have received had the ticket been sold by an outside ticketing agency. The remainder of the service charge is retained by Ticketing.

Other.For 2009, our other businesses generated approximately $5 million, or 0.1%, of our total revenue.

2009 Acquisitions

Brand
New Live. In February 2009, we acquired a 51.0% interest in Brand New Live. Brand New Live is a concert promotion company in the Netherlands.

Pleasure PAAS Party and Pleasure Magazine.In February 2009, we acquired event and magazine assets in the Netherlands for the Pleasure PAAS Party, which is an indoor Latin/Salsa event, and the
associated monthly Pleasure magazine.

Tecjet.In March 2009, we acquired a 77.5% interest in Tecjet. Tecjet was
acquired by AMG which is owned through the Company’s joint venture with Gaiety Investments. Tecjet holds the lease for a venue in Scotland. Our effective ownership percentage in Tecjet is 21.7%.

Parcolimpico. In November 2009, we acquired a 70% interest in Parcolimpico. Parcolimpico was acquired by Get Live 2, a newly formed
joint venture in which we hold a 10% controlling interest. Parcolimpico manages venues and facilities in Turin, Italy. Our effective ownership percentage in Parcolimpico is 7%.

2009 Divestitures

Consistent with our strategy to focus on our core live
music business, we continued to divest of certain assets during 2009.

Etix. In June 2009, we sold our 20% equity
interest in Etix, a web-based ticketing service provider.

Boston venues. In September 2009, we sold the Boston Opera
House, a non-core operational asset, along with rights under the Orpheum Theatre management agreement and a leasehold interest in Paradise Rock Club. All of these venues were located in Boston.

Dominion. In October 2009, we sold our 33% equity interest in Dominion, a U.K. theatrical company involved in venue operations.

United Kingdom theater business. In October 2009, we sold our remaining theatrical venues and operations in the United
Kingdom including two theaters in London’s West End, the Lyceum Theatre and the Apollo Victoria, and 14 regional theaters located throughout the United Kingdom.

MLK. In December 2009, we sold our 20% equity interest in MLK, a German music company involved in the promotion of live entertainment events.

Live Nation Venue Details

In the live entertainment industry, venues generally consist of:



•Stadiums—Stadiums are multi-purpose facilities, often housing local sports teams. Stadiums typically have 30,000 or more seats. Although
they are the largest venues available for live music, they are not specifically designed for live music. At December 31, 2009, we did not own or lease any stadiums, although we may rent them for certain events.



•Amphitheaters—Amphitheaters are generally outdoor venues with between 5,000 and 30,000 seats that are used primarily in the summer season.
We believe they are popular because they are designed specifically for concert events, with premium seat packages and better lines of sight and acoustics. At December 31, 2009, we owned eight, leased 29, operated six and had booking rights for
eight amphitheaters located in North America.



•Arenas—Arenas are indoor venues that are used as multi-purpose facilities, often housing local sports teams. Arenas typically have between
5,000 and 20,000 seats. Because they are indoors, they are able to offer amenities that other similar-sized outdoor venues cannot, such as luxury suites and premium club memberships. As a result, we believe they







have become increasingly popular for higher-priced concerts aimed at audiences willing to pay for these amenities. At December 31, 2009, we owned one, leased two, operated four and had
booking rights for three arenas located in the United Kingdom, Ireland, The Netherlands and North America.



•Music Theaters—Music theaters are indoor venues that are built primarily for music events. These venues typically have a capacity between
1,000 and 6,500. Because these venues have a smaller capacity than an amphitheater, they do not offer as much economic upside on a per show basis. However, because music theaters can be used year-round, unlike most amphitheaters, they can generate
annual profits similar to those of an amphitheater. Music theaters represent less risk to concert promoters because they have lower fixed costs associated with hosting a concert and may provide a more appropriately-sized venue for developing artists
and more artists in general. At December 31, 2009, we owned seven, leased 26, operated two, had booking rights for ten and an equity interest in one music theater located in North America, the United Kingdom and Sweden.



•Clubs—Clubs are indoor venues that are built primarily for music events but may also include comedy clubs. These venues typically have a
capacity of less than 1,000 and often without full fixed seating. Because of their small size, they do not offer as much economic upside, but they also represent less risk to a concert promoter because they have lower fixed costs associated with
hosting a concert and also may provide a more appropriate size venue for developing artists. Clubs can also be used year-round and can therefore generate higher profits for the year, even though per show profits are lower. At December 31, 2009,
we owned three, leased seven and had booking rights for eight clubs in North America and the United Kingdom.



•House of Blues—House of Blues venues are indoor venues that offer customers an integrated live music and dining experience. The live music
halls are specially designed to provide optimum acoustics and typically can accommodate between 1,000 to 2,000 guests. A full-service restaurant and bar is located adjacent to the live music hall. We believe that the high quality of the food,
service and atmosphere in our restaurants attracts customers to these venues independently from an entertainment event, and generates a significant amount of repeat business from local customers. At December 31, 2009, we owned two and leased
ten House of Blues venues located in North America. One of the House of Blues venues is comprised of two buildings where we own one and lease the other. We have included this venue as an owned venue.



•Festival Sites—Festival sites are outdoor locations used primarily in the summer season to stage day-long or multi-day concert events
featuring several performers. Depending on the location, festival site capacities can range from 10,000 to 120,000. We believe they are popular because of the value provided to the fan by packaging several performers for a full-day or multi-day
event. While festival sites only host a few events each year, they can provide higher operating income because they have lower costs associated with producing the event and maintaining the site. At December 31, 2009, we owned four festival
sites located in North America and the United Kingdom.



•Theatrical Theaters—Theatrical theaters are generally indoor venues that are built specifically for theatrical events, with substantial
aesthetic and acoustic consideration. These venues typically have less than 5,000 seats. Additionally, given their size, they are able to host events aimed at niche audiences. At December 31, 2009, we leased one theatrical theater located in
North America.

Competition

Competition in the live music and ticketing industries is intense. We believe that we compete primarily on the basis of our ability to
deliver quality music products, sell tickets and provide enhanced fan and artist experiences. We believe that our primary strengths include:



•the quality of service delivered to our artists, fans and corporate sponsors;



•our track record in promoting and producing live music events and tours both domestically and internationally;



•artist relationships;



•ticketing services;



•distribution platform (venues);



•the scope and effectiveness in our expertise of marketing and sponsorship programs; and



•our financial stability.

Although we believe that our products and services currently compete favorably with respect to such factors, we cannot provide any assurance that we can maintain our competitive position against current
and potential competitors, especially those with significantly greater brand recognition, financial, marketing, service, support, technical and other resources.

In the markets in which we promote music concerts, we face competition from promoters and venue operators. We believe that barriers to entry into the promotion services business are low and that certain
local promoters are increasingly expanding the geographic scope of their operations.

Our main competitors in the live music
industry include Anschutz Entertainment Group, C3 Presents, MSG Entertainment, Jam Productions and Palace Sports & Entertainment, in addition to numerous smaller regional companies and various casinos in North America and Europe. Anschutz
Entertainment Group operates under a number of different names including AEG Live, Concerts West and The Messina Group. Some of our competitors in the live music industry have a stronger presence in certain markets, have access to other sports and
entertainment venues, and have greater financial resources, which may enable them to gain a greater competitive advantage in relation to us.

In markets where we own and/or operate a venue, we compete with other venues to serve artists likely to perform in that general region. Consequently, touring artists have significant alternatives to our
venues in scheduling tours. Our main competitors in venue management include SMG and Anschutz Entertainment Group, in addition to numerous smaller regional companies and various casinos in North America and Europe. Some of our competitors in venue
management have a greater number of venues in certain markets as well as greater financial resources in those markets.

Our
main competitors at the local market level for sponsorships consist of local sports teams, which often offer state of the art venues and strong local media packages. Additionally, our competitors locally can include festivals, theme parks and other
local events. On the national level, our competitors include the major sports leagues that all sell sponsorships combined with significant national media packages.







The ticketing services industry includes the sale of tickets primarily through online
channels but also through phone, outlet and box office channels. As online ticket purchases increase, related ticketing costs generally decrease, which has made it easier for technology-based companies to offer primary ticketing services and
standalone, automated ticketing systems that enable venues to perform their own ticketing services or utilize self-ticketing systems. In the online environment, we compete with other websites, online event sites and ticketing companies to provide
event information, sell tickets and provide other online services such as fan clubs and artist websites.

We experience
competition from other national, regional and local primary ticketing service providers to secure new venues and to reach fans for events. The advent of online commerce has also contributed to the growth of resale ticketing services and the
consolidation of the resale industry, which historically had been more fragmented and consisted of a significant number of local resellers with limited inventory selling through traditional storefronts. The internet has allowed fans and other ticket
resellers to reach a vastly larger audience through the aggregation of inventory on online resale websites and marketplaces, and has provided consumers with more convenient access to tickets for a larger number and greater variety of events. We also
face significant and increasing competition from companies that sell self-ticketing systems, as well as from venues that choose to integrate self-ticketing systems into their existing operations or acquire primary ticketing service providers. Our
main competitors for online event sites include Tickets.com, as well as secondary ticketing companies such as Stubhub.

Government
Regulations

We are subject to federal, state and local laws, both domestically and internationally, governing matters such
as construction, renovation and operation of our venues, as well as:



•licensing, permitting and zoning, including noise ordinances;



•human health, safety and sanitation requirements;



•the service of food and alcoholic beverages;



•working conditions, labor, minimum wage and hour, citizenship and employment laws;



•compliance with ADA and the United Kingdom’s Disability Discrimination Act 1995;



•sales and other taxes and withholding of taxes;



•privacy laws and protection of personally identifiable information;



•historic landmark rules; and



•environmental protection.

We believe that our venues are in material compliance with these laws. The regulations relating to our food service in our venues are many and complex. A variety of regulations at various governmental
levels relating to the handling, preparation and serving of food, the cleanliness of food production facilities and the hygiene of food-handling personnel are enforced primarily at the local public health department level.

We also must comply with applicable licensing laws, as well as state and local service laws, commonly called dram shop statutes. Dram shop
statutes generally prohibit serving alcoholic beverages to certain persons such as an individual who is intoxicated or a minor. If we violate dram shop laws, we may be liable to third parties for the acts of the customer. Although we generally hire
outside vendors to provide these services at our larger operated venues and regularly sponsor training programs designed to minimize the likelihood of such a situation, we cannot guarantee that intoxicated or minor customers will not be served or
that liability for their acts will not be imposed on us.

We are also required to comply with the ADA, the DDA and certain
state statutes and local ordinances that, among other things, require that places of public accommodation, including both existing and newly constructed venues, be accessible to customers with disabilities. The ADA and DDA require that venues be
constructed to permit persons with disabilities full use of a live entertainment venue. The ADA and DDA may also require that certain modifications be made to existing venues in order to make them accessible to customers and employees who are
disabled. In order to comply with the ADA, DDA and other similar ordinances, we may face substantial capital expenditures in the future.

We are required to comply with federal, state and international laws regarding privacy and the storing, sharing, use, disclosure and protection of personally identifiable information and user data.
Specifically, personally identifiable information is increasingly subject to legislation and regulations in numerous jurisdictions around the world, the intent of which is to protect the privacy of personal information that is collected, processed
and transmitted in or from the governing jurisdiction.







From time to time, governmental bodies have proposed legislation that could have an effect
on our business. For example, some legislatures have proposed laws in the past that would impose potential liability on us and other promoters and producers of live music events for entertainment taxes and for incidents that occur at our events,
particularly relating to drugs and alcohol.

In addition, we and our venues are subject to extensive environmental laws and
regulations relating to the use, storage, disposal, emission and release of hazardous and non-hazardous substances, as well as zoning and noise level restrictions which may affect, among other things, the hours of operations of our venues.

Intellectual Property

We create, own and distribute intellectual property worldwide. It is our practice to protect our trademarks, brands, copyrights, patents and other original and acquired works, ancillary goods and
services. Our trademarks include, among others, the word marks “Live Nation,” “House of Blues” and “The Fillmore,” as well as the Live Nation, House of Blues, and The Fillmore logos. We have registered our most
significant trademarks in many foreign countries. We believe that our trademarks and other proprietary rights have significant value and are important to our brand-building efforts and the marketing of our services. We cannot predict, however,
whether steps taken by us to protect our proprietary rights will be adequate to prevent misappropriation of these rights.

Employees

As of December 31, 2009, we had approximately 4,300 full-time employees, including 3,200 domestic and 1,100 international
employees, of which approximately 4,200 were employed in our operations departments and approximately 100 were employed in our corporate area.
