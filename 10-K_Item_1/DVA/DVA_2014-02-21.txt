U.S. dialysis and related lab services business

Our U.S. dialysis and related lab services business is a leading provider of kidney dialysis services for patients suffering from chronic
kidney failure or ESRD. As of December 31, 2013, we provided dialysis and administrative services in the U.S. through a network of 2,074 outpatient dialysis centers in 45 states and the District of Columbia, serving a total of approximately
163,000 patients. We also provide acute inpatient dialysis services in approximately 1,000 hospitals and related laboratory services throughout the U.S. Our U.S. dialysis and related lab services business accounted for approximately 66% of our 2013
consolidated net revenues. All references in this document to dialysis and related lab services refer only to our U.S. dialysis and related lab services business.

HealthCare Partners business

HCP is a patient- and
physician-focused integrated health care delivery and management company with nearly three decades of experience providing coordinated, outcomes-based medical care in a cost-effective manner. Through capitation contracts with some of the
nation’s leading health plans, as of December 31, 2013, HCP had approximately 764,000 members under its care in southern California, central and south Florida, southern Nevada, central New Mexico and central Arizona. Of these,
approximately 265,000 individuals were patients enrolled in Medicare Advantage. The remaining approximately 499,000 individuals were managed care members whose health coverage is provided through their employer or who have individually acquired
health coverage directly from a health plan or as a result of their eligibility for Medicaid benefits. In addition to its managed care business, during the year ended December 31, 2013, HCP provided care in all markets, except Arizona, to over
472,000 patients whose health coverage is structured on a fee-for-service (FFS) basis, including patients enrolled through traditional Medicare and Medicaid programs, preferred provider organizations and other third-party payors.







The patients of HCP’s associated physicians, physician groups and independent practice
associations (IPAs) benefit from an integrated approach to medical care that places the physician at the center of patient care. As of December 31, 2013, HCP delivered services to its members via a network of over 3,000 associated group and
other network primary care physicians, 204 network hospitals, and several thousand associated group and network specialists. Together with hundreds of case managers, registered nurses and other care coordinators, these medical professionals utilize
a comprehensive information technology system, sophisticated risk management techniques and clinical protocols to provide high-quality, cost-effective care to HCP’s members.

Ancillary services and strategic initiatives businesses

As of December 31, 2013, our ancillary services and strategic initiatives consisted primarily of pharmacy services, disease
management services, vascular access services, ESRD clinical research, physician services, direct primary care and our international dialysis operations. Our ancillary services and strategic initiatives, including our international operations
accounted for approximately 7% of our consolidated net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2013, and relate primarily to our core business of providing kidney care services.

The dialysis and related lab services business

Industry overview

The loss of kidney function is normally irreversible. Kidney failure is typically caused by Type I and Type II
diabetes, high blood pressure, polycystic kidney disease, long-term autoimmune attack on the kidney and prolonged urinary tract obstruction. ESRD is the stage of advanced kidney impairment that requires continued dialysis treatments or a kidney
transplant to sustain life. Dialysis is the removal of toxins, fluids and salt from the blood of patients by artificial means. Patients suffering from ESRD generally require dialysis at least three times a week for the rest of their lives.

According to United States Renal Data System, there were approximately 430,000 ESRD dialysis patients in the U.S. in 2011 and
the underlying ESRD dialysis patient population has grown at an approximate compound rate of 4.0% from 2000 to 2011, the latest period for which such data is available. The growth rate is attributable to the aging of the population, increased
incidence rates for diseases that cause kidney failure such as diabetes and hypertension, lower mortality rates for dialysis patients and growth rates of minority populations with higher than average incidence rates of ESRD.

Since 1972, the federal government has provided health care coverage for ESRD patients under the Medicare ESRD program regardless of age
or financial circumstances. ESRD is the first and only disease state eligible for Medicare coverage both for dialysis and dialysis-related services and for all benefits available under the Medicare program. For patients with Medicare coverage, all
ESRD payments for dialysis treatments are made under a single bundled payment rate. See page 5 for further details.

Although
Medicare reimbursement limits the allowable charge per treatment, it provides industry participants with a relatively predictable and recurring revenue stream for dialysis services provided to patients without commercial insurance. For the year
ended December 31, 2013, approximately 90% of our total dialysis patients were covered under some form of government-based programs, with approximately 79% of our dialysis patients covered under Medicare and Medicare-assigned plans.

Treatment options for ESRD

Treatment options for ESRD are dialysis and kidney transplantation.







Dialysis options



•Hemodialysis

Hemodialysis, the most common form of ESRD treatment, is usually performed at a freestanding outpatient dialysis center, at a hospital-based outpatient center, or at the patient’s home. The
hemodialysis machine uses an artificial kidney, called a dialyzer, to remove toxins, fluids and salt from the patient’s blood. The dialysis process occurs across a semi-permeable membrane that divides the dialyzer into two distinct chambers.
While blood is circulated through one chamber, a pre-mixed fluid is circulated through the other chamber. The toxins, salt and excess fluids from the blood cross the membrane into the fluid, allowing cleansed blood to return back into the
patient’s body. Each hemodialysis treatment that occurs in the outpatient dialysis centers typically lasts approximately three and one-half hours and is usually performed three times per week.

Hospital inpatient hemodialysis services are required for patients with acute kidney failure primarily resulting from trauma, patients in
early stages of ESRD and ESRD patients who require hospitalization for other reasons. Hospital inpatient hemodialysis is generally performed at the patient’s bedside or in a dedicated treatment room in the hospital, as needed.

Some ESRD patients who are healthier and more independent may perform home-based hemodialysis in their home or residence through the use
of a hemodialysis machine designed specifically for home therapy that is portable, smaller and easier to use. Patients receive training, support and monitoring from registered nurses, usually in our outpatient dialysis centers, in connection with
their dialysis treatment. Home-based hemodialysis is typically performed with greater frequency than dialysis treatments performed in outpatient dialysis centers and on varying schedules.



•Peritoneal dialysis

Peritoneal dialysis uses the patient’s peritoneal or abdominal cavity to eliminate fluid and toxins and is typically performed at home. The most common methods of peritoneal dialysis are continuous
ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD), and continuous cycling peritoneal dialysis (CCPD). Because it does not involve going to an outpatient dialysis center three times a week for treatment, peritoneal dialysis is an alternative to hemodialysis for
patients who are healthier, more independent and desire more flexibility in their lifestyle. However, peritoneal dialysis is not a suitable method of treatment for many patients, including patients who are unable to perform the necessary procedures
and those at greater risk of peritoneal infection.

CAPD introduces dialysis solution into the patient’s peritoneal
cavity through a surgically placed catheter. Toxins in the blood continuously cross the peritoneal membrane into the dialysis solution. After several hours, the patient drains the used dialysis solution and replaces it with fresh solution. This
procedure is usually repeated four times per day.

CCPD is performed in a manner similar to CAPD, but uses a mechanical device
to cycle dialysis solution through the patient’s peritoneal cavity while the patient is sleeping or at rest.



•Kidney transplantation

Although kidney transplantation, when successful, is generally the most desirable form of therapeutic intervention, the shortage of suitable donors, side effects of immunosuppressive pharmaceuticals given
to transplant recipients and dangers associated with transplant surgery for some patient populations limit the use of this treatment option.

Dialysis and related lab services we provide

Outpatient
hemodialysis services

As of December 31, 2013, we operated or provided administrative services through a network of
2,074 outpatient dialysis centers in the U.S. that are designed specifically for outpatient hemodialysis. In 2013, our







overall network of U.S. outpatient dialysis centers increased by 120 primarily as a result of acquisitions and the opening of new dialysis centers, net of center closures and divestitures,
representing a total increase of approximately 6.1% from 2012.

As a condition of our enrollment in Medicare for the provision
of dialysis services, we contract with a nephrologist or a group of associated nephrologists to provide medical director services at each of our dialysis centers. In addition, other nephrologists may apply for practice privileges to treat their
patients at our centers. Each center has an administrator, typically a registered nurse, who supervises the day-to-day operations of the center and its staff. The staff of each center typically consists of registered nurses, licensed practical or
vocational nurses, patient care technicians, a social worker, a registered dietician, biomedical technician support and other administrative and support personnel.

Under Medicare regulations, we cannot promote, develop or maintain any kind of contractual relationship with our patients that would directly or indirectly obligate a patient to use or continue to use our
dialysis services, or that would give us any preferential rights other than those related to collecting payments for our dialysis services. Our total patient turnover which is based upon all causes averaged approximately 26% in 2013 and 30% in 2012.
However, in 2013, the overall number of patients to whom we provided services in the U.S. increased by approximately 6% from 2012, primarily from the opening of new dialysis centers and acquisitions, continued growth within the industry and lower
mortality rates.

Hospital inpatient hemodialysis services

As of December 31, 2013, we provided hospital inpatient hemodialysis services, excluding physician services, to patients in
approximately 1,000 hospitals throughout the U.S. We render these services based on a contracted per-treatment fee that is individually negotiated with each hospital. When a hospital requests our services, we typically administer the dialysis
treatment at the patient’s bedside or in a dedicated treatment room in the hospital, as needed. In 2013, hospital inpatient hemodialysis services accounted for approximately 4.5% of our total U.S. dialysis treatments.

Home-based hemodialysis services

Many of our outpatient dialysis centers offer certain support services for dialysis patients who prefer and are able to perform either home-based hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis in their homes.
Home-based hemodialysis support services consist of providing equipment and supplies, training, patient monitoring, on-call support services and follow-up assistance. Registered nurses train patients and their families or other caregivers to perform
either home-based hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis.

ESRD laboratory services

We own two separately incorporated, licensed, clinical laboratories which specialize in ESRD patient testing. These specialized
laboratories provide routine laboratory tests for dialysis and other physician-prescribed laboratory tests for ESRD patients and are an integral component of overall dialysis services that we provide. Our laboratories provide these tests
predominantly for our network of ESRD patients throughout the U.S. These tests are performed to monitor a patient’s ESRD condition, including the adequacy of dialysis, as well as other medical conditions of the patient. Our laboratories utilize
information systems which provide information to certain members of the dialysis centers’ staff and medical directors regarding critical outcome indicators.

Management services

We currently operate or provide management and
administrative services to 29 outpatient dialysis centers located in the U.S. in which we either own a minority equity investment or are wholly-owned by third parties. These services are provided pursuant to management and administrative services
agreements. Management fees are established by contract and are recognized as earned typically based on a percentage of revenues or cash collections generated by the outpatient dialysis centers.







Quality care

We employ 235 clinical service teammates in our dialysis and related lab services business. The primary focus of this group is assuring
and facilitating processes that aim to achieve superior clinical outcomes at our centers.

Our physician leadership in the
Office of the Chief Medical Officer (OCMO) for our dialysis and related lab services business includes nine senior nephrologists, led by our Chief Medical Officer, with a variety of academic, clinical practice, and clinical research backgrounds. Our
Physician Council is an advisory body to senior management. The Physician Counsel is currently composed of eight physicians with extensive experience in clinical practice in addition to the members of OCMO and currently eight Group Medical
Directors.

Sources of revenue—concentrations and risks

Our U.S. dialysis and related lab services business net revenues represent approximately 66% of our consolidated net revenues for the year
ended December 31, 2013. Our dialysis and related lab services revenues are derived primarily from our core business of providing kidney dialysis services, the administration of pharmaceuticals, related laboratory services and to a lesser
extent management fees generated from providing management and administrative services to certain outpatient dialysis centers, as discussed above.

The sources of our dialysis and related lab services revenues are principally from government-based programs, including Medicare and Medicare-assigned plans, Medicaid and Medicaid-assigned plans and
commercial insurance plans.

Medicare revenue

For patients with Medicare coverage, all ESRD payments for dialysis treatments are made under a single bundled
payment rate which provides a fixed payment rate to encompass all goods and services provided during the dialysis treatment, including certain pharmaceuticals that were historically separately reimbursed to the dialysis providers, such as Epogen®(EPO), vitamin D analogs and iron supplements, irrespective of the level of







pharmaceuticals administered to the patient or additional services performed. Most lab services that used to be paid directly to laboratories are also included in the bundled payment. The bundled
payment rate is also adjusted for certain patient characteristics, a geographic usage index and certain other factors.

An
important provision in the law is an annual adjustment, or market basket update, to the ESRD Prospective Payment System base rate (PPS). Absent action by Congress, the PPS base rate is automatically updated annually by a formulaic inflation
adjustment.

On November 9, 2012, CMS issued the final ESRD PPS rule for 2013 (2013 ESRD Rule). The base rate was
increased by 2.3%, resulting from a market basket increase of 2.9% less a productivity adjustment of 0.6%. This increase in the ESRD PPS base rate was largely offset by the Budget Control Act of 2011 (BCA) sequestration as discussed below. The 2013
ESRD Rule implemented the reduction in bad debt payments to dialysis facilities (as well as to all other providers that are eligible for bad debt payments) mandated under the Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012 and added new quality
reporting measures.

As a result of the BCA and subsequent activity in Congress, a $1.2 trillion sequester (across-the-board
spending cuts) in discretionary programs took effect in 2013. In particular, a 2% reduction in Medicare payments took effect on April 1, 2013. The across-the-board spending cuts pursuant to the sequestration have adversely affected and will
continue to adversely affect operating results.

Section 632(a) of the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 (ATRA)
mandated that the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) reduce dialysis payments beginning in January 2014 to reflect the Secretary’s estimate of changes in patient utilization data from 2007 to 2012 for erythropoiesis stimulating agents
(ESAs), other drugs and biologicals that would have been paid for separately under the composite rate system, and laboratory services that would have been paid for separately under the composite rate system. According to ATRA, the Secretary of HHS
had to use the most recently available data on average sales prices and changes in prices for drugs and biologicals reflected in the ESRD market basket percentage increase factor.

The final 2014 ESRD PPS rule (2014 ESRD Rule) was formally published by CMS on December 2, 2013. According to the 2014 ESRD Rule,
drug utilization cuts mandated by ATRA of 12% will be phased in over a three or four year period depending upon future decisions to be made by CMS. The 2014 ESRD Rule provides that there will be no changes to reimbursement levels for 2014 and 2015,
largely due to an offset from a market basket increase. While no net reimbursement reductions are planned for 2014 and 2015 under the 2014 ESRD Rule, it is anticipated that future reductions will occur in 2016, 2017 or both. If these future
reductions are implemented as currently anticipated they could negatively affect our operating results.

We anticipate that we
will continue to experience increases in our operating costs in 2014 that will outpace any Medicare reimbursement rate changes that we receive, which could significantly impact our operating results. We expect to continue experiencing increases
in operating costs that are subject to inflation, such as labor and supply costs, regardless of whether there is a compensating inflation-based increase in Medicare payment rates or in payments under the bundled payment rate system.

The CMS Center for Medicare & Medicaid Innovation (Innovation Center) is currently working with various healthcare providers to
develop and implement accountable care organizations (ACOs) and other innovative models of care for Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries. We are currently uncertain of the extent to which these models of care, including ACOs, Bundled Payments for
Care Improvement Initiative, Comprehensive ESRD Care Model (which includes the development of ESRD Seamless Care Organizations (ESCOs)), the Comprehensive Primary Care Initiative, the Duals Demonstration, or other models, will impact the health care
market. Our U.S. dialysis business may choose to participate in one or several of these models either as a partner with other providers or independently. We are currently seeking to participate in the Comprehensive ESRD Care Model with the
Innovation Center. Even if we do not participate in this or other programs, some of our patients may be assigned to a program, in which case the quality and cost of care that we furnish will be







included in an ACO’s or other program’s calculations. As new models of care emerge, we may be at risk for losing our Medicare patient base, which would have a materially adverse effect
on our operating results. Other initiatives in the government or private sector may arise, including the development of models similar to ACOs, IPAs and integrated delivery systems or evolutions of those concepts which could adversely impact our
business.

In addition, under ESRD PPS, beginning January 1, 2016, oral-only medications will be included in the bundled
ESRD payment rate to dialysis centers. Inadequate pricing could have a significant negative financial impact on our dialysis facilities given the volume and value of these drugs.

ESRD patients receiving dialysis services become eligible for primary Medicare coverage at various times, depending on their age or
disability status, as well as whether they are covered by a commercial insurance plan. Generally, for a patient not covered by a commercial insurance plan, Medicare becomes the primary payor for ESRD patients receiving dialysis services either
immediately or after a three-month waiting period. For a patient covered by a commercial insurance plan, Medicare generally becomes the primary payor after 33 months, which includes a three month waiting period, or earlier if the patient’s
commercial insurance plan coverage terminates. When Medicare becomes the primary payor, the payment rate we receive for that patient shifts from the commercial insurance plan rate to the Medicare payment rate.

Medicare pays 80% of the amount set by the Medicare system for each covered dialysis treatment. The patient is responsible for the
remaining 20%. In most cases, a secondary payor, such as Medicare supplemental insurance, a state Medicaid program or a commercial health plan, covers all or part of these balances. Some patients, who do not qualify for Medicaid but otherwise cannot
afford secondary insurance, can apply for premium payment assistance from charitable organizations through a program offered by the American Kidney Fund. We and other dialysis providers support the American Kidney Fund and similar programs through
voluntary contributions. If a patient does not have secondary insurance coverage, we are generally unsuccessful in our efforts to collect from the patient the remaining 20% portion of the ESRD composite rate that Medicare does not pay. However, we
are able to recover some portion of this unpaid patient balance from Medicare through an established cost reporting process by identifying these Medicare bad debts on each center’s Medicare cost report.

Medicaid revenue

Medicaid programs are state-administered programs partially funded by the federal government. These programs are intended to provide health coverage for patients whose income and assets fall below
state-defined levels and who are otherwise uninsured. These programs also serve as supplemental insurance programs for co-insurance payments due from Medicaid-eligible patients with primary coverage under the Medicare program. Some Medicaid programs
also pay for additional services, including some oral medications that are not covered by Medicare. We are enrolled in the Medicaid programs in the states in which we conduct our business.

Commercial revenue

Before a patient becomes eligible to have Medicare as their primary payor for dialysis services, a patient’s commercial insurance plan, if any, is responsible for payment of such dialysis services.
Although commercial payment rates vary, average commercial payment rates are generally significantly higher than Medicare rates. The payments we receive from commercial payors generate nearly all of our profits. Payment methods from commercial
payors can include a single lump-sum per treatment, referred to as bundled rates, or in other cases separate payments for treatments and pharmaceuticals, if used as part of the treatment, referred to as FFS rates. Commercial payment rates are the
result of negotiations between us and insurers or third-party administrators. Our out-of-network payment rates are on average higher than in-network payment rates. In 2013, we continued to enter into some commercial contracts, covering certain
patients that will primarily pay us a single bundled payment rate for all dialysis services provided to these patients. However, some of the contracts will pay us for certain other services and pharmaceuticals in addition to the bundled payment.
These contracts typically contain







annual price escalator provisions. We are continuously in the process of negotiating agreements with our commercial payors and if our negotiations result in overall commercial rate reductions in
excess of our commercial rate increases, our revenues and operating results could be negatively impacted. In addition, if there is an increase in job losses in the U.S., or depending upon changes to the healthcare regulatory system including the
impact of health care insurance exchanges, we could experience a decrease in the number of patients covered under commercial insurance plans.

Approximately 34% of our dialysis and related lab services revenues and approximately 10% of our dialysis patients were associated with commercial payors for the year ended December 31, 2013.
Commercial patients as a percentage of our total dialysis patients remained approximately 10% in 2013 and 2012. Less than 1% of our dialysis and related lab services revenues are due directly from patients. No single commercial payor accounted for
more than 10% of total dialysis and related lab services revenues for the year ended December 31, 2013.

In March 2012,
HHS issued two final rules related to the establishment of health care insurance exchanges that began operating in January 2014. These exchanges will provide a marketplace for eligible individuals and small employers to purchase health care
insurance and a Notice of Benefit and Payment Parameters for 2014. We believe the establishment of health care insurance exchanges could result in a reduction in patients covered by commercial insurance or an increase of patients covered through the
health care insurance exchanges under more restrictive commercial plans with lower reimbursement rates. To the extent that the implementation of such exchanges results in a reduction in patients covered by commercial insurance or a reduction in
reimbursement rates for our services from commercial and/or government payors, this could have a material impact on our operating results.

Revenue from EPO and other pharmaceuticals

The percentage of revenue that
we generate from separately billable pharmaceuticals as a result of operating under Medicare’s single bundled payment rate system continues to decline, since pharmaceuticals, including EPO, are included in the ESRD single bundled payment. In
addition, a significant percentage of our payor contracts covering commercial patients also pay us under a single bundled rate for all dialysis services provided to these patients. Approximately 5% of our total dialysis and related lab services
revenues for the year ended December 31, 2013 are associated with the administration of separately-billable physician-prescribed pharmaceuticals.

EPO is an ESA, a genetically-engineered form of a naturally occurring protein that stimulates the production of red blood cells. EPO is used in connection with all forms of dialysis to treat anemia, a
medical complication most ESRD patients experience. The administration of EPO, where separately billable, accounted for approximately 3% of our dialysis and related lab services revenues for the year ended December 31, 2013. EPO is produced by
a single manufacturer, Amgen. Any interruption of supply or product cost increases could adversely affect our operations.

In
December 2012, we entered into an amendment to our agreement with Amgen. Under the terms of the original agreement before the amendment, we were required to purchase EPO in amounts necessary to meet no less than 90% of our requirements of ESAs and
are still required to do so after 2013. In addition, all of the other conditions specified in the original agreement entered into in November 2011 still apply.

Evaluations on the utilization and reimbursement for ESAs, which have occurred in the past and may occur in the future, and related actions by the U.S. Congress and federal agencies, could result in
further restrictions on the utilization and reimbursement for ESAs. Additionally, commercial payors have also increasingly examined their administration policies for EPO and, in some cases, have modified those policies. Changes in labeling of EPO
and other pharmaceuticals in a manner that alters physician practice patterns or accepted clinical practices, changes in private and governmental payment criteria, including the introduction of EPO administration policies or the conversion to
alternate types of administration of EPO or other pharmaceuticals that result in further







decreases in utilization of EPO for patients covered by commercial payors could have a material impact on our operating results. Further increased utilization of EPO for patients for whom the
cost of EPO is included in a bundled reimbursement rate, or further decreases in reimbursement for EPO and other pharmaceuticals that are not included in a bundled reimbursement rate, could also have a material impact on our operating results.

Physician relationships

An ESRD patient generally seeks treatment at an outpatient dialysis center near his or her home where his or her treating nephrologist has practice privileges. Our relationships with local nephrologists
and our ability to meet their needs and the needs of their patients are key factors in the success of our dialysis operations. Approximately 4,800 nephrologists currently refer patients to our outpatient dialysis centers. As is typical in the
dialysis industry, one or a few physicians, including the outpatient dialysis center’s medical director, usually account for all or a significant portion of an outpatient dialysis center’s patient base.

Participation in the Medicare ESRD program requires that dialysis services at an outpatient dialysis center be under the general
supervision of a medical director who is a licensed physician. We have engaged physicians or groups of physicians to serve as medical directors for each of our outpatient dialysis centers. At some outpatient dialysis centers, we also separately
contract with one or more other physicians to serve as assistant or associate medical directors or to direct specific programs, such as home dialysis training programs. We have approximately 900 individual physicians and physician groups under
contract to provide medical director services.

Medical directors for our dialysis centers enter into written contracts with
us that specify their duties and fix their compensation generally for periods of ten years. The compensation of our medical directors is the result of arm’s length negotiations and generally depends upon an analysis of various factors such as
the physician’s duties, responsibilities, professional qualifications and experience, among others.

Our medical director
contracts for our dialysis centers generally include covenants not to compete. Also, when we acquire an outpatient dialysis center from one or more physicians or where one or more physicians own minority interests in our outpatient dialysis centers,
these physicians have agreed to refrain from owning interests in other competing outpatient dialysis centers within a defined geographic area for various time periods. These non-compete agreements restrict the physicians from owning or providing
medical director services to other outpatient dialysis centers, but do not prohibit the physicians from referring patients to any outpatient dialysis center, including competing centers. Many of these non-compete agreements continue for a period of
time beyond expiration of the corresponding medical director agreements, although some expire at the same time as the medical director agreement. Occasionally, we experience competition from a new outpatient dialysis center established by a former
medical director following the termination of his or her relationship with us.

If a significant number of physicians,
including an outpatient dialysis center’s medical directors, were to cease referring patients to our outpatient dialysis centers, our business could be adversely affected.

Government regulation

Our dialysis operations are subject to extensive federal, state and local governmental regulations. These regulations require us to meet various standards relating to, among other things, government
payment programs, dialysis facilities and equipment, management of centers, personnel qualifications, maintenance of proper records, and quality assurance programs and patient care.

Because we are subject to a number of governmental regulations, our business could be adversely impacted by:



•Loss or suspension of federal certifications;



•Loss or suspension of licenses under the laws of any state or governmental authority from which we generate substantial revenues;







•Exclusion from government healthcare programs, including Medicare and Medicaid;



•Significant reductions or lack of inflation-adjusted increases in payment rates or reduction of coverage for dialysis and ancillary services and
related pharmaceuticals;



•Fines, damages and monetary penalties for anti-kickback law violations, Stark Law violations, submission of false claims, civil or criminal liability
based on violations of law or other failures to meet regulatory requirements;



•Claims for monetary damages from patients who believe their protected health information (PHI) has been used or disclosed in violation of federal and
state patient privacy laws;



•Mandated changes to our practices or procedures that significantly increase operating expenses; or



•Refunds of payments received from government payors and government health care program beneficiaries because of any failures to meet applicable
requirements.

We expect that our industry will continue to be subject to substantial regulation, the scope
and effect of which are difficult to predict. Our activities could be reviewed or challenged by regulatory authorities at any time in the future. This regulation and scrutiny could have a material adverse impact on us.

Licensure and certification

Our dialysis centers are certified by CMS, as is required for the receipt of Medicare payments. In some states, our outpatient dialysis centers also are required to secure additional state licenses and
permits. Governmental authorities, primarily state departments of health, periodically inspect our centers to determine if we satisfy applicable federal and state standards and requirements, including the conditions of participation in the Medicare
ESRD program.

To date, we have not experienced significant difficulty in maintaining our licenses or our Medicaid
certifications. However, we have experienced some delays in obtaining Medicare certifications from CMS.

CMS continues to
study the regulations applicable to Medicare certification to provide dialysis services. On April 15, 2008, CMS issued new regulations for Medicare-certified ESRD facilities to provide dialysis services, referred to as Conditions for Coverage.
The Conditions for Coverage were effective October 14, 2008, with some provisions having a phased in implementation date of February 1, 2009. The regulations are patient, quality and outcome focused. Among other things, they establish
performance expectations for facilities and staff, eliminate certain procedural requirements, and promote continuous quality improvement and patient safety measures. We have established an interdisciplinary work group that includes a comprehensive
auditing process to monitor our continued compliance with the Conditions for Coverage.

Federal anti-kickback statute

The federal anti-kickback statute contained in the Social Security Act imposes criminal and civil sanctions on persons who
receive, make, offer or solicit payments in return for:



•The referral of a patient covered by Medicare, Medicaid or similar federal and state programs;



•The ordering or purchasing of items or services that are paid for in whole or in part by Medicare, Medicaid or similar federal and state programs; or



•Arranging for or recommending the ordering or purchasing of such items.

Federal criminal penalties for the violation of the federal anti-kickback statute include imprisonment, fines and exclusion of the
provider from future participation in the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Violations of the federal anti-kickback statute are punishable by imprisonment for up to five years and fines of up to $25,000 or both. Larger fines can be imposed upon
corporations under the provisions of the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and







the Alternate Fines Statute. Individuals and entities convicted of violating the federal anti-kickback statute are subject to mandatory exclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid and
other federal healthcare programs for a minimum of five years. Civil penalties for violation of this law include up to $50,000 in monetary penalties per violation, repayments of up to three times the total payments between the parties and suspension
from future participation in Medicare and Medicaid. Court decisions have also held that the statute is violated whenever one of the purposes of remuneration is to induce referrals. The Health Reform Acts amended the federal anti-kickback statute to
lower the standard of proof for the intent requirement that the government must make in order to obtain a conviction. The government does not have to prove that the defendant knew of the existence of the federal anti-kickback statute or had the
specific intent to violate it. In addition, the Health Reform Acts amended the federal anti-kickback statute to provide that any claims submitted from an arrangement that violates the federal anti-kickback statute are false claims under the False
Claims Act.

Regulations issued by HHS create exceptions or “safe harbors” for some business transactions and
arrangements. Transactions and arrangements structured within these safe harbors are deemed to not violate the federal anti-kickback statute. A business transaction or arrangement must satisfy every element of a safe harbor to be protected by that
safe harbor. Transactions and arrangements that do not satisfy all elements of a relevant safe harbor do not necessarily violate the statute, but can be subject to greater scrutiny by enforcement agencies.

Our medical directors refer patients to our dialysis centers, and these arrangements, by which we pay them for their medical director
services, must be in compliance with the federal anti-kickback statute in order to avoid scrutiny under the statute. Among the available safe harbors is one for personal services furnished for fair market value. However, most of our agreements with
our medical directors do not satisfy all seven of the requirements of the personal services safe harbor. We believe that because of the nature of our medical directors’ duties, it is impossible to satisfy the anti-kickback safe-harbor
requirement that services provided under an agreement on a part-time basis must specify the schedule of intervals of service, and their precise length and the exact charge for such intervals. Accordingly, while we believe that our agreements with
our medical directors for our dialysis centers satisfy as many of the elements of this safe harbor as we believe is reasonably possible, our arrangements do not qualify for safe harbor protection, as precise scheduling is not possible. We also note
that there is little guidance available as to what constitutes fair market value for medical director services. We believe that our agreements do not violate the federal anti-kickback statute; however, since the arrangements do not satisfy all of
the requirements for safe harbor protection, these arrangements could be challenged.

We own a controlling interest in
numerous U.S. dialysis related joint ventures. For the year ended December 31, 2013, these joint ventures represented approximately 21% of our dialysis and related lab services revenues. We may continue to increase the number of our joint
ventures. Our relationships with physicians and other referral sources relating to these joint ventures must comply with a federal anti-kickback statute safe harbor in order to avoid scrutiny under the statute. Although there is a safe harbor for
certain investment interests in small entities, our joint ventures do not satisfy all of the requirements for safe harbor protection. Under the federal anti-kickback statute, failure to comply with a safe harbor does not render an arrangement
illegal. Instead, an arrangement that does not operate within a safe harbor may be subject to anti kickback statute scrutiny on a case-by-case basis. Based upon the foregoing, physician joint ventures that fall outside the safe harbors are not, by
definition, prohibited by law. Instead, such joint ventures require case-by-case evaluation under the federal anti-kickback statute.

We have structured our joint ventures to satisfy as many safe harbor requirements as we believe are commercially reasonable. For example, we believe that these investments are offered on a fair market
value basis and provide returns to the physician investors only in proportion to their actual investment in the venture. We believe that our joint venture arrangements do not violate the federal anti-kickback statute; however, since the arrangements
do not satisfy all of the requirements for safe harbor protection, these arrangements could be subject to challenge. In that regard, we have been advised by the attorneys conducting the 2010 and 2011 U.S. Attorney Physician Relationship
Investigations that they believe that some or all of our joint ventures do not comply with the federal anti-kickback statute and the False Claims Act. We disagree that our joint venture







structure, which we believe is widely used in the dialysis industry and other segments of the healthcare industry substantially in the form that we use it, violates the federal anti-kickback
statute or the False Claims Act. However, we have recently agreed with the United States Attorney’s Office for the District of Colorado, the Civil Division of the United States Department of Justice and the Office of the Inspector General to a
framework for a global resolution for both the 2010 and 2011 U.S. Attorney Physician Relationship Investigations, which includes unwinding a limited subset of joint ventures that were created through partial divestiture to nephrologists, and our
agreement to not enter into this type of partial divestiture joint venture with nephrologists in the future. The final settlement remains subject to negotiation of specific terms.

As of December 31, 2013, we lease space for approximately 702 of our dialysis centers from entities in which physicians, hospitals
or medical groups hold ownership interests and we sublease space to referring physicians at approximately 233 of our dialysis centers. These arrangements must comply with a federal anti-kickback statute safe harbor in order to avoid scrutiny under
the statute. We believe that we meet the elements of the safe harbor for space rentals in all material respects. Therefore, we believe that our physician lease arrangements should not be subject to scrutiny or challenge under the federal
anti-kickback statute.

Some medical directors and other referring physicians may own our common stock. We believe that these
interests materially satisfy the requirements of the safe harbor for investments in large publicly traded companies for the federal anti-kickback statute. Therefore, we believe that these investment arrangements should not be subject to scrutiny or
challenge under the federal anti-kickback statute.

Because we are purchasing and selling items and services in the operation
of our dialysis centers that may be paid for, in whole or in part, by Medicare, Medicaid or other federal or state healthcare program and because we acquire certain items and services at a discount, we must structure these arrangements in compliance
with a federal anti-kickback statute safe harbor in order to avoid scrutiny under the statute. Subject to certain requirements and limitations, discounts representing reductions in the amounts we are charged for items or services based on
arm’s-length transactions can qualify for safe harbor protection if we fully and accurately report the discounts in the applicable Medicare cost reports. While some of the safe harbor criteria are subject to interpretation, we believe that our
vendor contracts with discount provisions are in compliance with the federal anti-kickback statute discount safe harbor. Therefore, we believe that our discounted vendor contracts should not be subject to scrutiny or challenge under the federal
anti-kickback statute.

Stark Law

CMS has adopted implementing regulations under the Stark Law, (collectively, known as the Stark Regulations). CMS has not yet adopted implementing regulations regarding application of the Stark Law to
Medicaid, but has indicated that it anticipates issuing additional regulations regarding the application of the Stark Law to Medicaid referrals.







The definition of DHS under the Stark Law excludes services paid under a composite rate,
even if some of the components bundled in the composite rate are DHS. Although the new ESRD bundled payment system is no longer titled a composite rate, we believe that the former composite rate payment system and the current bundled system are both
composite systems excluded from the Stark Law. Since most services furnished to Medicare beneficiaries provided in our dialysis centers are reimbursed through a composite or bundled rate, the services performed in our facilities generally are not
DHS, and the Stark Law referral prohibition does not apply to those services. The definition of DHS also excludes inpatient dialysis performed in hospitals that are not certified to provide ESRD services. Consequently, our arrangements with such
hospitals for the provision of dialysis services to hospital inpatients do not trigger the Stark Law referral prohibition.

In addition, although prescription drugs are DHS, there is an exception in the Stark Regulations for EPO and other specifically enumerated dialysis drugs when furnished in or by an ESRD facility, in
compliance with the federal anti-kickback statute and applicable billing requirements. The exception is available only for drugs included on a list of CPT/HCPCS codes published by CMS, and in the case of home dialysis, the exception applies only to
EPO, Aranesp®and equivalent drugs dispensed by the facility for use at home. While we believe that most drugs
furnished by our dialysis centers are covered by the exception, dialysis centers may administer drugs that are not on the list of CPT/HCPCS codes and therefore do not meet this exception. In order for a physician who has a financial relationship
with a dialysis center to order one of these drugs from the center and for the center to obtain Medicare reimbursement, another exception must apply.

We have entered into several types of financial relationships with referring physicians, including compensation arrangements. We believe that the compensation arrangements under our medical director
agreements satisfy the personal services arrangement exception to the Stark Law. While we believe that the compensation provisions included in our medical director agreements, which are the result of arm’s length negotiations, result in fair
market value payments for medical director services, an enforcement agency could nevertheless challenge the level of compensation that we pay our medical directors. If the arrangement does not meet a Stark Law exception, we could in the future be
required to change our practices, face civil penalties, pay substantial fines, return certain payments received from Medicare and beneficiaries or otherwise experience a material adverse effect as a result of a challenge to payments made pursuant to
referrals from these physicians under the Stark Law.

Some of our dialysis centers are leased from entities in which referring
physicians hold interests and we sublease space to referring physicians at some of our dialysis centers. The Stark Law provides an exception for lease arrangements if specific requirements are met. We believe that our leases and subleases with
referring physicians satisfy the requirements for this exception.

Some medical directors and other referring physicians may
own our common stock. We believe that these interests satisfy the Stark Law exception for investments in large publicly traded companies.

Some of our referring physicians also own equity interests in entities that operate our dialysis centers. None of the Stark Law exceptions applicable to physician ownership interests in entities to which
they make DHS referrals apply to the kinds of ownership arrangements that referring physicians hold in several of our subsidiaries that operate dialysis centers. Accordingly, these dialysis centers cannot bill Medicare for DHS referrals from
physician owners. If the dialysis centers bill for DHS referred by physician owners, the dialysis center would be subject to the Stark Law penalties described above.

While we believe that most of our operations do not implicate the Stark Law, particularly under the ESRD bundled payment system, and that to the extent that our dialysis centers furnish DHS, they either
meet an exception or do not bill for services that do not meet a Stark Law exception, if CMS determined that we have submitted claims in violation to the Stark Law, we would be subject to the penalties described above. In addition, it might be
necessary to restructure existing compensation agreements with our medical directors and to repurchase or to request the sale of ownership interests in subsidiaries and partnerships held by referring physicians or, alternatively, to refuse to accept
referrals for DHS from these physicians. Any such penalties and restructuring could have a material adverse effect on our operations.







If any of the business transactions or arrangements, including those described above, were
found to violate the federal anti-kickback statute of Stark Law, we could face criminal, civil or administrative sanctions, including possible exclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other state and federal healthcare programs. Any
findings that we have violated these laws could have a material adverse impact on our operations.

Fraud and abuse under
state law

The
False Claims Act

The False Claims Act (FCA) is a means of policing false bills or false requests for payment in the
healthcare delivery system. In part, the FCA authorizes the imposition of up to three times the government’s damages and civil penalties on any person who:



•Knowingly presents or causes to be presented to the federal government, a false or fraudulent claim for payment or approval;



•Knowingly makes, uses or causes to be made or used, a false record or statement to get a false or fraudulent claim paid or approved by the federal
government;



•Conspires to defraud the federal government by getting a false or fraudulent claim allowed or paid; or



•Knowingly makes, uses or causes to be made or used, a false record or statement to conceal, avoid or decrease an obligation to pay or transmit money or
property to the federal government.

In addition, amendments to the FCA impose severe penalties for the
knowing and improper retention of overpayments collected from government payors. Within 60 days of identifying an overpayment, a provider is required to notify CMS or the Medicare Administrative Contractor of the overpayment and the reason for it
and return the overpayment. These amendments could subject our procedures for identifying and processing overpayments to greater scrutiny. We have made significant investments in additional resources to accelerate the time it takes to identify and
process overpayments and we may be required to make additional investments in the future. Acceleration in our ability to identify and process overpayments could result in us refunding overpayments to government or other payors sooner than we have in
the past. A significant acceleration of these refunds could have a material adverse affect on our operating cash flows.







The penalties for a violation of the FCA range from $5,500 to $11,000 for each false claim
plus three times the amount of damages caused by each such claim which generally means the amount received directly or indirectly from the government. The federal government has used the FCA to prosecute a wide variety of alleged false claims and
fraud allegedly perpetrated against Medicare and state healthcare programs, including coding errors, billing for services not rendered, the submission of false cost reports, billing for services at a higher payment rate than appropriate, billing
under a comprehensive code as well as under one or more component codes included in the comprehensive code and billing for care that is not considered medically necessary. The Health Reform Acts provide that a violation of the federal anti-kickback
statute can form the basis for liability under the FCA. Some courts have held that filing claims or failing to refund amounts collected in violation of the Stark Law can form the basis for liability under the FCA. In addition to the provisions of
the FCA, which provide for civil enforcement, the federal government can use several criminal statutes to prosecute persons who are alleged to have submitted false or fraudulent claims for payment to the federal government.

The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996

The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) of 1996 and its implementing privacy and security regulations, as amended
by the federal Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (HITECH Act), (collectively referred to as HIPAA), requires us to provide certain protections to patients and their health information under the Protected Health
Information, or PHI. HIPAA requires us to afford patients certain rights regarding their PHI, and to limit uses and disclosure of their PHI existing in any media form (electronic and hardcopy). HIPAA also requires us to implement administrative,
physical, and technical safeguards with respect to electronic PHI. We believe our HIPAA Privacy and Security Program sufficiently address HIPAA requirements. Penalties for impermissible use or disclosure of PHI were increased by the HITECH Act by
imposing tiered penalties of up to $50,000 per violation and up to $1.5 million per year for the same type of violation. In addition, if PHI of 500 or more individuals is improperly used or disclosed, we would be required to report the improper use
or disclosure to the Department of Health and Human Services, which would post the violation on its website. If there were improper use or disclosure of PHI of more than 500 individuals in the same jurisdiction, we would be required to report the
improper use or disclosure to the media. Improper use or disclosure could result in significant fines and reputational damage.

Healthcare reform

In March 2010, broad health care reform legislation was enacted in the U.S. Although many of the provisions of the legislation did not take effect immediately and continue to be implemented, and some may
be modified before being implemented, the reforms could have an impact on our business in a number of ways. We cannot predict how employers, private payors or persons buying insurance might react to these changes or what form many of these
regulations will take before implementation.

The law requires that all non-grandfathered individual and small group health
plans sold in a state, including plans sold through state exchanges, cover essential health benefits (EHBs) in ten general categories. The scope of the benefits are intended to equal the scope of benefits under a typical employer plan.

In December 2011, the Center for Consumer Information and Insurance Oversight published an Essential Health Benefits Bulletin (EHB
Bulletin) describing the approach it was taking regarding the implementation of the EHB Bulletin requirement. For the two year transition period (from 2014 through 2015) the law requires states to define an EHB benchmark plan that must be covered by
plans in the state. States that do not define an EHB benchmark plan must use the small group plan with the largest enrollment in the state.

On February 25, 2013, HHS issued the final rule governing the standards applicable to EHB Bulletins, new definitions, actuarial value requirements and methodology, and published a list of plan
benchmark options that states can use to develop EHBs. The rule describes specific coverage requirements that: (i) prohibit discrimination against individuals because of pre-existing or chronic conditions on health plans applicable to EHBs;
(ii) ensure network adequacy of essential health providers, and (iii) prohibit benefit designs that limit enrollment and that prohibit access to care for enrollees.







Other regulations

Our dialysis and related lab services operations are subject to various state hazardous waste and non-hazardous medical waste disposal
laws. These laws do not classify as hazardous most of the waste produced from dialysis services. Occupational Safety and Health Administration regulations require employers to provide workers who are occupationally subject to blood or other
potentially infectious materials with prescribed protections. These regulatory requirements apply to all healthcare facilities, including dialysis centers, and require employers to make a determination as to which employees may be exposed to blood
or other potentially infectious materials and to have in effect a written exposure control plan. In addition, employers are required to provide or employ hepatitis B vaccinations, personal protective equipment and other safety devices, infection
control training, post-exposure evaluation and follow-up, waste disposal techniques and procedures and work practice controls. Employers are also required to comply with various record-keeping requirements. We believe that we are in material
compliance with these laws and regulations.

A few states have certificate of need programs regulating the establishment or
expansion of healthcare facilities, including dialysis centers. We believe that we are in material compliance with all applicable state certificate of need laws.

Capacity and location of our U.S. dialysis centers

Typically we are
able to increase our capacity by extending hours at our existing dialysis centers, expanding our existing dialysis centers, relocating our dialysis centers, developing new dialysis centers and by acquiring dialysis centers. The development of a
typical outpatient dialysis center by us generally requires approximately $2.5 million for leasehold improvements, equipment and first-year working capital. Based on our experience, a new dialysis center typically opens within a year after the
property lease is signed, normally achieves operating profitability in the second year after Medicare certification and normally reaches maturity within three to five years. Acquiring an existing outpatient dialysis center requires a substantially
greater initial investment, but profitability and cash flows are generally initially more timely and predictable. To a limited extent, we enter into agreements to provide management and administrative services to outpatient dialysis centers in which
we either own a minority equity investment, or are wholly-owned by third parties in return for management fees, which are typically based on a percentage of revenues or cash collections of the managed center’s operations.

The table below shows the growth of our U.S. dialysis operations by number of dialysis centers.

management and administrative services to seven centers that are wholly-owned by third parties. The locations of the 2,045 U.S. outpatient dialysis centers consolidated in our financial statements at December 31, 2013 were as follows:

HealthCare Partners business

Industry overview

U.S. healthcare spending
has increased steadily over the past twenty years. These increases have been driven, in part, by the aging population of the baby boomer generation, lack of healthy lifestyle both in terms of exercise and diet, rapidly increasing costs in medical
technology and pharmaceutical research, and provider reimbursement structures that may promote volume over quality in a FFS environment. These factors, as well as the steady growth of the U.S. population, have made the healthcare industry a growing
market. In 2012, CMS reported that health care accounted for 17.2% of the U.S. economy. According to CMS, healthcare spending increased 3.7% to reach $2.8 trillion in 2012. Comprising an estimated 13% of the federal budget and more than one-fifth of
total national health expenditures in 2012, Medicare is frequently the focus of discussions on how to moderate the growth of both federal spending and health care spending in the U.S.

Growth in Medicare spending is expected to continue due to population demographics. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, from 1970
through 2012, the overall U.S. population grew 54% while the number of Medicare enrollees grew by more than 140% over that time period. As an increasing number of the baby boomers become eligible for Medicare, the senior market is expected to be 20%
of the total U.S. population by 2050 according to the Congressional Budget Office.

Medicare Advantage is an alternative to
the traditional FFS Medicare program, which permits Medicare beneficiaries to receive benefits from a managed care health plan. Medicare Advantage plans contract with CMS to provide benefits at least comparable to those offered under the traditional
FFS Medicare program in exchange for a fixed monthly premium payment per member from CMS. The monthly premium varies based on the county in which the member resides, as adjusted to reflect the plan members’ demographics and the members’
risk scores. Individuals who elect to participate in the Medicare Advantage program typically receive greater benefits than traditional FFS Medicare Part B beneficiaries, including additional preventive services, vision, dental and prescription drug
benefits, and typically have lower deductibles and co-payments than traditional FFS Medicare.







Managed care health plans were developed, primarily during the 1980s, in an attempt to
mitigate the rising cost of providing healthcare benefits to populations covered by traditional health insurance. These managed care health plans enroll members through their employers, under federal Medicare benefits or through state Medicaid
programs. As a result of the prevalence of these health plans, many seniors now becoming eligible for Medicare have been interacting with managed care companies through their employers for the last 30 years. Individuals turning 65 now are likely to
be far more familiar with the managed care setting than previous Medicare populations. According to the Kaiser Family Foundation, in 2013, Medicare Advantage represents only 28% of total Medicare members, creating a significant opportunity for
additional Medicare Advantage penetration of newly eligible seniors.

In an effort to reduce the number of uninsured and to
begin to control healthcare expenditures, President Obama signed The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (the Health Reform Acts) into law in March 2010, which
were affirmed, in substantial part, by the U.S. Supreme Court in June 2012. The Health Reform Acts provide for a reduction of up to 32 million uninsured individuals by 2019, while potentially increasing Medicaid coverage by up to
16 million individuals and net commercial coverage by 16 million individuals. CMS projects that the total number of uninsured Americans will fall to 23 million in 2021 from 47 million in 2011. These previously uninsured Americans
and potentially newly eligible Medicaid beneficiaries represent a significant new market opportunity for health plans. We believe that health plans looking to cover these newly eligible individuals under fixed premium arrangements will seek provider
arrangements that can effectively manage the cost and quality of the care being provided to these newly eligible individuals.

In 2006, Medicare began to pay Medicare Advantage health plans under a bidding process. Plans bid against county-level benchmarks
established by Medicare based on the prior year’s Medicare Advantage county payment rate and increased by the projected national growth rate in per capita Medicare spending. Those payment rates were at least as high as per capita FFS Medicare
spending in each county and often substantially higher because Congress set floors to raise the lowest rates to stimulate plan growth in areas where plans historically had not found it profitable to enter. If a plan’s bid is higher than the
benchmark, enrollees pay the difference in the form of a monthly premium. If the bid is lower than the benchmark, the Medicare program retains 25% of the difference as savings and the plan receives 75% of the difference as a rebate, which must be
returned to enrollees in the form of additional benefits or reduced premiums. Plan payments are also adjusted based on enrollees’ risk profiles. The formula for base payment is a combination of the base rate for the enrollee’s county of
residence, multiplied by the enrollee’s risk score.

One of the primary ways in which the Health Reform Acts will fund
increased health insurance coverage is through cuts in Medicare Advantage reimbursement. County benchmarks are transitioning to a system in which each county’s benchmark in 2017 will be a certain percentage (ranging from 95% to 115%) of FFS. In
a March 2013 report to Congress, the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission (MedPAC) estimated that 2013 Medicare Advantage benchmarks, bids, and payments would average 110%, 96%, and 104% of FFS spending, respectively.

Despite the fact that the plan bids average less than FFS spending, payments for enrollees in these plans usually exceed FFS spending
because the benchmarks are high relative to FFS spending. For example, HMOs as a group bid an average of 92% of FFS spending, yet 2013 payments for HMO enrollees are estimated to average 103% of FFS spending because the benchmarks, including the
quality bonuses, average 110% of FFS spending.

As a result of the above, plans would generally have to bid significantly
lower than FFS or the Medicare Advantage benchmark for CMS to begin to save money on Medicare Advantage. As result of the transition of county benchmarks to 95% to 115% of FFS, Medicare Advantage benchmarks on average are expected to be reduced to
parity with FFS by 2017 as compared to 110% of fee for-service today. Given that CMS will retain 25% of the difference of any plans bid below benchmark, the overall Medicare Advantage program should realize savings as compared to FFS in 2017, which
would result in lower payments to Medicare Advantage plans and to HCP.







Integrated medical systems, such as HCP, that have scale are positioned to spread an individual member’s cost experience across a
wider population and realize the benefits of pooling medical risk among large numbers of patients. In addition, integrated medical systems with years of managed care experience can utilize their sizeable medical experience data to identify specific
medical care and quality management strategies and interventions for potential high cost cases and aggressively manage them to improve the health of its population base and, thus, lower cost. Many integrated medical systems, like HCP, have also
established physician performance metrics that allow them to monitor quality and service outcomes achieved by participating physicians in order to reward efficient, high quality care delivered to members and initiate improvement efforts for
physicians whose results can be enhanced.

Healthcare reform

The U.S. healthcare system, including the Medicare Advantage program, is subject to a broad array of new laws and regulations as a result
of the Health Reform Acts. The Health Reform Acts are considered by some to be the most dramatic change to the U.S. healthcare system in decades. The Supreme Court found that the individual mandate to obtain health insurance coverage under
this legislation is constitutional and also found that the expanded Medicaid benefit included in the legislation is constitutional if states can opt out of the expanded Medicaid benefit without losing their funding under the current Medicaid
program. This legislation made significant changes to the Medicare program and to the health insurance market overall. The Health Reform Acts reflect sweeping legislation that, once fully implemented, may have a significant impact on the U.S.
health care system generally and the operations of HCP’s business. There are numerous steps required to implement the Health Reform Acts, and Congress may seek to alter or eliminate some of their provisions.

One provision of the Health Reform Acts required CMS to establish a Medicare Shared Savings Program (MSSP) that promotes accountability
and coordination of care through the creation of Accountable Care Organizations (ACOs). The program allows certain providers and suppliers (including hospitals, physicians and other designated professionals) to voluntarily form ACOs and work
together along with other ACO participants to invest in infrastructure and redesign delivery processes to achieve high quality and efficient delivery of services. HCP recently entered into an agreement with CMS to participate in the Medicare Shared
Savings Program in California, Florida and Nevada beginning in 2014. Under this program, HCP will strive to attain improved clinical outcomes to its Medicare fee for service patients in a more cost-effective manner, and will have the
opportunity to share with CMS in any financial savings created.







Payor environment

Government programs

HCP derives a significant portion of its revenues from services rendered to beneficiaries of Medicare (including Medicare Advantage), Medicaid, and other governmental healthcare programs.

Medicare.The Medicare program was established in 1965 and became effective in 1967 as a federally funded U.S. health
insurance program for persons aged 65 and older, and it was later expanded to include individuals with ESRD and certain disabled persons, regardless of income or age. Since its formation, Medicare has grown to a $560 billion program in 2011,
covering approximately 48 million Americans and, based on the growing number of eligible beneficiaries and increases in the cost of health care, CMS projects that Medicare program funding will grow to $1.1 trillion by 2022.

Initially, Medicare was offered only on a FFS basis. Under the Medicare FFS payment system, an individual can choose any licensed
physician enrolled in Medicare and use the services of any hospital, health care provider or facility certified by Medicare. CMS reimburses providers, based on a fee schedule, if Medicare covers the service and CMS considers it medically necessary.

FFS Medicare is paid according to a physician fee schedule (PFS) set each year by CMS in accordance with formulas mandated by
Congress. CMS is required to limit the growth in spending under the PFS by a predetermined sustained growth rate (SGR). If implemented as mandated, the SGR would result in significant payment reductions under the PFS. CMS announced that the
estimated PFS update for 2014 would be reduced by 24.4% due to the SGR formula. Every year since 2003, Congress has delayed application of the SGR but we cannot predict whether they will continue to do so. Congress most recently delayed application
of the SGR in the Pathway for SGR Reform Act (SGR Act) which was signed by President Obama on December 26, 2013. Pursuant to the SGR Act, the negative impact of the SGR is further delayed for a temporary 3-month period which began on
January 1, 2014. The SGR Act gives physicians a 0.5% reimbursement increase during the 3 month delay period. However, the SGR Act also extends a 2% Medicare sequestration cut mandated by the Budget Control Act of 2011 and the Sequestration
Transparency Act of 2012 for an additional two years beyond the original expiration date of 2021.

There is pressure for
Congress to implement a permanent solution to the SGR reductions. The House Committee on Way and Means and the Senate Committee of Finance released SGR repeal proposals in early November 2013, and the two committees have since met to revise their
respective bills. Although the original proposals each called for a 10-year freeze on Medicare physician payments, the most recent incarnation of the House bill provides a 0.5% update for 2014-2016. The current form of the Senate bill, however,
retains the full 10-year payment freeze. We cannot predict whether the SGR will be repealed or if another formula would be substituted and what form that might take. Repeal of the SGR could be offset by further reductions in Medicare payments.

As a result of the BCA and subsequent activity in Congress, a $1.2 trillion sequester (across-the-board spending cuts) in
discretionary programs took effect in 2013. In particular, a 2% reduction in Medicare payments took effect on April 1, 2013. The across-the-board spending cuts pursuant to the sequestration have adversely affected HCP and will continue to
adversely affect their operating results.

Medicare Advantage.Medicare Advantage is a Medicare health plan
program developed and administered by CMS as an alternative to the original FFS Medicare program. Under the Medicare Advantage program, Medicare beneficiaries may choose to receive benefits under a managed care health plan that provides benefits at
least comparable to those offered under the original Medicare FFS payment system in exchange for which the health plan receives a monthly per patient premium payment from CMS. The Medicare Advantage monthly premium varies based on the county in
which the member resides, and is adjusted to reflect the demographics and estimated risk profile of the members that enroll. Once a person is authorized by CMS to participate in







Medicare Advantage, health plans compete for enrollment based on benefit design differences such as co-payments or deductibles, availability of preventive care, attractiveness of and access to a
network of hospitals, physicians and ancillary providers and premium contribution or, most often in Medicare Advantage plans, the absence of any monthly premium. In certain parts of the country, many health plans that provide Medicare Advantage
benefits subcontract with integrated medical systems such as HCP to transfer the responsibility for managing patient care.

In
2004, CMS adopted a risk adjustment payment system for Medicare Advantage health plans in which the participating health plans’ premiums are adjusted based on the actual illness burden of the members that enroll. The model bases a portion of
the total CMS reimbursement payments on various clinical and demographic factors, including hospital inpatient diagnoses, additional diagnosis data from ambulatory treatment settings, hospital outpatient department and physician visits, gender, age
and Medicaid eligibility. CMS requires that all managed care companies capture, collect and submit the necessary diagnosis code information to CMS twice a year for reconciliation with CMS’s internal database. Medical providers, such as HCP,
provide this diagnosis code information to health plan customers for submission to CMS. Under this system, the risk-adjusted portion of the total CMS payment to the Medicare Advantage plans will equal the local rate set forth in the traditional
demographic rate book, adjusted to reflect the plan members’ gender, age and morbidity. See “—Governmental regulation” below.

Medicaid.







Commercial payors

According to the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, in 2009 approximately 61% of non-elderly U.S. citizens received their health care
benefits through their employer, which contracted with health plans to administer these health care benefits. Patients enrolled in health plans offered through an employment setting are generally referred to as commercial members. Nationally,
commercial employer-sponsored health plan enrollment was approximately 167 million as of 2011. Under the Health Reform Acts, beginning in 2014, many uninsured individuals and many individuals who receive their health insurance benefits through
small employers may purchase their health care benefits through insurance exchanges in which health plans compete directly for individual or small group members’ enrollment. HCP derives a significant amount of its enrollment from commercial
members; however, these members represent a disproportionately small share of HCP’s operating profits.

Whether in the
Medicare Advantage, commercial or Medicaid market, managed care health plans seek to provide a coordinated and efficient approach to managing the health care needs of their enrolled populations. By negotiating with providers, such as pharmacies,
hospitals and physicians, and indirectly trying to influence physicians’ behavior through various incentive and penalty schemes, managed care companies attempt to enhance their profitability by limiting their medical costs. These health plans
have shown success in mitigating certain components of medical cost, but we believe they are limited by their indirect relationship with physicians, who in the aggregate direct most of their patients’ health care costs. We believe that
physician-led and professionally-managed integrated medical systems such as HCP’s have a greater opportunity to influence cost and improve quality due to the close coordination of care at the most effective point of contact with the
patient—the primary care physician.

Capitation and FFS revenue

There are a number of different models under which an integrated medical system receives payment for managing and providing health care
services to its members.

Fee-for-service structure. Under traditional FFS reimbursement, physicians are paid a
specified FFS that they provide during a patient visit. Under this structure, physician compensation is solely related to the volume of patient visits and procedures performed, thus offering limited financial incentive to focus on cost containment
and preventative care. FFS revenues are derived primarily from HCPs physician services and hospice care.

Capitation
structure. Under capitation, payors pay a fixed amount per enrolled member, thereby subcontracting a significant portion of the responsibility and risks for managing patient care to physicians. Global capitation represents a prospective
budget from which the provider system then manages care-related expenses including payments to associated providers outside the group, such as hospitals and specialists. Compared to traditional FFS models, we believe that capitation arrangements
better align provider incentives with both quality and efficiency of care for a population of patients. We believe that this approach improves the quality of the experience for patients and the potential profitability for efficient care providers.

Since premiums paid represent a significant amount per person, the revenue and, when costs are effectively managed, profit
opportunity available to an integrated medical system under a capitated arrangement can be significant. This is particularly the case for patients with multiple diseases and senior members. We believe that the advantages, savings and efficiencies
made possible by the capitated model are most pronounced when the care demands of the population are the most severe and require the most coordination, such as for the senior population or patients with chronic, complex and follow-on diseases. While
organized coordination of care is central to the capitated model, it is also well suited to the implementation of preventative care and disease management over the long-term since physicians have a financial incentive to improve the overall health
of their patient population.







The inherent risk in assumption of global care risk relates to potential losses if a number
of individual patients’ medical costs exceed the expected amount. This risk is especially significant to individual practitioners or smaller physician groups who lack the scale required to spread the risk over a broad population. HCP has the
scale, comprehensive medical delivery resources, significant infrastructure to support practicing physicians, and demonstrated care management know-how to spread the risk of losses over a large patient population.

Global model.

In Florida, New Mexico and Arizona, HCP may contract directly with health plans under global capitation arrangements that include hospital services, because state law permits HCP to assume financial
responsibility for both professional and institutional services.

In California, entities that maintain full or restricted
licenses under the California Knox-Keene Health Care Service Plan Act of 1975 (Knox-Keene) are permitted to assume financial responsibility for both professional and institutional services. As described below, in December 2013 HCP obtained a
restricted Knox-Keene health care service plan license and therefore may enter into global capitation arrangements with health plans through which HCP will assume financial responsibility for both professional and institutional services.

In Nevada, HCP enters into global capitation arrangements to assume financial responsibility for both professional and institutional
services, however, according to the Nevada Division of Insurance (NDI), the NDI has not opined on whether it is appropriate for an entity like HCP to enter into global capitation arrangements to assume financial responsibility for the provision of
both professional and institutional services to either Medicare Advantage enrollees or enrollees of commercial health plans. Nevertheless, NDI representatives are aware of HCP’s contracting practices and have not taken any actions to question
such practices. If NDI were to determine that HCP has been inappropriately taking global risk for institutional and professional services in Nevada without having the necessary Nevada state insurance license to do so, we may be required to obtain
such a license to resolve such violations and we could be subject to civil and criminal liability. Because of the current global capitation to HCP, and HCP’s assumption of nearly the entire professional and institutional risk in Nevada,
Florida, New Mexico and Arizona, HCP’s health plan customers function primarily to support HCP in undertaking marketing and sales efforts to enroll members and processing claims in these states.

Risk-sharing model

.







if any, will be converted to global capitation arrangements, subject to HCP’s and the applicable health plan’s satisfactory negotiation and approval. Completion of such evaluation and
possible conversion is expected to occur over time.

Government regulation

In addition to the laws and regulations to which our dialysis and related lab services business is subject, the internal operations of HCP
and its contractual relationships with healthcare providers such as hospitals, other healthcare facilities, and healthcare professionals are subject to extensive and increasing regulation by numerous federal, state, and local government entities.
These laws and regulations often are interpreted broadly and enforced aggressively by multiple government agencies, including the Office of Inspector General (OIG), the U.S. Department of Justice, and various state authorities. Many of these laws
and regulations are the same as those that impact our dialysis and related lab services business. For example:



•HCP’s financial relationships with healthcare providers including physicians and hospitals could subject HCP to sanctions and penalties under the
federal anti-kickback statute;



•The referral of Medicare patients by HCP-associated physicians for the provision of DHS may subject the parties to sanctions and penalties under the
federal Stark Law;



•HCP’s financial relationships and those of its associated physicians may subject the parties to penalties and sanctions under state fraud and
abuse law;



•HCP’s submission of claims to governmental payors such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs for services provided by its associated physicians
and clinical personnel may subject HCP to sanction and penalties under the FCA; and



•HCP’s handling of electronic PHI may subject HCP to sanctions and penalties under the federal HIPAA of 1996 and its implementing privacy and
security regulations, as amended by the HITECH Act, collectively referred to as HIPAA, and state medical privacy laws which often include penalties and restrictions that are more severe than those which arise under HIPAA.

A finding that claims for services were not covered or not payable, or the imposition of sanctions
associated with a violation of any of these healthcare laws and regulations, could result in criminal or civil penalties and exclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other federal and state healthcare programs and could have a material
adverse effect on HCP’s business, financial condition and results of operations. We cannot guarantee that the arrangements or business practices of HCP will not be subject to government scrutiny or be found to violate certain healthcare laws.
Government audits, investigations and prosecutions, even if we are ultimately found to be without fault, can be costly and disruptive to HCP’s business. Moreover, changes in healthcare legislation or government regulation may restrict
HCP’s existing operations, limit their expansion or impose additional compliance requirements and costs, any of which could have a material adverse effect on HCP’s business, financial condition and results of operations.

The following includes brief descriptions of some, but not all, of the laws and regulations that, in addition to those described in
relation to our dialysis and related lab services business, affect HCP. For a discussion of the laws and regulations to which the U.S. dialysis and related lab services business is subject that also affect HCP, see “The dialysis and related lab
services business—Government regulation” above.

Licensing, certification, accreditation and related laws and
guidelines.HCP clinical personnel are subject to numerous federal, state and local licensing laws and regulations, relating to, among other things, professional credentialing and professional ethics. Since HCP clinical personnel perform
services in medical office settings, hospitals and other types of healthcare facilities, HCP may indirectly be subject to laws applicable to those entities as well as ethical guidelines and operating standards of professional trade associations and
private accreditation commissions, such as the American Medical Association and the Joint Commission. There are penalties for non-compliance with these laws and standards, including loss of professional license, civil or







criminal fines and penalties, loss of hospital admitting privileges, federal health care program disenrollment, loss of billing privileges, and exclusion from participation in various
governmental and other third-party healthcare programs.

Professional licensing requirements.HCP’s
clinical personnel including physicians must satisfy and maintain their professional licensing in the states where they practice medicine. Activities that qualify as professional misconduct under state law may subject them to sanctions, including
the loss of their licenses and could subject HCP to sanctions as well. Some state boards of medicine impose reciprocal discipline, that is, if a physician is disciplined for having committed professional misconduct in one state where he or she is
licensed, another state where he or she is also licensed may impose the same discipline even though the conduct occurred in another state. Therefore, if an HCP-associated physician is licensed in multiple states, sanctions or loss of licensure in
one state may result in sanction or the loss of licensure in another state. Professional licensing sanctions may also result in exclusion from participation in governmental healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, as well as other
third-party programs.

Corporate practice of medicine and fee splitting.Three states in which HCP operates,
California, Nevada and Arizona have laws that prohibit business entities, such as our Company and our subsidiaries, from practicing medicine, employing physicians to practice medicine or exercising control over medical decisions by physicians, known
collectively as the corporate practice of medicine. These states also prohibit entities from engaging in certain arrangements, such as fee-splitting, with physicians. In some states these prohibitions are expressly stated in a statute or regulation,
while in other states the prohibition is a matter of judicial or regulatory interpretation.

In California, a violation of the
corporate practice of medicine prohibition constitutes the unlawful practice of medicine, which is a public offense punishable by fines and other criminal penalties. In addition, any physician who participates in a scheme that violates
California’s corporate practice of medicine prohibition may be punished for aiding and abetting a lay entity in the unlawful practice of medicine. In Nevada, violation of the corporate practice of medicine rules by a lay entity also constitutes
the unlawful practice of medicine. This violation is a felony punishable by fines and other criminal penalties. Physicians in Nevada can similarly be punished for aiding and abetting in the unlicensed practice of medicine. In Arizona, although state
statutes establish professional corporations for the provision of professional services including medical services, state statutes and regulations do not specifically address the corporate practice of medicine prohibition or proscribe penalties for
its violation. Accordingly, a violation of the corporate practice of medicine prohibition as set forth in Arizona case law would be deemed illegal and result in the voiding of the offending employment or contractual relationship at issue.

In California, Nevada and Arizona, where the corporate practice of medicine is prohibited, HCP has historically operated by
maintaining long-term management contracts with multiple associated professional organizations which, in turn, employ or contract with physicians to provide those professional medical services required by the enrollees of the payors with which the
professional organizations contract. Under these management agreements, HCP performs only non-medical administrative services, does not represent that it offers medical services, and does not exercise influence or control over the practice of
medicine by the physicians or the associated physician groups with which it contracts. For example, in California, HCP has full-service management contracts with HealthCare Partners Affiliates Medical Group and HealthCare Partners Associates Medical
Group, Inc. (collectively HCPAMG). The HCPAMG entities are owned by California-licensed physicians and professional medical corporations and contract with physicians to provide professional medical services. In Nevada, HCP’s Nevada subsidiaries
have similar management agreements with Nevada professional corporations that employ and contract with physicians to provide professional medical services.

In Arizona, HCP arranges for the provision of patient care services through an independent practice association named Arizona Integrated Physicians (AIP). AIP is a professional corporation that contracts
with independent physicians and medical group practices. In this way, the professional medical services required by HCP members in Arizona are provided by an Arizona professional entity (AIP) and structured to be in compliance with Arizona’s
corporate practice of medicine laws.







Some of the relevant laws, regulations, and agency interpretations in California, Nevada and
Arizona have been subject to limited judicial and regulatory interpretation. Moreover, state laws are subject to change. Regulatory authorities and other parties, including HCP’s associated physicians, may assert that, despite the management
agreements and other arrangements through which HCP operates, we are engaged in the prohibited corporate practice of medicine or that HCP’s arrangements constitute unlawful fee-splitting. If this were to occur, we could be subject to civil or
criminal penalties, HCP’s agreements could be found legally invalid and unenforceable (in whole or in part), or we could be required to restructure its contractual arrangements.

If we were required to restructure HCP’s operating structures in California, Nevada or Arizona due to determination that a corporate
practice of medicine violation existed, such a restructuring might include revisions of the California and Nevada management services agreements, which might include a modification of the management fee, and/or establishing an alternative structure.
For example, Nevada or Arizona might have to obtain the equivalent of a California Knox-Keene license in such state in order to comply with the corporate practice of medicine rules while contracting directly with payors and, in turn, physicians, to
provide physician services to the payors’ enrollees. In California, HCP’s restricted Knox-Keene license has created potential flexibility for HCP in the event regulatory authorities seek to enforce corporate practice of medicine or fee
splitting laws based upon current management services relationships with HCPAMG. HCP’s restricted Knox-Keene license allows the HCP-owned licensed entity to contract with or employ physicians as a result of an exemption from California’s
corporate practice of medicine laws applicable to Knox-Keene licensees.

Knox-Keene.

The DMHC interprets Knox-Keene to apply to both HCSPs and downstream contracting entities, including provider groups that enter into global risk contracts with licensed HCSPs. A global risk contract is a
health care services contract in which a downstream contracting entity agrees to provide both professional (e.g., medical group) services and institutional (e.g., hospital) services subject to an at-risk or capitated reimbursement methodology.
According to DMHC, entities that accept global risk must obtain a restricted Knox-Keene license as did a subsidiary of HCP in December 2013.

Under a restricted Knox-Keene license, entities may enter into global risk contracts with other licensed HCSPs. Holders of restricted Knox-Keene licenses must comply with the same financial requirements
as HCSPs with full licenses, including demonstrating specific levels of TNE, but are granted waivers from meeting marketing and other terms of full Knox-Keene licensure. The consequences of operating without a license include civil penalties,
criminal penalties and the issuance of cease and desist orders.







One of HCP’s subsidiaries (the Plan) applied for a restricted Knox-Keene license on
April 26, 2013, which was approved by DMHC on December 31, 2013. This allows HCP to contract directly with HCSPs to simplify its historic contractual and financial structure and to facilitate expansion into new markets in California. Under
the Knox-Keene license, the Plan is prohibited from declaring or paying any dividends or making any distribution of cash or property to the Plan’s parent, affiliates, or shareholders, if such a distribution would cause the Plan to fail to
maintain TNE, result in insufficient working capital or cash flow as required by DMHC regulation, or result in the Plan being unable to provide or arrange health care services. In addition, the Plan is subject to DMHC oversight and must seek
approval before incurring any debt or guaranteeing any debt relating to the Plan’s parent, affiliates, or shareholders. The Plan must also submit proposed global capitation contracts to DMHC for approval. Thus, HCP and the Plan are now subject
to additional regulatory burdens, including: (i) regulatory oversight of operations, (ii) the need to seek approval for all material business changes, (iii) significant requirements to maintain certain TNE levels, and (iv) other
operating limitations imposed by the Knox-Keene Act and its regulations.

HCP services

HCP provides complete medical care
through a network of participating physicians and other health care professionals. Through its group model, HCP employs, directly (where permitted by state law) and through its associated physician groups, approximately 460 associated group
full-time primary care physicians who practice in clinics that are operated by HCP. Through its IPA model, HCP contracts with approximately 3,100 additional network primary care physicians who provide care for HCP’s members in an independent
office setting. These physicians are complemented by a network of several thousand specialists and ancillary providers and 204 network hospitals that provide specialty or institutional care to the patients of HCP’s associated physicians,
physician groups and IPAs.

In order to comply with local regulations prohibiting the corporate practice of medicine, many of
HCP’s group physicians are employed by associated medical groups with which HCP has entered into long-term management agreements, while, in other states, the physicians are employed directly by HCP. The largest of these HCP managed medical
groups is HCPAMG, which employs, directly or indirectly, over 600 full-time primary care physicians, specialists and hospitalists. See “—Governmental Regulations—Corporate Practice of Medicine and Fee Splitting” above.

HCP does not own hospitals, although hospitals are an essential part of its provider network. In most cases, however, HCP
contracts or otherwise aligns with hospitals to manage the utilization, readmission and cost of hospital services. Most HCP patients receive specialty care through HCP’s network based on referrals made by







their primary care physician. These specialists may be reimbursed based on capitation, case rates or on a discounted FFS rate.

HCP’s information technology system, including
HCP’s electronic health record and data warehouse, is designed to support the HCP delivery model with data-driven opportunities to improve the quality and cost effectiveness of the care received by its members. Using informatics technology, HCP
has created disease registries that track large numbers of patients with defined medical conditions. HCP applies the data from these registries to manage the care for patients with similar medical conditions which we believe leads to a better
medical outcome. We believe its approach to using this data is effective because the information is communicated by the patient’s physician rather than the health plan or disease management companies.

HCP employs a wide variety of other information applications in order to service IPA and network providers using web connectivity. The
HCP Connect! on-line portal provides web-based eligibility, referrals, electronic claims submission and explanation of benefits, and other communication vehicles for individual physician offices. The success of this suite of applications has
enhanced HCP’s ability to manage its IPA networks, and has resulted in significant back-office efficiencies for HCP and its associated physician groups. HCP has further expanded its ability to share key utilization and clinical data with its
internal and contracted physicians and specialists through the Physician Information Portal and the Clinical Viewer. Through these secure web portals, a physician is able to obtain web-based, point of care information regarding a patient, including
diagnosis history, provide quality indicators, historical risk-adjustment coding information, pharmacy medication history, and other key information. In addition to its web-portals geared towards physicians, HCP has recently introduced a
patient on-line portal to enable HCP’s patients to securely view their own clinical information, schedule physician appointments and interact electronically with their physicians. HCP believes these tools help to lead to high quality
clinical outcomes, create internal efficiencies, and enhance the satisfaction of its associated physicians and patients.

In
addition, HCP uses its data to carefully track high utilizing patients through robust data warehousing and data mining technologies. HCP filters the data warehouse to identify and reach out to patients with high-utilization patterns who are
inefficiently using resources such as visiting an emergency room when either a same-day appointment or urgent care center would be more appropriate and satisfactory for the member. High utilizing patients are identified and tracked as part of
HCP’s electronic health record by their physician and HCP’s care management staff. Specific care plans are attached to each of these patients and tracked carefully for full compliance. The objective is to proactively manage their care at
times when these patients are either not compliant with the care plan or when changing circumstances require care managers to develop new and more suitable care plans. By using these resources, HCP has achieved improvements in quality of care,
satisfaction and cost.







We believe HCP is well positioned to profitably leverage marketplace demands for greater
provider accountability, measurable quality results and cost effective medical care. We believe that HCP’s business model is likely to continue to be an attractive alternative for health plans looking for high quality, cost effective delivery
systems, physicians seeking an attractive practice environment and patients interested in a highly integrated approach to managing their medical care. Additionally, we believe that the scale of HCP’s business allows it to spread capitation risk
over a large population of members, invest in comprehensive analytic and health care information tools as well as clinical and quality measurement infrastructure, and recognize administrative and operating efficiencies. For these reasons, we believe
that HCP offers patients, physicians and health plans a proven platform for addressing many of the most pressing challenges facing the U.S. health care system, including rising medical costs.

We also believe HCP has the ability to demonstrably improve medical outcomes and patient satisfaction while effectively managing costs
through the following unique competitive strategies and internal progress and systems:



•HCP’s clinical leadership and associated group and network physicians devote significant efforts to ensuring that HCP’s members receive the
most appropriate care in the most appropriate manner.



•HCP is committed to maximizing its patients’ satisfaction levels.



•HCP has the scale and, combined with its strong reputation and high quality patient care, that makes it an attractive partner for health plans compared
to smaller provider groups that may have a higher risk of default and may not have the same resources to devote to develop the same level of patient care.



•HCP has nearly three decades of experience in managing complex disease cases for its population of patients. As a result, HCP has developed a rich
dataset of patient care experiences and outcomes which permits HCP to proactively monitor and intervene in improving the care of its members.



•HCP’s senior management team possesses substantial experience with the healthcare industry with average experience of nearly 35 years, as of
December 31, 2013.

Locations of HCP clinics

As of December 31, 2013, HCP managed a total of 196 medical clinics, of which 68 clinics were located in California, 62 clinics were
located in Florida, 49 clinics were located in Nevada and 17 clinics were located in New Mexico. As described above, HCP members in Arizona receive services at independent physician and medical group practice offices. In this way, HCP does not
directly manage clinics in Arizona.

Ancillary services and strategic initiatives business

Ancillary services and strategic initiatives, which include our international dialysis operations, as described below, accounted for
approximately 7% of our total consolidated net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2013 and consist primarily of the following as of December 31, 2013:



•Pharmacy services. DaVita Rx is a pharmacy that provides oral medications to DaVita’s patients with ESRD. The main objectives of the
pharmacy are to improve clinical outcomes by facilitating increased patient compliance and to provide our patients a convenient way to fill their prescription needs by delivering the prescriptions to the center where they are treated. Revenues are
recognized as prescriptions are filled and shipped to patients. On January 8, 2013, we entered into an agreement with Fresenius Medical Care (FMC) and began to provide certain pharmacy services to FMC’s patients in the U.S. in late 2013.



•Disease management services.VillageHealth provides advanced care management services to health plans and government agencies for
employees/members diagnosed with chronic kidney disease (CKD) or ESRD. Through a combination of clinical coordination, medical claims analysis and information technology, we endeavor to assist our customers and patients in obtaining superior renal
health care







and improved clinical outcomes, as well as helping to reduce overall medical costs. Revenues are typically based upon an established contract fee and are recognized as earned over the contract
period and can include additional fees for cost savings recognized by certain customers. In 2013, VillageHealth also operated a Medicare Advantage ESRD Special Needs Plan in partnership with a payor that works with CMS to provide ESRD patients full
service health care. We are at risk for all medical costs of the program in excess of the capitation payments.



•Vascular access services. Lifeline provides management and administrative services to physician-owned vascular access clinics that provide
surgical and interventional radiology services for dialysis patients. Lifeline also is the majority-owner of four vascular access clinics and one wholly-owned vascular access clinic. Management fees generated from providing management and
administrative services are recognized as earned typically based on a percentage of revenues or cash collections generated by the clinics. Revenues associated with the vascular access clinic that is majority-owned are recognized in the period when
physician services are provided.



•ESRD clinical research programs.DaVita Clinical Research conducts research trials principally with dialysis patients and provides
administrative support for research conducted by DaVita-associated nephrology practices. Revenues are based upon an established fee per study, as determined by contract with drug companies and other sponsors and are recognized as earned according to
the contract terms.



•Physician services.DaVita Nephrology Partners offers practice management and administrative services to physicians who specialize in
nephrology under management and administrative services agreements. Practice management and administrative services typically include operations management, IT support, billing and collections, credentialing and coding, and other support functions.
Management fees generated from providing practice management and administrative services to physician practices are recognized as earned typically based upon cash collections generated by the practices.



•Direct primary care.Paladina Health is a healthcare services organization that operates membership-based primary care clinics mainly
through employer-based on-site and newer-site clinics. The clinics offer patients more personalized and improved access to primary care physicians, including unlimited visits and same-day or next-day appointments. Physicians focus on clinical
outcomes and patient satisfaction. Revenues are recognized over the membership period.

International
dialysis operations

As of December 31, 2013, we operated or provided administrative services to a total of 73
outpatient dialysis centers located in ten countries outside of the U.S. serving approximately 5,400 patients. Our international dialysis operations continue to be in a start-up phase in which we have been developing and acquiring dialysis centers
in various strategic markets, since the commencement of our international operations during the fourth quarter of 2011. Our overall net revenues generated from our international operations were less than 1% of our consolidated net revenues during
2013. Our international operations are included as a component of our ancillary services and strategic initiatives.

Competition

U.S. and International dialysis competition

The two largest dialysis companies, FMC and our company, account for approximately 71% of
outpatient dialysis patients in the U.S. with our company serving approximately 35% of the total outpatient dialysis patients. Approximately 44% of the centers not owned by us or FMC are owned or controlled by hospitals or non-profit organizations.
Hospital-based and non-profit dialysis units typically are more difficult to acquire than physician-owned centers.

FMC also
manufactures a full line of dialysis supplies and equipment in addition to owning and operating outpatient dialysis centers worldwide. This may give FMC cost advantages over us because of their ability to manufacture their own products. However, FMC
has been one of our largest suppliers of dialysis products and equipment over the last several years. In January 2010, we entered into an agreement with FMC which committed us to purchase a certain amount of dialysis equipment, parts and supplies
from FMC through 2013. In addition, in August 2006 in connection with the DVA Renal Healthcare acquisition, we also entered into a product supply agreement with Gambro Renal Products, Inc. (Gambro) that requires us to purchase a certain amount of
our hemodialysis non-equipment product supplies, such as dialyzers, at fixed prices through 2015. Our purchases of products in these categories generally offered by both FMC and Gambro represent approximately 4% of our total U.S. dialysis operating
expenses. During 2013, we purchased hemodialysis products and supplies from Gambro representing approximately 2% of our total U.S. dialysis operating expenses.







HCP’s competition

HCP’s business is highly competitive. HCP competes with managed care organizations, hospitals, medical groups and individual
physicians in its markets. HCP competes with other primary care physician groups or physicians who contract with health plans for membership. Health plans contract with care providers on the basis of costs, reputation, scope, efficiency and
stability. Individual members select a primary care physician at the time of membership with the health plan. Location, name recognition, quality indicators and other factors go into that decision. For example, in California, HCP competes with both
Permanente Medical Group, which is the exclusive provider for Kaiser, and Heritage Provider Network. However, HCP’s principal competitors for members and health plan contracts vary by market.

Corporate compliance program

Our businesses are subject to extensive federal, state and local government regulations. Management has designed and implemented a corporate compliance program as part of our commitment to comply fully
with all applicable laws and regulations and to maintain the high standards of conduct we expect from all of our teammates. We continuously review this program and enhance it as necessary. The primary purposes of the program include:



•Assessing and identifying risks for existing and new businesses, such as HCP;



•Increasing, through training and education, the awareness of our teammates and affiliated professionals of the necessity of complying with all
applicable laws, regulations and company policies and procedures;



•Auditing and monitoring the activities of our operating units and business support functions on a regular basis to identify potential instances of
noncompliance in a timely manner; and



•Ensuring that we take steps to resolve instances of noncompliance or to address areas of potential noncompliance as promptly as we become aware of
them.

We have a code of conduct that each of our teammates and affiliated professionals must follow and we
have a confidential toll-free hotline for teammates and patients to report potential instances of noncompliance. Our Chief Compliance Officer administers the compliance program. The Chief Compliance Officer reports directly to our Chief Operating
Officer and to the Compliance Committee of our Board of Directors.

Insurance

We maintain insurance for property and general liability, professional liability, directors’ and officers’ liability, workers
compensation and other coverage in amounts and on terms deemed adequate by management based on our actual claims experience and expectations for future claims. Future claims could, however, exceed our applicable insurance coverage. Physicians
practicing at our dialysis centers are required to maintain their own malpractice insurance and our medical directors are required to maintain coverage for their individual private medical practices. Our liability policies cover our medical
directors for the performance of their duties as medical directors at our outpatient dialysis centers. HCP also maintains general and professional liability insurance through various independent and related parties. HCP has purchased its primary
general and professional liability insurance from California Medical Group Insurance in which HCP owns a 67% equity interest.







Teammates

As of December 31, 2013, we employed approximately 57,400 teammates:



•   Licensed professional staff (physicians, nurses and other healthcare professionals)23,800•   Other patient care and center support staff and laboratory personnel23,400•   Corporate, billing and regional administrative staff10,200

Our businesses require skilled healthcare professionals with specialized training for treating patients
with complex care needs. Recruitment and retention of nurses are continuing concerns for healthcare providers due to short supply. We have an active program of investing in our professional healthcare teammates to help ensure we meet our recruitment
and retention targets, including expanded training opportunities, tuition reimbursements and other incentives.
