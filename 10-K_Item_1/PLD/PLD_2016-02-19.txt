ITEM 1. Business



The Company



We are the global leader in logistics real estate, focused on high-barrier, high-growth markets across the Americas, Europe and Asia. At December 31, 2015, we owned or had investments in, on a wholly owned basis or through co-investment ventures, properties and development projects expected to total approximately 669 million square feet (62 million square meters) in 20 countries. We lease modern distribution facilities to a diverse base of more than 5,200 customers across two major categories: business-to-business and retail/online fulfillment. For business-to-business enterprises, our buildings serve a variety of sectors, including automotive, transportation, pharmaceuticals and general consumer goods. In the area of retail/online fulfillment, our state-of-the-art logistics facilities foster the seamless flow of goods around the world.







Details of the 669 million square feet at December 31, 2015 was as follows (dollars and square feet in millions):

(1)Total expected investment (“TEI”) represents total estimated cost of development or expansion, including land, development and leasing costs. TEI is based on current projections and is subject to change. Non-U.S. dollar investments are translated to U.S. dollars using the exchange rate at period end or the date of development start for purposes of calculating development starts in any period.



Our operating portfolio includes stabilized industrial properties in our owned and managed portfolio. A developed property moves into the operating portfolio when it meets stabilization. The property is considered stabilized when a development project has been completed for one year or is at least 90% occupied whichever occurs first. Our other real estate properties include properties in which we have an ownership interest but do not manage, and other properties we own, such as value-added




properties and assets held for sale to third parties. Value-added properties are those which are expected to be repurposed or redeveloped to a higher and better use. They also include newly acquired properties that present opportunities to create greater value.



Prologis, Inc. began operating as a fully integrated real estate company in 1997 and elected to be taxed as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (“Internal Revenue Code”). We believe the current organization and method of operation will enable Prologis, Inc. to maintain its status as a REIT. The Operating Partnership also was formed in 1997.



Our global corporate headquarters are at Pier 1, Bay 1, San Francisco, California 94111, and our other principal offices are in Amsterdam, Denver, Luxembourg, Mexico City, Sao Paulo, Shanghai, Singapore and Tokyo.



Our Internet address iswww.prologis.com. All reports required to be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) are available and can be accessed free of charge through the Investor Relations section of our website after we electronically submit material to the SEC. The common stock of Prologis, Inc. is listed on the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) under the ticker “PLD” and is a component of the Standard & Poor’s (“S&P”) 500.



Investment Strategy



Our investment strategy focuses on providing high-quality distribution facilities to customers whose businesses are tied to consumption and global trade and as such depend on the efficient movement of goods through the supply chain. We have a significant worldwide presence of $51.5 billion of real estate assets in our owned and managed portfolio which spans 20 countries on four continents. We focus our investments in large population centers with high per-capita consumption rates located near major airports, seaports and rail and highway systems. We classify our properties into two main market categories: global and regional. Global markets comprise approximately 30 of the largest markets tied to global trade and consumption. Regional markets benefit from large population centers but typically are not as tied to the global supply chain; instead, they serve local consumption and are less supply constrained.



We intend to hold primarily Class-A product in global and regional markets. At December 31, 2015, global and regional markets represented approximately 89% and 11%, respectively, of our owned and managed portfolio (based on our share, as determined by our ownership percentage for consolidated and unconsolidated entities, of the properties’ gross book value).



We have deep knowledge of our local markets, extensive construction expertise and a demonstrated commitment to sustainable design across our portfolio. We are supported by a diverse customer base and our relationships with multinational corporations bring us repeat business across our global portfolio. See below for information on our customers. For more detail on our properties, see Item 2. Properties.



Both macroeconomics and demographics are important drivers of our business; these drivers include population growth, consumption and rising affluence. In the developed markets of the United States (or “U.S.”), Europe and Japan, the reconfiguration of supply chains, which is strongly influenced by e-commerce trends, as well as the operational efficiencies that can be realized from our modern logistics facilities, are key factors. In emerging markets, such as Brazil, China and Mexico, new affluence and the rise of the consumer classes together have prompted demand as supply chains are constructed. Taken together, logistics real estate markets benefit from economic growth, as well as from the modernization of supply chains around the world.



In addition to our wholly owned investments we also have investments in a variety of ventures. We co-invest with partners and investors in entities that own multiple properties. We refer to these entities as co-investment ventures (consolidated or unconsolidated).



Business Strategy and Operating Segments



Our business comprises two operating segments: Real Estate Operations and Strategic Capital.



Real Estate Operations



Rental Operations.Rental operations is the largest segment and contributed approximately 90% of our revenues, earnings and funds from operations in 2015 (see below for our definition of funds from operations and a complete reconciliation to net earnings in Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations). We collect rent from our customers through operating leases, including reimbursements for the majority of our property operating costs. We expect to generate long-term internal growth by maintaining high occupancy rates, controlling expenses and increasing rents. Our rental revenue is diversified by customer segment and geography. We believe our property management, leasing and maintenance teams, together with our capital expenditure, energy and risk management programs, create cost efficiencies that allow us to capitalize on the economies of scale inherent in owning, operating and growing a global portfolio.



Capital Deployment. Capital deployment includes the development, redevelopment and acquisition of industrial properties to increase rental income and therefore is reported with rental operations. We primarily deploy capital in global and regional markets to serve our customers’ requirements. We capitalize on the following: (i) our land bank, (ii) the development expertise of our local teams, (iii) our customer relationships, and (iv) the demand for high-quality distribution facilities. We aim to increase our rental revenue and our net asset value by leasing newly developed space and acquiring operating properties. We develop properties for long-term hold, for contribution to our co-investment ventures and, occasionally, for sale to third parties. In 2015, we stabilized $1.6 billion of development projects with an estimated gross margin of 32%, creating $515 million in value for Prologis.



Strategic Capital





Competition



Competitively priced distribution space could impact our occupancy rates and have an adverse effect on how much rent we can charge, which in turn could affect both of our operating segments. We may face competition with regard to our capital deployment activities, including local, regional and national operators or developers. We also face competition from investment managers for institutional capital within our strategic capital business.






We believe we have competitive advantages due to our:



·ability to respond quickly to customers’ needs for high-quality distribution space in key global and regional markets;



·established relationships with key customers served by our local teams;



·ability to leverage our organizational scale and structure to provide a single point of contact for global customers through the Prologis global customer solutions team;



·property management and leasing expertise;



·relationships and proven track record with current and prospective investors in our strategic capital business;



·global experience developing and managing industrial properties;



·well-positioned land bank; and



·team members with experience in the land entitlement and development processes.



Customers



Our broad customer base represents a spectrum of international, national, regional and local distribution users. At December 31, 2015, in Real Estate Operations, we had more than 4,600 customers occupying 338.3 million square feet of distribution space. On an owned and managed basis, we had more than 5,200 customers occupying 614.7 million square feet of distribution space.



In Strategic Capital, we view our partners and investors as our customers. At December 31, 2015, in our private ventures, we partnered with approximately 100 investors, several of which invest in multiple ventures.

(1)Net effective rent (or “NER”) is calculated using the estimated total cash to be received over the term of the lease (including base rent and expense reimbursements) divided by the lease term to determine the amount of rent and expense reimbursements received per year. Amounts derived in a currency other than the U.S. dollar have been translated using the average rate from the previous twelve months.

We believe we have good relationships with our employees. Prologis employees are not organized under collective bargaining agreements, although some employees in Europe are represented by statutory Works Councils and as such they benefit from applicable labor agreements.



Code of Ethics and Business Conduct



We maintain a Code of Ethics and Business Conduct applicable to our board of directors (the “Board”) and all of our officers and employees, including the principal executive officer, the principal financial officer and the principal accounting officer, or other people performing similar functions. A copy of our Code of Ethics and Business Conduct is available on our website,www.prologis.com. In addition to being accessible through our website, copies of our Code of Ethics and Business Conduct can be obtained, free of charge, upon written request to Investor Relations, Pier 1, Bay 1, San Francisco, California 94111. Any amendments to or waivers of our Code of Ethics and Business Conduct that apply to the principal executive officer, the principal financial officer, or the principal accounting officer, or other people performing similar functions, and that relate to any matter enumerated in Item 406(b) of Regulation S-K, will be disclosed on our website.



Environmental Matters



We are exposed to various environmental risks that may result in unanticipated losses and affect our operating results and financial condition. Either the previous owners or we have conducted environmental reviews on a majority of the properties we have acquired, including land. While some of these assessments have led to further investigation and sampling, none of the environmental assessments has revealed an environmental liability that we believe would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. See Item 1A. Risk Factors and Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.



Insurance Coverage



We carry insurance coverage on our properties. We determine the type of coverage and the policy specifications and limits based on what we deem to be the risks associated with our ownership of properties and our business operations in specific markets. Such coverage typically includes property damage and rental loss insurance resulting from such perils as fire, windstorm, flood, earthquake and terrorism; commercial general liability insurance; and environmental insurance. Insurance is maintained through a combination of commercial insurance, self-insurance and a wholly-owned captive insurance entity. The costs to insure our properties are primarily covered through reimbursements from our customers. We believe that our insurance coverage contains policy specifications and insured limits that are customary for similar properties, business activities and markets and we believe our properties are adequately insured. See further discussion in Item 1A. Risk Factors.
