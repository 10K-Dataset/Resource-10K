The terms “we,” “our,” “us,” “its,” “UnitedHealth Group,” or the “Company” used in this report refer to UnitedHealth Group Incorporated and its subsidiaries.

Through our diversified family of businesses, we leverage core competencies in advanced, enabling technology; health care data, information and intelligence; and clinical care management and coordination to help meet the demands of the health system. These core competencies are deployed within our two distinct, but strategically aligned, business platforms: health benefits operating under UnitedHealthcare and health services operating under Optum.

UnitedHealthcare provides health care benefits to an array of customers and markets. UnitedHealthcare Employer & Individual serves employers ranging from sole proprietorships to large, multi-site and national employers, public sector employers, students and other individuals and serves the nation’s active and retired military and their families through the TRICARE program. UnitedHealthcare Medicare & Retirement delivers health and well-being benefits for Medicare beneficiaries and retirees. UnitedHealthcare Community & State manages health care benefit programs on behalf of state Medicaid and community programs and their participants. UnitedHealthcare Global (formerly UnitedHealthcare International) includes Amil, a health care company providing health and dental benefits and hospital and clinical services to individuals in Brazil, and other diversified global health businesses.

Optum is a health services business serving the broad health care marketplace, including payers, care providers, employers, governments, life sciences companies and consumers, through its OptumHealth, OptumInsight and OptumRx businesses. These businesses have dedicated units that help improve overall health system performance through optimizing care quality, reducing costs and improving consumer experience and care provider performance across eight business markets: local care delivery, care management, consumer engagement, distribution services, health financial services, operational services and support, health care information technology and pharmacy services.

Through UnitedHealthcare and Optum, in 2014, we managed over $165 billion in aggregate health care spending on behalf of the customers and consumers we serve. Our revenues are derived from premiums on risk-based products; fees from management, administrative, technology and consulting services; sales of a wide variety of products and services related to the broad health and well-being industry; and investment and other income. Our two business platforms have four reportable segments:

•UnitedHealthcare, which includes UnitedHealthcare Employer & Individual, UnitedHealthcare Medicare & Retirement, UnitedHealthcare Community & State and UnitedHealthcare Global;

•OptumHealth;

•OptumInsight; and

•OptumRx.

For our financial results and the presentation of certain other financial information by segment, including revenues and long-lived fixed assets by geographic source, see Note 13 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements.”

UnitedHealthcare Employer & Individual

UnitedHealthcare Employer & Individual offers an array of consumer-oriented health benefit plans and services for large national employers, public sector employers, mid-sized employers, small businesses, individuals and military service members in the TRICARE west region. UnitedHealthcare Employer & Individual provides nearly 29 million Americans access to health care as ofDecember 31, 2014. Large employer groups typically use self-funded arrangements where UnitedHealthcare Employer & Individual earns a service fee. Smaller employer groups and individuals are more likely to purchase risk-based products because they are less willing or unable to bear a greater potential liability for health care expenditures.

Through its risk-based product offerings, UnitedHealthcare Employer & Individual assumes the risk of both medical and administrative costs for its customers in return for a monthly premium, which is typically a fixed rate per individual served for a one-year period. When providing administrative and other management services to customers that elect to self-fund the health care costs of their employees and employees’ dependents, UnitedHealthcare Employer & Individual receives a fixed monthly service fee per individual served. These customers retain the risk of financing medical benefits for their employees and employees’ dependents, while UnitedHealthcare Employer & Individual provides services such as coordination and facilitation of medical and related services to customers, consumers and health care professionals, administration of transaction processing and access to a contracted network of physicians, hospitals and other health care professionals, including dental and vision.

UnitedHealthcare Employer & Individual also offers a variety of insurance options for purchase by individuals, including students, which are designed to meet the health coverage needs of these consumers and their families. The consolidated purchasing capacity represented by the individuals UnitedHealth Group serves makes it possible for UnitedHealthcare Employer & Individual to contract for cost-effective access to a large number of conveniently located care professionals and facilities.

UnitedHealthcare Employer & Individual typically distributes its products through consultants or direct sales in the larger employer and public sector segments. In the smaller group segment of the commercial marketplace, UnitedHealthcare Employer & Individual’s distribution system consists primarily of direct sales and sales through collaboration with brokers and agents. UnitedHealthcare Employer & Individual also distributes products through wholesale agents or agencies that contract with health insurance carriers to distribute individual or group benefits and provide other related services to their customers.

In recent years, UnitedHealthcare Employer & Individual has diversified its model more extensively, distributing through professional employer organizations, associations, private equity relationships and, increasingly, through both multi-carrier and its own proprietary private exchange marketplaces. In 2014, UnitedHealthcare Employer & Individual launched UnitedHealthcare Marketplace, a new shopping platform for employers seeking to offer their employees flexibility and a choice of UnitedHealthcare plans. UnitedHealthcare Employer & Individual is also participating in select multi-plan exchanges that they believe are structured to encourage consumer choice. Direct-to-consumer sales are also supported by participation in multi-carrier health insurance marketplaces for individuals and small groups through exchanges. In 2014, UnitedHealthcare Employer & Individual participated in 13 state public health care exchanges, including four individual and nine small group exchanges. In 2015, we are participating in 23 individual and 12 small group state public exchanges.

UnitedHealthcare Employer & Individual’s diverse product portfolio offers a continuum of benefit designs, price points and approaches to consumer engagement, which provide the flexibility to meet the needs of employers of all sizes, as well as individuals shopping for health benefits coverage. UnitedHealthcare Employer & Individual has seen increased demand for consumer driven health plans and new network approaches with lower costs, as well as more convenient care options for consumers. UnitedHealthcare Employer & Individual emphasizes local markets and leverages its national scale to adapt products to meet specific local market needs.









UnitedHealthcare Employer & Individual offers its products through affiliates that are licensed as insurance companies, health maintenance organizations (HMOs), or third-party administrators (TPAs).The market for health benefit products is shifting, with benefit and network offerings shaped, at least in part, by the requirements and effects of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and a reconciliation measure, the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (together, Health Reform Legislation), employer focus on quality and employee engagement, and the urgent need to align the system around value.

UnitedHealthcare Employer & Individual’s major product families include:

Traditional Products.Traditional products include a full range of medical benefits and network options from managed plans, such as Choice and Options PPO, to more traditional indemnity products. The plans offer a full spectrum of covered services, including preventive care, direct access to specialists and catastrophic protection.

Consumer Engagement Products and Tools.Consumer engagement products couple plan design with financial accounts to increase individuals’ responsibility for their health and well-being. This suite of products includes high-deductible consumer-driven benefit plans, which include health reimbursement accounts (HRAs), health savings accounts (HSAs) and consumer engagement services such as personalized behavioral incentive programs and consumer education. During 2014, more than 32,000 employer-sponsored benefit plans, including more than 300 employers in the large group self-funded market, purchased HRA or HSA products from us. UnitedHealthcare Employer & Individual’s consumer engagement tools support members with access to benefit, cost and quality information through online and mobile applications, such as Advocate4Me, myHealthcare Cost Estimator and Health4Me. Using innovative tools and technology, UnitedHealthcare and Optum’s applications are helping people address a broad range of health related issues, including benefits and claims questions, finding the right doctor, proactive support for appointments and issue resolution, health education, clinical program enrollment and treatment decision support.

Value Based Products.UnitedHealthcare Employer & Individual’s suite of consumer incentive products increases individual awareness of personal health and care quality and cost for heightened consumer responsibility and behavior change. These products include: Small Business Wellness, which is a packaged wellness and incentives product that offers gym reimbursement and encourages completion of important wellness activities. For mid-sized clients, SimplyEngaged is a scalable activity-based reward program that ties incentives to completion of health improvement activities, while SimplyEngaged Plus provides richer incentives for achieving health goals. For large, self-funded customers, the UnitedHealthcare Healthy Rewards program offers a flexible incentive design to help employers choose the right activities and include appropriate biometric outcomes that best fit the needs of their employee population. UnitedHealth Personal Rewards leverages a tailored approach to incentives by combining personalized scorecards with financial incentives for improving biometric scores, compliance with key health treatments and preventive care.

Essential Benefits Products.UnitedHealthcare Employer & Individual’s portfolio of lower cost products provides value to consumers through innovative plan designs and unique network programs like UnitedHealth Premium®, which guide people to physicians recognized for providing high-quality, cost-efficient care to their patients. This approach to essential benefits is designed to deliver sustainable health care costs for employers, enabling them to continue to offer their employees coverage at more affordable prices. For example, UnitedHealthcare Employer & Individual’s tiered benefit plans offer enhanced benefits in the form of greater coinsurance coverage and/or lower copays for people using UnitedHealth Premium®designated care providers.

Clinical and Pharmacy Products.UnitedHealthcare Employer & Individual offers a comprehensive suite of clinical and pharmacy benefits management programs, which complement its service offerings by improving quality of care, engaging members and providing cost-saving options. All UnitedHealthcare Employer & Individual members are provided access to clinical products that help them make better health care decisions and better use of their medical benefits, improving health and decreasing medical expenses.

Each medical plan has a core set of clinical programs embedded in the offering, with additional services available depending on funding type (fully insured or self-funded), line of business (e.g., small business, key accounts, public sector, national accounts and individuals), and clinical need. UnitedHealthcare Employer & Individual’s clinical programs include:

•wellness programs;

•decision support;

•utilization management;

•case and disease management;

•complex condition management;

•on-site programs, including Know Your Numbers (biometrics) and flu shots;









•incentives to reinforce positive behavior change;

•mental health/substance use disorder management; and

•employee assistance programs.

UnitedHealthcare Employer & Individual’s comprehensive and integrated pharmaceutical management services promote lower costs by using formulary programs to produce better unit costs, encouraging consumers to use drugs that offer improved value and outcomes, and supporting the appropriate use of drugs based on clinical evidence through physician and consumer education programs.

Specialty Offerings. UnitedHealthcare Employer & Individual also delivers dental, vision, life, and disability product offerings through an integrated approach including a network of more than 58,000 vision professionals in private and retail settings, and nearly 75,000 dental offices.

UnitedHealthcare Military & Veterans.UnitedHealthcare Military & Veterans is the provider of health care services for nearly 3 million active duty and retired military service members and their families in 21 states (West Region) under the Department of Defense’s (DoD) TRICARE Managed Care Support contract. The contract began on April 1, 2013, and includes a transition period and five one-year renewals at the government’s option.

UnitedHealthcare Military & Veterans’ responsibility as a contractor is to augment the military’s direct care system by providing managed care support services, provider networks, medical management, claims/enrollment administration and customer service.

UnitedHealthcare Medicare & Retirement

UnitedHealthcare Medicare & Retirement provides health and well-being services to individuals age 50 and older, addressing their unique needs for preventive and acute health care services, as well as services dealing with chronic disease and other specialized issues common among older individuals. UnitedHealthcare Medicare & Retirement is fully dedicated to serving this growing senior market segment, providing products and services in all 50 states, the District of Columbia and most U.S. territories. It has distinct pricing, underwriting, clinical program management and marketing capabilities dedicated to health products and services in this market.

UnitedHealthcare Medicare & Retirement offers a spectrum of risk-based Medicare products that may be purchased by individuals or on a group basis, including Medicare Advantage plans, Medicare Prescription Drug Benefit (Medicare Part D) and Medicare Supplement products that extend and enhance traditional fee-for-service coverage. UnitedHealthcare Medicare & Retirement services include care management and clinical management programs, a nurse health line service, 24-hour access to health care information, access to discounted health services from a network of care providers and administrative services.

Premium revenues from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) represented 29% of UnitedHealth Group’s total consolidated revenues for the year endedDecember 31, 2014, most of which were generated by UnitedHealthcare Medicare & Retirement.

UnitedHealthcare Medicare & Retirement has extensive distribution capabilities and experience, including direct marketing to consumers on behalf of its key clients: AARP, the nation’s largest membership organization dedicated to the needs of people age 50 and over, and state and U.S. government agencies. Products are also offered through employer groups and agent channels.

UnitedHealthcare Medicare & Retirement’s major product categories include:

Medicare Advantage.UnitedHealthcare Medicare & Retirement provides health care coverage for seniors and other eligible Medicare beneficiaries primarily through the Medicare Advantage program administered by CMS, including Medicare Advantage HMO plans, preferred provider organization (PPO) plans, Point-of-Service plans, Private-Fee-for-Service plans and Special Needs Plans (SNPs). Under the Medicare Advantage program, UnitedHealthcare Medicare & Retirement provides health insurance coverage in exchange for a fixed monthly premium per member from CMS and in some cases consumer premiums. Premium amounts received from CMS vary based on the geographic areas in which members reside; demographic factors such as age, gender, and institutionalized status; and the health status of the individual. UnitedHealthcare Medicare & Retirement had approximately 3 million people enrolled in its Medicare Advantage products as ofDecember 31, 2014.

Medicare Advantage plans are designed to compete at the local level, taking into account member and care provider preferences, competitor offerings, our historical financial results, our quality and cost initiatives and the long-term payment rate outlook for each geographic area. Starting in 2012, and phased in through 2017, the Medicare Advantage rate structure and quality rating bonuses are changing significantly. See Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” for further information.









UnitedHealthcare Medicare & Retirement offers innovative care management, disease management and other clinical programs, integrating federal, state and personal funding through its continuum of Medicare Advantage products. For high-risk patients in certain care settings and programs, UnitedHealthcare Medicare & Retirement uses proprietary, automated medical record software that enables clinical care teams to capture and track patient data and clinical encounters, creating a comprehensive set of care information that bridges across home, hospital and nursing home care settings. Proprietary predictive modeling tools help identify members at high risk and allow care managers to reach out to those members and create individualized care plans that help them obtain the right care, in the right place, at the right time.

Medicare Part D.UnitedHealthcare Medicare & Retirement provides Medicare Part D benefits to beneficiaries throughout the United States and its territories through its Medicare Advantage and stand-alone Medicare Part D plans. UnitedHealthcare Medicare & Retirement offers two stand-alone Medicare Part D plans: the AARP MedicareRx Preferred and the AARP MedicareRx Saver Plus plans. The stand-alone Medicare Part D plans address a large spectrum of beneficiaries’ needs and preferences for their prescription drug coverage, including low cost prescription options. Each of the plans includes the majority of the drugs covered by Medicare and provides varying levels of coverage to meet the diverse needs of Medicare beneficiaries. As ofDecember 31, 2014, UnitedHealthcare enrolled approximately 8 million people in the Medicare Part D programs, including more than 5 million individuals in the stand-alone Medicare Part D plans and approximately 3 million in Medicare Advantage plans incorporating Medicare Part D coverage.

Medicare Supplement.UnitedHealthcare Medicare & Retirement is currently serving more than 4 million seniors through various Medicare Supplement products in association with AARP. UnitedHealthcare Medicare & Retirement offers plans in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and most U.S. territories. UnitedHealthcare Medicare & Retirement offers a full range of supplemental products at diverse price points. These products cover the various levels of coinsurance and deductible gaps that seniors are exposed to in the traditional Medicare program.

UnitedHealthcare Community & State

UnitedHealthcare Community & State is dedicated to serving state programs that care for the economically disadvantaged, the medically underserved and those without the benefit of employer-funded health care coverage, in exchange for a monthly premium per member from the state program. In some cases, these premiums are subject to experience or risk adjustments. UnitedHealthcare Community & State’s primary customers oversee Medicaid plans, Children’s Health Insurance Programs (CHIP), SNPs, integrated Medicare-Medicaid plans (MMP) and other federal, state and community health care programs. As ofDecember 31, 2014, UnitedHealthcare Community & State participated in programs in 24 states and the District of Columbia, and served more than 5 million beneficiaries. Health Reform Legislation provided for optional Medicaid expansion effective January 1, 2014. For 2015, 13 of our state customers have elected to expand Medicaid, an increase of one state since 2014. For further discussion of the Medicaid expansion under Health Reform Legislation, see Part II, Item 7, “Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”

States using managed care services for Medicaid beneficiaries select health plans by using a formal bid process or by awarding individual contracts. A number of factors are considered by UnitedHealthcare Community & State when choosing programs for participation including the state’s commitment and consistency of support for its Medicaid managed care program in terms of service, innovation and funding; the eligible population base, both immediate and long term; and the structure of the projected program. UnitedHealthcare Community & State works with its state customers to advocate for actuarially sound rates that are commensurate with medical cost trends.

The primary categories of eligibility for the programs served by UnitedHealthcare Community & State and our participation are:

•Temporary Assistance to Needy Families, primarily women and children – 21 markets;

•CHIP – 21 markets;

•Aged, Blind and Disabled (ABD) – 16 markets;

•SNP  – 14 markets;

•Medicaid Expansion – 13 markets;

•Long-Term Services and Supports (LTSS) – 12 markets;

•other programs (e.g., developmentally disabled, rehabilitative services) – 6 markets

•childless adults programs for the uninsured – 4 markets; and

•MMP – 1 market.

These health plans and care programs offered are designed to address the complex needs of the populations they serve, including the chronically ill, those with disabilities and people with a higher risk of medical, behavioral and social conditions. UnitedHealthcare Community & State administers benefits for the unique needs of children, pregnant women, adults, seniors









and those who are institutionalized or are nursing home eligible. They often live in areas that are medically underserved and are less likely to have a consistent relationship with the medical community or a care provider. These individuals also tend to face significant social and economic challenges.

UnitedHealthcare Community & State leverages the national capabilities of UnitedHealth Group locally, supporting effective care management, strong regulatory partnerships, greater administrative efficiency, improved clinical outcomes and the ability to adapt to a changing national and local market environment. UnitedHealthcare Community & State coordinates resources among family, physicians, other health care providers, and government and community-based agencies and organizations to facilitate continuous and effective care.

The LTSS market represents only 6% of the total Medicaid population, yet accounts for more than 30% of total Medicaid expenditures. The LTSS population is made up of over 4 million individuals who qualify for additional benefits under LTSS programs who represent a subset of the more than 16 million ABD Americans. Currently, only one-quarter of the ABD population and approximately 20% of the LTSS eligible population are served by managed care programs. States are increasingly looking for solutions to not only help control costs, but to improve quality for the complex medical challenges faced by this population and are moving with greater speed to managed care programs.

There are more than 9 million individuals eligible for both Medicare and Medicaid. This group has historically been referred to as dually eligible or MMP. MMP beneficiaries typically have complex conditions with costs of care that are far higher than typical Medicare or Medicaid beneficiaries. While these individuals’ health needs are more complex and more costly, they have been historically served in unmanaged environments. This market provides UnitedHealthcare an opportunity to integrate Medicare and Medicaid funding and improve people’s health status through close coordination of care.

Total annual expenditures for MMPs are estimated at more than $390 billion, or approximately 13% of the total health care costs in the United States. As ofDecember 31, 2014, UnitedHealthcare served more than 315,000 people with complex conditions similar to those in an MMP population in legacy programs through Medicare Advantage dual SNPs. As ofDecember 31, 2014, UnitedHealthcare Community & State had been awarded new MMP business taking effect in 2015 in Ohio and Texas.

UnitedHealthcare Global

UnitedHealthcare Global participates in international markets through national “in country” and cross-border strategic approaches. UnitedHealthcare Global’s cross-border health care business provides comprehensive health benefits, care management and care delivery for multinational employers, governments and individuals around the world. UnitedHealthcare Global’s goal is to create business solutions that are based on local infrastructure, culture and needs, and that blend local expertise with experiences from the U.S. health care industry.

Optum

Optum is a health services business serving the broad health care marketplace, including:

•Those who need care: the consumers who need the right support, information, resources and products to achieve their health goals.

•Those who provide care: pharmacies, physicians’ practices, hospitals and clinical facilities seeking to modernize the health system and support the best possible patient care and experience.

•Those who pay for care: insurers, employers and government agencies devoted to ensuring the populations they sponsor receive high-quality care, administered and delivered efficiently.

•Those who innovate for care: life sciences and research focused organizations dedicated to developing more effective approaches to care, enabling technologies and medicines that improve care delivery and health outcomes.

Using advanced data analytics and technology, Optum helps improve overall health system performance by optimizing care quality, reducing costs and improving the consumer experience and care provider performance. Optum is organized in three reportable segments:

•OptumHealth focuses on care delivery, care management, consumer engagement, distribution and health financial services;

•OptumInsight delivers operational services and support and health information technology services; and

•OptumRx specializes in pharmacy services.

OptumHealth

OptumHealth is a diversified health and wellness business serving the physical, emotional and financial needs of more than 63 million unique individuals. OptumHealth enables population health management through programs offered by employers, payers, government entities and, increasingly, directly with the care delivery system. OptumHealth products and services deliver value by improving quality and patient satisfaction while lowering cost. OptumHealth works to optimize the care delivery system through the creation of high-performing networks and centers of excellence across the care continuum, by working directly with physicians to advance population health management and by focusing on caring for the most medically complex patients.

OptumHealth offers its products on a risk basis, where it assumes responsibility for health care costs in exchange for a monthly premium per individual served, and on an administrative fee basis, under which it manages or administers delivery of the products or services in exchange for a fixed fee per individual served. For its financial services offerings, OptumHealth charges fees and earns investment income on managed funds.

OptumHealth sells its products primarily through its direct sales force, strategic collaborations and external producers in three markets: employers (which includes the sub-markets of large, mid-sized and small employers), payers (which includes the sub-markets of health plans, TPAs, underwriter/stop-loss carriers and individual market intermediaries) and government entities (which includes states, CMS, DoD, the Veterans Administration and other federal procurement agencies). As provider reimbursement models evolve, care providers are emerging as a fourth market for the health management, financial services and local care delivery businesses.

OptumHealth is organized into two major operating groups: Collaborative Care and Consumer Solutions Group (CSG).

Collaborative Care.Collaborative Care’s major product offerings include local care delivery, complex population management and mobile care delivery.

•Local Care Delivery. Local care delivery serves patients through a collaborative network of care providers aligned around total population health management and outcomes-based reimbursement. Within its local care delivery systems, OptumHealth works directly with medical groups and Independent Practice Associations to deploy a core set of technology, risk management, analytical and clinical capabilities and tools to assist physicians in delivering high-quality care across the populations they serve. OptumHealth is directly affiliated with clinics and physicians who provided care to more than 2 million patients in 2014.

•Complex Population Management. Complex population management services focus on improving care for patients with very challenging medical conditions by providing the optimal care in the most appropriate setting. Complex population management is focused on building and executing integrated solutions for payers, governmental agencies, accountable care organizations and provider groups for the highest cost patient segment of the health care system with focus on optimizing patient outcomes, quality and cost effectiveness. In addition, complex population management provides hospice services in 17 markets in the United States.











•Mobile Care Delivery. OptumHealth’s mobile care delivery business provides occupational health, medical and dental readiness services, treatments and immunization programs. These solutions serve a number of government and commercial clients including the U.S. military.

CSG.CSG includes population health management services, specialty networks, distribution and financial services products.

•Population Health Management Services: OptumHealth serves nearly 38 million people through population health management services, including care management, complex conditions (e.g., cancer, neonatal and maternity), health and wellness and advocacy decision support solutions.

•Specialty Networks.Within specialty networks, OptumHealth serves more than 57 million people by offering them access to proprietary networks of provider specialists in the areas of behavioral health management (e.g., mental health, substance abuse), chiropractic, physical therapy, transplant, infertility, kidney and end stage renal disease.

•Distribution:This business provides health exchange capabilities to help payers, market aggregators and employers meet the needs of the consumers they serve. OptumHealth provides call center support, multi-modal communications software, data analysis and trained nurses that help clients acquire, retain and service large populations of health care consumers.

•Financial Services: This business serves the health financial needs of individuals, employers, health care professionals and payers. OptumHealth is a leading provider of consumer health care accounts. OptumHealth also offers electronic payment solutions to manage compliance and improve the administrative efficiency of electronic claim payments. As ofDecember 31, 2014, Financial Services and its wholly owned subsidiary, Optum Bank, had $2.8 billion in customer assets under management and during 2014 processed $85 billion in medical payments to physicians and other health care providers.

OptumInsight

OptumInsight provides technology, operational and consulting services to participants in the health care industry. Hospital systems, physician practices, commercial health plans, government agencies, life sciences companies and other organizations that constitute the health care system use OptumInsight to help them reduce costs, meet compliance mandates, improve clinical performance, achieve efficiency and modernize their core operating systems to meet the changing needs of the health system landscape.

Many of OptumInsight’s software and information products, advisory consulting arrangements and outsourcing contracts are delivered over an extended period, often several years. OptumInsight maintains an order backlog to track unearned revenues under these long-term arrangements. The backlog consists of estimated revenue from signed contracts, other legally binding agreements and anticipated contract renewals based on historical experience that either have not started but are anticipated to begin in the near future, or are in process and have not been completed. OptumInsight’s aggregate backlog at

December 31, 2014

, was $8.6 billion, of which $4.8 billion is expected to be realized within the next 12 months. This includes $2.9 billion related to intersegment agreements, all of which are included in the current portion of the backlog. OptumInsight’s aggregate backlog at December 31, 2013, adjusted for the January 1, 2014 business realignment discussed in Note 13 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements,” was $7.5 billion including $2.7 billion related to intersegment agreements. The increase in 2014 backlog was attributable to a revenue management services acquisition and general business growth, partially offset by services performed on existing contracts. OptumInsight cannot provide any assurance that it will be able to realize all of the revenues included in the backlog due to uncertainties with regard to the timing and scope of services and the potential for cancellation, non-renewal or early termination of service arrangements.









OptumInsight’s products and services are sold primarily through a direct sales force. OptumInsight’s products are also supported and distributed through an array of alliances and business partnerships with other technology vendors, who integrate and interface OptumInsight’s products with their applications.

OptumInsight provides capabilities targeted to the needs of four primary market segments: care providers (e.g., physician practices and hospitals), payers, governments and life sciences organizations.

Care Providers.Serving four out of five U.S. hospitals and tens of thousands of physician practices, OptumInsight provides capabilities that help drive financial performance, meet compliance requirements and deliver health intelligence. OptumInsight’s offerings in clinical workflow software, revenue management tools and services, health IT and analytics help hospitals and physician practices improve patient outcomes, strengthen financial performance and meet quality measurement and compliance requirements, as well as transition to new collaborative and value based business models.

Payers.OptumInsight serves approximately 300 health plans by helping them improve operational and administrative efficiency, meet clinical performance and compliance goals, develop strong provider networks, manage risk and drive growth.









OptumInsight also helps payer clients adapt to new market models, including health insurance exchanges, consumer driven health care and engagement, pay-for-value contracting and population health management.

Governments.OptumInsight provides services to government agencies across 36 states and the District of Columbia. Services include financial management and program integrity services, policy and compliance consulting, data and analytics technology, systems integration and expertise to improve medical quality, access and costs.

Life Sciences.OptumInsight’s Life Sciences business provides services to more than 200 global life sciences organizations. OptumInsight’s services use real-world evidence to support market access and positioning of products, provide insights into patient reported outcomes and optimize and manage risk.

OptumRx

OptumRx provides a full spectrum of pharmacy benefit management (PBM) services to more than 30 million Americans nationwide, managing more than $40 billion in pharmaceutical spending annually and processing nearly 600 million adjusted retail, home delivery and specialty drug prescriptions annually. OptumRx’s PBM services deliver a low cost, high-quality pharmacy benefit through retail network contracting services, home delivery and specialty pharmacy services, manufacturer rebate contracting and management and a variety of clinical programs such as step therapy, formulary management, drug adherence and disease and drug therapy management programs. As of December 31, 2014, OptumRx’s network included more than 67,000 retail pharmacies and two home delivery pharmacy facilities in California and Kansas.

The home delivery and specialty pharmacy fulfillment capabilities of OptumRx are an important strategic component of its business, providing patients with convenient access to maintenance medications, offering a broad range of complex drug therapies and patient management services for individuals with chronic health conditions and enabling OptumRx to help consumers achieve optimal health, while maximizing cost savings.

OptumRx provides PBM services to a substantial majority of UnitedHealthcare members. Additionally, OptumRx manages specialty pharmacy benefits across nearly all of UnitedHealthcare’s businesses with services including patient support and clinical programs designed to ensure quality and deliver value for consumers. This is crucial in managing overall drug spend, as biologics and other specialty medications are the fastest growing pharmacy expenditures. OptumRx also provides PBM services to non-affiliated external clients, including public and private sector employer groups, insurance companies, Taft-Hartley Trust Funds, TPAs, managed care organizations (MCOs), Medicare-contracted plans, Medicaid plans and other sponsors of health benefit plans and individuals throughout the United States. OptumRx’s distribution system consists primarily of health insurance brokers and other health care consultants and direct sales.

GOVERNMENT REGULATION

Most of our health and well-being businesses are subject to comprehensive federal, state and international laws and regulations. We are regulated by federal, state and international regulatory agencies that generally have discretion to issue regulations and interpret and enforce laws and rules. The regulations can vary significantly from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, and the interpretation of existing laws and rules also may change periodically. Domestic and international governments continue to enact and consider various legislative and regulatory proposals that could materially impact certain aspects of the health care system. New laws, regulations and rules, or changes in the interpretation of existing laws, regulations and rules, including as a result of changes in the political climate, could adversely affect our business.

If we fail to comply with, or fail to respond quickly and appropriately to changes in, applicable laws, regulations and rules, our business, results of operations, financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected. See Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors” for a discussion of the risks related to compliance with federal, state and international laws and regulations.



Federal Laws and Regulation

We are subject to various levels of U.S. federal regulation. For example, when we contract with the federal government, we are subject to federal laws and regulations relating to the award, administration and performance of U.S. government contracts. CMS regulates our UnitedHealthcare businesses, and certain aspects of our Optum businesses. Payments by CMS to our businesses are subject to regulations including those governing fee-for-service and the submission of information relating to the health status of enrollees for purposes of determining the amount of certain payments to us. CMS also has the right to audit our performance to determine our compliance with CMS contracts and regulations and the quality of care we provide to Medicare beneficiaries. Our commercial business is further subject to CMS audits related to risk adjustment and reinsurance data.

UnitedHealthcare Community & State has Medicaid and CHIP contracts that are subject to federal regulations regarding services to be provided to Medicaid enrollees, payment for those services and other aspects of these programs. There are many regulations affecting Medicare and Medicaid compliance, and the regulatory environment with respect to these programs is









complex. We are also subject to federal law and regulations relating to the administration of contracts with federal agencies that are held by our Optum businesses and UnitedHealthcare Military & Veterans business, such as our TRICARE West Region contract with the DoD.

Certain of our businesses, such as UnitedHealthcare’s eyeglass manufacturing activities and Optum’s high acuity clinical workflow software, hearing aid products and clinical research activities, are subject to regulation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Our business is also subject to laws and regulations relating to consumer protection, anti-fraud and abuse, anti-kickbacks, false claims, prohibited referrals, inappropriately reducing or limiting health care services, anti-money laundering, securities and antitrust.

Health Care Reform.Health Reform Legislation expands access to coverage and modifies aspects of the commercial insurance market, as well as the Medicaid and Medicare programs, CHIP and other aspects of the health care system.

Among other requirements, Health Reform Legislation expanded dependent coverage to age 26, expanded benefit requirements, eliminated certain annual and lifetime maximum limits, eliminated certain pre-existing condition limits, required coverage for preventative services without cost to members, required premium rebates if certain medical loss ratios (MLRs) are not satisfied, granted members new and additional appeal rights, created new premium rate review processes, established a system of state and federal exchanges through which consumers can purchase health coverage, imposed new requirements on the format and content of communications (such as explanations of benefits) between health insurers and their members, introduced new risk sharing programs, reduced the Medicare Part D coverage gap and reduced payments to private plans offering Medicare Advantage.

Health Reform Legislation and the related federal and state regulations are affecting how we do business and could impact our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. The full impact of Health Reform Legislation remains difficult to predict and is not yet fully known. See also Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors” and Part II, Item 7, “Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” for a discussion of the risks related to Health Reform Legislation and related matters.

Privacy, Security, and Data Standards Regulation.The administrative simplification provisions of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended (HIPAA), apply to both the group and individual health insurance markets, including self-funded employee benefit plans. Federal regulations related to HIPAA contain minimum standards for electronic transactions and code sets, and for the privacy and security of protected health information. ICD-9, the current system of assigning codes to diagnoses and procedures associated with hospital utilization in the United States is anticipated to be replaced by ICD-10 code sets on October 1, 2015, and health plans and providers will be required to use ICD-10 codes for such diagnoses and procedures for dates of services on or after such date.

The Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (HITECH) significantly expanded the privacy and security provisions of HIPAA. HITECH imposes additional requirements on uses and disclosures of health information; includes new contracting requirements for HIPAA business associate agreements; extends parts of HIPAA privacy and security provisions to business associates; adds new federal data breach notification requirements for covered entities and business associates and new reporting requirements to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and the Federal Trade Commission and, in some cases, to the local media; strengthens enforcement and imposes higher financial penalties for HIPAA violations and, in certain cases, imposes criminal penalties for individuals, including employees. In the conduct of our business, depending on the circumstances, we may act as either a covered entity or a business associate. Federal consumer protection laws may also apply in some instances to privacy and security practices related to personally identifiable information.

The use and disclosure of individually identifiable health data by our businesses is also regulated in some instances by other federal laws, including the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA) or state statutes implementing GLBA. These federal laws and state statutes generally require insurers to provide customers with notice regarding how their non-public personal health and financial information is used and the opportunity to “opt out” of certain disclosures before the insurer shares such information with a third-party, and generally require safeguards for the protection of personal information. Neither the GLBA nor HIPAA privacy regulations preempt more stringent state laws and regulations that may apply to us, as discussed below.

ERISA.The Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (ERISA), regulates how our services are provided to or through certain types of employer-sponsored health benefit plans. ERISA is a set of laws and regulations that is subject to periodic interpretation by the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) as well as the federal courts. ERISA sets forth standards on how our business units may do business with employers who sponsor employee benefit health plans, particularly those that maintain self-funded plans. Regulations established by the DOL subject us to additional requirements for claims payment and member appeals under health care plans governed by ERISA.









State Laws and Regulation

Health Care Regulation

.

Our insurance and HMO subsidiaries must be licensed by the jurisdictions in which they conduct business. All of the states in which our subsidiaries offer insurance and HMO products regulate those products and operations. The states require periodic financial reports and establish minimum capital or restricted cash reserve requirements. The National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) has adopted model regulations that, where implemented by states, require expanded governance practices and risk and solvency assessment reporting. Most states have adopted these or similar measures to expand the scope of regulations relating to corporate governance and internal control activities of HMOs and insurance companies. In 2014, the NAIC adopted the Risk Management and Own Risk and Solvency Assessment Model Act that requires us to maintain a risk management framework and file a self-assessment report with state insurance regulators. The first report will be filed with Connecticut, our lead regulator, in 2015, and annually thereafter. Certain states have also adopted their own regulations for minimum MLRs with which health plans must comply. In addition, a number of state legislatures have enacted or are contemplating significant reforms of their health insurance markets, either independent of or to comply with or be eligible for grants or other incentives in connection with Health Reform Legislation, which may affect our operations and our financial results.

Health plans and insurance companies are regulated under state insurance holding company regulations. Such regulations generally require registration with applicable state departments of insurance and the filing of reports that describe capital structure, ownership, financial condition, certain intercompany transactions and general business operations. Most state insurance holding company laws and regulations require prior regulatory approval of acquisitions and material intercompany transfers of assets, as well as transactions between the regulated companies and their parent holding companies or affiliates. These laws may restrict the ability of our regulated subsidiaries to pay dividends to our holding companies.

Some of our business activity is subject to other health care-related regulations and requirements, including PPO, MCO, utilization review (UR), TPA, or care provider-related regulations and licensure requirements. These regulations differ from state to state, and may contain network, contracting, product and rate, and financial and reporting requirements. There are laws and regulations that set specific standards for delivery of services, appeals, grievances and payment of claims, adequacy of health care professional networks, fraud prevention, protection of consumer health information, pricing and underwriting practices and covered benefits and services. State health care anti-fraud and abuse prohibitions encompass a wide range of activities, including kickbacks for referral of members, billing for unnecessary medical services and improper marketing. Certain of our businesses are subject to state general agent, broker and sales distributions laws and regulations. UnitedHealthcare Community & State and certain of our Optum businesses are subject to regulation by state Medicaid agencies that oversee the provision of benefits to our Medicaid and CHIP beneficiaries and to our dually eligible (for Medicare and Medicaid) beneficiaries. We also contract with state governmental entities and are subject to state laws and regulations relating to the award, administration and performance of state government contracts.

Guaranty Fund Assessments.Under state guaranty fund laws, certain insurance companies can be assessed (up to prescribed limits) for certain obligations to the policyholders and claimants of insolvent insurance companies that write the same line or similar lines of business. Assessments are generally based on a formula relating to premiums in the state compared to the premiums of other insurers and could be spread out over a period of years. Some states permit member insurers to recover assessments paid through full or partial premium tax offsets. Any such assessment could expose our insurance entities and other insurers to the risk of paying a portion of an insolvent insurance company’s claims through state guaranty association assessments in future periods.

Pharmacy Regulation.OptumRx’s home delivery pharmacies must be licensed as pharmacies in the states in which they are located. Our home delivery pharmacies must also register with the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration and individual state controlled substance authorities to dispense controlled substances. In addition to the laws and regulations in the states where our home delivery pharmacies are located, laws and regulations in non-resident states where we deliver pharmaceuticals may also apply, including the requirement to register with the board of pharmacy in the non-resident state. These non-resident states generally expect our home delivery pharmacies to follow the laws of the state in which the pharmacies are located, but some states also require us to comply with the laws of that non-resident state when pharmaceuticals are delivered there. As our home delivery pharmacies maintain certain Medicare and state Medicaid provider numbers, their participation in the programs requires them to comply with the applicable Medicare and Medicaid provider rules and regulations. Other laws and regulations affecting our home delivery pharmacies include federal and state statutes and regulations governing the labeling, packaging, advertising and adulteration of prescription drugs and dispensing of controlled substances. See Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors” for a discussion of the risks related to our PBM businesses.

State Privacy and Security Regulations.A number of states have adopted laws and regulations that may affect our privacy and security practices, such as state laws that govern the use, disclosure and protection of social security numbers and sensitive health information or that are designed to implement GLBA or protect credit card account data. State and local authorities









increasingly focus on the importance of protecting individuals from identity theft, with a significant number of states enacting laws requiring businesses to notify individuals of security breaches involving personal information. State consumer protection laws may also apply to privacy and security practices related to personally identifiable information, including information related to consumers and care providers. Additionally, different approaches to state privacy and insurance regulation and varying enforcement philosophies in the different states may materially and adversely affect our ability to standardize our products and services across state lines. See Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors” for a discussion of the risks related to compliance with state privacy and security regulations.

Corporate Practice of Medicine and Fee-Splitting Laws.Certain of our businesses function as direct medical service providers and, as such, are subject to additional laws and regulations. Some states have corporate practice of medicine laws that prohibit specific types of entities from practicing medicine or employing physicians to practice medicine. Moreover, some states prohibit certain entities from sharing in the fees or revenues of a professional practice (fee-splitting). These prohibitions may be statutory or regulatory, or may be imposed through judicial or regulatory interpretation. The laws, regulations and interpretations in certain states have been subject to limited judicial and regulatory interpretation and are subject to change.

Consumer Protection Laws.Certain of our businesses participate in direct-to-consumer activities and are subject to emerging regulations applicable to on-line communications and other general consumer protection laws and regulations.

Banking Regulation

Optum Bank is subject to regulation by federal banking regulators, including the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, which performs annual examinations to ensure that the bank is operating in accordance with federal safety and soundness requirements, and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which may perform periodic examinations to ensure that the bank is in compliance with applicable consumer protection statutes, regulations and agency guidelines. Optum Bank is also subject to supervision and regulation by the Utah State Department of Financial Institutions, which carries out annual examinations to ensure that the bank is operating in accordance with state safety and soundness requirements and performs periodic examinations of the bank’s compliance with applicable state banking statutes, regulations and agency guidelines. In the event of unfavorable examination results from any of these agencies, the bank could become subject to increased operational expenses and capital requirements, enhanced governmental oversight and monetary penalties.

International Regulation

COMPETITION









compete effectively to maintain or increase our market share, including by maintaining or increasing enrollments in businesses providing health benefits, our results of operations, financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected. See Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors,” for additional discussion of our risks related to competition.
