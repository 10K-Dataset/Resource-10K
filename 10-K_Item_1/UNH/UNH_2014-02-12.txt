ITEM  1.    BUSINESS

INTRODUCTION

Overview

UnitedHealth Group is a diversified health and well-being company dedicated to helping people live healthier lives and making the health system work better for everyone. The terms “we,” “our,” “us,” “UnitedHealth Group,” or the “Company” used in this report refer to UnitedHealth Group Incorporated and our subsidiaries.

Through our diversified family of businesses, we leverage core competencies in advanced, enabling technology; health care data, information and intelligence; and clinical care management and coordination to help meet the demands of the health system. These core competencies are deployed within our two distinct, but strategically aligned, business platforms: health benefits operating under UnitedHealthcare and health services operating under Optum.

UnitedHealthcare provides health care benefits to a full spectrum of customers and markets. UnitedHealthcare Employer & Individual serves employers ranging from sole proprietorships to large, multi-site and national employers, as well as students and other individuals, and serves the nation’s active and retired military and their families through the TRICARE program. UnitedHealthcare Medicare & Retirement delivers health and well-being benefits for Medicare beneficiaries and retirees. UnitedHealthcare Community & State manages health care benefit programs on behalf of state Medicaid and community programs and their participants. UnitedHealthcare International includes Amil, a health care company providing health and dental benefits and hospital and clinical services to individuals in Brazil, and other diversified global health businesses.

Optum is a health services business serving the broad health care marketplace, including payers, care providers, employers, government, life sciences companies and consumers, through its OptumHealth, OptumInsight and OptumRx businesses. These businesses have dedicated units that help improve overall health system performance including optimizing care quality, reducing costs and improving consumer experience and care provider performance across eight business markets: integrated care delivery, care management, consumer engagement, distribution services, health financial services, operational services and support, health care information technology and pharmacy services.

Through UnitedHealthcare and Optum, in 2013, we managed over $160 billion in aggregate health care spending on behalf of the constituents and consumers we served. Our revenues are derived from premiums on risk-based products; fees from management, administrative, technology and consulting services; sales of a wide variety of products and services related to the broad health and well-being industry; and investment and other income. Our two business platforms have four reportable segments:

•UnitedHealthcare, which includes UnitedHealthcare Employer & Individual, UnitedHealthcare Medicare & Retirement, UnitedHealthcare Community & State and UnitedHealthcare International;

•OptumHealth;

•OptumInsight; and

•OptumRx.

For our financial results and the presentation of certain other financial information by segment, including revenues and long-lived fixed assets by geographic source, see Note 13 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8, “Financial Statements.”

2014 Business Realignment

On January 1, 2014, we realigned certain of our businesses to respond to changes in the markets we serve and the opportunities that are emerging as the health system evolves. Our Optum business platform took responsibility for certain technology operations and business processing activities with the intention of pursuing additional third-party commercial opportunities in addition to continuing to serve UnitedHealthcare. These activities, which were historically a corporate function, will be included in OptumInsight’s results of operations. Our periodic filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) beginning with our first quarter 2014 Form 10-Q will include historical segment results restated to reflect the effect of this realignment and will continue to present the same four reportable segments (UnitedHealthcare, OptumHealth, OptumInsight and OptumRx).










UnitedHealthcare

UnitedHealthcare is advancing strategies to improve the way health care is delivered and financed, offering consumers a simpler, more affordable health care experience. Our market position is built on:

•a national scale;

•strong local market relationships;

•the breadth of product offerings, which are responsive to many distinct market segments in health care;

•service and advanced technology;

•competitive medical and operating cost positions;

•effective clinical engagement;

•extensive expertise in distinct market segments; and

•innovation for customers.

UnitedHealthcare utilizes the expertise of UnitedHealth Group affiliates for capabilities in specialized areas, such as OptumRx pharmacy benefit products and services, certain OptumHealth care management and integrated care delivery services and OptumInsight health information and technology solutions, consulting and other services.

In the United States, UnitedHealthcare arranges for discounted access to care through networks that include a total of over 820,000 physicians and other health care professionals and approximately 6,000 hospitals and other facilities.

UnitedHealthcare is subject to extensive regulations. See further discussion of our regulatory environment below under “Government Regulation” and in Item 7, “Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”

UnitedHealthcare Employer & Individual

UnitedHealthcare Employer & Individual offers a comprehensive array of consumer-oriented health benefit plans and services for large national employers, public sector employers, mid-sized employers, small businesses, individuals, and the military, specifically TRICARE west region members. UnitedHealthcare Employer & Individual provides over 30 million Americans access to health care as ofDecember 31, 2013. Large employer groups typically use self-funded arrangements where UnitedHealthcare Employer & Individual earns a service fee. Smaller employer groups are more likely to purchase risk-based products because they are less willing or able to bear a greater potential liability for health care expenditures.

Through its risk-based product offerings, UnitedHealthcare Employer & Individual assumes the risk of both medical and administrative costs for its customers in return for a monthly premium, which is typically at a fixed rate per individual served for a one-year period. When providing administrative and other management services to customers that elect to self-fund the health care costs of their employees and employees’ dependants, UnitedHealthcare Employer & Individual receives a fixed service fee per individual served. These customers retain the risk of financing medical benefits for their employees and employees’ dependants, while UnitedHealthcare Employer & Individual provides services such as coordination and facilitation of medical and related services to customers, consumers and health care professionals, administration of transaction processing and access to a contracted network of physicians, hospitals and other health care professionals, including dental and vision.

UnitedHealthcare Employer & Individual also offers a variety of non-employer based insurance options for purchase by individuals, including students, which are designed to meet the health coverage needs of these consumers and their families. As part of the new public health care exchange market that opened October 1, 2013, UnitedHealthcare Employer & Individual now offers health benefit plans through exchanges in 10 states and District of Columbia, including four individual exchanges and nine small group (SHOP) exchanges.

The consolidated purchasing capacity represented by the individuals UnitedHealth Group serves makes it possible for UnitedHealthcare Employer & Individual to contract for cost-effective access to a large number of conveniently located care professionals.

UnitedHealthcare Employer & Individual typically distributes its products through consultant or direct sales in the larger employer and public sector segments. In the smaller group size segment of the commercial marketplace, UnitedHealthcare Employer & Individual’s distribution system consists primarily of direct sales and producers, including brokers and agents. UnitedHealthcare Employer & Individual also distributes products through general agents, each of which is a wholesale agent or agency that contracts with a carrier to distribute individual or group benefits, providing extensive services to customers. In recent years, UnitedHealthcare Employer & Individual has diversified its model more extensively, distributing through professional employer organizations, associations, private equity relationships and, increasingly, through both multi-carrier and its own proprietary private exchange marketplaces. UnitedHealthcare Employer & Individual offers its products through










affiliates that are licensed as insurance companies, health maintenance organizations (HMOs), or third party administrators (TPAs).

Direct-to-consumer sales will be supported by industry participation in multi-carrier health insurance marketplaces for individuals and small groups through state or federally led exchanges for coverage effective January 1, 2014. Additionally, UnitedHealthcare Employer & Individual has expanded distribution to include retail offerings responsive to the needs of individual consumers. Over the last few years, UnitedHealthcare Employer & Individual has opened several retail storefronts in various locations across the United States that provide solutions to consumers at all stages in life, from individual plans to employer coverage, as well as solutions for Medicare-Medicaid eligible (MME) individuals.

UnitedHealthcare Employer & Individual’s diverse product portfolio offers a continuum of benefit designs, price points and approaches to consumer engagement, which provide the flexibility to meet the needs of employers of all sizes as well as individuals shopping for health benefits coverage. UnitedHealthcare Employer & Individual emphasizes local markets and leverages its national scale to adapt products to meet specific local market needs. UnitedHealthcare Employer & Individual’s major product families include:

Traditional Products.Traditional products include a full range of medical benefits and network options from managed plans such as Choice and Options PPO to more traditional indemnity offerings. The plans offer a full spectrum of covered services, including preventive care, direct access to specialists and catastrophic protection.

Consumer Engagement Products and Tools.Consumer engagement products couple plan design with financial accounts to increase employee responsibility for their health and well-being. This suite of products includes high-deductible consumer-driven benefit plans, which include health reimbursement accounts (HRAs), health savings accounts (HSAs) and consumer activation services such as personalized behavioral incentive programs and consumer education information. For example, UnitedHealthcare Employer & Individual’s Diabetes Health Plan emphasizes health engagement for diabetics and prediabetics, with personalized health action plans, scorecards and benefits that are specifically designed to encourage consumers to participate actively in maintaining their health. During 2013, more than 45,000 employer-sponsored benefit plans, including nearly 270 employers in the large group self-funded market, purchased an HRA or HSA product. UnitedHealthcare Employer & Individual’s consumer engagement tools provide members with online and/or mobile access to benefit, cost and quality information, such as myHealthcare Cost Estimator, Health4Me, and myClaims Manager with online bill payment.

Value-Based Products.UnitedHealthcare Employer & Individual’s suite of consumer incentive products increases individual awareness for heightened consumer responsibility and behavior change. These products include: Small Business Wellness, which is a packaged wellness and incentives product offering gym reimbursement and encouraging completion of important wellness activities. For mid-sized clients, SimplyEngaged is a scalable activity-based reward program that ties incentives to completion of health improvement activities, while SimplyEngaged Plus provides richer incentives for achieving health outcome goals. For large, self-funded customers, the UnitedHealthcare Healthy Rewards program offers a flexible incentive design for employers to choose the right activities and biometric outcomes that best fit the needs of their population. Additionally, UnitedHealth Personal Rewards leverages a tailored approach to incentives by combining personalized scorecards with financial incentives for improving biometric scores, compliance with key health treatments and preventive care.

Essential Benefits Products.UnitedHealthcare Employer & Individual’s portfolio of products drives value to consumers with lower costs, innovative designs and unique network programs that guide people to physicians recognized for providing high-quality, cost-efficient care to their patients. These approaches are designed to deliver sustainable health care costs for employers, enabling them to continue to offer their employees coverage at more affordable prices through benefit and local network access tradeoffs. UnitedHealthcare Employer & Individual’s tiered benefit plans offer enhanced benefits in the form of greater coinsurance coverage and/or lower copays for using UnitedHealth Premium®designated care providers.

Clinical and Pharmacy Products.UnitedHealthcare Employer & Individual offers a comprehensive suite of clinical and pharmacy benefits management programs, which complement our service offerings by improving quality of care, engaging members and providing cost-saving options. All UnitedHealthcare Employer & Individual members are provided access to clinical products that help them make better health care decisions and better use of their medical benefits, improving health and decreasing medical expenses.

Each medical plan has a core set of clinical programs embedded in the offering, with additional services available depending on funding type (fully insured and self-funded), line of business (e.g. small business, key accounts, public sector and national accounts), and clinical need. UnitedHealthcare Employer & Individual’s spectrum of clinical programs include:

•wellness programs;

•decision support;










•utilization management;

•case and disease management;

•complex condition management;

•on-site programs, including Know Your Numbers (biometrics) and flu shots;

•incentives to reinforce positive behavior change;

•mental health/substance use disorder management; and

•employee assistance programs.

UnitedHealthcare Employer & Individual’s comprehensive and integrated pharmaceutical management services promote lower costs by using formulary programs to drive better unit costs, encouraging consumers to use drugs that offer better value and outcomes, and by supporting the appropriate use of drugs based on clinical evidence through physician and consumer programs.

Specialty Offerings. UnitedHealthcare Employer & Individual also delivers dental, vision, life, and disability product offerings through an integrated approach including a network of more than 58,000 vision professionals in private and retail settings, and more than 250,000 dental providers.

UnitedHealthcare Military & Veterans.UnitedHealthcare Military & Veterans is the provider of health care services for more than 2.9 million active duty and retired military service members and their families in 21 states (West Region) under the Department of Defense’s (DoD) TRICARE Managed Care Support contract. The contract began on April 1, 2013 and includes a transition period and five one-year renewals at the government’s option.

UnitedHealthcare Military & Veterans’ responsibility as a contractor is to augment the military’s direct care system by providing managed care support services, provider networks, medical management, claims/enrollment administration, and customer services.

UnitedHealthcare Medicare & Retirement

UnitedHealthcare Medicare & Retirement provides health and well-being services to individuals age 50 and older, addressing their unique needs for preventive and acute health care services as well as for services dealing with chronic disease and other specialized issues for older individuals. UnitedHealthcare Medicare & Retirement is fully dedicated to serving this growing senior market segment, providing products and services in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and most U.S. territories. It has distinct pricing, underwriting, clinical program management and marketing capabilities dedicated to health products and services in this market.

UnitedHealthcare Medicare & Retirement offers a spectrum of risk-based Medicare products which may be purchased by individuals or on a group basis, including Medicare Advantage plans, Medicare Prescription Drug Benefit (Medicare Part D) and Medicare Supplement/Medigap products that supplement traditional fee-for-service coverage. UnitedHealthcare Medicare & Retirement services include care management and clinical management programs, a nurse health line service, 24-hour access to health care information, access to discounted health services from a network of care providers and administrative services.

Premium revenues from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) represented 29% of UnitedHealth Group’s total consolidated revenues for the year endedDecember 31, 2013, most of which were generated by UnitedHealthcare Medicare & Retirement under a number of contracts.

UnitedHealthcare Medicare & Retirement has extensive distribution capabilities and experience, including direct marketing to consumers on behalf of its key clients: AARP, the nation’s largest membership organization dedicated to the needs of people age 50 and over; state and U.S. government agencies; and employer groups. Products are also offered through employer groups and agent channels.

UnitedHealthcare Medicare & Retirement’s major product categories include:

Medicare Advantage.UnitedHealthcare Medicare & Retirement provides health care coverage for seniors and other eligible Medicare beneficiaries primarily through the Medicare Advantage program administered by CMS, including Medicare Advantage HMO plans, preferred provider organization (PPO) plans, Point-of-Service plans, Private-Fee-for-Service plans and Special Needs Plans (SNPs). Under the Medicare Advantage program, UnitedHealthcare Medicare & Retirement provides health insurance coverage in exchange for a fixed monthly premium per member from CMS and in some cases consumer premiums. Premium amounts vary based on the geographic areas in which members reside; demographic factors such as age, gender, and institutionalized status; and the health status of the individual. UnitedHealthcare Medicare & Retirement had approximately 3 million people enrolled in its Medicare Advantage products as ofDecember 31, 2013.










Medicare Advantage plans are designed at the local level taking into account member and care provider preferences, competitor offerings, our historical financial results, our quality and cost initiatives and the long-term payment rate outlook for that geographic area. Starting in 2012, and phased in through 2017, the Medicare Advantage rate structure and quality rating bonuses are changing significantly, see Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” for further information.

UnitedHealthcare Medicare & Retirement offers innovative care management, disease management and other clinical programs, integrating federal, state and personal funding through its continuum of Medicare Advantage products. For high-risk patients in certain care settings and programs, UnitedHealthcare Medicare & Retirement uses proprietary, automated medical record software that enables clinical care teams to capture and track patient data and clinical encounters, creating a comprehensive set of care information that bridges across home, hospital and nursing home care settings. Proprietary predictive modeling tools help identify members at high risk and allow care managers to outreach to members to create individualized care plans and to help members obtain the right care, in the right place, at the right time.

Medicare Part D.UnitedHealthcare Medicare & Retirement provides Medicare Part D benefits to beneficiaries throughout the United States and its territories through its Medicare Advantage and stand-alone Medicare Part D plans. UnitedHealthcare Medicare & Retirement offers two standalone Medicare Part D plans: the AARP Medicare Rx Preferred and the AARP Medicare Rx Saver plans. The stand-alone Medicare Part D plans address a large spectrum of beneficiaries’ needs and preferences for their prescription drug coverage, including low cost prescription options. Each of the plans cover the majority of the drugs covered by Medicare and provides varying levels of coverage to meet the diverse needs of Medicare beneficiaries. As ofDecember 31, 2013, UnitedHealthcare had enrolled approximately 8 million people in the Medicare Part D program, including approximately 5 million individuals in the stand-alone Medicare Part D plans and approximately 3 million in its Medicare Advantage plans incorporating Medicare Part D coverage.

Medicare Supplement.UnitedHealthcare Medicare & Retirement is currently serving more than 4 million seniors through various Medicare Supplement products in association with AARP. UnitedHealthcare Medicare & Retirement offers plans in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and most U.S. territories. These products cover varying levels of coinsurance and deductible gaps that seniors are exposed to in the traditional Medicare program.

UnitedHealthcare Community & State

UnitedHealthcare Community & State is dedicated to providing diversified solutions to states’ programs that care for the economically disadvantaged, the medically underserved and those without the benefit of employer-funded health care coverage in exchange for a fixed monthly premium per member from the applicable state. UnitedHealthcare Community & State’s primary customers oversee Medicaid plans, Children’s Health Insurance Programs (CHIP), and other federal, state and community health care programs. As ofDecember 31, 2013, UnitedHealthcare Community & State participated in programs in 24 states and the District of Columbia, and served more than 4 million beneficiaries. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and a reconciliation measure, the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (together, Health Reform Legislation) provides for optional Medicaid expansion effective January 1, 2014. Currently, more than half of our state customers have elected to expand Medicaid. For further discussion of the Medicaid expansion under Health Reform Legislation, see Item 7, “Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”

States using managed care services for Medicaid beneficiaries select health plans by using a formal bid process or by awarding individual contracts. A number of factors are considered by UnitedHealthcare Community & State when choosing programs for participation including the state’s commitment and consistency of support for its Medicaid managed care program in terms of service, innovation and funding; the eligible population base, both immediate and long term; and the structure of the projected program. UnitedHealthcare Community & State works with its state customers to advocate for actuarially sound rates that are commensurate with medical cost trends.

The primary categories of eligibility for the programs served by UnitedHealthcare Community & State and our participation are:

•Temporary Assistance to Needy Families, primarily young women and children – 19 markets;

•CHIP – 19 markets;

•Dual SNP – 18 markets;

•Aged, Blind and Disabled (ABD) – 14 markets;

•Long-Term Care (LTC) – 10 markets;

•childless adults & programs for the uninsured – 7 markets;

•other programs (e.g., developmentally disabled, rehabilitative services) – 5 markets; and

•administrative service offering – 1 market.










The LTC market represents only 6% of the total Medicaid population, yet accounts for more than 30% of total Medicaid expenditures. The LTC population is made up of nearly 4 million individuals who qualify for additional benefits under LTC programs and represent a subset of the more than 15 million ABD Americans. Currently, only one-quarter of the ABD population and less than 20% of the LTC eligible population are served by managed care programs. States are increasingly looking for solutions to not only help control costs, but to improve quality for the complex medical challenges faced by this population and are moving with greater speed to managed care programs.

There are nearly 10 million individuals eligible for both Medicare and Medicaid. This group has historically been referred to as dually eligible. MME beneficiaries typically have complex conditions with costs of care that are far higher than a typical Medicare or Medicaid beneficiary. While these individuals’ health needs are more complex and more costly, they have been historically served in unmanaged environments. This market provides UnitedHealthcare an opportunity to integrate Medicare and Medicaid funding and optimize people’s health status through close coordination of care.

Total annual expenditures for dually eligibles are estimated at more than $300 billion, or more than 10% of the total health care costs in the United States. As of December 31, 2013, UnitedHealthcare served more than 275,000 people in legacy dually eligible programs through Medicare Advantage and SNPs. In 2013, UnitedHealthcare Community & State implemented a managed fee-for-service demonstration model in the state of Washington. In 2014, UnitedHealthcare Community & State will help implement MME programs in the states of Ohio, Washington and Michigan. These programs are among the first in the country to leverage CMS’ demonstrations to serve MMEs.

UnitedHealthcare International

UnitedHealthcare International participates in international markets through national “in country” and cross-border strategic approaches. UnitedHealthcare International’s cross-border health care business provides comprehensive health benefits, care management and care delivery for multinational employers, governments and individuals around the world. UnitedHealthcare International’s goal is to create business solutions that are based on local infrastructure, culture and needs, and that blend local expertise with experiences from the U.S. health care industry. As of December 31, 2013, UnitedHealthcare International provided medical benefits to 4.8 million people, principally in Brazil, but also residing in more than 125 countries.

Amil.In 2012, UnitedHealthcare International acquired Amil, which provides health and dental benefits to nearly 7 million people and also operates 25 acute hospitals, as well as specialty clinics, primary care, and emergency services across Brazil, principally for the benefit of its members. Amil’s patients are also treated in its contracted provider network of 21,000 physicians and other health care professionals, 2,100 hospitals and 7,900 laboratories and diagnostic imaging centers. Amil offers a diversified product portfolio with a wide range of product offerings, benefit designs, price points and value, including indemnity products. Amil’s products include various administrative services such as network access and administration, care management and personal health services and claims processing.

Other Operations.UnitedHealthcare International also includes other diversified global health services operations with a variety of offerings for international customers, including:

•network access and care coordination in the United States and overseas;

•TPA products and services for health plans and TPAs;

•brokerage services;

•practice management services for care providers;










•government and corporate consulting services for improving quality and efficiency; and

•global expatriate insurance solutions.

Optum

Optum is a health services business serving the broad health care marketplace, including:

•Those who need care: the consumers and patients who need the right support, information, resources and products to achieve their health goals.

•Those who provide care: physicians and other care providers, hospitals and clinical facilities seeking to modernize in ways that enable the best patient care and experience possible, delivered cost-effectively.

•Those who pay for care: insurers, employers and government agencies devoted to ensuring that those they sponsor receive high-quality care, administered and delivered efficiently.

•Those who innovate for care: life sciences and research focused organizations dedicated to developing more effective approaches, enabling technologies and medicines that improve the delivery and quality of care.

Using advanced data, analytics and technology, Optum helps improve overall health system performance by optimizing care quality, reducing costs and improving the consumer experience and care provider performance. Optum is organized in three reportable segments:

•OptumHealth focuses on care management, integrated care delivery, and consumer solutions, including financial services;

•OptumInsight delivers operational services and support and health information technology services; and

•OptumRx specializes in pharmacy services.

OptumHealth

OptumHealth is a diversified health and wellness business serving the physical, emotional and financial needs of more than 62 million unique individuals and enabling consumer health management through programs offered by employers, payers, government entities and, increasingly, directly through the care delivery system. OptumHealth’s products and services can be deployed individually or integrated to provide more comprehensive solutions, addressing a broad base of needs within the health care system. These solutions are focused on improving quality and patient satisfaction and lowering costs by working to optimize the care delivery system through the creation of high-performing networks, centers of excellence across the care continuum, working directly with physicians to advance population health management and focusing on caring for the most medically complex patients.

OptumHealth offers its products on a risk basis, where it assumes responsibility for health care costs in exchange for a fixed monthly premium per individual served, and on an administrative fee basis whereby it manages or administers delivery of the products or services in exchange for a fixed fee per individual served. For its financial services offerings, OptumHealth charges fees and earns investment income on managed funds.

OptumHealth sells its products primarily through its direct sales force, strategic collaborations and external producers in three markets: employers (which includes the sub-markets of large, mid-sized and small employers), payers (which includes the sub-markets of health plans, TPAs, underwriter/stop-loss carriers and individual market intermediaries) and government entities (which includes states, CMS, DoD, Veterans Administration and other federal procurement agencies). As provider reimbursement models evolve, care providers are emerging as a fourth market for the health management, financial services and integrated care delivery businesses.

OptumHealth is organized into two major operating groups: Physician Solutions and Consumer Solutions.

Physician Solutions.Physician Solutions includes the Specialty Networks and Integrated Care Delivery offerings.

•Specialty Networks.Within Specialty Networks, OptumHealth serves nearly 57 million people in two primary ways: 1) creating access to networks of provider specialists in the areas of behavioral health management (e.g., mental health, substance abuse), global well-being (e.g., international work/life solutions), chronic physical health management (e.g., chiropractic, physical therapy), and complex medical conditions (e.g., transplant, infertility); and 2) managing the care and health needs for consumers through a variety of programs utilizing predictive modeling, evidence-based clinical outcomes management and peer support. Specialty Networks address areas likely to have significant variation in clinical practice, where a disciplined, evidence-based approach can drive improved health outcomes and reduced costs. These range from more commonly accessed services (e.g., behavioral health and chiropractic) to less common procedures (e.g. transplant, infertility, bariatric surgery and kidney disease/end stage renal disease).










•Integrated Care Delivery. Integrated Care Delivery serves patients through a collaborative network aligned around total population health management and outcomes-based reimbursement. Within its local care delivery systems, OptumHealth works directly with medical groups and Independent Practice Associations to deploy a core set of technology, risk management, analytical and clinical capabilities and tools to assist physicians in delivering high-quality care across the populations they serve. Integrated Care Delivery’s complex population management services focus on improving care for patients with very challenging medical conditions by providing the optimal care in the most desirable setting. Integrated Care Delivery’s LHI business designs and implements mobile care delivery solutions, providing occupational health, medical and dental readiness services, treatments and immunization programs for the U.S. military and U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), as well as for many commercial companies.

Consumer Solutions.Consumer Solutions includes health management solutions, distribution and financial services operations.

•Health Management Solutions: OptumHealth serves over 37 million people through population health management services including care management, complex conditions (e.g., cancer, neonatal and maternity) health and wellness, and advocacy decision support solutions. This set of services helps consumers navigate the health care system and make decisions about their care and treatment, resulting in better clinical outcomes and lower medical costs.

•Distribution:This business provides capabilities to help payers, aggregators and employers meet the needs of the consumers they serve. The consumer engagement and sales distribution platform is backed by a spectrum of health and wellness services. The consumer engagement platform is a technology-enabled engagement model that is helping health care companies, including health plans, grow and manage their consumer relationships. OptumHealth provides call center support, multi-modal communications software, data analysis and trained nurses that help clients acquire, retain and service large populations of health care consumers.

•Financial Services: This business is dedicated solely to providing financial solutions for the health care market, serving the needs of individuals, employers, health care professionals and payers. OptumHealth is a leading provider of consumer health care accounts including health savings, health reimbursement, health incentive, retiree reimbursement and flexible spending accounts, that help people plan and save for current and future health care expenses. Payers, health care professionals and employers rely upon OptumHealth’s electronic payment solutions to manage compliance and improve the administrative efficiency of electronic claim payments. OptumHealth also offers health care related lending and credit to health care providers to support the modernization of their practices, and financial risk protection for third-party payers and self-funded employers. As ofDecember 31, 2013, Financial Services and its wholly owned subsidiary, Optum Bank, had $2.3 billion in customer assets under management and during 2013 processed $78 billion in medical payments to physicians and other health care providers.

OptumInsight

OptumInsight provides technology, operational and consulting services to participants in the health care industry. Hospitals, physicians, commercial health plans, government agencies, life sciences companies and other organizations that comprise the health care system use OptumInsight to help them reduce costs, meet compliance mandates, improve clinical performance and adapt to the changing health system landscape.

Many of OptumInsight’s software and information products, advisory consulting arrangements, and outsourcing contracts are performed over an extended period, often several years. OptumInsight maintains an order backlog to track unearned revenues under these long-term arrangements. The backlog consists of estimated revenue from signed contracts, other legally binding agreements and anticipated contract renewals based on historical experience that either have not started but are anticipated to begin in the near future, or are in process and have not been completed. OptumInsight’s aggregate backlog at December 31, 2013 was $5.5 billion, of which $2.7 billion is expected to be realized within the next 12 months. This includes $1.1 billion related to intersegment agreements, all of which are included in the current portion of the backlog. OptumInsight’s aggregate backlog at December 31, 2012 was $4.6 billion. The increase in 2013 backlog was attributable to the partnership with Dignity Health that established the Optum360 provider revenue management business. OptumInsight cannot provide any assurance that it will be able to realize all of the revenues included in backlog due to uncertainty regarding the timing and scope of services, the potential for cancellation, non-renewal, or early termination of service arrangements.









OptumInsight’s products and services are sold primarily through a direct sales force. OptumInsight’s products are also supported and distributed through an array of alliance and business partnerships with other technology vendors, who integrate and interface OptumInsight’s products with their applications.

OptumInsight provides capabilities targeted to the needs of four primary market segments: care providers (e.g., physician practices and hospitals), commercial payers, governments and life sciences.










Care Providers.Serving four out of five U.S. hospitals and tens of thousands of physician practices, OptumInsight provides capabilities that help drive financial performance, meet compliance requirements, and deliver health intelligence. OptumInsight’s offerings in clinical workflow, revenue management, health IT and analytics helps hospitals and physician practices improve patient outcomes, strengthen financial performance and meet quality measurement and compliance requirements, as well as transition to new collaborative and accountable care business models.

Commercial Payers.OptumInsight serves approximately 300 health plans with employer, individual, Medicare, and Medicaid membership. OptumInsight applies its solutions across the payer’s operations, helping clients to improve operational and administrative efficiency, meet clinical performance and compliance goals, develop strong provider networks, manage risk and drive growth. OptumInsight is also helping payer clients adapt to new market models, including health insurance exchanges, consumer driven health care and engagement, pay-for-value contracting, and population health management.

Governments.OptumInsight provides services to state, federal and municipal agencies and departments, across 35 states and the District of Columbia. Services include financial management and program integrity services, policy and compliance consulting, data and analytics technology, systems integration and expertise to improve medical quality, access and costs.

Life Sciences.OptumInsight’s Life Sciences business provides services to more than 400 global life sciences organizations. OptumInsight’s services use real-world evidence to support market access and positioning of their products, to deliver strategic regulatory services, to provide insights into patient reported outcomes and to optimize and manage risk.

OptumRx

OptumRx provides a range of pharmacy benefit management (PBM) services to nearly 28 million people nationwide, managing approximately $33 billion in pharmaceutical spending annually and processing an annual run rate of more than one-half billion adjusted retail, mail and specialty drug prescriptions. OptumRx’s PBM services include retail pharmacy network management services, mail order and specialty pharmacy services, manufacturer rebate contracting and administration, benefit plan design and consultation, claims processing, Medicare Part D services, and a variety of clinical programs such as formulary management and compliance, drug utilization review and disease and drug therapy management services. OptumRx has a network of more than 67,000 retail pharmacies and two mail services facilities in California and Kansas.

The mail order and specialty pharmacy fulfillment capabilities of OptumRx are an important strategic component of its business, providing patients with convenient access to maintenance medications, offering a broad range of complex drug therapies and patient management services for individuals with chronic health conditions, and enabling OptumRx to manage its clients’ drug costs through operating efficiencies and economies of scale.

OptumRx provides PBM services to UnitedHealthcare members enrolled in benefit plans that offer pharmacy benefits. Throughout the course of 2013, OptumRx transitioned 12 million new or migrating UnitedHealthcare commercial members. Additionally, OptumRx managed specialty pharmacy benefits across nearly all of UnitedHealthcare’s businesses with services including patient support and clinical programs that ensure quality and value for consumers. Specialty drug management is important in managing overall drug spend, as biologicals and other specialty medications are fast growing pharmacy expenditures. OptumRx also provides PBM services to non-affiliated external clients, including public and private sector employer groups, insurance companies, Taft-Hartley Trust Funds, TPAs, managed care organizations (MCOs), Medicare-contracted plans, Medicaid plans and other sponsors of health benefit plans and individuals throughout the United States. OptumRx’s distribution system consists primarily of health insurance brokers and other health care consultants and direct sales.

GOVERNMENT REGULATION

Most of our health and well-being businesses are subject to comprehensive federal, state and international laws and regulations. We are regulated by federal, state and international regulatory agencies that generally have discretion to issue regulations and interpret and enforce laws and rules. These regulations can vary significantly from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, and the interpretation of existing laws and rules also may change periodically. Domestic and international governments continue to enact and consider various legislative and regulatory proposals that could materially impact certain aspects of the health care system. New laws, regulations and rules, or changes in the interpretation of existing laws, regulations and rules, including as a result of changes in the political climate, could adversely affect our business.

In the event we fail to comply with, or we fail to respond quickly and appropriately to changes in, applicable laws, regulations and rules, our business, results of operations, financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected. See Item 1A, “Risk Factors” for a discussion of the risks related to compliance with federal, state and international laws and regulations.












Federal Laws and Regulation

We are subject to various levels of U.S. federal regulation. For example, when we contract with the federal government, we are subject to federal laws and regulations relating to the award, administration and performance of U.S. government contracts. CMS regulates our UnitedHealthcare businesses, and certain aspects of our Optum businesses. Payments by CMS to our businesses are subject to regulations including the submission of information relating to the health status of enrollees for purposes of determining the amount of certain payments to us. CMS also has the right to audit our performance to determine our compliance with CMS contracts and regulations and the quality of care we provide to Medicare beneficiaries. Our commercial business will also be subject to audits related to risk adjustment and reinsurance data when the programs are implemented starting in 2014.

UnitedHealthcare Community & State has Medicaid and CHIP contracts that are subject to federal regulations regarding services to be provided to Medicaid enrollees, payment for those services and other aspects of these programs. There are many regulations affecting Medicare and Medicaid compliance, and the regulatory environment with respect to these programs has become and will continue to become increasingly complex as a result of Health Reform Legislation. We are also subject to federal law and regulations relating to the administration of contracts with federal agencies that are held by our Optum businesses and UnitedHealthcare Military & Veterans business, such as our TRICARE West Region contract with the DoD.

Certain of our businesses, such as UnitedHealthcare’s eyeglass manufacturing activities and Optum’s high acuity clinical workflow software, hearing aid products and clinical research activities, are subject to regulation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Optum’s clinical research activities are subject to laws and regulations outside of the United States that regulate clinical trials. Our business is also subject to laws and regulations relating to consumer protection, anti-fraud and abuse, anti-kickbacks, false claims, prohibited referrals, inappropriately reducing or limiting health care services, anti-money laundering, securities and antitrust.

Health Care Reform.Health Reform Legislation expands access to coverage and modifies aspects of the commercial insurance market, as well as the Medicaid and Medicare programs, CHIP and other aspects of the health care system.

Among other requirements, Health Reform Legislation has expanded dependant coverage to age 26, expanded benefit requirements, eliminated certain annual and lifetime maximum limits, eliminated certain pre-existing condition limits, required coverage for preventative services without cost to members, required premium rebates if certain medical loss ratios (MLRs) are not met, granted members new and additional appeal rights, created new premium rate review processes, established a system of state and federal exchanges through which consumers can purchase health coverage, imposed new requirements on the format and content of communications (such as explanations of benefits) between health insurers and their members, reduced the Medicare Part D coverage gap and reduced payments to private plans offering Medicare Advantage.

Health Reform Legislation and the related federal and state regulations are affecting how we do business and could impact our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. The full impact of Health Reform Legislation remains difficult to predict and is not yet fully known. See also Item 1A, “Risk Factors” and Item 7, “Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” for a discussion of the risks related to Health Reform Legislation and related matters.

Privacy, Security, and Data Standards Regulation.The administrative simplification provisions of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended (HIPAA), apply to both the group and individual health insurance markets, including self-funded employee benefit plans. Federal regulations related to HIPAA contain minimum standards for electronic transactions and code sets, and for the privacy and security of protected health information. ICD-9, the current system of assigning codes to diagnoses and procedures associated with hospital utilization in the United States, will be replaced by ICD-10 code sets on October 1, 2014, and health plans and providers will be required to use ICD-10 codes for such diagnoses and procedures for dates of services on or after such date.

The Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (HITECH) significantly expanded the privacy and security provisions of HIPAA. HITECH imposes additional requirements on uses and disclosures of health information; includes new contracting requirements for HIPAA business associate agreements; extends parts of HIPAA privacy and security provisions to business associates; adds new federal data breach notification requirements for covered entities and business associates and new reporting requirements to HHS and the Federal Trade Commission and, in some cases, to the local media; strengthens enforcement and imposes higher financial penalties for HIPAA violations and, in certain cases, imposes criminal penalties for individuals, including employees. In the conduct of our business, we may act, depending on the circumstances, as either a covered entity or a business associate. Federal consumer protection laws may also apply in some instances to privacy and security practices related to personally identifiable information.










The use and disclosure of individually identifiable health data by our businesses is also regulated in some instances by other federal laws, including the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA) or state statutes implementing GLBA. These federal laws and state statutes generally require insurers to provide customers with notice regarding how their non-public personal health and financial information is used and the opportunity to “opt out” of certain disclosures before the insurer shares such information with a third party, and generally require safeguards for the protection of personal information. Neither the GLBA nor HIPAA privacy regulations preempt more stringent state laws and regulations that may apply to us, as discussed below.

ERISA.The Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (ERISA), regulates how our services are provided to or through certain types of employer-sponsored health benefit plans. ERISA is a set of laws and regulations that is subject to periodic interpretation by the DOL as well as the federal courts. ERISA places controls on how our business units may do business with employers who sponsor employee benefit health plans, particularly those that maintain self-funded plans. Regulations established by the DOL subject us to additional requirements for claims payment and member appeals under health care plans governed by ERISA.

State Laws and Regulation

Health Care Regulation.Our insurance and HMO subsidiaries must be licensed by the jurisdictions in which they conduct business. All of the states in which our subsidiaries offer insurance and HMO products regulate those products and operations. These states require periodic financial reports and establish minimum capital or restricted cash reserve requirements. The National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) has adopted model regulations that, where implemented by states, require expanded governance practices and risk and solvency assessment reporting. Most states have adopted these or similar measures expanding the scope of regulations relating to corporate governance and internal control activities of HMOs and insurance companies. The NAIC also established the Risk Management and Own Risk and Solvency Assessment Model Act that by 2015 will require us to conduct additional group solvency assessments, maintain a risk management framework and file additional reports with state insurance regulators. Certain states have also adopted their own regulations for minimum MLRs with which health plans must comply. In addition, a number of state legislatures have enacted or are contemplating significant reforms of their health insurance markets, either independent of or to comply with or be eligible for grants or other incentives in connection with Health Reform Legislation, which may affect our operations and our financial results.

Health plans and insurance companies are regulated under state insurance holding company regulations. Such regulations generally require registration with applicable state departments of insurance and the filing of reports that describe capital structure, ownership, financial condition, certain intercompany transactions and general business operations. Some state insurance holding company laws and regulations require prior regulatory approval of acquisitions and material intercompany transfers of assets, as well as transactions between the regulated companies and their parent holding companies or affiliates. These laws may restrict the ability of our regulated subsidiaries to pay dividends to our holding companies.

Some of our business activity is subject to other health care-related regulations and requirements, including PPO, MCO, utilization review (UR), or TPA-related regulations and licensure requirements. These regulations differ from state to state, and may contain network, contracting, product and rate, and financial and reporting requirements. There are laws and regulations that set specific standards for delivery of services, appeals, grievances and payment of claims, adequacy of health care professional networks, fraud prevention, protection of consumer health information, pricing and underwriting practices and covered benefits and services. State health care anti-fraud and abuse prohibitions encompass a wide range of activities, including kickbacks for referral of members, billing unnecessary medical services and improper marketing. Certain of our businesses are subject to state general agent, broker, and sales distributions laws and regulations. Our UnitedHealthcare Community & State and certain Optum businesses are subject to regulation by state Medicaid agencies that oversee the provision of benefits to our Medicaid and CHIP beneficiaries and to our dually eligible (for Medicare and Medicaid) beneficiaries. We also contract with state governmental entities and are subject to state laws and regulations relating to the award, administration and performance of state government contracts.

Guaranty Fund Assessments.Under state guaranty fund laws, certain insurance companies (and HMOs in some states) doing business in those states, including those issuing health, long-term care, life and accident insurance policies, can be assessed (up to prescribed limits) for certain obligations to the policyholders and claimants of insolvent insurance companies that write the same line or lines of business. Assessments generally are based on a formula relating to premiums in the state compared to the premiums of other insurers and could be spread out over a period of years. Some states permit member insurers to recover assessments paid through full or partial premium tax offsets.

Pharmacy Regulation.OptumRx’s mail order pharmacies must be licensed as pharmacies in the states in which they are located. Our mail order pharmacies must also register with the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration and individual state controlled substance authorities to dispense controlled substances. In addition to the laws and regulations in the states where our mail order pharmacies are located, laws and regulations in non-resident states where we deliver pharmaceuticals may also










apply, including the requirement to register with the board of pharmacy in the non-resident state. These non-resident states generally expect our mail order pharmacies to follow the laws of the state in which the pharmacies are located, but some states also require us to comply with the laws of that non-resident state when pharmaceuticals are delivered there. Our mail order pharmacies maintain certain Medicare and state Medicaid provider numbers as pharmacies providing services under these programs. Participation in these programs requires the pharmacies to comply with the applicable Medicare and Medicaid provider rules and regulations. Other laws and regulations affecting our mail order pharmacies include federal and state statutes and regulations governing the labeling, packaging, advertising and adulteration of prescription drugs and dispensing of controlled substances. See Item 1A, “Risk Factors” for a discussion of the risks related to our PBM businesses.

State Privacy and Security Regulations.A number of states have adopted laws and regulations that may affect our privacy and security practices, for example, state laws that govern the use, disclosure and protection of social security numbers and sensitive health information or that are designed to implement GLBA or protect credit card account data. State and local authorities increasingly focus on the importance of protecting individuals from identity theft, with a significant number of states enacting laws requiring businesses to notify individuals of security breaches involving personal information. State consumer protection laws may also apply to privacy and security practices related to personally identifiable information, including information related to consumers and care providers. Additionally, different approaches to state privacy and insurance regulation and varying enforcement philosophies in the different states may materially and adversely affect our ability to standardize our products and services across state lines. See Item 1A, “Risk Factors” for a discussion of the risks related to compliance with state privacy and security regulations.

Corporate Practice of Medicine and Fee-Splitting Laws.Certain of our businesses function as direct service providers to care delivery systems and, as such, are subject to additional laws and regulations. Some states have corporate practice of medicine laws that prohibit certain entities from practicing medicine or employing physicians to practice medicine. Additionally, some states prohibit certain entities from sharing in the fees or revenues of a professional practice (fee-splitting). These prohibitions may be statutory or regulatory, or may be a matter of judicial or regulatory interpretation. These laws, regulations and interpretations have, in certain states, been subject to limited judicial and regulatory interpretation and are subject to change.

Consumer Protection Laws.Certain of our businesses participate in direct-to-consumer activities and are subject to emerging regulations applicable to on-line communications and other general consumer protection laws and regulations.

Banking Regulation

Optum Bank is subject to regulation by federal banking regulators, including the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, which performs annual examinations to ensure that the bank is operating in accordance with federal safety and soundness requirements, and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which may perform periodic examinations to ensure that the bank is in compliance with applicable consumer protection statutes, regulations and agency guidelines. Optum Bank is also subject to supervision and regulation by the Utah State Department of Financial Institutions, which carries out annual examinations to ensure that the bank is operating in accordance with state safety and soundness requirements and performs periodic examinations of the bank’s compliance with applicable state banking statutes, regulations and agency guidelines. In the event of unfavorable examination results from any of these agencies, the bank could be subjected to increased operational expenses and capital requirements, enhanced governmental oversight and monetary penalties.
