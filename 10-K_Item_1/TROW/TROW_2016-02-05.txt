Item 1.Business.



T. Rowe Price Group, Inc. is a financial services holding company that provides global investment management services through its subsidiaries to individual and institutional investors in the sponsored T. Rowe Price mutual funds distributed in the United States and other investment portfolios. These other investment portfolios include separately managed accounts, subadvised funds, and other sponsored investment portfolios, including collective investment trusts, target-date retirement trusts, Luxembourg-based funds offered to investors outside the United States, and portfolios offered through variable annuity life insurance plans in the U.S.



The late Thomas Rowe Price, Jr., founded our firm in 1937, and the common stock of T. Rowe Price Associates, Inc. was first offered to the public in 1986. The T. Rowe Price Group corporate holding company structure was established in 2000.



We derive the vast majority of our consolidated net revenue and net income from investment advisory services provided by our subsidiaries, primarily T. Rowe Price Associates and T. Rowe Price International Ltd. Our revenues depend largely on the total value and composition of assets under our management. Accordingly, fluctuations in financial markets and in the composition of assets under management impact our revenues and results of operations. AtDecember 31, 2015, we had$763.1 billionin assets under management, including$487.1 billionin the Price Funds and$276.0 billionin other investment portfolios.



Our assets under management are accumulated from a diversified client base across four primary distribution channels: third-party financial intermediaries that distribute our managed investment portfolios in the U.S. and other countries; individual U.S. investors on a direct basis; U.S. defined contribution retirement plans; and institutional investors globally. As ofDecember 31, 2015, more thanforty-five percentof our assets under management are sourced from our third-party financial intermediary distribution channel with the remaining three distribution channels comprising the balance. We have taken steps to broaden and deepen our distribution reach in overseas markets and with financial intermediaries in the U.S., Europe and Asia. These initiatives are part of multi-year plans designed to further diversify our assets under management and client base. For the foreseeable future, we will continue to make key hires and make investments in infrastructure to support these initiatives.



The assets we manage are a broad range of U.S. and international stock, blended asset, bond, and money market mutual funds and other investment portfolios that are designed to meet the varied and changing needs and objectives of individual and institutional investors. Investors select mutual funds based on the distinct objective that is described in each fund’s prospectus and can exchange balances among the funds as permitted when economic and market conditions and their investment needs change. The investment objectives and investment management approaches employed in our other investment portfolios are similar to those in the Price Funds. We also offer specialized advisory services, including management of stable value investment contracts and a distribution management service for the disposition of equity securities our clients receive from third-party venture capital investment pools.



Investment objectives for our managed investment portfolios, including the Price Funds, accommodate a variety of strategies. Equity investment strategies may emphasize large-cap, mid-cap or small-cap investing; growth, value or core investing; and U.S., global, multi-regional and regional international, emerging market, and sector investing. Our fixed income strategies may focus on high yield, U.S. taxable bond, taxable low-duration, international, global and municipal tax-free investing. We also combine strategies across asset classes to create solutions that help our clients achieve a single investment objective. To this end, we offer systematic, tax-efficient, blended equity, and asset allocation investment strategies, including target-date retirement investment portfolios.



We employ fundamental and quantitative security analysis in the performance of the investment advisory function through substantial internal equity and fixed income investment research capabilities. We perform original industry and company research using such sources as inspection of corporate activities, management interviews, company-published financial and other information, financial newspapers and magazines, corporate rating services, and field checks with suppliers and competitors in the same industry and particular business sector. Our research staff operates primarily from offices located in the U.S. and England with additional staff based in Australia, Hong Kong, Japan, and Singapore. We also use research provided by brokerage firms and security analysts in a supportive capacity and information received from private economists, political observers, commentators, government experts, and market analysts. Our securities selection process for some investment portfolios is based on quantitative analysis using computerized data modeling.



From time to time, we introduce new strategies and investment vehicles to complement and expand our investment offerings, respond to competitive developments in the financial marketplace, and meet the changing needs of our investment advisory clients. We will introduce a new investment strategy if we believe that we have the appropriate investment management

expertise and that its objective will be useful for investors over a long period. We continued to expand our investment offerings in 2015 with new equity and fixed income strategies, and the launch of new investment vehicles. We have launched three new fixed income products—Global Unconstrained, Global High Income, Global Investment Grade Corporate Bond—and one new equity product Emerging Markets Value. We also launched a new Retirement Date series for institutional investors and added an I-Share class to a number of existing Price Funds. The I-Class shares are designed to meet the needs of institutionally oriented clients who seek investment products with lower shareholder servicing costs and lower expense ratios. We plan to add the I-Share class to other Price Funds in 2016.



We typically provide seed capital for new investment funds and trusts to enable the portfolio manager to begin building an investment performance history in advance of the portfolio receiving sustainable client assets. The length of time we hold our seed capital investment will vary for each new investment portfolio as it is highly dependent on how long it takes to generate cash flows into the portfolio from unrelated investors. We attempt to ensure that the new investment portfolio has a sustainable level of assets from unrelated shareholders before we consider redemption of our seed capital investment in order to not negatively impact the new investment portfolio's net asset value or its investment performance record. AtDecember 31, 2015, nearly$1.0 billionof our investments in sponsored portfolios and those sponsored portfolio investments reported in other investments is considered seed investments. About 60% of our total seed capital investments of $1.0 billion are investments in fixed income strategies and the remaining are investments in equity and asset allocation strategies.



Conversely, we may also limit new investments into a mutual fund or investment strategy in order to maintain the integrity of the investment strategy and to protect the interests of its existing fund shareholders and investors. At present, the following mutual funds and affiliated other investment portfolio strategies are closed to new investors.

We also provide certain administrative services as ancillary services to our investment advisory clients. These administrative services are provided by several of our subsidiaries and include mutual fund transfer agent, accounting, distribution, and shareholder services; participant recordkeeping and transfer agent services for defined contribution retirement plans investing in our sponsored mutual funds; recordkeeping services for defined contribution retirement plans investing in mutual funds outside the T. Rowe Price complex; brokerage; and trust services. Substantially all of our administrative and distribution and servicing fee revenues in2015were determined based generally on the recovery of our related costs to provide these services. Therefore, changes in our administrative fees, distribution and servicing fees, and related expenses generally do not significantly affect our net operating income or net income.



In 2014, we made a long-term strategic decision to change our delivery of certain administrative services, including fund accounting and other investment recordkeeping operations. BNY Mellon was contracted to provide such services and 210 associates became employees of BNY Mellon on August 1, 2015. BNY Mellon will transition our data to its technology platform over time. Though a few line items of our consolidated income statements, including administrative revenues, compensation and related costs, and other operating expenses, will be affected, we do not expect that the net impact on our future operating results will be material.

2015DEVELOPMENTS.



U.S. equities, as measured by the S&P 500 Index, rose in2015for the seventh consecutive year. The S&P 500 Index and the NASDAQ Composite Index, which is heavily weighted in technology companies, returned1.4%and5.7%, respectively, in2015. Equities in developed non-U.S. markets were mixed, while emerging market equities fared poorly around the world due in part to the broad currency weakness versus the U.S. dollar which hurt investor returns in dollar terms. Global bonds returns were also mixed in2015. In this market environment, our 2015 results were as follows:



Year ended(in millions, except per-share data)12/31/201412/31/2015% changeInvestment advisory fees$3,464.5$3,687.36%Net revenues$3,982.1$4,200.65%Operating expenses$2,091.2$2,301.710%Net operating income$1,890.9$1,898.9—%Non-operating investment income$112.2$103.5(8)%Net income$1,229.6$1,223.0(1)%Diluted earnings per share$4.55$4.632%Average assets under management (in billions)$724.7$767.96%Annual management fee rate (in basis points)47.848.0



Six Price Funds -Growth Stock,Blue-Chip Growth,Mid-Cap Growth,Value,Capital Appreciation, andEquity Income-accounted for27%of our investment advisory revenues in2015, and22%of our assets under management atDecember 31, 2015. Our largest client account relationship apart from the Price Funds is with a third-party financial intermediary that accounted for about5%of our investment advisory revenues in2015.



Assets under management ended2015at$763.1 billion, anincreaseof$16.3 billionfrom the end of2014. Market appreciation and income, net of distributions not reinvested, added$14.7 billionand net cash inflows added$1.6 billionin assets under management during2015.



Our target-date retirement funds and trusts, which provide shareholders with single, diversified portfolios that invest in underlying T. Rowe Price funds and T. Rowe Price collective investment trusts, continue to be a significant source of our asset growth. In2015, our net cash flows include$16.2 billionthat originated in these portfolios, including$8.9 billionin our target-date retirement funds. The assets under management in these portfolios totaled$165.7 billionatDecember 31, 2015, including$135.5 billionin target-date retirement funds and$30.2 billionin target-date retirement trusts. These portfolios' assets account for21.7%of our managed assets atDecember 31, 2015, compared with19.9%at the end of2014.

Investors domiciled outside the U.S. represent nearly5%of total assets under management at the end of2015. We service clients in41countries around the world.



Investment Performance.



Strong investment performance and brand awareness is a key driver to attracting assets and to our long-term success. As of the end of2015,80%of the T. Rowe Price U.S. mutual funds across their share classes outperformed their comparable Lipper averages on a total return basis for thethree-yearperiod,78%outperformed for thefive-yearperiod,88%outperformed for the10-yearperiod, and80%outperformed for theone-yearperiod. In addition, T. Rowe Price stock, bond and blended asset funds that were given an overall rating of four or five stars from Morningstar atDecember 31, 2015, account for nearly86%of the assets under management in our rated funds. Our target-date retirement funds continue to deliver very attractive long-term performance, with at least97%of these funds outperforming their comparable Lipper averages on a total return basis for the three-, five-, and 10-year periods endedDecember 31, 2015. The performance of our institutional strategies remains very competitive.



Capital Resources.



AtDecember 31, 2015, we remain debt-free with ample liquidity and resources, including cash and sponsored portfolio investment holdings of nearly$2.8 billion. During the full year of2015, we expended$987.8 millionto repurchase13.1 millionshares, or5%of our outstanding common stock. We generally repurchase shares of our common stock over time to offset the dilution created by our equity-based compensation plans. We declared and paid regular quarterly dividends in 2015 that totaled$2.08per share as well as a special dividend of $2.00 per share.



We also invested$151 millionduring the year in capitalized technology and facilities from existing cash balances. We currently expect total capital expenditures for technology development, facilities and equipment for2016to be up to$180 million, which will be funded from operating resources.



Our substantial liquidity and resources also allow us to take advantage of attractive growth opportunities; invest in key capabilities, including investment professionals, technologies, and new investment strategy offerings; and, most importantly, provide our clients with strong investment management expertise and service both now and in the future. In the coming years, we expect to increase funding for long-term initiatives to sustain and deepen our investment talent, expand capabilities through enhanced technology, and broaden our distribution reach globally.

Additional information concerning our revenues, results of operations and total assets, and our assets under management during the past three years is contained in the Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Item 7 of this Form 10-K as well as our consolidated financial statements, which are included in Item 8 of this report.



PRICE FUNDS.



We provide investment advisory, distribution, and other administrative services to the Price Funds under various agreements. Investment advisory services are provided to each fund under individual investment management agreements that grant the fund the right to use the T. Rowe Price name. The boards of the respective funds, including a majority of directors who are not interested persons of the funds or of T. Rowe Price Group (as defined in the Investment Company Act of 1940), must approve the investment management agreements annually. Fund shareholders must approve material changes to these investment management agreements. Each agreement automatically terminates in the event of its assignment (as defined in the Investment Company Act) and, generally, either party may terminate the agreement without penalty after a 60-day notice. The termination of one or more of these agreements could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Independent directors and trustees of the Price Funds regularly review our fee structures.



Advisory Services.



Investment advisory revenues earned from the Price Funds are determined daily based on the net assets managed in each fund. The advisory fee paid monthly by each of the Price Funds is computed on a daily basis by multiplying a fund’s net assets by its effective fee rate. Details of each fund's fee arrangement are available in its prospectus.



For the majority of the Price Funds, the fee rate is equal to the sum of a tiered group fee rate plus an individual fund rate. The tiered group rate is based on the combined net assets of nearly all of the Price Funds. If the combined net assets of these Price Funds exceed$500 billion, the weighted-average fee across pricing tiers is29.1 basis pointsfor the first$500 billionof net assets plus27.0 basis pointsfor net assets in excess of$500 billion. To the extent that the combined net assets of the funds included in the group rate calculation increase, the group charge component of a fund's advisory fee rate and the resulting advisory fee rate paid by each fund will decrease.



The individual fund rates are generally flat rates that are set based on the fund’s specific investment objective. Several funds, including the Blue Chip Growth, Equity Income, Growth Stock and Mid-Cap Growth funds, have an effective tiered individual fund rate in which their base individual flat rate is reduced by about 15% on net assets in excess of $15 billion. The New Income and Value funds have their base individual flat rate reduced by about 15% on net assets in excess of $20 billion. The effective fee rates for the stock and bond funds on which we earned annual advisory fees of at least$6.0 millionin2015varied from a low of33basis points for the Limited Duration Inflation Focused Bond fund to a high of104basis points for the Emerging Markets Stock, International Discovery, and Latin America funds.



The fee rate of several of the Price Funds, including the Index and Summit funds as well as specific funds offered solely to institutional investors, do not include a group fee component but rather an individual fund fee or an all-inclusive fee. An all-inclusive fee covers both the investment management fee and ordinary operating expenses incurred by the fund. Each of the funds in the series of Spectrum Funds and in the series of target-date retirement funds that we offer invests in a diversified portfolio of other Price Funds and has no separate investment advisory fee; rather, they indirectly bear the expenses of the funds in which they invest.



Each Price fund typically bears all expenses associated with its operation and the issuance and redemption of its securities. In particular, each fund pays investment advisory fees; shareholder servicing fees and expenses; fund accounting fees and expenses; transfer agent fees; custodian fees and expenses; legal and auditing fees; expenses of preparing, printing and mailing prospectuses and shareholder reports to existing shareholders; registration fees and expenses; proxy and annual meeting expenses; and independent trustee or director fees and expenses.



We usually provide that a newly organized fund’s expenses will not exceed a specified percentage of its net assets during an initial operating period. Generally, during the earlier portion of the period, we will waive advisory fees and absorb other mutual fund expenses in excess of these self-imposed limits. During the latter portion of the period, we may recover some or all of the waived fees and absorbed costs, but such recovery is not assured.



In2015, we continued to voluntarily waive advisory fees and other fund expenses of all of our money market funds and trusts in order to maintain a positive yield for investors. Total fees waived in2015were$47.6 million, or about1%of total



Page6






investment advisory revenues earned during the year, compared to$58.4 millionin2014. We expect that these fee waivers will continue in2016.



Assets under Management.



AtDecember 31, 2015, assets under our management in the Price Funds aggregated$487.1 billion, an increase of2.0%or$9.5 billionfrom the beginning of the year. The following table presents the net assets (in billions) and the year of formation of our largest Price Funds (net assets in excess of$1.0 billionatDecember 31, 2015) at December 31.

The Spectrum Funds, Target Retirement Funds, and Retirement Date Funds are not presented in the table above because their assets are already included in the assets of their underlying fund holdings.



Our operating subsidiaries invest in many of the T. Rowe Price funds.



Administrative Services.



Our subsidiaries provide advisory-related administrative services to the Price Funds and their shareholders. T. Rowe Price Services provides mutual fund transfer agency and shareholder services, including maintenance of staff, facilities, technology, and other equipment to respond to inquiries from fund shareholders. T. Rowe Price Retirement Plan Services provides participant accounting, plan administration, and transfer agent services for defined contribution retirement plans that invest in both the Price Funds and funds outside the Price fund complex. Plan sponsors and participants compensate us for some of the administrative services while the Price Funds compensate us for maintaining and administering the individual participant accounts for those plans that invest in the Price Funds. Until August 2015, T. Rowe Price Associates provided mutual fund accounting services, including maintenance of financial records, preparation of financial statements and reports, daily valuation of portfolio securities, and computation of daily net asset values per share to the Price Funds. The Price Funds contracted directly with BNY Mellon in August 2015 to provide these services in the future.



We provide trustee services through our subsidiary, T. Rowe Price Trust Company, a Maryland-chartered limited service trust company. Through this entity, we offer collective investment trusts for investment by qualified retirement plans and serve as trustee for employer sponsored retirement plans and other retirement products. T. Rowe Price Trust Company may not accept deposits and cannot make personal or commercial loans.



We also provide non-discretionary advisory planning services to fund shareholders and potential investors through our subsidiary T. Rowe Price Advisory Services. These services are limited in scope and include retirement planning services, such as saving for retirement, transitioning into retirement, and income in retirement. An investment portfolio evaluation service is an integral part of these services. An ongoing checkup service is also available to assist an investor in remaining on track to achieve their financial goals.

Distribution and Servicing.



The Investor class of all Price Funds can be purchased in the U.S. on a no-load basis, without a sales commission or 12b-1 fee. No-load mutual fund shares offer investors a low-cost and relatively easy method of directly investing in a variety of stock and fixed income portfolios. In 2015, we added an I-Class share to a number of our Price Funds. The I-Class shares are designed to meet the needs of institutionally oriented clients who seek investment products with lower shareholder servicing costs, and lower expense ratios. This share class will limit ordinary operating expenses (other than interest; expenses related to borrowings, taxes, and brokerage; and any non extraordinary expenses) at 5 basis points for a period of time and there will be no external payments for 12b-1 or administrative fee payments.



Certain of the Price Funds also offer Advisor Class and R Class shares that are distributed to mutual fund shareholders, and defined contribution retirement plans, respectively, through third-party financial intermediaries. These share classes pay 12b-1 fees of 25 and 50 basis points, respectively, for distribution, administration, and personal services. Our subsidiary, T. Rowe Price Investment Services, is the principal distributor of the Price Funds and enters into a tri-party agreement with each intermediary and fund. Under the agreement, each fund is responsible to pay the distribution and service fees directly to the applicable intermediaries. In addition, those Price Funds offered to investors through variable annuity life insurance plans have a share class that pays a 12b-1 fee of 25 basis points.



In accounting for 12b-1 fees, the applicable mutual fund share classes incur the related expense and we recognize the corresponding distribution and servicing fee revenue in our consolidated statements of income. We also recognize, as distribution and servicing costs in the consolidated statements of income, the corresponding cost paid to the third-party financial intermediaries who distribute these fund share classes. The fee revenue that we recognize from the funds and the expense that we recognize for the fees paid to third-party intermediaries are equal in amount and, therefore, do not impact our net operating income.



We believe that our lower fund cost structure, distribution methods, and fund shareholder and administrative services help promote the stability of our fund assets under management through market cycles.



Except as noted above for 12b-1 fees, we bear all advertising and promotion expenses associated with the distribution of the Price Funds. These costs are recognized currently, and include advertising and direct mail communications to potential fund shareholders as well as substantial staff and communications capabilities to respond to investor inquiries. Marketing and promotional efforts are focused in print media, television, and Internet. In addition, we direct considerable marketing efforts to defined contribution plans that invest in mutual funds. Advertising and promotion expenditures vary over time based on investor interest, market conditions, new and existing investment offerings, and the development and expansion of new marketing initiatives, including the enhancement of our digital capabilities.



OTHER INVESTMENT PORTFOLIOS.



Our other client investment portfolios had assets under management of$276.0 billionatDecember 31, 2015, an increase of$6.8 billionfrom the beginning of the year. We provide investment advisory services to these clients through our subsidiaries on a separately managed or subadvised account basis and through sponsored investment portfolios, including collective investment trusts, target-date retirement trusts, Luxembourg-based funds offered to investors outside the U.S., and portfolios offered through variable annuity life insurance plans in the U.S. At December 31, the assets under management in these portfolios included the following investment mandates:



20142015U.S. equities$179.3$180.3International equities27.629.5Stable value assets17.819.1Bonds and money market securities44.547.1$269.2$276.0



We charge fees for investment management to these clients based on, among other things, the specific investment services to be provided. Our standard form of investment advisory agreement for client accounts provides that the agreement may be terminated at any time and that any unearned fees paid in advance will be refunded.



Page9








Our fees for managing these investment portfolios are computed using the value of assets under our management at a contracted annual fee rate. The value of assets under management billed is generally based on daily valuations, month-end average valuations, or end of billing period valuations. In2015, approximately73%of advisory fees were recognized based on daily portfolio valuations,10%were based on month-end averages, and17%were based on end of billing period valuations.



Our subsidiaries, T. Rowe Price (Luxembourg) Management Sàrl and T. Rowe Price International provide management company and investment management services, respectively, to our Luxembourg-based SICAVs (Société d'Investissement à Capital Variable) and FCPs (Fonds Commun de Placement). These funds are distributed outside the U.S. through distribution agents and other financial intermediaries. The fees earned for these distribution and marketing services are part of the overall investment management fees earned for managing the SICAV and FCP fund assets. We recognize any related distribution fees paid to financial intermediaries in other operating expenses. At December 31, 2015, assets under management in these funds were$10.3 billion.

COMPETITION.



As a member of the financial services industry, we are subject to substantial competition in all aspects of our business. A significant number of proprietary and other sponsors’ mutual funds are sold to the public by other investment management firms, broker-dealers, mutual fund companies, banks, and insurance companies. We compete with brokerage and investment banking firms, insurance companies, banks, mutual fund companies, hedge funds, and other financial institutions and funds in all aspects of our business and in every country in which we offer our advisory services.
