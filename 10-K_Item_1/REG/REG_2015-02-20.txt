Item 1.    Business



Regency Centers began its operations as a publicly-traded REIT in 1993, and currently owns direct or partial interests in 322 shopping centers, the majority of which are grocery-anchored community and neighborhood centers.  Our centers are located in the top markets of 23 states and the District of Columbia, and contain 38.2 million square feet of gross leasable area, or 28.4 million square feet when including only our pro rata share of the 120 centers partially owned through co-investment partnerships.

Our mission is to be the preeminent grocery-anchored shopping center owner and developer through:

•First-rate performance of our exceptionally merchandised and located national portfolio;

•Value-enhancing services of the best team of professionals in the business;

•Creation of superior growth in shareholder value.



Our Strategy is to:

•Sustain average annual 3% net operating income (“NOI”) growth from a high-quality portfolio of community and neighborhood shopping centers;

•Develop new high quality shopping centers at attractive returns on investment from a disciplined development program;

•Cost-effectively enhance our already strong balance sheet to reduce our cost of capital, provide financial flexibility and weather economic downturns;

•Engage a talented and dedicated team that operates efficiently and is recognized as a leader in the real estate industry and sustainability initiatives.



Sustain average annual 3% NOI growth from high-quality portfolio of community and neighborhood shopping centers:

•Own and develop centers that are located at key corners in our nation’s most attractive metro areas;

•Target trade areas characterized by their strong demographics and consumer buying power, and draw shoppers to our centers with highly productive anchor tenants;

•Attract the best national, regional and local retailers and restaurants;

•Pursue initiatives that reinforce the underlying quality of our portfolio and maximize long-term growth such as “Fresh Look,” an operating philosophy that guides our merchandising and place-making programs;

•Fortify future NOI growth by rigorously reviewing our portfolio to identify low growth assets for disposition;

•Opportunistically upgrade our portfolio by acquiring high quality shopping centers with superior upside in NOI growth funded from the sale of low growth assets.



Develop new high quality shopping centers at attractive returns on investment from a disciplined development program:

•We have an existing presence in our key markets with in-house expertise and anchor relationships;

•Long-term ownership of shopping center developments located in desirable infill markets;

•Anchor developments with dominant, national and regional chains and high volume specialty grocers;

•Limit size of program to manage total development exposure and risk;

•Create additional value through redevelopment of existing centers to benefit the operating portfolio;

•Fund development program primarily from the sale of low-growth assets in the existing portfolio.



Cost-effectively enhance an already strong balance sheet to reduce our cost of capital, provide financial flexibility and weather economic downturns:

•We have access to multiple sources of debt and equity through the capital markets and co-investment partnerships;










•Fund development and acquisitions from free cash flow, a disciplined match-funding strategy of selling low growth assets, and accessing favorably priced equity;

•Further reduce leverage when appropriate through organic growth in earnings and accessing the capital markets prudently;

•Rigorously manage our $800 million line of credit and maintain substantial uncommitted capacity;

•Maintain a large pool of unencumbered assets and excellent relationships with mortgage lenders;

•Maintain a well laddered debt maturity profile.



Engage a talented and dedicated team that operates efficiently and is recognized as a leader in the real estate industry and sustainability initiatives:

•We reflect our values by executing and successfully meeting our commitments to our people and our communities, a tradition we have embraced for over 50 years;

•Foster a values-based culture, offering a comprehensive benefits package and an engaging workplace environment;

•Believe in unwavering standards of honesty and integrity and build our reputation by maintaining the highest ethical principles.

•Offer a challenging, safe and dynamic work environment and support the professional development and the personal life of each employee.

•Encourage employees to achieve their personal health goals through a robust wellness program focused on education, awareness and prevention.

•Contribute to the betterment of our communities by supporting philanthropic programs with employee contribution matching and paid time off to volunteer.





Sustainability



We recognize the importance of operating in a sustainable manner and are committed to reducing our environmental impact, including energy and water use, greenhouse gas emissions, and waste.  We are committed to transparency with regard to our sustainability performance, risks and opportunities, and will continue to increase disclosure using industry accepted reporting frameworks.   We believe our commitment to sustainability supports the Company in achieving key strategic objectives, leads to better risk management, enhances our relationships with key stakeholders, and is in the best interest of our shareholders.



Competition



We are among the largest owners of shopping centers in the nation based on revenues, number of properties, GLA, and market capitalization.  There are numerous companies and individuals engaged in the ownership, development, acquisition, and operation of shopping centers that compete with us in our targeted markets, including grocery store chains that also anchor some of our shopping centers.  This results in competition for attracting anchor tenants, as well as the acquisition of existing shopping centers and new development sites.  We believe that our competitive advantages are driven by:

•our locations within our market areas;

•the design and high quality of our shopping centers;

•the strong demographics surrounding our shopping centers;

•our relationships with our anchor tenants and our side-shop and out-parcel retailers;

•our practice of maintaining and renovating our shopping centers; and,

•our ability to source and develop new shopping centers.



Employees



Our headquarters are located at One Independent Drive, Suite 114, Jacksonville, Florida.  We presently maintain 17 market offices nationwide, where we conduct management, leasing, construction, and investment activities.  As ofDecember 31, 2014, we had 370 employees and we believe that our relations with our employees are good.



Compliance with Governmental Regulations



Under various federal, state and local laws, ordinances and regulations, we may be liable for the cost to remove or remediate certain hazardous or toxic substances at our shopping centers.  These laws often impose liability without regard to whether the owner knew of, or was responsible for, the presence of the hazardous or toxic substances.  The cost of required remediation and the owner's liability for remediation could exceed the value of the property and/or the aggregate assets of the owner.  The presence of such substances, or the failure to properly remediate such substances, may adversely affect our ability to sell or lease the property or borrow using the property as collateral.  While we have a number of properties that could require










or are currently undergoing varying levels of environmental remediation, known environmental remediation is not currently expected to have a material financial impact on us due to insurance programs designed to mitigate the cost of remediation, various state-regulated programs that shift the responsibility and cost to the state, and existing accrued liabilities for remediation.
