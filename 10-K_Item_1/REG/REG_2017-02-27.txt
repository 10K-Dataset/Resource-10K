Item 1.    Business



Regency Centers began its operations as a publicly-traded REIT in 1993, and, as ofDecember 31, 2016, owns direct or partial interests in 307 shopping centers, the majority of which are grocery-anchored community and neighborhood centers.  Our centers are located in the top markets of25states and the District of Columbia, and contain 37.8 million square feet ("SF") of gross leasable area ("GLA").  Our pro-rata share of this GLA is 28.7 million square feet.  All of our operating, investing, and financing activities are performed through the Operating Partnership, our wholly-owned subsidiaries, and through our co-investment partnerships.

Our mission is to be the preeminent national grocery-anchored shopping center owner and developer through:

•First-rate performance of our exceptionally merchandised and located national portfolio;

•Value-enhancing services from an accomplished team of professionals in the business; and

•Creation of superior growth in shareholder value.



Our strategy is:

•Sustain average annual 3% same property NOI growth from a high-quality, growing portfolio of thriving community and neighborhood shopping centers;

•Develop new, and redevelop existing, high quality shopping centers at attractive returns on investment from a disciplined development program;










•Maintain our balance sheet to provide financial flexibility, to cost effectively fund uses of capital, and to weather economic downturns; and

•Engage a talented and dedicated team with high standards of integrity that operates efficiently and is recognized as a leader in the real estate industry.



We expect to execute our strategy as follows:



Sustain average annual 3% same property NOI growth from a high-quality, growing portfolio of thriving community and neighborhood shopping centers:

•Own and develop centers that are located at key corners in our nation’s most attractive metro areas;

•Target trade areas characterized by their strong demographics and consumer buying power, and draw shoppers to our centers with highly productive anchor tenants;

•Attract the best national, regional and local retailers and restaurants;

•Pursue initiatives that reinforce the underlying quality of our portfolio and maximize long-term growth such as “Fresh Look®,” an operating philosophy that guides our merchandising and place-making programs;

•Fortify future NOI growth by rigorously reviewing our portfolio to identify and sell operating properties that no longer meet our investment standards; and

•Opportunistically upgrade our portfolio by acquiring high quality shopping centers with meaningful upside in NOI growth funded from the sale of operating properties that no longer meet our investment standards.



Develop new, and redevelop existing, high quality shopping centers at attractive returns on investment from a disciplined development program:

•Maintain and grow our existing presence in our key markets with in-house expertise and anchor relationships;

•Develop shopping centers located in desirable infill markets for long-term ownership;

•Anchor developments with dominant, national and regional chains and high volume specialty grocers;

•Create additional value through redevelopment of existing centers; and

•Fund our development program primarily from the sale of operating properties that no longer meet our investment criteria.



Cost-effectively enhance our balance sheet to reduce our cost of capital, provide financial flexibility and weather economic downturns:

•Prudently access our multiple sources of debt and equity through the capital markets and co-investment partnerships;

•Fund development and acquisitions from free cash flows, selling operating properties that no longer meet our investment standards, and accessing favorably priced equity;

•Further reduce leverage through organic growth in earnings and, when appropriate, accessing the capital markets;

•Rigorously manage our line of credit and maintain substantial uncommitted capacity;

•Maintain a large pool of unencumbered assets and excellent relationships with mortgage lenders; and

•Maintain a well laddered debt maturity profile.



Engage a talented and dedicated team that operates efficiently and is recognized as a leader in the real estate industry with respect to development and operating capabilities, customer relationships, operating and technology systems, and environmental sustainability:

•Encourage employees to achieve their personal health goals through a robust wellness program focused on education, awareness and prevention; and

•Contribute to the betterment of our communities by supporting philanthropic programs with employee contribution matching and paid volunteer time.





Environmental Sustainability



We believe being an industry leader in sustainability is in the best interest of our tenants, investors, employees, and the communities in which we operate.  We are committed to reducing our environmental impact, including energy and water use,










greenhouse gas emissions, and waste.  We believe this commitment is not only the right thing to do, but also assists the Company in achieving key strategic objectives in operations and development.  We are committed to transparency with regard to our sustainability performance, risks and opportunities, and will continue to increase disclosure using industry accepted reporting frameworks.  We currently have a Green Star rating from the Global Real Estate Sustainability Benchmark, or GRESB, for the second consecutive year.  More information about our sustainability strategy, goals, performance, and formal disclosures are available on our website at www.regencycenters.com.



Competition



We are amongst the largest owners of shopping centers in the nation based on revenues, number of properties, GLA, and market capitalization.  There are numerous companies and individuals engaged in the ownership, development, acquisition, and operation of shopping centers that compete with us in our targeted markets, including grocery store chains that also anchor some of our shopping centers.  This results in competition for attracting anchor tenants, as well as the acquisition of existing shopping centers and new development sites.  We believe that our competitive advantages are driven by:

•our locations within our market areas;

•the design and high quality of our shopping centers;

•the strong demographics surrounding our shopping centers;

•our relationships with our anchor tenants and our side-shop and out-parcel retailers;

•our practice of maintaining and renovating our shopping centers; and

•our ability to source and develop new shopping centers.



Employees



Our corporate headquarters are located at One Independent Drive, Suite 114, Jacksonville, Florida.  We presently maintain 18 market offices nationwide, including our corporate headquarters, where we conduct management, leasing, construction, and investment activities.  We have 371 employees and we believe that our relations with our employees are good.



Compliance with Governmental Regulations



Under various federal, state and local laws, ordinances and regulations, we may be liable for the cost to remove or remediate certain hazardous or toxic substances at our shopping centers.  These laws often impose liability without regard to whether the owner knew of, or was responsible for, the presence of the hazardous or toxic substances.  The cost of required remediation and the owner's liability for remediation could exceed the value of the property and/or the aggregate assets of the owner.  The presence of such substances, or the failure to properly remediate such substances, may adversely affect our ability to sell or lease the property or borrow using the property as collateral.  Although we have a number of properties that could require or are currently undergoing varying levels of environmental remediation, known environmental remediation is not currently expected to have a material financial impact on us due to insurance programs designed to mitigate the cost of remediation, various state-regulated programs that shift the responsibility and cost to the state, and existing accrued liabilities for remediation.












Executive Officers



Our executive officers are appointed each year by our Board of Directors.  Each of our executive officers has been employed by us for more than five years.

Defined Terms



We use certain non-GAAP performance measures, in addition to the required GAAP presentations, as we believe these measures improve the understanding of the Company's operational results.  We manage our entire real estate portfolio without regard to ownership structure, although certain decisions impacting properties owned through partnerships require partner approval.  Therefore, we believe presenting our pro-rata share of certain operating metrics regardless of ownership structure, along with other non-GAAP  measures, makes comparisons of other REITs' operating results to the Company's more meaningful. We continually evaluate the usefulness, relevance, limitations, and calculation of our reported non-GAAP performance measures to determine how best to provide relevant information to the public, and thus such reported measures could change.



The following terms, as defined, are commonly used by management and the investing public to understand and evaluate our operational results:



•Same Propertyinformation is provided for operating properties that were owned and operated for the entirety of both calendar year periods being compared and excludes Non-Same Properties and Properties in Development.



•A Non-Same Propertyis a property acquired, sold, or a development completion during either calendar year period being compared.  Corporate activities, including the captive insurance company, are part of Non-Same Property.



•Property In Developmentincludes land or properties in various stages of development and redevelopment including active pre-development activities.



•Development Completionis a project in development that is deemed complete upon the earliest of: (i) 90% of total estimated net development costs have been incurred and percent leased equals or exceeds 95%, or (ii) the project features at least two years of anchor operations, or (iii) three years have passed since the start of construction. Once deemed complete, the property is termed an Operating Property.



•Pro-Ratainformation includes 100% of our consolidated properties plus our ownership interest in our unconsolidated real estate investment partnerships.



The pro-rata information is prepared on a basis consistent with the comparable consolidated amounts and is intended to more accurately reflect our proportionate economic interest in the operating results of properties in our portfolio.  We do not control the unconsolidated investment partnerships, and the pro-rata presentations of the assets and liabilities, and revenues and expenses do not represent our legal claim to such items.  The partners are entitled to profit or loss allocations and distributions of cash flows according to the operating agreements, which provide for such allocations according to their invested capital.  Our share of invested capital establishes the ownership interests we use to prepare our pro-rata share.

The presentation of pro-rata information has limitations which include, but are not limited to, the following:

•The amounts shown on the individual line items were derived by applying our overall economic ownership interest percentage determined when applying the equity method of accounting or allocating noncontrolling interests, and do not necessarily represent our legal claim to the assets and liabilities, or the revenues and expenses; and



•Other companies in our industry may calculate their pro-rata interest differently, limiting the usefulness as a comparative measure.



Because of these limitations, the pro-rata financial information should not be considered independently or as a substitute for our financial statements as reported under GAAP.  We compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our GAAP financial statements, using the pro-rata information as a supplement.

•Core EBITDAis defined as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, real estate gains and losses, and development and acquisition pursuit costs.



•Fixed Charge Coverage Ratiois defined as Core EBITDA divided by the sum of the gross interest and scheduled mortgage principal paid to our lenders plus dividends paid to our preferred stockholders.



•Net Operating Income ("NOI")is the sum of minimum rent, percentage rent and recoveries from tenants and other income, less operating and maintenance, real estate taxes, and provision for doubtful accounts.  NOI excludes straight-










line rental income and expense, above and below market rent amortization and other fees.  The Company also provides disclosure of NOI excluding termination fees, which excludes both termination fee income and expenses.



•NAREIT Funds from Operations ("NAREIT FFO")is a commonly used measure of REIT performance, which the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ("NAREIT") defines as net income, computed in accordance with GAAP, excluding gains and losses from sales of depreciable property, net of tax, excluding operating real estate impairments, plus depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. We compute NAREIT FFO for all periods presented in accordance with NAREIT's definition. Many companies use different depreciable lives and methods, and real estate values historically fluctuate with market conditions. Since NAREIT FFO excludes depreciation and amortization and gains and losses from depreciable property dispositions, and impairments, it provides a performance measure that, when compared year over year, reflects the impact on operations from trends in occupancy rates, rental rates, operating costs, acquisition and development activities, and financing costs. This provides a perspective of our financial performance not immediately apparent from net income determined in accordance with GAAP. Thus, NAREIT FFO is a supplemental non-GAAP financial measure of our operating performance, which does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with GAAP; and, therefore, should not be considered a substitute measure of cash flows from operations.



•Core FFOis an additional performance measure used by Regency as the computation of NAREIT FFO includes certain non-cash and non-comparable items that affect the Company's period-over-period performance.  Core FFO excludes from NAREIT FFO, but is not limited to: (a) transaction related gains, income or expense; (b) impairments on land; (c) gains or losses from the early extinguishment of debt; and (d) other non-core amounts as they occur.  The Company provides a reconciliation of NAREIT FFO to Core FFO.
