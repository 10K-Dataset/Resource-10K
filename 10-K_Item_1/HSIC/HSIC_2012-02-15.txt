ITEM 1.  Business



General



We believe we are the largest distributor of healthcare products and services primarily to office-based healthcare practitioners.  We serve nearly 775,000 customers worldwide, including dental practitioners and laboratories, physician practices and animal health clinics, as well as government and other institutions.  We believe that we have a strong brand identity due to our more than 79 years of experience distributing healthcare products.



We are headquartered in Melville, New York, employ nearly 15,000 people (of which over 6,500 are based outside the United States) and have operations in the United States, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, China, the Czech Republic, France, Germany, Hong Kong SAR, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Portugal, Slovakia, Spain, Switzerland and the United Kingdom.  We also have affiliates in Iceland, Saudi Arabia and Turkey.



We have established strategically located distribution centers to enable us to better serve our customers and increase our operating efficiency.  This infrastructure, together with broad product and service offerings at competitive prices, and a strong commitment to customer service, enables us to be a single source of supply for our customers’ needs.  Our infrastructure also allows us to provide convenient ordering and rapid, accurate and complete order fulfillment.



We conduct our business through two reportable segments: healthcare distribution and technology.  These segments offer different products and services to the same customer base.  The healthcare distribution reportable segment aggregates our dental, medical, animal health and international operating segments.  This segment consists of consumable products, small equipment, laboratory products, large dental equipment, equipment repair services, branded and generic pharmaceuticals, vaccines, surgical products, diagnostic tests, infection-control products and vitamins.  Our technology group provides software, technology and other value-added services to healthcare practitioners, primarily in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Australia and New Zealand.  Our value-added practice solutions include practice management software systems for dental and medical practitioners and animal health clinics.  Our technology group offerings also include financial services on a non-recourse basis, e-services and continuing education services for practitioners.



Industry



The healthcare products distribution industry, as it relates to office-based healthcare practitioners, is highly fragmented and diverse.  This industry, which encompasses the dental, medical and animal health markets, was estimated to produce revenues of approximately $28 billion in 2011 in the combined North American, European and Australian/New Zealand markets.  The industry ranges from sole practitioners working out of relatively small offices to group practices or service organizations ranging in size from a few practitioners to a large number of practitioners who have combined or otherwise associated their practices.



Due in part to the inability of office-based healthcare practitioners to store and manage large quantities of supplies in their offices, the distribution of healthcare supplies and small equipment to office-based healthcare practitioners has been characterized by frequent, small quantity orders, and a need for rapid, reliable and substantially complete order fulfillment.  The purchasing decisions within an office-based healthcare practice are typically made by the practitioner or an administrative assistant.  Supplies and small equipment are generally purchased from more than one distributor, with one generally serving as the primary supplier.





The healthcare products distribution industry continues to experience growth due to the aging population, increased healthcare awareness, the proliferation of medical technology and testing, new pharmacology treatments and expanded third-party insurance coverage, partially offset by the affects of increased unemployment on insurance coverage.  In addition, the physician market continues to benefit from the shift of procedures and diagnostic testing from acute care settings to alternate-care sites, particularly physicians’ offices.



We believe that consolidation within the industry will continue to result in a number of distributors, particularly those with limited financial and marketing resources, seeking to combine with larger companies that can provide growth opportunities.  This consolidation also may continue to result in distributors seeking to acquire companies that can enhance their current product and service offerings or provide opportunities to serve a broader customer base.



In recent years, the healthcare industry has increasingly focused on cost containment.  This trend has benefited distributors capable of providing a broad array of products and services at low prices.  It also has accelerated the growth of HMOs, group practices, other managed care accounts and collective buying groups, which, in addition to their emphasis on obtaining products at competitive prices, tend to favor distributors capable of providing specialized management information support.  We believe that the trend towards cost containment has the potential to favorably affect demand for technology solutions, including software, which can enhance the efficiency and facilitation of practice management.



Competition



The distribution and manufacture of healthcare supplies and equipment is highly competitive.  Many of the healthcare distribution products we sell are available to our customers from a number of suppliers.  In addition, our competitors could obtain exclusive rights from manufacturers to market particular products.  Manufacturers also could seek to sell directly to end-users, and thereby eliminate or reduce our role and that of other distributors.





We also face significant competition internationally, where we compete on the basis of price and customer service against several large competitors, including the GACD Group, Pluradent AG & Co., Planmeca Oy, Arseus NV, Billericay Dental Supply Co. Ltd., National Veterinary Services and Alcyon SA, as well as a large number of dental, medical and animal health product distributors and manufacturers in Australia, Austria, Belgium, China, the Czech Republic, France, Germany, Hong Kong SAR, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Portugal, Slovakia, Spain, Switzerland, Turkey and the United Kingdom.





Significant price reductions by our competitors could result in a similar reduction in our prices.  Any of these competitive pressures may materially adversely affect our operating results.



Competitive Strengths



We have more than 79 years of experience in distributing products to healthcare practitioners resulting in strong awareness of the “Henry Schein” brand.  Our competitive strengths include:



Direct sales and marketing expertise.  Our sales and marketing efforts are designed to establish and solidify customer relationships through personal visits by field sales representatives, frequent direct marketing and telesales contact, emphasizing our broad product lines, including exclusive distribution agreements, competitive prices and ease of order placement.  The key elements of our direct sales and marketing efforts are:•Field sales consultants.  We have approximately 3,200 field sales consultants, including equipment sales specialists, covering major North American, European and other international markets.  These consultants complement our direct marketing and telesales efforts and enable us to better market, service and support the sale of more sophisticated products and equipment.



•Direct marketing.  During 2011, we distributed approximately 28.1 million pieces of direct marketing material, including catalogs, flyers, order stuffers and other promotional materials to existing and potential office-based healthcare customers.



•Telesales.  We support our direct marketing effort with approximately 1,625 inbound and outbound telesales representatives, who facilitate order processing and generate new sales through direct and frequent contact with customers.





Broad product and service offerings at competitive prices.  We offer a broad range of products and services to our customers, at competitive prices, in the following categories:



•Consumable supplies and equipment.  We offer over 90,000 Stock Keeping Units, or SKUs, to our customers.  Of the SKUs offered, approximately 51,000 are offered to our dental customers, approximately 38,000 to our medical customers and approximately 19,000 to our animal health customers.  We offer over 100,000 additional SKUs to our customers in the form of special order items.



•Technology and other value-added products and services.  We sell practice management software systems to our dental, medical and animal health customers.  Our practice management solutions provide practitioners with electronic medical records, patient treatment history, billing, accounts receivable analyses and management, appointment calendars, electronic claims processing and word processing programs.  As of December 31, 2011, we have an active user base of more than 70,000 practices, including Dentrix®, Easy Dental®, Oasis® and EXACT® for dental practices, MicroMD® for physician practices and Advantage+, AVImark®, DVM Manager®, Infinity, Sunpoint, Triple Crown ® and Vetech Advantage for animal health practices.



•Repair services.  We have 194 equipment sales and service centers worldwide that provide a variety of repair, installation and technical services for our healthcare customers.  Our ProRepair technicians provide installation and repair services for: dental handpieces; dental, medical and animal health small equipment; table top sterilizers; and large dental equipment.



•Financial services.  We offer our customers solutions in operating their practices more efficiently by providing access to a number of financial services and products (including non-recourse financing for equipment, technology and software products; non-recourse patient financing; collection services and credit card processing) at rates that we believe are generally lower than what they would be able to secure independently. We also provide dental practice valuation and brokerage services.





Commitment to superior customer service.  We maintain a strong commitment to providing superior customer service.  We frequently monitor our customer service through customer surveys, focus groups and statistical reports.  Our customer service policy primarily focuses on:



•Exceptional order fulfillment.  Approximately 99% of items ordered are shipped without back ordering and are shipped on the same business day the order is received.



•Streamlined ordering process.  Customers may place orders 24 hours a day, 7 days a week by mail, fax, telephone, e-mail, Internet and by using our computerized order entry systems.



Integrated management information systems.  Our information systems generally allow for centralized management of key functions, including accounts receivable, inventory, accounts payable, payroll, purchasing, sales and order fulfillment.  These systems allow us to manage our growth, deliver superior customer service, properly target customers, manage financial performance and monitor daily operational statistics.



Cost-effective purchasing.  We believe that cost-effective purchasing is a key element to maintaining and enhancing our position as a competitive-pricing provider of healthcare products.  We continuously evaluate our purchase requirements and suppliers’ offerings and prices in order to obtain products at the lowest possible cost.  In 2011, our top 10 healthcare distribution suppliers and our single largest supplier accounted for approximately 33% and 8%, respectively, of our aggregate purchases.



Efficient distribution.  We distribute our products from our strategically located distribution centers.  We strive to maintain optimal inventory levels in order to satisfy customer demand for prompt delivery and complete order fulfillment.  These inventory levels are managed on a daily basis with the aid of our management information systems.  Once an order is entered, it is electronically transmitted to the distribution center nearest the customer’s location and a packing slip for the entire order is printed for order fulfillment.

Business Strategy



Our objective is to continue to expand as a value-added distributor of healthcare products and services to office-based healthcare practitioners.  To accomplish this, we will apply our competitive strengths in executing the following strategies:



•Increase penetration of our existing customer base.  We have nearly 775,000 customers worldwide and we intend to increase sales to our existing customer base and enhance our position as their primary supplier.



•Increase the number of customers we serve.  This strategy includes increasing the number and productivity of field sales consultants, as well as using our customer database to focus our marketing efforts.



•Leverage our value-added products and services.  We continue to increase cross-selling efforts for key product lines.  In the dental business, we have significant cross-selling opportunities between our dental practice management software users and our dental distribution customers.  In the medical business, we have opportunities to expand our vaccine, injectables and other pharmaceuticals sales to medical distribution customers, as well as cross-selling core products and practice management software with these key products.  In the animal health business, we have opportunities to cross-sell practice management software and other products.



•Pursue strategic acquisitions and joint ventures.  Our acquisition strategy includes acquiring businesses and entering into joint ventures complementary to ours that will provide, among other things, additional sales to be channeled through our existing distribution infrastructure, access to additional product lines and field sales consultants and an opportunity to further expand into new geographic markets.



Markets Served



Demographic trends indicate that our markets are growing, as an aging U.S. population is increasingly using healthcare services.  Between 2011 and 2021, the 45 and older population is expected to grow by approximately 14%.  Between 2011 and 2031, this age group is expected to grow by approximately 27%.  This compares with expected total U.S. population growth rates of approximately 9% between 2011 and 2021 and approximately 18% between 2011 and 2031.



In the dental industry, there is predicted to be a rise in oral healthcare expenditures as the 45 and older segment of the population increases.  Cosmetic dentistry is another growing aspect of dental practices as new technologies allow dentists to offer cosmetic solutions that patients seek.  At the same time, there is an expected increase in dental insurance coverage.



We support our dental professionals through the many SKUs that we offer, as well as through important value-added services, including practice management software, electronic claims processing, financial services and continuing education, all designed to help maximize a practitioner’s efficiency.



There continues to be a migration of procedures from acute-care settings to physicians’ offices, a trend that we believe provides additional opportunities for us.  There also is the continuing use of vaccines, injectables and other pharmaceuticals in alternate-care settings.  We believe we have established a leading position as a vaccine supplier to the office-based physician practitioner.



We believe our international group is a leading European healthcare supplier servicing office-based dental, medical and animal health practices.  We are in the process of implementing SAP software across continental Europe.  Additionally, we are expanding our dental full-service model and our animal health presence in Europe, as well as our medical offerings in countries where opportunities exist.  Through our “Schein Direct” program, we also have the capability to provide door-to-door air package delivery to practitioners in over 200 countries around the world.

Seasonality and Other Factors Affecting Our Business and Quarterly Results



We experience fluctuations in quarterly earnings.  As a result, we may fail to meet or exceed the expectations of securities analysts and investors, which could cause our stock price to decline.



Our business is subject to seasonal and other quarterly fluctuations.  Net sales and operating profits generally have been higher in the third and fourth quarters due to the timing of sales of seasonal products (including influenza vaccine, equipment and software products), purchasing patterns of office-based healthcare practitioners and year-end promotions.  Net sales and operating profits generally have been lower in the first quarter, primarily due to increased sales in the prior two quarters.  We expect our historical seasonality of sales to continue in the foreseeable future.  Quarterly results also may be adversely affected by a variety of other factors, including:



•timing and amount of sales and marketing expenditures;



•timing of pricing changes offered by our vendors;



•timing of the introduction of new products and services by our vendors;



•timing of the release of upgrades and enhancements to our technology-related products and services;



•changes in or availability of vendor contracts or rebate programs;



•vendor rebates based upon attaining certain growth goals;



•changes in the way vendors introduce or deliver products to market;



•costs of developing new applications and services;



•exclusivity requirements with certain vendors may prohibit us from distributing competitive products manufactured by other vendors;



•loss of sales representatives;



•costs related to acquisitions and/or integrations of technologies or businesses;



•costs associated with our self-insured medical insurance program;



•general economic conditions, as well as those specific to the healthcare industry and related industries;



•our success in establishing or maintaining business relationships;



•unexpected difficulties in developing and manufacturing products;



•product demand and availability or recalls by manufacturers;



•exposure to product liability and other claims in the event that the use of the products we sell results in injury;



•increases in the cost of shipping or service issues with our third-party shippers;



•restructuring costs; and



•changes in accounting principles.



Any change in one or more of these or other factors could cause our annual or quarterly operating results to fluctuate.  If our operating results do not meet market expectations, our stock price may decline.





Governmental Regulations



Operating, Security and Licensure Standards



Certain of our businesses involve the distribution of pharmaceuticals and medical devices, and in this regard we are subject to various local, state, federal and foreign governmental laws and regulations applicable to the distribution of pharmaceuticals and medical devices.  Among the federal laws applicable to us are the Controlled Substances Act, the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, as amended, the Prescription Drug Marketing Act of 1987, and Section 361 of the Public Health Service Act.  We are also subject to comparable foreign regulations.



The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act generally regulates the introduction, manufacture, advertising, labeling, packaging, storage, handling, reporting, marketing and distribution of, and record keeping for, pharmaceuticals and medical devices shipped in interstate commerce, and states may similarly regulate such activities within the state.  Section 361 of the Public Health Service Act, which provides authority to prevent the spread of communicable diseases, serves as the legal basis for the United States Food and Drug Administration’s regulation of human cells, tissues, and cellular and tissue-based products, also known as HCT/P products.



The Prescription Drug Marketing Act of 1987 (“PDMA”), which amended the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, and its implementing regulations, establishes certain requirements applicable to the wholesale distribution of prescription drugs, including the requirement that wholesale drug distributors be licensed by each state in which they conduct business, provide certain drug pedigree information on the distribution of prescription drugs and act in accordance with federally established guidelines on storage, handling and record maintenance.



Under the Controlled Substances Act, as a distributor of controlled substances, we are required to obtain and renew annually registrations from the United States Drug Enforcement Administration permitting us to handle controlled substances.  We are also subject to other statutory and regulatory requirements relating to the sale, marketing, handling and distribution of such drugs, in accordance with specified rules and regulations, and these requirements have been subject to heightened enforcement activity in recent times.  We are subject to inspection by the United States Drug Enforcement Administration.





Certain of our businesses are subject to various additional federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations, including with respect to the sale, transportation, storage, handling and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances, and safe working conditions.  In recent years, some states have passed or proposed laws and regulations that are intended to protect the integrity of the medical supply channel.  For example, Florida and certain other states have implemented or are implementing drug pedigree requirements that require that prescription drugs be distributed with records or information documenting the prior distribution of the drug, from distributors and potentially back to the manufacturers.  California has enacted a law requiring the implementation of an electronic drug pedigree system that provides track and trace chain of custody technologies, such as radio frequency identification, or RFID, technologies, although the effective date has been postponed until January 1, 2015 for pharmaceutical manufacturers, and July 1, 2016 for pharmaceutical wholesalers and repackagers.  There have been increasing efforts by various levels of government to regulate the pharmaceutical distribution system in order to prevent the introduction of counterfeit, adulterated or misbranded pharmaceuticals into the distribution system.





At the federal level, the United States Food and Drug Administration issued final regulations pursuant to PDMA that became effective in December 2006. The regulations impose drug pedigree and other chain of custody requirements that increase the costs and/or burden to us of selling our products and handling product returns.  In early December 2006, the federal District Court for the Eastern District of New York issued a preliminary injunction enjoining the implementation of certain of the federal drug pedigree requirements, including the requirement to identify transactions back to the manufacturer.  Nonetheless, prescription drug pedigrees are required under federal regulations and the PDMA, and the pedigree must track back to the last manufacturer or authorized distributor of record, or ADR, that handled the drug.



The United States Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act of 2007, which went into effect on September 27, 2007, requires the United States Food and Drug Administration to establish standards and identify and validate effective technologies for the purpose of securing the pharmaceutical supply chain against counterfeit drugs.  These standards include any track and trace or authentication technologies, such as RFID and other technologies.  The United States Food and Drug Administration has continued to develop its policies in this area, such as issuing a Final Guidance in 2010 regarding standardized numerical identification for prescription drug packages, and announcing its work on developing draft regulations for unique medical device identifiers.



Certain of our businesses also maintain contracts with governmental agencies and are subject to certain regulatory requirements specific to government contractors.



Healthcare Fraud





Healthcare Reform







A provision in the Health Care Reform Law often referred to as the “individual mandate,” which requires individuals without health insurance to pay a penalty, was recently declared unconstitutional by certain federal courts, while certain other federal courts have affirmed its constitutionality   Appeals are pending, and the United States Supreme Court will review this issue during its 2012 term.



Regulated Software; Electronic Health Records



The United States Food and Drug Administration has become increasingly active in addressing the regulation of computer software intended for use in healthcare settings, and has been developing policies on regulating clinical decision support tools as medical devices.  Certain of our businesses involve the development and sale of software and related products to support physician and dental practice management, and it is possible that the FDA could determine that one or more of our products is a medical device, which could subject us or one or more of our businesses to substantial additional requirements with respect to these products.



Certain of our businesses involve access to personal health, medical, financial and other information of individuals, and are accordingly directly or indirectly subject to numerous federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations that protect the privacy and security of such information, and require, among other things, the implementation of various recordkeeping, operational, notice and other practices intended to safeguard that information, limit its use to allowed purposes, and notify individuals in the event of privacy and security breaches.  Failure to comply with these laws can result in substantial penalties and other liabilities. As a result of the federal Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (“HITECH Act”), which was passed in 2009, some of our businesses that were previously only indirectly subject to federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”) privacy and security rules became directly subject to such rules because such businesses serve as “business associates” of HIPAA covered entities, such as health care providers. Additional rules under the HITECH Act are expected to be issued in early 2012, further expanding the privacy and security requirements applicable to some of our businesses.



In addition, the HITECH Act established a program of Medicare and Medicaid incentive payments available to certain health care providers including, among others, physicians and dentists, if they meaningfully use certified electronic health record technology (“EHR”).  Also, eligible providers that fail to adopt certified EHR systems may be subject to Medicare reimbursement reductions beginning in 2015.  Qualification for the incentive payments requires the use of EHRs that are certified as having certain capabilities for meaningful use pursuant to standards adopted by the Department of Health and Human Services.  While initial standards have been established, new versions are expected to be issued over the next several years, and the content of those standards is not certain.  Certain of our businesses involve the manufacture and sale of certified EHR systems, and so must maintain compliance with these evolving governmental criteria.



Also, HIPAA requires certain health care providers, such as physicians, to use certain transaction and code set rules for specified electronic transactions, such as transactions involving claims submissions.  As of January 1, 2012, subject to 90 days of CMS enforcement discretion, electronic claim submissions and related electronic transactions were required to be conducted under a new HIPAA transaction standard, called Version 5010.  CMS is requiring this upgrade in connection with another new requirement applicable to the industry, the implementation of new diagnostic code sets to be used in claims submission.  The new diagnostic code sets are called the ICD-10-CM, and are to be implemented on October 1, 2013.  Certain of our businesses provide electronic practice management products that must meet those requirements, and while we believe we are prepared to timely adopt the new standards, it is possible that the transition to these new standards, particularly the transition to ICD-10-CM, may result in a degree of disruption and confusion, thus potentially increasing the costs associated with supporting this product.



International Transactions



In addition, United States and international import and export laws and regulations require us to abide by certain standards relating to the importation and exportation of products.  We also are subject to certain laws and regulations concerning the conduct of our foreign operations, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and anti-bribery laws and laws pertaining to the accuracy of our internal books and records, as well as other types of requirements similar to those imposed in the United States.





While we believe that we are substantially compliant with the foregoing laws and regulations promulgated thereunder and possess all material permits and licenses required for the conduct of our business, there can be no assurance that regulations that impact our business or customers’ practices will not have a material adverse impact on our business.  As a result of political, economic and regulatory influences, the healthcare distribution industry in the United States is under intense scrutiny and subject to fundamental changes.  We cannot predict what further reform proposals, if any, will be adopted, when they may be adopted, or what impact they may have on us.



See “ITEM 1A. Risk Factors” for a discussion of additional regulatory developments that may affect our results of operations and financial condition.



Proprietary Rights



We hold trademarks relating to the “Henry Schein” name and logo, as well as certain other trademarks.  Pursuant to agreements executed in connection with our reorganization in 1994, both Henry Schein, Inc. and Schein Pharmaceutical, Inc. (which was acquired by Watson Pharmaceuticals, Inc. in 2000), a company previously engaged in the manufacture and distribution of multi-source pharmaceutical products, are entitled to use the “Schein” name in connection with their respective businesses, but Schein Pharmaceutical, Inc. must always use “Schein” in combination with the word “Pharmaceutical” and is not entitled to use the name “Henry Schein” or to use “Schein” alone or with any other word (other than “Pharmaceutical”).  We intend to protect our trademarks to the fullest extent practicable.



Employees
