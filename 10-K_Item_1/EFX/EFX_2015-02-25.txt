We also maintain support operations in the Republic of Ireland. We offer credit services in Russia and India through joint ventures and have an investment in the second largest consumer and commercial credit information company in Brazil.



Equifax was originally incorporated under the laws of the State of Georgia in 1913, and its predecessor company dates back to 1899.

OUR BUSINESS STRATEGY



Our strategic objective is to be the global leader in information solutions that creates unparalleled insights to solve customer challenges. Data is at the core of our value proposition. Leveraging our extensive resources, we deliver differentiated decisions through a broad and diverse set of data assets, sophisticated analytics and proprietary decisioning technology. Our comprehensive set of data assets can provide an in-depth view of the consumer’s financial potential and opportunity including their propensity, ability and capacity to pay. Our long-term corporate growth strategy is driven by the following initiatives:



•Increase penetration of our clients’ information solutions needs.We seek to increase our share of clients’ spend on information-related services through developing and introducing new products, pricing our services in accordance with the value they represent to our customers, increasing the range of current services utilized by our clients, and improving the quality and effectiveness of our sales organization and client support interactions with consumers. We are also helping clients address increased requirements to comply with emerging regulations and rules.



•Deploy decisioning technologies and analytics globally.We continue to invest in and develop new technology to enhance the functionality, cost-effectiveness and security of the services we offer and further differentiate our products from those offered by our competitors. In addition to custom products for large clients, we develop off-the-shelf, decisioning technology platforms that are more cost effective for medium and smaller-sized clients. We also develop predictive scores and analytics, some of which leverage multiple data assets, to help clients acquire new customers and manage their existing customer relationships. We develop a broad array of industry, risk management, cross-sell and account acquisition models to enhance the precision of our clients’ decisioning activities. We also develop custom and generic solutions that enable customers to more effectively manage their debt collection and recovery portfolios.



•Invest in unique data sources.We continue to invest in and acquire unique sources of credit and non-credit information to enhance the variety and quality of our services while increasing clients’ confidence in information-based business decisions. Areas of focus for investment in new sources of data include, among others, positive payment data, real estate data and new commercial business data.  We also have developed unique capabilities to integrate customer and third-party data into our solution offerings to further enhance the decisioning solutions we develop for our customers.












•Pursue new vertical markets and expand into emerging markets.We believe there are many opportunities to expand into emerging markets both in the U.S. and internationally. In the U.S., we have increased and broadened resources in key markets, including auto, insurance, telecommunications, and government, and we are delivering services ranging from identity authentication and management to risk management. We continue to invest in growing our ventures in Russia and India and continue to leverage our newer product offerings across all of our geographical business units and periodically enter new country markets through acquisitions or start up operations.



•Serve as a trusted steward and advocate for our customers and consumers.This includes continuously improving the customer and consumer experience in our consumer and commercial offerings, anticipating and executing on regulatory initiatives, while simultaneously delivering security for our services.









MARKETS AND CLIENTS



Our products and services serve clients across a wide range of verticals, including financial services, mortgage, human resources, consumer, commercial, telecommunications, retail, automotive, utilities, brokerage, healthcare and insurance industries, as well as state and federal governments. We also serve consumers directly. Our revenue stream is highly diversified with our largest client providing only 2% of total revenue.

We market our products and services primarily through our own direct sales organization that is organized around sales teams that focus on client segments typically aligned by vertical markets and geography. Sales groups are based in our headquarters in Atlanta, Georgia, and field offices located in the U.S. and in the countries where we have operations. We also market our products and services through indirect channels, including alliance partners, joint ventures and other resellers. In addition, we sell through direct mail and various websites, such aswww.equifax.com.



Our largest geographic market segments are North America (the U.S. and Canada); Europe (the U.K., Spain and Portugal); and Latin America (Argentina, Chile, Costa Rica, Ecuador, El Salvador, Honduras, Mexico, Paraguay, Peru and Uruguay).

Each of our operating segments is described more fully below.





USIS



USIS provides consumer information solutions to businesses in the U.S. through three product and service lines, as follows:












Online Information Solutions.



Online Information Solutions’ clients access products through a full range of electronic distribution mechanisms, including direct real-time access, which facilitates instant decisions. We also develop and host customized applications that enhance the decision-making process for our clients. These decisioning technology applications assist with a wide variety of decisioning activities, including determining pre-approved offers, cross-selling of various products, determining deposit amounts for telephone and utility companies, and verifying the identity of their customers. We have also compiled commercial databases regarding businesses in the U.S., which include loan, credit card, public records and leasing history data, trade accounts receivable performance, and Secretary of State and Securities and Exchange Commission registration information. We offer scoring and analytical services that provide additional information to help mitigate the credit risk assumed by our clients.



Mortgage Solutions.Our Mortgage Solutions products, offered in the U.S., consist of specialized credit reports that combine information from the three major consumer credit reporting agencies (Equifax, Experian Group and TransUnion LLC) into a single “merged” credit report in an online format, commonly referred to as a tri-merge report. Mortgage lenders use these tri-merge reports in making their mortgage underwriting decisions. Additionally, we offer various “triggering” services designed to alert lenders to changes in a consumer’s credit status during the underwriting period and securitized portfolio risk assessment services for evaluating inherent portfolio risk.



Financial Marketing Services.Our Financial Marketing Services products utilize consumer and commercial financial information enabling our clients to more effectively manage their marketing efforts, including targeting and segmentation; to identify and acquire new clients for their products and services; to develop portfolio strategies to minimize risk and maximize profitability; and to realize additional revenue from existing customers through more effective cross selling and upselling of additional products and services. These products utilize information derived from consumer and commercial information, including credit, income, asset, liquidity, net worth and spending activity, which also support many of our Online Information Solutions’ products. These data assets broaden the understanding of consumer and business financial potential and opportunity which can further drive high value decisioning and targeting solutions for our clients. We also provide account review services, which assist our clients in managing their existing customers and prescreen services that help our clients identify new opportunities with their customers. Clients for these products primarily include institutions in the banking, brokerage, retail, insurance and mortgage industries as well as companies primarily focused on digital and interactive marketing.



International



The International operating segment includes our Canada, Europe and Latin America business units. These business units offer products that are similar to those available in the USIS and Personal Solutions operating segments, although, in some jurisdictions, data sources tend to rely more heavily on government agencies than in the U.S. We also offer specialized services that help our customers better manage risk in their consumer portfolios.  This operating segment’s products and services generate revenue in Argentina, Canada, Chile, Costa Rica, Ecuador, El Salvador, Honduras, Mexico, Paraguay, Peru, Portugal, Spain, the U.K. and Uruguay. We also maintain support operations in the Republic of Ireland, Chile and Costa Rica. We offer consumer credit services in Russia and India through our investment in joint ventures and have an investment in the second largest consumer and commercial credit information company in Brazil. We also provide information, technology and services to support debt collections and recovery management in Europe and Latin America.












Canada.Similar to Online Information Solutions, Mortgage Solutions and Financial Marketing Services business units, Canada offers products derived from the credit information that we maintain about individual consumers and businesses. We offer many products in Canada, including credit reporting and scoring, consumer and commercial marketing, risk management, fraud detection and modeling services, identity management and authentication services, together with certain of our decisioning products that facilitate pre-approved offers of credit and automate a variety of credit decisions.



Europe.Our European operation provides information solutions, marketing and personal solutions products. Information solutions and personal solutions products are generated from information that we maintain and include credit reporting and scoring, asset information, risk management, identity management and authentication services, fraud detection and modeling services. Most of these products are sold in the U.K. with a more limited set of information solutions products sold in Portugal and Spain. Our commercial products, such as business credit reporting and commercial risk management services, are available mostly in the U.K, with a more limited set of information solutions products sold in Portugal and Spain. Marketing products, which are similar to those offered in our Financial Marketing Services business unit, are primarily available in the U.K. and, to a lesser extent, in Spain. Beginning in 2014, we also provide information, technology and services to support debt collections and recovery management.



Latin America.Our Latin American operation provides consumer and commercial information solutions products,  marketing products and personal solutions products. We offer a full range of products, generated from credit records that we maintain, including credit reporting and scoring, decisioning technology, risk management, identity management, authentication and fraud detection services. Our consumer products are the primary source of revenue in each of the countries in which we operate. We also offer various commercial products, which include credit reporting, decisioning tools and risk management services, in the countries we serve. Beginning in 2013, we also provide information, technology and services to support debt collections and recovery management. Additionally, we provide a variety of consumer and commercial marketing products generated from our credit information databases, including business profile analysis, business prospect lists and database management. The countries in which we operate include Argentina, Chile, Costa Rica, Ecuador, El Salvador, Honduras, Mexico, Paraguay, Peru and Uruguay.



Workforce Solutions



Workforce Solutions operates in the U.S. through two business units:



Verification Services.Verification Services include employment, income and social security number verification services. Our online verification services enable direct third-party verifiers including various governmental agencies, mortgage originators, credit card and automotive lenders and pre-employment screeners to verify the employee’s employment status and income information. We also offer an offline research verification service, which expands employment verification to locate data outside our existing automated database.  Our services also include IRS income verifications using theIncomeChek®product as well as identity verification through a secure, web-based portal using theDirectChek®product.



The Work Number is our key repository of employment and income data serving our verifier business and enabling employer human resource services.  We rely on payroll data received from over 4,300 organizations, including almost three quarters of Fortune 500 companies, to regularly update the database. The updates occur as employers transmit data electronically to Equifax from their payroll systems. Employers contract to provide this data for specified periods under the terms of contracts which range from one to five years. We use this data to provide automated employment and income verification services to third-party verifiers as well as enabling employer services such as unemployment claims, I-9 and eVerify transactions and employer tax credits opportunities.



The fees we charge for these services are generally on a per transaction basis. After the expiration of the applicable contract, absent renewal by mutual agreement of the parties, we generally do not have any further right to use the employment data we obtained pursuant to the contract. We have not experienced significant turnover in the employer contributors to the database because we generally do not charge them to add their employment data to the database and the verification service we offer relieves them of the administrative burden and expense of responding to third-party employment verification requests. The database contained approximately 255 million current and historic employment records atDecember 31, 2014.












Employer Services.



North America Personal Solutions



Our Personal Solutions products give consumers information to enable them to understand and monitor their credit and monitor and help protect their identity primarily through our Equifax Complete, ID Patrol, Credit Watch and Score Watch monitoring products. Consumers can obtain credit file information about them and Equifax or FICO credit scores. Equifax products also offer monitoring features for consumers who are concerned about identity theft and data breaches, including credit report monitoring from all three bureaus, internet and bank account monitoring, lost wallet support, and the ability to lock and unlock the Equifax credit file. Our products are available to consumers in the United States and Canada directly primarily over the internet and indirectly through relationships with business partners who distribute our products or provide these services to their employees or customers.





COMPETITION



The market for our products and services is highly competitive and is subject to constant change. Our competitors vary widely in size and the nature of the products and services they offer. Sources of competition are numerous and include the following:





•



•Competition for our commercial solutions products primarily includes Experian, The Dun & Bradstreet Corporation and Cortera, Inc., and providers of these services in the international markets we serve. We believe our access to and knowledge of U.S. small business loan information from financial institutions combined with our consumer credit information in the case of small business owners enables more efficient and effective decision-making for the small business segment of that market.












•Competition for our employment and income verification services includes large employers who serve their own needs through in-house systems to manage verification as well as regional online verification companies, such as Verify Jobs and First Advantage, who offer verification services along with other human resources and tax services. Competition for Employer Services includes payroll processors such as Automatic Data Processing, Inc., or ADP, Paychex, Inc. and Ceridian Corporation. Competitors of our Tax Management Services include in-house management of this function primarily by large employers, ADP, and a number of smaller regional firms that offer tax management services (including Barnett Associates, Thomas & Thorngren, and UC Advantage).



•Competition for our debt collection and recovery management software, services and analytics is similar to the competition for our consumer information solutions and personal solutions products.  We believe that the breadth and depth of our data assets enable our clients to develop a more current and comprehensive view of consumers.  In the category of platforms and analytics, we compete to some extent with entities that deploy collections platforms, account management systems or recovery solutions.



While we believe that none of our competitors offers the same mix of products and services as we do, certain competitors may have a larger share of particular geographic or product markets or operate in geographic areas where we do not currently have a presence.



We assess the principal competitive factors affecting our markets to include: product attributes such as quality, depth, coverage, adaptability, scalability, interoperability, functionality and ease of use; product price; technical performance; access to unique proprietary databases; availability in application service provider, or ASP, format; quickness of response, flexibility and client services and support; effectiveness of sales and marketing efforts; existing market penetration; new product innovation; and our reputation as a trusted steward of information.





TECHNOLOGY AND INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY



We generally seek protection under federal, state and foreign laws for strategic or financially important intellectual property developed in connection with our business. Certain intellectual property, where appropriate, is protected by registration under applicable trademark laws or by prosecution of patent applications. We own a number of patents registered in the U.S. and several in foreign countries. We also have certain registered trademarks, service marks, logos and internet URLs in the U.S. and in many foreign countries, the most important of which are “Equifax,” "Decision360," “The Work Number” and variations thereof. These marks are used in connection with many of our product lines and services. We believe that, in the aggregate, the rights under our patents and trademarks are generally important to our operations and competitive position, but we do not regard any of our businesses as being dependent upon any single patent or group of patents or trademark. However, certain Company trademarks, which contribute to our identity and the recognition of our products and services, including but not limited to the “Equifax” trademark, are an integral part of our business, and their loss could have a material adverse effect on us. We also protect certain of our confidential intellectual property and technology in compliance with trade secret laws and through the use of nondisclosure agreements.



We license other companies to use certain data, software, and other technology and intellectual property rights we own or control, primarily as core components of our products and services, on terms that are consistent with customary industry standards and that are designed to protect our interest in our intellectual property. Other companies license us to use certain data, technology and other intellectual property rights they own or control.  For example, we license credit-scoring algorithms and the right to sell credit scores derived from those algorithms from third parties for a fee. We do not hold any franchises or concessions that are material to our business or results of operations.





GOVERNMENTAL REGULATION



We are subject to a number of U.S. federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations that involve matters central to our business.  These laws and regulations may involve privacy, data protection, intellectual property, competition, consumer protection, anti-corruption, anti-bribery, anti-money laundering, employment, health, taxation or other subjects.  In particular, we are subject to federal, state and foreign laws regarding the collection, protection, dissemination and use of non-public personal information we have in our possession and to consumer financial protection.  Foreign data and consumer protection, privacy and other laws and regulations are often more restrictive than those in the U.S.  Failure to satisfy those legal and regulatory requirements, or the adoption of new laws or regulations, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition or liquidity.












U.S. federal and state and foreign laws and regulations are evolving and can be subject to significant change.  In addition, the application and interpretation of these laws and regulations are often uncertain.  These laws are enforced by federal, state and local regulatory agencies in the jurisdictions where we operate, and in some instances also through private civil litigation. There are also a number of legislative proposals pending before the U.S. Congress, various state legislative bodies, and foreign governments concerning consumer and data protection which could affect us.



Summary of U.S. Regulation Relating to Consumer and Data Protection



Our U.S. operations are subject to numerous laws and regulations governing the collection, protection and use of consumer credit and other information, and imposing sanctions for the misuse of such information or unauthorized access to data. Many of these provisions also affect our customers’ use of consumer credit or other data we furnish.



Examples of the most significant of these laws include, but are not limited to, the following:



Federal Laws and Regulation



•Under Title X of the Dodd-Frank Act, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (“CFPB”) has broad powers to promulgate, administer and enforce consumer financial regulations, including those applicable to us and to many of our customers.  The CFPB has oversight of the Fair Credit Reporting Act, as amended (“FCRA”), the federal regulation most directly impacting our U.S. operations. The CFPB is also charged with defining “unfair, deceptive or abusive acts and practices”, known as “UDAAP”.  It conducts examinations for purposes of assessing compliance with federal consumer financial protection laws; has been requesting information about the business activities affecting consumers and compliance systems or procedures; and it has devoted resources to detecting and assessing risks to consumers and to markets for consumer financial products and services.



The CFPB may pursue administrative proceedings or litigation to enforce these laws and rules. In these proceedings, the CFPB can obtain cease and desist orders, which can include orders for restitution to consumers or rescission of contracts, as well as other kinds of affirmative relief, and monetary penalties ranging from $5,000 per day for ordinary violations of federal consumer financial laws to $25,000 per day for reckless violations, and $1 million per day for knowing violations. Also, where a company has violated Title X of the Dodd-Frank Act, or CFPB regulations under Title X, the Dodd-Frank Act empowers state attorneys general and state regulators to bring civil actions for the kind of cease and desist orders available to the CFPB (but not for civil penalties).



Under UDAAP, the CFPB has exercised its broad powers to examine the acts and practices of entities subject to its jurisdiction and declare those acts or practices to be unfair, deceptive or abusive.



If the CFPB or one or more state officials believe that we have committed a violation of the foregoing laws, they could exercise their enforcement powers in a manner that would have material adverse effect on us.  We are currently the subject of investigations by state attorneys general and the CFPB as more fully described under Item 3. Legal Proceedings in this Form 10-K.  At this time, we cannot predict the extent to which the Dodd-Frank Act, the resulting rules and regulations, including those of the CFPB, or exercise of its or other enforcement powers will impact our operational results, financial condition, or liquidity.



The CFPB examinations may include the filing of reports, reviewing materials we use to offer products and services and our compliance management systems and procedures. Our CFPB examinations to date have covered our regulatory compliance management system, the U.S. portion of our North America Personal Solutions business unit (direct-to-consumer), our consumer dispute handling process, and our data accuracy. We are continuing to constructively engage with the CFPB on the results of all examinations.



•The Federal Trade Commission Act (“FTC Act”) prohibits unfair methods of competition and unfair or deceptive acts or practices. We must comply with the FTC Act when we market our services, such as consumer credit monitoring services offered through our Personal Solutions unit. The security measures we employ to safeguard the personal data of consumers could also be subject to the FTC Act, and failure to safeguard data adequately may subject us to regulatory scrutiny or enforcement action. There is no private right of action under the FTC Act.












•The FCRA regulates consumer reporting agencies, including us, as well as data furnishers and users of consumer reports such as banks and other companies.  FCRA provisions govern the accuracy, fairness and privacy of information in the files of consumer reporting agencies (“CRAs”) that engage in the practice of assembling or evaluating certain information relating to consumers for certain specified purposes.  The FCRA limits the type of information that may be reported by CRAs, limits the distribution and use of consumer reports and establishes customer rights to access and dispute their credit files.  CRAs are required to follow reasonable procedures to assure maximum possible accuracy of the information concerning the individual about whom the report relates and if a consumer disputes the accuracy of any information in the consumer’s file to conduct a reasonable reinvestigation.  CRAs are required to make available to consumers a free annual credit report.  The FCRA imposes many other requirements on CRAs, data furnishers and users of consumer report information.  Violation of the FCRA can result in civil and criminal penalties.  The FCRA contains an attorney fee shifting provision to provide an incentive for consumers to bring individual or class action lawsuits against a CRA for violations of the FCRA.  Regulatory enforcement of the FCRA is by the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”), the CFPB, and the State Attorneys General, acting alone or in concert with one another.



•The Financial Services Modernization Act of 1999, or Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (“GLB Act”), regulates, among other things, the use of non-public personal financial information of consumers that is held by financial institutions, including us. We are subject to various GLB Act provisions, including rules relating to the use or disclosure of the underlying data and rules relating to the physical, administrative and technological protection of non-public personal financial information. Breach of the GLB Act can result in civil and/or criminal liability and sanctions by regulatory authorities, such as fines of up to $100,000 per violation and up to five years imprisonment for individuals.  Regulatory enforcement of the GLB Act is under the purview of the FTC and State Attorneys General, acting alone or in concert with each other.



•The Credit Repair Organizations Act (“CROA”) regulates companies that claim to be able to assist consumers in improving their credit standing. There have been efforts to apply the CROA to credit monitoring services offered by consumer reporting agencies and others. CROA allows for a private right of action and permits consumers to recover all money paid for alleged “credit repair” services in the event of violation.



State Laws and Regulation Relating to Consumer and Data Protection



•A number of states have enacted requirements similar to the federal FCRA.  Some of these state laws impose additional, or more stringent, requirements than the FCRA, especially in connection with the investigations and responses to reported inaccuracies in consumer reports.  The FCRA preempts some of these state laws, but the scope of preemption continues to be defined by the courts.  The state of Vermont is grandfathered under the original FCRA requirements and thus we are subject to additional requirements to comply with Vermont law.



•Most states and the District of Columbia have passed laws that give consumers the right to place a security freeze on their credit reports to prevent others from opening new accounts or obtaining new credit in their name.  These laws place differing requirements on credit reporting agencies with respect to how and when to respond to such credit file freeze requests and in the fees, if any, the agencies may charge for freeze-related actions.



•A majority of states have adopted versions of data security breach laws that require notification of affected consumers in the event of a breach of personal information.  Some of these laws require additional data protection measures which exceed the GLB Act data safeguarding requirements.  If data within our system is compromised by a breach, we may be subject to provisions of various state security breach laws.



Summary of International Regulation Relating to Consumer and Data Protection



We are subject to various data protection, privacy and consumer credit laws and regulations in the foreign countries where we operate including among others the following:












•





•



•In Canada, federal and provincial laws govern how we collect, use or disclose personal information in the course of our commercial activities. The federal Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act of 2000 gives individuals the right to access and request correction of their personal information collected by us, and requires compliance with the Canadian Standard Association Model Code for the Protection of Personal Information covering accountability and identifying purposes, consent, collection, use, disclosure, retention, accuracy, safeguards, individual access and compliance. The federal and provincial privacy regulators have powers of investigation and intervention, and provisions of Canadian law regarding civil liability apply in the event of unlawful processing which is prejudicial to the persons concerned. The European Union, or EU, recognizes Canada as having adequate levels of protection for personal data transfers and processing.



•In Latin America, consumer reporting, data protection and privacy laws and regulations exist in various forms in Argentina, Chile, Costa Rica, Ecuador, El Salvador, Paraguay, Peru and Uruguay. Argentina and Uruguay generally follow the EU data protection model, and the EU recognizes Argentina’s laws as providing adequate levels of protection for personal data transfers and processing. Among other protections, laws in all of these countries generally allow individuals to access and request corrections of personal data.














•



•In India, various legislation including the Information Technology Act 2000 and the Credit Information Companies Regulation Act of 2005 establishes a federal data protection framework. Entities that collect and maintain personal credit information must ensure that it is complete, accurate and safeguarded, and must adopt certain privacy principles with respect to collecting, processing, preserving, sharing and using such credit information. The Indian parliament has passed legislation that would allow individuals to sue for damages in the case of a data breach, if the entity negligently failed to implement reasonable security practices and procedures to protect personal data.  Our Indian joint venture is subject to regulation by the Reserve Bank of India, which is the Indian central bank.



•In Russia, credit reporting activities are governed by the Federal Law on Credit Histories No.218-fz, dated December 30, 2004.  The law regulates the contents of credit files, consent, who may submit data to a credit bureau and how credit reports may be used.












Tax Management Services



The Tax Management Services business within our Workforce Solutions segment is potentially impacted by changes in renewal or non-renewal of U.S. tax laws or interpretations, for example, those pertaining to work opportunity tax credits and unemployment compensation claims.





PERSONNEL



Equifax employed approximately 7,500 employees in 20 countries as ofDecember 31, 2014. None of our U.S. employees are subject to a collective bargaining agreement and no work stoppages have been experienced. Pursuant to local laws, certain of our employees in Argentina and Spain are covered under government-mandated collective bargaining regulations that govern general salary and compensation matters, basic benefits and hours of work.  In some of our non-U.S. subsidiaries, certain of our employees are represented by workers’ councils or statutory labor unions.
