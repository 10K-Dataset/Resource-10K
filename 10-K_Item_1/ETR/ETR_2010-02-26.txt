ENTERGY'S BUSINESS

Entergy is an integrated energy company engaged primarily in electric power production and retail electric distribution operations.  Entergy owns and operates power plants with approximately 30,000 MW of aggregate electric generating capacity, and Entergy is the second-largest nuclear power generator in the United States.  Entergy delivers electricity to 2.7 million utility customers in Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas.  Entergy generated annual revenues of $10.7 billion in 2009 and had approximately 15,000 employees as of December 31, 2009.

Entergy operates primarily through two business segments: Utility and Non-Utility Nuclear.

·  
Utility generates, transmits, distributes, and sells electric power in a four-state service territory that includes portions of Arkansas, Mississippi, Texas, and Louisiana, including the City of New Orleans; and operates a small natural gas distribution business.
·  
Non-Utility Nuclear owns and operates six nuclear power plants located in the northern United States and sells the electric power produced by those plants primarily to wholesale customers.  This business also provides services to other nuclear power plant owners.  As discussed further in "Management's Financial Discussion and Analysis," in November 2007, the Board approved a plan to pursue a separation of the Non-Utility Nuclear business from Entergy through a tax-free spin-off of Non-Utility Nuclear to Entergy shareholders.

In addition to its two primary, reportable, operating segments, Entergy also operates the non-nuclear wholesale assets business.  The non-nuclear wholesale assets business sells to wholesale customers the electric power produced by power plants that it owns while it focuses on improving performance and exploring sales or restructuring opportunities for its power plants.  Such opportunities are evaluated consistent with Entergy's market-based point-of-view.

ENTERGY'S BUSINESS (continued from page 3)



Utility

The
Utility business segment includes six wholly-owned retail electric utility
subsidiaries: Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, Entergy
Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, Entergy New Orleans, and Entergy
Texas.  These companies generate, transmit, distribute and sell
electric power to retail and wholesale customers in Arkansas, Louisiana,
Mississippi, and Texas. Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy New Orleans
also provide natural gas utility services to customers in and around Baton
Rouge, Louisiana, and New Orleans, Louisiana, respectively.  Also
included in the Utility is System Energy, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Entergy
Corporation that owns or leases 90 percent of Grand Gulf.  System
Energy sells its power and capacity from Grand Gulf at wholesale to Entergy
Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, and Entergy New
Orleans.

The six
retail utility subsidiaries are each regulated by state utility commissions, or,
in the case of Entergy New Orleans, the City Council.  System Energy
is regulated by FERC as all of its transactions are at the wholesale level. The
Utility continues to operate as a rate-regulated business as efforts toward
deregulation have been delayed, abandoned, or not initiated in its service
territories.  The overall generation portfolio of the Utility, which
relies heavily on natural gas and nuclear generation, is consistent with
Entergy's strong support for the environment.

The
Utility is focused on providing highly reliable and cost-effective electricity
and gas service while working in an environment that provides the highest level
of safety for its employees.  Since 1998, the Utility has
significantly improved key customer service, reliability, and safety metrics and
continues to actively pursue additional improvements.

Retail
Rate Regulation

General

(Entergy
Arkansas, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi,
Entergy New Orleans, and Entergy Texas)

Each Utility operating company
participates in retail rate proceedings on a consistent basis.  The
status of material retail rate proceedings is described in Note 2 to the
financial statements.  Certain aspects of the Utility operating
companies' retail rate mechanisms are discussed below.

Entergy
Arkansas

Fuel and Purchased Power
Cost Recovery

Entergy Arkansas' rate schedules
include an energy cost recovery rider to recover fuel and purchased energy costs
in monthly bills.  The rider utilizes prior calendar year energy costs
and projected energy sales for the twelve-month period commencing on April 1 of
each year to develop an energy cost rate, which is redetermined annually and
includes a true-up adjustment reflecting the over-recovery or under-recovery,
including carrying charges, of the energy cost for the prior calendar
year.  The energy cost recovery rider tariff also allows an interim
rate request depending upon the level of over- or under-recovery of fuel and
purchased energy costs.  In December 2007, the APSC issued an order
stating that Entergy Arkansas' energy cost recovery rider will remain in effect,
and any future termination of the rider would be subject to eighteen months
advance notice by the APSC, which would occur following notice and
hearing.  See Note 2 to the financial statements for a discussion of
Entergy Arkansas' energy cost recovery rider proceedings before the
APSC.

Storm Cost
Recovery

See Note
2 to the financial statements for a discussion of proceedings regarding recovery
of Entergy Arkansas' storm restoration costs.

Entergy
Gulf States Louisiana

Fuel
Recovery

Entergy Gulf States Louisiana's
electric rates include a fuel adjustment clause designed to recover the cost of
fuel and purchased power costs.  The fuel adjustment clause contains a
surcharge or credit for deferred fuel expense and related carrying charges
arising from the monthly reconciliation of actual fuel costs incurred with fuel
cost revenues billed to customers, including carrying charges.

To help stabilize electricity costs,
Entergy Gulf States Louisiana received approval from the LPSC to hedge its
exposure to natural gas price volatility through the use of financial
instruments.  Entergy Gulf States Louisiana hedges approximately
one-third of the projected exposure to natural gas price changes for the gas
used to serve its native electric load for all months of the
year.  The hedge quantity is reviewed on an annual basis.

Entergy Gulf States Louisiana's gas
rates include a purchased gas adjustment clause based on estimated gas costs for
the billing month adjusted by a surcharge or credit that arises from an annual
reconciliation of fuel costs incurred with fuel cost revenues billed to
customers, including carrying charges.

To help stabilize retail gas costs,
Entergy Gulf States Louisiana received approval from the LPSC to hedge its
exposure to natural gas price volatility for its gas purchased for resale
through the use of financial instruments.  Entergy Gulf States
Louisiana hedges approximately one-half of the projected natural gas volumes
used to serve its natural gas customers for November through
March.  The hedge quantity is reviewed on an annual
basis.

Entergy
Louisiana

Fuel
Recovery

Entergy Louisiana's rate schedules
include a fuel adjustment clause designed to recover the cost of fuel and
purchased power costs.  The fuel adjustment clause contains a
surcharge or credit for deferred fuel expense and related carrying charges
arising from the monthly reconciliation of actual fuel costs incurred with fuel
cost revenues billed to customers, including carrying charges.

In the Delaney vs. Entergy Louisiana
proceeding, the LPSC ordered Entergy Louisiana, beginning with the May 2000 fuel
adjustment clause filing, to re-price costs flowed through its fuel adjustment
clause related to the Evangeline gas contract so that the price included for
fuel adjustment clause recovery shall thereafter be at the rate of the Henry Hub
first of the month cash market price (as reported by the publication

Inside FERC

) plus $0.24 per
mmBtu for the month for which the fuel adjustment clause is calculated,
irrespective of the actual cost for the Evangeline contract quantity reflected
in that month's fuel adjustment clause.

To help stabilize electricity costs,
Entergy Louisiana received approval from the LPSC in 2001 to hedge its exposure
to natural gas price volatility through the use of financial
instruments.  Entergy Louisiana hedges approximately one-third of the
projected exposure to natural gas price changes for the gas used to serve its
native electric load for all months of the year.  The hedge quantity
is reviewed on an annual basis.

In September 2002, Entergy Louisiana
settled a proceeding that concerned a contract entered into by Entergy Louisiana
to purchase, through 2031, energy generated by a hydroelectric facility known as
the Vidalia project.  In the settlement, the LPSC approved Entergy
Louisiana's proposed treatment of the regulatory effect of the benefit from a
tax accounting election related to that project.  In general, the
settlement permits Entergy Louisiana to keep a portion of the tax benefit in
exchange for bearing the risk associated with sustaining the tax
treatment.  The LPSC settlement divided the term of the Vidalia
contract into two segments: 2002-2012 and 2013-2031. During the first eight
years of the 2002-2012 segment, Entergy Louisiana agreed to credit rates by
flowing through its fuel adjustment calculation $11 million each year, beginning
monthly in October 2002.  Entergy Louisiana must credit rates in this
way and by this amount even if Entergy Louisiana is unable to sustain the tax
deduction.  Entergy Louisiana also must credit rates by $11 million
each year for an additional two years unless either the tax accounting method
elected is retroactively repealed or the IRS denies the entire deduction related
to the tax accounting method.  In addition, in accordance with an LPSC
settlement, Entergy Louisiana credited rates in August 2007 by $11.8 million
(including interest) as a result of a settlement with the IRS of the 2001 tax
treatment of the Vidalia contract.  Entergy Louisiana agreed to credit
ratepayers additional amounts unless the tax accounting election was not
sustained.  During the years 2013-2031, Entergy Louisiana and its
ratepayers would share the remaining benefits of this tax accounting
election.  Note 8 to the financial statements contains further
discussion of the obligations related to the Vidalia project.

Entergy
Mississippi

Fuel
Recovery

Entergy Mississippi's rate schedules
include energy cost recovery riders to recover fuel and purchased energy
costs.  The rider utilizes projected energy costs filed quarterly by
Entergy Mississippi to develop an energy cost rate.  The energy cost
rate is redetermined each calendar quarter and includes a true-up adjustment
reflecting the over-recovery or under-recovery of the energy cost as of the
second quarter preceding the redetermination.

Power Management
Rider

The MPSC
approved the purchase of the Attala power plant in November 2005.  In
December 2005, the MPSC issued an order approving the investment cost recovery
through its power management rider and limited the recovery to a period that
begins with the closing date of the purchase and ends the earlier of the date
costs are incorporated into base rates or December 31, 2006.  As a
consequence of the events surrounding Entergy Mississippi's ongoing efforts to
recover storm restoration costs associated with Hurricane Katrina, in October
2006, the MPSC approved a revision to Entergy Mississippi's power management
rider.  The revision has the effect of allowing Entergy Mississippi to
recover the annual ownership costs of the Attala plant until such time as a
general rate case is filed.

To help stabilize electricity costs,
Entergy Mississippi received approval from the MPSC to hedge its exposure to
natural gas price volatility through the use of financial
instruments.  Entergy Mississippi hedges approximately one-half of the
projected exposure to natural gas price changes for the gas used to serve its
native electric load for all months of the year.  The hedge quantity
is reviewed on an annual basis.

Storm Cost
Recovery

See Note

Entergy
New Orleans

Fuel
Recovery

Entergy New Orleans' electric rate
schedules include a fuel adjustment tariff designed to reflect no more than
targeted fuel and purchased power costs, adjusted by a surcharge or credit for
deferred fuel expense arising from the monthly reconciliation of actual fuel and
purchased power costs incurred with fuel cost revenues billed to customers,
including carrying charges.  In June 2006, the City Council authorized
the recovery of all Grand Gulf costs through Entergy New Orleans' fuel
adjustment clause (a significant portion of Grand Gulf costs was previously
recovered through base rates), and continued that authorization in approving the
October 2006 formula rate plan filing settlement.  Effective June
2009, the majority of Grand Gulf costs were realigned to base rates and are no
longer flowed through the fuel adjustment clause.

Entergy New Orleans' gas rate schedules
include a purchased gas adjustment to reflect estimated gas costs for the
billing month, adjusted by a surcharge or credit similar to that included in the
electric fuel adjustment clause, including carrying charges.  In
October 2005, the City Council approved modification of the current gas cost
collection mechanism effective November 2005 in order to address concerns
regarding its fluctuations, particularly during the winter heating
season.  The modifications are intended to minimize fluctuations in
gas rates during the winter months.

To help stabilize retail gas costs,
Entergy New Orleans received approval from the City Council to hedge its
exposure to natural gas price volatility for its gas purchased for resale
through the use of financial instruments.  Entergy New Orleans hedges
approximately one-half of the projected natural gas volumes used to serve its
natural gas customers for November through March.  The hedge quantity
is reviewed on an annual basis.

Entergy
Texas

Fuel
Recovery

Entergy Texas' rate schedules include a
fixed fuel factor to recover fuel and purchased power costs, including carrying
charges, not recovered in base rates.  The fixed fuel factor formula
was revised and approved by a PUCT order in August 2006.  The new
formula was implemented in September 2006.  Under the new method,
semi-annual revisions of the fixed fuel factor will continue to be made in March
and September based on the expected change in the market price of natural gas
over the next 12 months.  The method also accounts for changes in
resource mix and retail sales.  To the extent actual costs vary from
the fixed fuel factor, refunds or surcharges are required or
permitted.  The amounts collected under the fixed fuel factor through
the start of retail open access are subject to fuel reconciliation proceedings
before the PUCT.  The PUCT fuel cost reviews are discussed in Note 2
to the financial statements.

Franchises

Entergy Arkansas holds exclusive
franchises to provide electric service in approximately 307 incorporated cities
and towns in Arkansas.  These franchises are unlimited in duration and
continue unless the municipalities purchase the utility property.  In
Arkansas, franchises are considered to be contracts and, therefore, are
terminable upon breach of the terms of the franchise.

Entergy Gulf States Louisiana holds
non-exclusive franchises, permits, or certificates of convenience and necessity
to provide electric service in approximately 56 incorporated municipalities and
the unincorporated areas of approximately 18 parishes, and to provide gas
service in the City of Baton Rouge and the unincorporated areas of two
parishes.  Most of Entergy Gulf States Louisiana's franchises have a
term of 60 years.  Entergy Gulf States Louisiana's current electric
franchises expire during 2015-2046.

Entergy Louisiana holds non-exclusive
franchises to provide electric service in approximately 116 incorporated
Louisiana municipalities.  Most of these franchises have 25-year
terms.  Entergy Louisiana also supplies electric service in
approximately 353 unincorporated communities, all of which are located in the 45
Louisiana parishes in which it holds non-exclusive
franchises.  Entergy Louisiana's electric franchises expire during
2010-2036.

Entergy Mississippi has received from
the MPSC certificates of public convenience and necessity to provide electric
service to areas within 45 counties, including a number of municipalities, in
western Mississippi.  Under Mississippi statutory law, such
certificates are exclusive.  Entergy Mississippi may continue to serve
in such municipalities upon payment of a statutory franchise fee, regardless of
whether an original municipal franchise is still in existence.

Entergy New Orleans provides electric
and gas service in the City of New Orleans pursuant to city ordinances (except
electric service in Algiers, which is provided by Entergy
Louisiana).  These ordinances contain a continuing option for the City
of New Orleans to purchase Entergy New Orleans' electric and gas utility
properties.

Entergy Texas holds a certificate of
convenience and necessity from the PUCT to provide electric service to areas
within approximately 26 counties in eastern Texas, and holds non-exclusive
franchises to provide electric service in approximately 68 incorporated
municipalities.  Entergy Texas typically is granted 50-year
franchises.  Entergy Texas' electric franchises expire during
2010-2045.

The business of System Energy is
limited to wholesale power sales.  It has no distribution
franchises.

"Owned
      and Leased Capability" is the dependable load carrying capability as
      demonstrated under actual operating conditions based on the primary fuel
      (assuming no curtailments) that each station was designed to
      utilize.

The
Entergy System's load and capacity projections are reviewed periodically to
assess the need and timing for additional generating capacity and
interconnections.  These reviews consider existing and projected
demand, the availability and price of power, the location of new load, and the
economy.  Summer peak load in the Entergy System service territory has
averaged 21,036 MW from 2002-2009.  In the 2002 time period, the
Entergy System's long-term capacity resources, allowing for an adequate reserve
margin, were approximately 3,000 MW less than the total capacity required for
peak period demands.  In this time period Entergy met its capacity
shortages almost entirely through short-term power purchases in the wholesale
spot market.  In the fall of 2002, the Entergy System began a program
to add new resources to its existing generation portfolio and began a process of
issuing requests for proposals (RFP) to procure supply-side resources from
sources other than the spot market to meet the unique regional needs of the
Utility operating companies.  The Entergy System has adopted a
long-term resource strategy that calls for the bulk of capacity needs to be met
through long-term resources, whether owned or contracted.  The System
refers to this strategy as "The Portfolio Transformation
Strategy".  Over the past eight years, Portfolio Transformation has
resulted in the addition of about 4,000 MW of new long-term resources, including
approximately 900 MW of resources that are currently under regulatory
review.  Adjusting for unit deactivations of older generation,
currently, the System's portfolio of long-term resources is about 1,500 MW short
of its projected 2010 peak load plus reserve margin.  The remaining
need has been met with limited-term resource procurements.  The System
will continue to access the spot power market to economically purchase energy in
order to minimize customer cost.  In addition, Entergy considers in
its planning processes the implications of the notices from Entergy Arkansas and
Entergy Mississippi regarding their future withdrawal from the System
Agreement.  Furthermore, as with other transmission systems, there are
certain times during which congestion occurs on the Utility operating companies'
transmission system that limits the ability of the Utility operating companies
as well as other parties to fully utilize the generating resources that have
been granted transmission service.

RFP
Procurements

The RFPs issued by the Entergy System
since the fall of 2002 have sought resources needed to meet near-term summer
reliability requirements as well as longer-term resources through a broad range
of wholesale power products, including limited-term (1 to 3 years) and long-term
contractual products and asset acquisitions.  Detailed evaluation
processes have been developed to analyze submitted proposals, and, with the
exception of the January 2008 RFP and the 2008 Western Region RFP, each RFP has
been overseen by an independent monitor.  The following table
illustrates the results of the RFP process for resources acquired since the Fall
2002 RFP.  The contracts below were primarily with non-affiliated
suppliers,

In
      September 2009, on behalf of the Entergy operating companies, Entergy
      Services issued the Summer 2009 Long-Term RFP seeking proposals for
      long-term capacity and energy through products offered in the
      RFP.  The RFP includes a Utility self-build
      option.  The tentative RFP schedule targets resource selection
      in the third quarter 2010 and execution of definitive agreements by the
      fourth quarter 2010.

Entergy
Louisiana and Entergy New Orleans currently purchase 101 MW of capacity and
energy from Entergy Power, Inc. sourced from Independence Steam Electric Station
Unit 2.  The transaction, which originated from the Fall 2002 RFP,
included an option for Entergy Louisiana and Entergy New Orleans to acquire an
ownership interest in the unit for a total price of $80 million, subject to
various adjustments.  On March 5, 2008, Entergy Louisiana and Entergy
New Orleans provided notice of their intent to exercise the
option.  The parties are negotiating the terms and conditions of the
ownership acquisition.

In
January 2009, Entergy Texas issued an RFP seeking long-term CCGT resources for
the Western Region of the Entergy System in pursuit of multiple supply
procurement objectives.  As a result of the RFP, Entergy Services, as
agent for Entergy Texas, has signed a PPA with Exelon Generation Company, LLC to
purchase 150-300 megawatts of capacity and energy from the Tenaska Frontier
Generating Station located in Grimes County, Texas.  The PPA has an
approximately ten-year delivery term and may be terminated by Entergy Texas if
necessary regulatory approvals, including full cost recovery, are not
obtained.

In July
2009, Entergy Services issued the July 2009 Baseload RFP on behalf of Entergy
Texas, Entergy Louisiana and Entergy Mississippi seeking limited-term flexible
baseload resources.  A self-supply alternative was considered and
ultimately selected from the RFP, and consists of a 336 MW limited-term
cost-based wholesale baseload purchase from Entergy Arkansas.

Other
Procurements From Third Parties

The above
table does not include resource acquisitions made outside of the RFP process,
including Entergy Mississippi's January 2006 acquisition of the 480 MW,
combined-cycle, gas-fired Attala power plant, and Entergy Gulf States
Louisiana's March 2008 acquisition of the 322 MW, simple-cycle, gas-fired
Calcasieu Generating Facility.  In addition, in October 2009 Entergy
Louisiana, LLC entered into a Purchase and Sale Agreement to acquire Unit 2 of
the Acadia Energy Center, a 580 MW generating unit located near Eunice,
Louisiana from Acadia Power Partners, LLC, an independent power
producer.  The purchase is contingent on regulatory
approvals.  The above table also does not reflect various limited- and
long-term contracts that have been entered into in recent years by the Utility
operating companies as a result of bilateral negotiations.

Interconnections

The Entergy System's generating units
are interconnected by a transmission system operating at various voltages up to
500 kV.  These generating units consist primarily of steam-electric
production facilities and are centrally dispatched and
operated.  Entergy's Utility operating companies are interconnected
with many neighboring utilities.  In addition, the Utility operating
companies are members of the SERC Reliability Corporation.  The
primary purpose of SERC is to ensure the reliability and adequacy of the
electric bulk power supply in the southeast region of the United
States.  SERC is a member of the North American Electric Reliability
Corporation.

Gas
Property

As of December 31, 2009, Entergy New
Orleans distributed and transported natural gas for distribution within Algiers
and New Orleans, Louisiana, through a total of 33 miles of gas transmission
pipeline, 1,655 miles of gas distribution pipeline, and 855 miles of gas service
pipeline from the distribution mains to the customers.  As of December
31, 2009, the gas properties of Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, which are located
in and around Baton Rouge, Louisiana, were not material to Entergy Gulf States
Louisiana's financial position.

Titles

The Entergy System's generating
stations are generally located on properties owned in fee simple. Most of the
substations and transmission and distribution lines are constructed on private
property or public rights-of-way pursuant to easements, servitudes, or
appropriate franchises.  Some substation properties are owned in fee
simple.  The Utility operating companies generally have the right of
eminent domain, whereby they may perfect title to, or secure easements or
servitudes on, private property for their utility operations.

Substantially all of the physical
properties and assets owned by Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana,
Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, Entergy New Orleans, Entergy Texas, and
System Energy are subject to the liens of mortgages securing bonds issued by
those companies.  The Lewis Creek generating station is owned by
GSG&T, Inc., a subsidiary of Entergy Texas, and is not subject to its
mortgage lien.  Lewis Creek is leased to and operated by Entergy
Texas.

(a)

Hydroelectric
      power provided 1% of Entergy Arkansas' generation in 2009 and is expected
      to provide approximately 1% of its generation in 2010.

(b)

Capacity
      and energy from System Energy's interest in Grand Gulf was historically
      allocated as follows: Entergy Arkansas - 36%; Entergy Louisiana - 14%;
      Entergy Mississippi - 33%; and Entergy New Orleans -
      17%.  Pursuant to purchased power agreements, Entergy Arkansas
      is selling a portion of its owned capacity and energy from Grand Gulf to
      Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, and
      Entergy New Orleans.

Natural
Gas

The Utility operating companies have
long-term firm and short-term interruptible gas contracts for both supply and
gas transportation.  Long-term firm contracts for power plants
comprise less than 15% of the Utility operating companies' total
requirements.  Short-term contracts and spot-market purchases satisfy
additional gas requirements.  Entergy Texas owns a gas storage
facility that provides reliable and flexible natural gas service to certain
generating stations.

Entergy Louisiana has a long-term
natural gas supply contract, which expires in 2012, in which Entergy Louisiana
agreed to purchase natural gas in annual amounts equal to approximately
one-third of its projected annual fuel requirements for certain generating
units.  Annual demand charges associated with this contract are
estimated to be $6.6 million.

Many factors, including wellhead
deliverability, storage and pipeline capacity, and demand requirements of end
users, influence the availability and price of natural gas supplies for power
plants.  Demand is tied to weather conditions as well as to the prices
and availability of other energy sources.  Pursuant to federal and
state regulations, gas supplies to power plants may be interrupted during
periods of shortage.  To the extent natural gas supplies are disrupted
or natural gas prices significantly increase, the Utility operating companies
will use alternate fuels, such as oil, or rely to a larger extent on coal,
nuclear generation, and purchased power.

Coal

Entergy Arkansas has a long-term
contract for low-sulfur Powder River Basin (PRB) coal which expires in 2011 and
is expected to provide for approximately 40% of the total expected coal
requirements for 2010.  Over the past three years, Entergy Arkansas
has committed to seven medium-term (one- to three-year) contracts that will
supply approximately 55% of the total coal supply needs in
2010.  These contracts are staggered in term so that not all contracts
have to be renewed the same year.  The additional 5% of total coal
requirements will be satisfied by spot market or over-the-counter
purchases.  Based on greater PRB coal deliveries and the high cost of
foreign coal, no alternative coal consumption is expected at Entergy Arkansas
during 2010.  Entergy Arkansas has an existing long-term railroad
transportation contract that will provide all of Entergy Arkansas' coal
transportation requirements for 2010 and will provide most of the transportation
requirements for several years beyond 2010.

Entergy Gulf States Louisiana has
executed three medium-term contracts for the supply of low-sulfur PRB coal for
Nelson Unit 6 that will expire in late 2010 and 2011.  These three
contracts will supply approximately 95% of Nelson Unit 6 coal needs in
2010.  Additional PRB coal will be purchased through spot market or
over-the-counter purchases provided that adequate transportation is available
from BNSF Railway Company.  For the same reasons as for Entergy
Arkansas' plants, no alternative coal consumption is expected at Nelson Unit 6
during 2010.  Coal will be transported to Nelson via an existing rail
transportation agreement with BNSF Railway Company during 2010.

For the year 2009, coal transportation
delivery to all Utility operating company coal-fired units have met coal demand
at the plants.  It is expected that improved delivery times
experienced in 2009 will continue through 2010.  Both Entergy Arkansas
and Entergy Gulf States Louisiana control a sufficient number of railcars to
satisfy the rail transportation requirement.

The operator of Big Cajun 2 - Unit 3,
Louisiana Generating, LLC, has advised Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy
Texas that it has adequate rail car and barge capacity to meet the volumes of
low-sulfur PRB coal requested for 2010.  Entergy Gulf States Louisiana
and Entergy Texas coal nomination requests to Big Cajun 2 - Unit 3 are made on
an annual basis.

Nuclear
Fuel

The nuclear fuel cycle consists of the
following:

·

mining
      and milling of uranium ore to produce a
  concentrate;

·

conversion
      of the concentrate to uranium hexafluoride
gas;

·

enrichment
      of the uranium hexafluoride gas;

·

fabrication
      of nuclear fuel assemblies for use in fueling nuclear reactors;
      and

·

disposal
      of spent fuel.

System Fuels, a company owned by
Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, and Entergy New
Orleans, is responsible for contracts to acquire nuclear material to be used in
fueling Entergy's Utility nuclear units, except for River
Bend.  System Fuels also maintains inventories of such materials
during the various stages of processing.  The Utility operating
companies, except Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, purchase enriched uranium
hexafluoride from System Fuels, but contract separately for the fabrication of
their own nuclear fuel.  The requirements for River Bend are met
pursuant to contracts made by Entergy Gulf States Louisiana.  All
contracts for the disposal of spent nuclear fuel are between the Department of
Energy (DOE) and each of the nuclear power plants.

Based upon currently planned fuel
cycles, Entergy's Utility and Non-Utility Nuclear nuclear units have a
diversified portfolio of contracts and inventory that provides substantially
adequate nuclear fuel materials and conversion and enrichment services at what
Entergy believes are reasonably predictable or fixed prices through most of
2010, and with substantial additional amounts after that
time.  Entergy's ability to purchase nuclear fuel at reasonably
predictable prices, however, depends upon the creditworthiness and performance
reliability of uranium miners, as well as upon the structure of Entergy's
contracts for the purchase of nuclear fuel.  For example, some of the
supply under Entergy's contracts for nuclear fuel is effectively on a
"mine-contingent" basis, which means that if applicable mines are unable to
supply sufficient uranium, Entergy may be required to purchase some nuclear fuel
from another supplier.  There are a number of possible alternate
suppliers that may be accessed to mitigate such an event, including potentially
drawing upon Entergy's inventory intended for later generation periods depending
upon its risk management strategy at that time, although the pricing of any such
alternate uranium supply from the market will be dependent upon the market for
uranium supply at that time.  In addition, some nuclear fuel contracts
are on a non-fixed price basis subject to prevailing prices at the time of
delivery.

Uranium supply became extremely limited
in 2006 and 2007, but this supply shortfall was substantially eliminated in
2008.  Market prices for uranium concentrates increased from about $7
per pound in December 2000 to a range of $70 to $135 per pound in
2007.  In 2008, however, market prices for uranium concentrates ranged
from $45 to $90 per pound and from January 1, 2009 through December 31, 2009
ranged from $40 to $55 per pound.  The effects of market price changes
may be reduced and deferred by risk management strategies (such as buying for
inventory or entering into forward physical contracts at fixed prices when
Entergy believes it is appropriate and useful).  Entergy buys uranium
from a diversified mix of sellers located in a diversified mix of countries, and
from time to time purchases from nearly all qualified reliable major market
participants worldwide that sell into the U.S.

The recent higher nuclear fuel market
prices of 2006-2009 compared to the 2000-2005 period affects the U.S. nuclear
utility industry, including Entergy, first in cash flow requirements for fuel
acquisition, and then, some time later, in nuclear fuel expenses.  For
example, for a nuclear fleet the size of Entergy's, the current market value of
annual enriched uranium requirements has increased by several hundred million
dollars compared to about five years ago.  As nuclear fuel installed
in the core in nuclear power plants is replaced fractionally over an approximate
five-year period, nuclear fuel expense is beginning to, and will eventually with
a time lag, reflect current market prices and can be expected to increase from
the previously reported industry levels of about 0.5 cents per kWh to closer to
1.0 cent per kWh.  Entergy's nuclear fuel contract portfolio has
provided a degree of price hedging against the full extent of market prices
through 2010, but market trends will eventually affect the costs of all nuclear
plant operators.


Part I
Item 1

Entergy
Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy

Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Gulf States
Louisiana, Entergy Louisiana, and System Energy each have made arrangements to
lease nuclear fuel and related equipment and services.  The lessors
finance the acquisition and ownership of nuclear fuel through credit agreements
and the issuance of notes.  These arrangements are subject to periodic
renewal.  See Note 10 to the financial statements for a discussion of
nuclear fuel leases.

Natural Gas Purchased for
Resale

Entergy New Orleans has several
suppliers of natural gas.  Its system is interconnected with three
interstate and three intrastate pipelines.  Entergy New Orleans has a
"no-notice" service gas purchase contract with Atmos Energy which guarantees
Entergy New Orleans gas delivery at specific delivery points and at any volume
within the minimum and maximum set forth in the contract amounts.  The
Atmos Energy gas supply is transported to Entergy New Orleans pursuant to a
transportation service agreement with Gulf South Pipeline Co.  This service
is subject to FERC-approved rates.  Entergy New Orleans also makes
interruptible spot market purchases.  In recent years, natural gas
deliveries to Entergy New Orleans have been subject primarily to weather-related
curtailments.

As a result of the implementation of
FERC-mandated interstate pipeline restructuring in 1993, curtailments of
interstate gas supply could occur if Entergy New Orleans' suppliers failed to
perform their obligations to deliver gas under their supply agreements. 
Gulf South Pipeline Co. could curtail transportation capacity only in the event
of pipeline system constraints.

Entergy Gulf States Louisiana purchases
natural gas for resale under a firm contract from Enbridge Marketing (U.S.)
Inc.  In August 2008, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana entered into a new
five-year contract with Enbridge Marketing (U.S.) Inc.  The gas is
delivered through a combination of intrastate and interstate
pipelines.

Federal
Regulation of the Utility

State or local regulatory authorities,
as described above, regulate the retail rates of the Utility operating
companies.  FERC regulates wholesale rates (including intrasystem
sales pursuant to the System Agreement) and interstate transmission of
electricity, as well as rates for System Energy's sales of capacity and energy
from Grand Gulf to Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, and
Entergy New Orleans pursuant to the Unit Power Sales Agreement.

System Agreement

(Entergy Corporation, Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, Entergy
Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, Entergy New Orleans, and Entergy
Texas)

The Utility operating companies
historically have engaged in the coordinated planning, construction, and
operation of generating and bulk transmission facilities under the terms of the
System Agreement, which is a rate schedule that has been approved by the
FERC.  Under the terms of the System Agreement, generating capacity
and other power resources are jointly operated by the Utility operating
companies.  The System Agreement provides, among other things, that
parties having generating reserves greater than their allocated share of
reserves (long companies) shall receive payments from those parties having
generating reserves that are less than their allocated share of reserves (short
companies). Such payments are at amounts sufficient to cover certain of the long
companies' costs for intermediate and peaking oil/gas-fired generation,
including operating expenses, fixed charges on debt, dividend requirements on
preferred equity, and a fair rate of return on common equity
investment.  Under the System Agreement, these charges are based on
costs associated with the long companies' steam electric generating units fueled
by oil or gas and having an annual average heat rate above 10,000
Btu/kWh.  In addition, for all energy exchanged among the Utility
operating companies under the System Agreement, the companies purchasing
exchange energy are required to pay the cost of fuel consumed in generating such
energy plus a charge to cover other associated costs.

Citing its concerns that the benefits
of its continued participation in the current form of the System Agreement have
been seriously eroded, in December 2005, Entergy Arkansas submitted its notice
that it will terminate its participation in the current System Agreement
effective ninety-six (96) months from the date of the notice or such earlier
date as authorized by the FERC.  Entergy Arkansas indicated, however,
that a properly structured replacement agreement could be a viable
alternative.  In November 2007, pursuant to the provisions of the
System Agreement, Entergy Mississippi provided its written notice to terminate
its participation in the System Agreement effective ninety-six (96) months from
the


Part I
Item 1

Entergy
Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy

date of
the notice or such earlier date as authorized by the FERC.  In light
of the notices of Entergy Arkansas and Entergy Mississippi to terminate
participation in the current System Agreement, in January 2008 the LPSC
unanimously voted to direct the LPSC Staff to begin evaluating the potential for
a new agreement.  Likewise, the New Orleans City Council opened a
docket to gather information on progress towards a successor
agreement.

In November 2009 the FERC accepted the
notices of cancellation and determined that Entergy Arkansas and Entergy
Mississippi are permitted to withdraw from the System Agreement following the 96
month notice period without payment of a fee or being required to otherwise
compensate the remaining Utility operating companies as a result of
withdrawal.  The FERC stated it expected Entergy and all interested
parties to move forward and develop details of all needed successor arrangements
and encouraged Entergy to file its Section 205 filing for post 2013 arrangements
as soon as possible.  The LPSC and the City Council have requested
rehearing of the FERC's decision.

System Energy and Related
Agreements

System Energy recovers costs related to
its interest in Grand Gulf through rates charged to Entergy Arkansas, Entergy
Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, and Entergy New Orleans for capacity and energy
under the Unit Power Sales Agreement (described below).  In December
1995, System Energy commenced a rate proceeding at the FERC.  In July
2001, the rate proceeding became final, with the FERC approving a prospective
10.94% return on equity.  The FERC's decision also affected other
aspects of System Energy's charges to the Utility operating companies that it
supplies with power.  In 1998, the FERC approved requests by Entergy
Arkansas and Entergy Mississippi to accelerate a portion of their Grand Gulf
purchased power obligations.  Entergy Arkansas' and Entergy
Mississippi's acceleration of Grand Gulf purchased power obligations ceased
effective July 2001 and July 2003, respectively, as approved by
FERC.

Unit
Power Sales Agreement

The Unit Power Sales Agreement
allocates capacity, energy, and the related costs from System Energy's current
90% ownership and leasehold interests in Grand Gulf to Entergy Arkansas (36%),
Entergy Louisiana (14%), Entergy Mississippi (33%), and Entergy New Orleans
(17%). Each of these companies is obligated to make payments to System Energy
for its entitlement of capacity and energy on a full cost-of-service basis
regardless of the quantity of energy delivered, so long as Grand Gulf remains in
commercial operation.  Payments under the Unit Power Sales Agreement
are System Energy's only source of operating revenue.  The financial
condition of System Energy depends upon the continued commercial operation of
Grand Gulf and the receipt of such payments.  Entergy Arkansas,
Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, and Entergy New Orleans generally
recover payments made under the Unit Power Sales Agreement through rates charged
to their customers.

In the case of Entergy Arkansas and
Entergy Louisiana, payments are also recovered through sales of electricity from
their respective retained shares of Grand Gulf.  Under a settlement
agreement entered into with the APSC in 1985 and amended in 1988, Entergy
Arkansas retains 22% of its 36% share of Grand Gulf-related costs and recovers
the remaining 78% of its share in rates.  In the event that Entergy
Arkansas is not able to sell its retained share to third parties, it may sell
such energy to its retail customers at a price equal to its avoided cost, which
is currently less than Entergy Arkansas' cost from its retained
share.  Entergy Arkansas has life-of-resources purchased power
agreements with Entergy Louisiana and Entergy New Orleans that sell a portion of
the output of Entergy Arkansas' retained share of Grand Gulf to those
companies.  In a series of LPSC orders, court decisions,
and


Part I
Item 1

Entergy
Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy

agreements
from late 1985 to mid-1988, Entergy Louisiana was granted rate relief with
respect to costs associated with Entergy Louisiana's share of capacity and
energy from Grand Gulf, subject to certain terms and
conditions.  Entergy Louisiana retains and does not recover from
retail ratepayers 18% of its 14% share of the costs of Grand Gulf capacity and
energy and recovers the remaining 82% of its share in rates. Entergy Louisiana
is allowed to recover through the fuel adjustment clause 4.6 cents per kWh for
the energy related to its retained portion of these
costs.  Alternatively, Entergy Louisiana may sell such energy to
non-affiliated parties at prices above the fuel adjustment clause recovery
amount, subject to the LPSC's approval.

Availability
Agreement

The Availability Agreement among System
Energy and Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, and Entergy
New Orleans was entered into in 1974 in connection with the financing by System
Energy of Grand Gulf. The Availability Agreement provides that System Energy
make available to Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, and
Entergy New Orleans all capacity and energy available from System Energy's share
of Grand Gulf.

Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana,
Entergy Mississippi, and Entergy New Orleans also agreed severally to pay System
Energy monthly for the right to receive capacity and energy from Grand Gulf in
amounts that (when added to any amounts received by System Energy under the Unit
Power Sales Agreement) would at least equal System Energy's total operating
expenses for Grand Gulf (including depreciation at a specified rate) and
interest charges. The September 1989 write-off of System Energy's
investment in Grand Gulf 2, amounting to approximately $900 million, is being
amortized for Availability Agreement purposes over 27 years.

The allocation percentages under the
Availability Agreement are fixed as follows: Entergy Arkansas - 17.1%; Entergy
Louisiana - 26.9%; Entergy Mississippi - 31.3%; and Entergy New Orleans - 24.7%.
The allocation percentages under the Availability Agreement would remain in
effect and would govern payments made under such agreement in the event of a
shortfall of funds available to System Energy from other sources, including
payments under the Unit Power Sales Agreement.

System Energy has assigned its rights
to payments and advances from Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy
Mississippi, and Entergy New Orleans under the Availability Agreement as
security for its first mortgage bonds and reimbursement obligations to certain
banks providing letters of credit in connection with the equity funding of the
sale and leaseback transactions described in Note 10 to the financial statements
under "

Sale and
Leaseback Transactions

-
Grand Gulf Lease Obligations

."  In these assignments, Entergy
Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, and Entergy New Orleans
further agreed that, in the event they were prohibited by governmental action
from making payments under the Availability Agreement (for example, if FERC
reduced or disallowed such payments as constituting excessive rates), they would
then make subordinated advances to System Energy in the same amounts and at the
same times as the prohibited payments. System Energy would not be allowed to
repay these subordinated advances so long as it remained in default under the
related indebtedness or in other similar circumstances.

Each of the assignment agreements
relating to the Availability Agreement provides that Entergy Arkansas, Entergy
Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, and Entergy New Orleans will make payments
directly to System Energy. However, if there is an event of default, those
payments must be made directly to the holders of indebtedness that are the
beneficiaries of such assignment agreements. The payments must be made pro rata
according to the amount of the respective obligations secured.

The obligations of Entergy Arkansas,
Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, and Entergy New Orleans to make payments
under the Availability Agreement are subject to the receipt and continued
effectiveness of all necessary regulatory approvals.  Sales of
capacity and energy under the Availability Agreement would require that the
Availability Agreement be submitted to FERC for approval with respect to the
terms of such sale. No such filing with FERC has been made because sales of
capacity and energy from Grand Gulf are being made pursuant to the Unit Power
Sales Agreement.  If, for any reason, sales of capacity and energy are
made in the future pursuant to the Availability Agreement, the jurisdictional
portions of the Availability Agreement would be submitted to FERC for
approval.


Part I
Item 1

Entergy
Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy

Since commercial operation of Grand
Gulf began, payments under the Unit Power Sales Agreement to System Energy have
exceeded the amounts payable under the Availability Agreement. Therefore, no
payments under the Availability Agreement have ever been required.  If
Entergy Arkansas or Entergy Mississippi fails to make its Unit Power Sales
Agreement payments, and System Energy is unable to obtain funds from other
sources, Entergy Louisiana and Entergy New Orleans could become subject to
claims or demands by System Energy or its creditors for payments or advances
under the Availability Agreement (or the assignments thereof) equal to the
difference between their required Unit Power Sales Agreement payments and their
required Availability Agreement payments because their Availability Agreement
obligations exceed their Unit Power Sales Agreement obligations.

The Availability Agreement may be
terminated, amended, or modified by mutual agreement of the parties thereto,
without further consent of any assignees or other creditors.

Capital
Funds Agreement

System Energy and Entergy Corporation
have entered into the Capital Funds Agreement, whereby Entergy Corporation has
agreed to supply System Energy with sufficient capital to (i) maintain System
Energy's equity capital at an amount equal to a minimum of 35% of its total
capitalization (excluding short-term debt) and (ii) permit the continued
commercial operation of Grand Gulf and pay in full all indebtedness for borrowed
money of System Energy when due.

Entergy Corporation has entered into
various supplements to the Capital Funds Agreement. System Energy has assigned
its rights under such supplements as security for its first mortgage bonds and
for reimbursement obligations to certain banks providing letters of credit in
connection with the equity funding of the sale and leaseback transactions
described in Note 10 to the financial statements under "

Sale and
Leaseback Transactions

-
Grand Gulf Lease Obligations

."  Each such supplement provides
that permitted indebtedness for borrowed money incurred by System Energy in
connection with the financing of Grand Gulf may be secured by System Energy's
rights under the Capital Funds Agreement on a pro rata basis (except for the
Specific Payments, as defined below). In addition, in the supplements to the
Capital Funds Agreement relating to the specific indebtedness being secured,
Entergy Corporation has agreed to make cash capital contributions directly to
System Energy sufficient to enable System Energy to make payments when due on
such indebtedness (Specific Payments). However, if there is an event of default,
Entergy Corporation must make those payments directly to the holders of
indebtedness benefiting from the supplemental agreements. The payments (other
than the Specific Payments) must be made pro rata according to the amount of the

Jurisdictional
Separation of Entergy Gulf States, Inc. into Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and
Entergy Texas

Effective December 31, 2007, Entergy
Gulf States, Inc. completed a jurisdictional separation into two vertically
integrated utility companies, one operating under the sole retail jurisdiction
of the PUCT, Entergy Texas, and the other operating under the sole retail
jurisdiction of the LPSC, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana.  Management
believes that the jurisdictional separation will better align Entergy Gulf
States, Inc.'s Louisiana and Texas operations to serve customers in those states
and to operate consistent with state-specific regulatory requirements as the
utility regulatory environments in those jurisdictions evolve.  The
jurisdictional separation provides for regulation of each separated company by a
single retail regulator, which should reduce regulatory complexity.

Entergy Texas now owns all Entergy Gulf
States, Inc. distribution and transmission assets located in Texas, the
gas-fired generating plants located in Texas, undivided 42.5% ownership shares
of Entergy Gulf States, Inc.'s 70% ownership interest in Nelson 6 and 42%
ownership interest in Big Cajun 2, Unit 3, which are coal-fired generating
plants located in Louisiana, and other assets and contract rights to the extent
related to utility operations in Texas.  Entergy Gulf States Louisiana
now owns all of the remaining assets that were owned by Entergy Gulf States,
Inc.  On a book value basis, approximately 58.1% of the Entergy Gulf
States, Inc. assets were allocated to Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and
approximately 41.9% were allocated to Entergy Texas.

Entergy
Gulf States Louisiana remains primarily liable for all of the long-term debt
issued by Entergy Gulf States, Inc. that was outstanding on December 31,
2007.  Under a debt assumption agreement with Entergy Gulf States
Louisiana, Entergy Texas assumed its pro rata share of this long-term debt,
which was $1.079 billion, or approximately 46%, of which $168 million remains
outstanding at December 31, 2009.  The pro rata share of the long-term
debt assumed by Entergy Texas was determined by first determining the net assets
for each company on a book value basis, and then calculating a debt assumption
ratio that resulted in the common equity ratios for each company being
approximately the same as the Entergy Gulf States, Inc. common equity ratio
immediately prior to the jurisdictional separation.  Entergy Texas'
debt assumption does not discharge Entergy Gulf States Louisiana's liability for
the long-term debt.  To secure its debt assumption obligations,
Entergy Texas granted to Entergy Gulf States Louisiana a first lien on Entergy
Texas' assets that were previously subject to the Entergy Gulf States, Inc.
mortgage.  Entergy Texas has until December 31, 2010 to repay the
assumed debt.  In addition, Entergy Texas, as the owner of Entergy
Gulf States Reconstruction Funding I, LLC ("EGSRF I"), reports the $329.5
million of senior secured transition bonds ("securitization bonds") issued by
EGSRF I as long-term debt on its consolidated balance sheet.  The
securitization bonds are non-recourse to Entergy Texas.

Entergy
Texas will purchase from Entergy Gulf States Louisiana pursuant to a
life-of-unit purchased power agreement (PPA) a 42.5% share of capacity and
energy from the 70% of River Bend subject to retail
regulation.  Entergy Texas was allocated a share of River Bend's
nuclear and environmental liabilities that is identical to the share of the
plant's output purchased by Entergy Texas under the PPA.  Entergy Gulf
States Louisiana will purchase a 57.5% share of capacity and energy from the
gas-fired generating plants owned by Entergy Texas, and Entergy Texas will
purchase a 42.5% share of capacity and energy from the gas-fired generating
plants owned by Entergy Gulf States Louisiana.  The PPAs associated
with the gas-fired generating plants will terminate when retail open access
commences in Entergy Texas' jurisdiction or when the unit(s) is no longer
dispatched by the Entergy System.  If Entergy Texas implements retail
open access, it will terminate its participation in the System Agreement,
except for the portion of the System Agreement related to transmission
equalization.  The dispatch and operation of the generating plants
will not change as a result of the jurisdictional separation.

The
jurisdictional separation occurred through completion of the following
steps:

·

Through
      a Texas statutory merger-by-division, Entergy Gulf States, Inc. was
      renamed as Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, Inc., a Texas corporation, and
      the new Texas business corporation Entergy Texas, Inc. was
      formed.

·

Entergy
      Gulf States, Inc. allocated the assets described above to Entergy Texas,
      and all of the capital stock of Entergy Texas was issued directly to
      Entergy Gulf States, Inc.'s parent company, Entergy
      Corporation.

·

Entergy
      Corporation formed EGS Holdings, Inc., a Texas corporation, and
      contributed all of the common stock of Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, Inc.
      to EGS Holdings, Inc.


Part I
Item 1

Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy

·

EGS
      Holdings, Inc. formed the Louisiana limited liability company Entergy Gulf
      States Louisiana, L.L.C. and then owned all of the issued and outstanding
      membership interests of Entergy Gulf States Louisiana,
    L.L.C.

·

Entergy
      Gulf States Louisiana, Inc. then merged into Entergy Gulf States
      Louisiana, L.L.C., with Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, L.L.C. being the
      surviving entity.

·

Entergy
      Corporation now owns EGS Holdings, Inc. and Entergy Texas in their
      entirety, and EGS Holdings, Inc. now owns Entergy Gulf States Louisiana's
      common membership interests in their
entirety.

Entergy
Louisiana Corporate Restructuring

Effective
December 31, 2005, Entergy Louisiana, LLC, a limited liability company organized
under the laws of the State of Texas, as part of a restructuring involving a
Texas statutory merger-by-division succeeded to all of the regulated utility
operations of Entergy Louisiana, Inc.  Entergy Louisiana, LLC was
allocated substantially all of the property and other assets of Entergy
Louisiana, Inc., including all assets used to provide retail and wholesale
electric service to Entergy Louisiana, Inc.'s customers.  Entergy
Louisiana, LLC also assumed substantially all of the liabilities of Entergy
Louisiana, Inc., including all of its debt securities and leases but excluding
the outstanding preferred stock of Entergy Louisiana, Inc.

As the
operator of Entergy Louisiana, Inc.'s retail utility operations, Entergy
Louisiana, LLC is subject to the jurisdiction of the LPSC over electric service,
rates and charges to the same extent that the LPSC possessed jurisdiction over
Entergy Louisiana, Inc.'s retail utility operations.  The
restructuring implemented a recommendation from the LPSC staff, intended to
reduce corporate franchise taxes, and is expected to result in a decrease in
that component of Entergy Louisiana, LLC's rates to its Louisiana retail
customers.

On
December 31, 2005, and immediately prior to the formation of Entergy Louisiana,
LLC, Entergy Louisiana, Inc. changed its state of incorporation from Louisiana
to Texas and its name to Entergy Louisiana Holdings, Inc.  Upon the
effectiveness of the statutory merger-by-division on December 31, 2005, Entergy
Louisiana, LLC was organized and Entergy Louisiana Holdings held all of Entergy
Louisiana, LLC's common membership interests.  All of the common
membership interests of Entergy Louisiana, LLC continue to be held by Entergy
Louisiana Holdings and all of the common stock of Entergy Louisiana Holdings
continues to be held by Entergy Corporation.  As part of the
merger-by-division, Entergy Louisiana Holdings succeeded to Entergy Louisiana,
Inc.'s rights and obligations with respect to Entergy Louisiana, Inc.'s
outstanding preferred stock, which had an aggregate par value of approximately
$100 million.  In June 2006, Entergy Louisiana Holdings redeemed all
of its preferred stock and amended its charter to eliminate authority to issue
any future series of preferred stock.

Although
Entergy Louisiana, LLC has been consolidated for financial reporting purposes
since its inception, it did not join in the filing of Entergy's consolidated
federal income tax return through the tax year 2007.  Entergy Louisiana,
LLC filed separate federal income tax returns, paid federal income taxes on a
stand-alone basis, and was not a party to the Entergy System's intercompany tax
allocation agreement through 2007.  As such, Entergy Louisiana, LLC may
have made elections for tax purposes that may differ from those made by the
Entergy consolidated tax group, which may result in Entergy Louisiana, LLC
having more exposure to tax liability than it would have had, had it been
included in the Entergy consolidated tax return.  Beginning in 2008,
Entergy Louisiana, LLC joined the consolidated federal income tax return and
participated in the Entergy System's intercompany tax allocation
agreement.  Entergy Louisiana Holdings will continue as a party to the
Entergy System's intercompany tax allocation agreement.

After the
merger-by-division, Entergy Louisiana, LLC issued $100 million of its preferred
membership interests, which grant the holders thereof the power to vote
together, as a single class, with Entergy Corporation as the holder of the
common membership interests.  The preferred membership interests have
approximately 23% of the total voting power.  Because Entergy
Corporation, indirectly through Entergy Louisiana Holdings, owns all of the
common membership interests in Entergy Louisiana, LLC, Entergy Corporation will
be able to elect the entire board of directors of Entergy Louisiana, LLC, except
in certain circumstances if distributions on Entergy Louisiana, LLC's preferred
membership interests are in arrears.

Entergy
Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy

Non-Utility
Nuclear also owns two non-operating facilities, Big Rock Point in Michigan and
Indian Point 1 in New

York,
that were acquired when Non-Utility Nuclear purchased the Palisades and Indian
Point 2 nuclear plants, respectively.  These facilities are in various
stages of the decommissioning process.

The operating licenses for Vermont
Yankee, Pilgrim, Indian Point 2 and Indian Point 3 expire in 2012 to
2015.  License renewal applications are pending at the NRC for these
four plants, and are the subject of public and local political debate as well as
state permitting requirements.  Various parties have expressed
opposition to the pending license renewal applications

.

There is an
ongoing proceeding before the Atomic Safety and Licensing Board (ASLB) of the
NRC and contentions have been admitted for litigation regarding the Indian Point
License renewals.  The ASLB has completed its proceedings regarding
Vermont Yankee, but the New England Coalition filed a petition for NRC review of
the ASLB's decision on July 23, 2009.

Also, the ASLB has
completed its proceedings regarding Pilgrim, but Pilgrim Watch filed a petition
for NRC review of the ASLB's decision on November 12, 2008.  Both the
Vermont Yankee and Pilgrim license renewals are awaiting an NRC decision on the
petitions for review.  On September 8, 2008, the NRC granted Entergy's
request for a renewed operating license for the FitzPatrick nuclear plant, which
extends the operating license term for that plant by twenty years, to October
17, 2034.

In addition, for Vermont Yankee the
state certificates of public good to operate the plant and store spent nuclear
fuel also expire in 2012.  Non-Utility Nuclear filed an application
with the Vermont Public Service Board on March 3, 2008 for approval of continued
operations and storage of spent nuclear fuel generated after March 21,
2012.  Under Vermont law the Vermont General Assembly approval of
Non-Utility Nuclear's request is required for the request to be
granted.  During its 2009 session, which concluded in May, several
committees of the Vermont General Assembly held hearings on Vermont Yankee, but
no bill or resolution was introduced for approval of continued operation and
storage of spent nuclear fuel generated after March 21, 2012.  Entergy
had anticipated that the Vermont General Assembly might consider authorizing
continued operation of Vermont Yankee and spent fuel storage during its 2010
session, which began in January.  Governor Jim Douglas, however,
issued a statement on January 27, 2010 indicating he would not ask the Vermont
General Assembly to consider Vermont Yankee license renewal during its 2010
session pending an ongoing investigation relating to elevated levels of tritium
found in Vermont Yankee groundwater monitoring wells.  The
Governor's statement also expressed concerns about potential decommissioning
costs and about inconsistent information related to underground piping at
Vermont Yankee carrying radionuclides that was provided by Entergy Nuclear
Vermont Yankee and Entergy Nuclear Operations, Inc. in a proceeding before the
Vermont Public Service Board related to extending operation of Vermont Yankee
beyond its current operating license.  Notwithstanding the Governor’s
position, on February 24, 2010, a bill to approve the continued operation of
Vermont Yankee was advanced to a vote by the Vermont Senate leadership and
defeated by a margin of 26 to 4.  This vote does not preclude the
Vermont Senate from voting again on a similar bill in the
future.  Vermont is the only state of which Entergy is aware the state
legislature has asserted that it has the authority to approve the continued
operation of a Non-Utility Nuclear plant for a renewed license
term.

In April 2007, Non-Utility Nuclear
submitted an application to the NRC to renew the operating licenses for Indian
Point 2 and 3 for an additional 20 years.  The NRC Staff currently is
performing its technical and environmental reviews of the
application.  It issued a draft supplemental environmental impact
statement in December 2008, a safety evaluation with open items in January 2009,
and a final safety evaluation report in August 2009.  The New York
Department of Environmental Conservation has taken the position that Indian
Point must obtain a new state-issued Clean Water Act Section 401 water quality
certification as part of the license renewal process.  Indian Point
also must obtain a Coastal Zone Management Act consistency determination from
the New York Department of State prior to getting its renewed
license.  For a discussion concerning the status of Non-Utility
Nuclear’s efforts to obtain these certifications and determinations, see
"Environmental Regulation, Clean Water Act" below.

The NRC is required by statute to
provide an opportunity to members of the public to request a hearing on the
Indian Point 2 and 3 license renewal application.  In early December
2007, the NRC received thirteen petitions to intervene in the license renewal
proceeding for Indian Point 2 and 3.  The petitions were filed by
various state and local government entities, including the States of New York
and Connecticut, as well as several public interest groups.  The ASLB
summarily rejected four of the thirteen petitions to


Part I
Item 1

Entergy
Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy

intervene
in December 2007.  The nine remaining petitions contained over 160
proposed contentions, which are issues of law or fact pertaining to the license
renewal application that the petitioners seek to have adjudicated by the
NRC.

In January 2008, in accordance with the
NRC's hearing rules, Non-Utility Nuclear filed nine detailed answers to the
petitions, opposing all of the petitioners' proposed contentions.  The
NRC Staff, which functions as an independent party in any hearing, also filed
detailed responses to the petitions.  The NRC Staff opposed admission
of all but a few of the petitioners' proposed contentions.  On July
31, 2008, the ASLB granted, in part, the petitions to intervene of the State of
New York, Riverkeeper, Inc., and Hudson River Sloop Clearwater, Inc., admitting
a total of 17 technical and environmental contentions for
adjudication.  Due to similarities among certain contentions, the
Board consolidated the 17 admitted contentions into 13 discrete
issues.  The ASLB subsequently permitted the Town of Cortlandt,
Village of Buchanan, City of New York, State of Connecticut, and Westchester
County to participate in the proceeding as "interested" governmental entities,
as allowed by the NRC regulations.  The ASLB issued its initial case
management and scheduling order during the first quarter 2009, although the
parties began the discovery process pursuant to an ASLB order issued in December
2008 and an agreement reached by the parties in January 2009 regarding
disclosure issues.  Any evidentiary hearings on the admitted
contentions are expected to occur in 2010.

The hearing process is an integral
component of the NRC's regulatory framework, and evidentiary hearings on license
renewal applications are not uncommon.  Non-Utility Nuclear intends to
participate fully in the hearing process as permitted by the NRC's hearing
rules.  As noted in Non-Utility Nuclear's responses to the various
petitions to intervene, Non-Utility Nuclear believes that many of the issues
raised by the petitioners are unsupported and without
merit.  Furthermore, Non-Utility Nuclear believes that it will carry
its burden of proof with respect to any issues that were admitted for
evidentiary hearings.  Non-Utility Nuclear will continue to work with
the NRC Staff as it completes its technical and environmental reviews of the
license renewal application, and based on current scheduling expects to obtain
20-year license renewals for Indian Point 2 and Indian Point 3 in
2011.

Interconnections

The Pilgrim and Vermont Yankee plants
fall under the authority of the Independent System Operator (ISO) New England
and the FitzPatrick and Indian Point plants fall under the authority of the New
York Independent System Operator (NYISO).  The Palisades plant falls
under the authority of the Midwest Independent System Operator
(MidwestISO).  The primary purpose of ISO New England, NYISO and
MidwestISO is to direct the operations of the major generation and transmission
facilities in their respective regions and in doing so also takes responsibility
for ensuring grid reliability, administering and monitoring wholesale
electricity markets and planning for their respective region’s energy
needs.

Energy
and Capacity Sales

As a wholesale generator, Entergy's
Non-Utility Nuclear business's core business is selling energy, measured in MWh,
to its customers.  Non-Utility Nuclear enters into forward contracts
with its customers and sells energy in the day ahead or spot
markets.  In addition to selling the energy produced by its plants,
Non-Utility Nuclear sells unforced capacity to load-serving entities, which
allows those companies to meet specified reserve and related requirements placed
on them by the ISOs in their respective areas. Non-Utility Nuclear's forward
fixed price power contracts consist of contracts to sell energy only, contracts
to sell capacity only, and bundled contracts in which it sells both capacity and
energy.  While the terminology and payment mechanics vary in these
contracts, each of these types of contracts requires Non-Utility Nuclear to
deliver MWh of energy to its counterparties, make capacity available to them, or
both.  See "

Commodity Price Risk

- - Power Generation" in Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Management's
Discussion and Analysis for additional information regarding these
contracts.

In
addition to the contracts discussed in "

Commodity Price Risk

- - Power Generation," Non-Utility Nuclear's purchase of the Vermont Yankee plant
included a value sharing agreement providing for payments to the seller in the
event that the plant's operating license term is renewed beyond its original
expiration in 2012.  Under the value sharing agreement, to the extent
that the average annual price of the energy sales from the plant exceeds the
specified strike price, initially $61/MWh and then adjusted annually based on
three indices, the Non-Utility Nuclear business will pay 50% of the amount
exceeding the strike prices to the seller.  These payments, if
required, will be recorded as adjustments to the purchase price of the
plants.  The value sharing would begin in 2012 and extend into
2022.


Part I
Item 1

Entergy
Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy

As part
of the purchase of the Palisades plant, Entergy's Non-Utility Nuclear business
executed a 15-year PPA with the seller, Consumers Energy, for 100% of the
plant's output, excluding any future uprates.  Under the purchased
power agreement, Consumers Energy will receive the value of any new
environmental credits for the first ten years of the
agreement.  Entergy and Consumers Energy will share on a 50/50 basis
the value of any new environmental credits for years 11 through 15 of the
agreement.  The environmental credits are defined as benefits from a
change in law that causes capability of the plant as of the purchase date to
become a tradable attribute (e.g., emission credit, renewable energy credit,
environmental credit, "green" credit, etc.) or otherwise to have a market
value.

Customers

Non-Utility Nuclear's customers for the
sale of both energy and capacity include retail power providers, utilities,
electric power co-operatives, power trading organizations and other power
generation companies.  These customers include Consolidated Edison,
NYPA, and Consumers Energy, companies from which Non-Utility Nuclear purchased
plants, and ISO New England and NYISO.  As of December 31, 2009, for
the planned energy output under contract for Non-Utility Nuclear through 2014,
99.7% of the planned energy output is under contract with counterparties with
public investment grade credit ratings and 0.3% is with load-serving entities
without public credit ratings.

Competition

The ISO
New England and NYISO markets are highly competitive.  Non-Utility
Nuclear has approximately 85 competitors in New England and 70 competitors in
New York, including generation companies affiliated with regulated utilities,
other independent power producers, municipal and co-operative generators, owners
of co-generation plants and wholesale power marketers.  Non-Utility
Nuclear is an independent power producer, which means it generates power for
sale to third parties at market prices to the extent that the power is not sold
under a fixed price contract.  Municipal and co-operative generators
also generate power but use most of it to deliver power to their municipal or
co-operative power customers. Owners of co-generation plants produce power
primarily for their own consumption. Wholesale power marketers do not own
generation; rather they buy power from generators or other market participants
and resell it to retail providers or other market
participants.  Competition in the New England and New York power
markets is affected by, among other factors, the amount of generation and
transmission capacity in these markets.  Based on the latest available
information, Non-Utility Nuclear's plants provided approximately 7% of the
aggregate net generation capacity serving the New England power market and 16%
of the aggregate net generation capacity serving the New York power
market.  The MidwestISO market includes approximately 280
participants.  The MidwestISO does not have a formal, centralized
forward capacity market, but load serving entities do transact capacity through
bilateral contracts.  Palisades' current output is fully contracted to
Consumers Energy through 2022 and, therefore, Non-Utility Nuclear does not
expect to be materially affected by competition in the MidwestISO market in the
near term.

Seasonality

Non-Utility
Nuclear's revenues and operating income are subject to mild fluctuations during
the year due to seasonal factors and weather conditions.  When outdoor
and cooling water temperatures are lower, generally during colder months,
Non-Utility Nuclear's nuclear power plants operate more efficiently, and
consequently, it generates more electricity and records higher revenues and
operating income.  Although some of its annual contracts provide for
monthly pricing, Non-Utility Nuclear derives the majority of its revenues from
fixed price forward power sales that are generally sold at a single price for a
calendar year, which can offset the effects of seasonality and weather
conditions on monthly power prices.

Other
Business Activities

Entergy
Nuclear Power Marketing, LLC (ENPM) was formed in 2005 to centralize the power
marketing function for Non-Utility Nuclear.  Upon its formation, ENPM
entered into long-term power purchase agreements with the Non-Utility Nuclear
subsidiaries that own that business's power plants (generating
subsidiaries).  As part of a series of agreements, ENPM agreed to
assume and/or otherwise service the existing power purchase agreements that were
in effect between the generating subsidiaries and their
customers.  ENPM functions include origination of new energy and
capacity transactions, generation scheduling, contract management (including
billing and settlements), and market and credit risk mitigation.

Entergy
Nuclear, Inc. pursues service agreements with other nuclear power plant owners
who seek the advantages of Entergy's scale and expertise but do not necessarily
want to sell their assets. Services provided by either Entergy Nuclear, Inc. or
other Non-Utility Nuclear subsidiaries include engineering, operations and
maintenance, fuel procurement, management and supervision, technical support and
training, administrative support, and other managerial or technical services
required to operate, maintain, and decommission nuclear electric power
facilities.  Entergy Nuclear, Inc. provided decommissioning services
for the Maine Yankee nuclear power plant and continues to pursue opportunities
for Non-Utility Nuclear with other nuclear plant owners through operating
agreements or innovative arrangements such as structured leases.

In
September 2003, Entergy's Non-Utility Nuclear business agreed to provide plant
operation support services for the 800 MW Cooper Nuclear Station located near
Brownville, Nebraska.  The contract is for 10 years, the remaining
term of the plant's current operating license.  Entergy will receive
$14 million in each of the remaining years of the contract.  Entergy
can also receive up to $6 million more per year if safety and regulatory goals
are met.  In addition, Entergy will be reimbursed for all
employee-related expenses.  In 2006, Entergy Nuclear, Inc. signed an
agreement to provide license renewal services for the Cooper Nuclear
Station.

Nuclear, Inc. has now signed an agreement with Nebraska Public Power District to
extend management support services to Cooper Nuclear Station until January
2029.  The plant’s original operating license, currently due to expire
in 2014, is currently under review by the NRC for a 20-year license
renewal.

Entergy Nuclear, Inc. offers operating
license renewal and life extension services to nuclear power plants
owners.  Entergy Nuclear Inc., through its subsidiary, TLG Services,
offers decommissioning, engineering, and related services to nuclear power plant
owners.  In April 2009, Non-Utility Nuclear announced that it will
team with energy firm ENERCON to offer nuclear development services ranging from
plant relicensing to full-service, new plant deployment.  ENERCON has
experience in engineering, environmental, technical and management
services.

Non-Nuclear Wholesale Assets
Business

The non-nuclear wholesale assets
business sells to wholesale customers the electric power produced by power
plants that it owns while it focuses on improving performance and exploring
sales or restructuring opportunities for its power plants.  Such
opportunities are evaluated consistent with Entergy's market-based
point-of-view.

Entergy-Koch

Entergy-Koch
is a joint venture owned 50% each by Entergy and Koch Industries, Inc, through
subsidiaries.  Entergy-Koch began operations on February 1,
2001.  Entergy contributed most of the assets and trading contracts of
its power marketing and trading business and $414 million cash to the venture
and Koch contributed its approximately 8,000-mile Koch Gateway Pipeline (renamed
Gulf South Pipeline), gas storage facilities, and Koch Energy Trading, which
marketed and traded electricity, gas, weather derivatives, and other
energy-related commodities and services.  As specified in the
partnership agreement, Entergy contributed an additional $72.7 million to the
partnership in January 2004.

In the fourth quarter of 2004,
Entergy-Koch sold its energy trading and pipeline businesses to third
parties.  The sales came after a review of strategic alternatives for
enhancing the value of Entergy-Koch, LP.  Entergy received
$862 million of cash distributions in 2004 from Entergy-Koch after the
business sales.  Due to the November 2006 expiration of contingencies
on the sale of Entergy-Koch's trading business, and the corresponding release to
Entergy-Koch of sales proceeds held in escrow, Entergy received additional cash
distributions of approximately $163 million during the fourth quarter of 2006
and recorded a gain of approximately $55 million (net-of-tax).  In
December 2009, Entergy reorganized its investment in Entergy-Koch, received a
$25.6 million cash distribution, and received a distribution of certain software
owned by the joint venture.  Entergy-Koch is no longer an operating
entity.

Regulation of Entergy's
Business

Energy
Policy Act of 2005

The
Energy Policy Act of 2005 became law in August 2005.  The legislation
contains electricity provisions that, among other things:

·

Repealed
      PUHCA 1935, through enactment of PUHCA 2005, effective February 8, 2006;
      PUHCA 2005 and/or related amendments to Section 203(a) of the Federal
      Power Act (a) remove various limitations on Entergy Corporation as a
      registered holding company under PUHCA 1935; (b) require the maintenance
      and retention of books and records by certain holding company system
      companies for inspection by the FERC and state commissions, as
      appropriate; and (c) effectively leave to the jurisdiction of the FERC (or
      state or local regulatory bodies, as appropriate) (i) the issuance by an
      electric utility of securities; (ii) (A) the disposition of jurisdictional
      FERC electric facilities by an electric utility; (B) the acquisition by an
      electric utility of securities of an electric utility; (C) the acquisition
      by an electric utility of electric generating facilities (in each of the
      cases in (A), (B) and (C) only in transactions in excess of $10 million);
      (iv) electric public utility mergers; and (v) the acquisition by an
      electric public utility holding company of securities of an electric
      public utility company or its holding company in excess of $10 million or
      the merger of electric public utility holding company
      systems.  PUHCA 2005 and the related FERC rule-making also
      provide a savings provision which permits continued reliance on certain
      PUHCA 1935 rules and orders after the repeal of PUHCA
  1935.

·

Codifies
      the concept of participant funding or cost causation, a form of cost
      allocation for transmission interconnections and upgrades, and allows the
      FERC to apply participant funding in all regions of the
      country.  Participant funding helps ensure that a utility's
      native load customers only bear the costs that are necessary to provide
      reliable transmission service to them and not bear costs imposed by
      generators (the participants) who seek to deliver power to other
      regions.

·

Provides
      financing benefits, including loan guarantees and production tax credits,
      for new nuclear plant construction, and reauthorizes the Price-Anderson
      Act, the law that provides an umbrella of insurance protection for the
      payment of public liability claims in the event of a major nuclear power
      plant incident.

·

Revises
      current tax law treatment of nuclear decommissioning trust funds by
      allowing regulated and non-regulated taxpayers to make deductible
      contributions to fund the entire amount of estimated future
      decommissioning costs.

·

Provides
      a more rapid tax depreciation schedule for transmission assets to
      encourage investment.

·

Creates
      mandatory electricity reliability guidelines with enforceable penalties to
      help ensure that the

nation's power
      transmission grid is kept in good repair and that disruptions in the
      electricity system are

minimized.

Entergy already voluntarily complies with National
      Electricity Reliability Council standards, which are similar to the
      guidelines mandated by the Energy Policy Act of
  2005.

·

Establishes
      conditions for the elimination of the Public Utility Regulatory Policy
      Act's (PURPA) mandatory purchase obligation from qualifying
      facilities.

·

Significantly
      increased the FERC's authorization to impose criminal and civil penalties
      for violations of the provisions of the Federal Power
  Act.

Federal

The Federal Power Act
regulates:

·

the

Regulation
of the Nuclear Power Industry

Atomic Energy Act of 1954
and Energy Reorganization Act of 1974

Under the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 and
the Energy Reorganization Act of 1974, the operation of nuclear plants is
heavily regulated by the NRC, which has broad power to impose licensing and
safety-related requirements.  The NRC has broad authority to impose
fines or shut down a unit, or both, depending upon its assessment of the
severity of the situation, until compliance is achieved.  Entergy
Arkansas, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, Entergy Louisiana, and System Energy,
as owners of all or portions of ANO, River Bend, Waterford 3, and Grand Gulf,
respectively, and Entergy Operations, as the licensee and operator of these
units, are subject to the jurisdiction of the NRC.  Entergy's
Non-Utility Nuclear business is subject to the NRC's jurisdiction as the owner
and operator of Pilgrim, Indian Point Energy Center, FitzPatrick, Vermont
Yankee, and Palisades.  Substantial capital expenditures at Entergy's
nuclear plants because of revised safety requirements of the NRC could be
required in the future.

Nuclear Waste Policy Act of

Spent
Nuclear Fuel

Under the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of
1982, the DOE is required, for a specified fee, to construct storage facilities
for, and to dispose of, all spent nuclear fuel and other high-level radioactive
waste generated by domestic nuclear power reactors.  Entergy's nuclear
owner/licensee subsidiaries provide for the estimated future disposal costs of
spent nuclear fuel in accordance with the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of
1982.  The affected Entergy companies entered into contracts with the
DOE, whereby the DOE is to furnish disposal services at a cost of one mill per
net kWh generated and sold after April 7, 1983, plus a one-time fee for
generation prior to that date.  Entergy Arkansas is the only one of
the Utility operating companies that generated electric power with nuclear fuel
prior to that date and has a recorded liability as of December 31, 2009 of
$180.7 million for the one-time fee.  Entergy's Non-Utility Nuclear
business has accepted assignment of the Pilgrim, FitzPatrick, Indian
Point 3, Indian Point 1 and 2, Vermont Yankee, and Palisades/Big Rock Point
spent fuel disposal contracts with the DOE held by their previous
owners.  The previous owners have paid or retained liability for the
fees for all generation prior to the purchase dates of those
plants.  The fees payable to the DOE may be adjusted in the future to
assure full recovery.  Entergy considers all costs incurred for the
disposal of spent nuclear fuel, except accrued interest, to be proper components
of nuclear fuel expense.  Provisions to recover such costs have been
or will be made in applications to regulatory authorities for the Utility
plants.  Entergy's total spent fuel fees to date, including the
one-time fee liability of Entergy Arkansas, have surpassed $1
billion.

The permanent spent fuel repository in
the U.S. has been legislated to be Yucca Mountain, Nevada.  The DOE is
required by law to proceed with the licensing (the DOE filed the license
application in June 2008) and, after the license is granted by the NRC, proceed
with the repository construction and commencement of receipt of spent
fuel.  Because the DOE has not begun accepting spent fuel, it is in
non-compliance with the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 and has breached its
spent fuel disposal contracts.  The DOE continues to delay meeting its
obligation.  Moreover, the Obama administration has expressed its
intention to discontinue the Yucca Mountain project and plans to study a new
spent fuel strategy.  Therefore, uncertainty remains regarding the
time frame under which the DOE will begin to accept spent fuel from Entergy's
facilities for storage or disposal.  As a result, continuing future
expenditures will be required to increase spent fuel storage capacity at
Entergy's nuclear sites.


Part I
Item 1

Entergy
Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy

As a result of the DOE's failure to
begin disposal of spent nuclear fuel in 1998 pursuant to the Nuclear Waste
Policy Act of 1982 and the spent fuel disposal contracts, Entergy's nuclear
owner/licensee subsidiaries have incurred and will continue to incur
damages.  In November 2003 these subsidiaries, except for the owner of
Palisades, began litigation to recover the damages caused by the DOE's delay in
performance.  In two separate decisions in October 2007, the U.S. Court of
Federal Claims awarded $10.0 million jointly to System Fuels, System Energy, and
SMEPA, and awarded $48.7 million jointly to System Fuels and Entergy
Arkansas, in damages related to the DOE's breach of its
obligations.  Both decisions are subject to appeal by the DOE, and the
DOE has filed an appeal of the Entergy Arkansas decision with the U.S. Court of
Appeals for the Federal Circuit.  The System Energy case awaits a
final decision in the trial court, but a DOE appeal is likely upon issuance of
the final decision.  Management cannot predict the timing or amount of
any potential recoveries on other claims filed by Entergy subsidiaries, and
cannot predict the timing of any eventual receipt from the DOE of the U.S. Court
of Federal Claims damage awards.

Pending DOE acceptance and disposal of
spent nuclear fuel, the owners of nuclear plants are providing their own spent
fuel storage.  Storage capability additions using dry casks began
operations at Palisades in 1993, at ANO in 1996, at FitzPatrick in 2002, at
River Bend in 2005, at Grand Gulf in 2006, and at Indian Point and Vermont
Yankee in 2008.  These facilities will be expanded as
needed.  Current on-site spent fuel storage capacity at Waterford 3
and Pilgrim is estimated to be sufficient until approximately 2012 and 2014,
respectively; by which time dry cask storage facilities are planned to be placed
into service at these units.

Nuclear
Plant Decommissioning

Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Gulf States
Louisiana and Entergy Texas, Entergy Louisiana, and System Energy are entitled
to recover from customers through electric rates the estimated decommissioning
costs for ANO, the portion of River Bend subject to retail rate regulation,
Waterford 3, and Grand Gulf, respectively.  These amounts are
deposited in trust funds that can only be used for future decommissioning
costs.  Entergy periodically reviews and updates the estimated
decommissioning costs to reflect inflation and changes in regulatory
requirements and technology, and then makes applications to the regulatory
authorities to reflect, in rates, the changes in projected decommissioning
costs.

In June 2001, Entergy Arkansas received
notification from the NRC of approval for a renewed operating license
authorizing operations at ANO 1 through May 2034.  In July 2005,
Entergy Arkansas received notification from the NRC of approval for a renewed
operating license authorizing operations at ANO 2 through July
2038.  Entergy Arkansas' projections showed that with the assumption
of 20 years of extended operational life for both units, the decommissioning
fund balances with earnings over the extended life would be sufficient to
decommission both units.  Pursuant to APSC approval, which was granted
based on assumption of renewed licenses for ANO 1 and 2, beginning in 2001
Entergy Arkansas stopped collecting funds to decommission ANO 1 and
2.  The APSC requires Entergy Arkansas to update every five years the
estimated costs to decommission ANO.  In March 2009, Entergy Arkansas
filed with the APSC its fourth five-year estimate of ANO decommissioning
costs.  The updated estimate indicated the cost to decommission the
two ANO units would be $1,265 million.

In December 2002, the LPSC approved a
settlement between Entergy Gulf States, Inc. and the LPSC staff.  The
settlement included, among other things, the requirement to cease collection of
funds to decommission River Bend based on an assumed license renewal for River
Bend.

As part of the Pilgrim, Indian Point 1
and 2, Vermont Yankee, and Palisades/Big Rock Point purchases, the former owners
transferred decommissioning trust funds, along with the liability to
decommission the plants, to Entergy.  As part of the Indian Point 1
and 2 purchase, Entergy also funded an additional $25 million to the
decommissioning trust fund.  As part of the Palisades transaction,
Non-Utility Nuclear assumed responsibility for spent fuel at the decommissioned
Big Rock Point nuclear plant, which is located near Charlevoix,
Michigan.  Once the spent fuel is removed from the site, Non-Utility
Nuclear will dismantle the spent fuel storage facility and complete site
decommissioning.  Non-Utility Nuclear expects to fund this activity
from operating revenue, and Non-Utility Nuclear is providing $5 million in
credit support to provide financial assurance for this obligation to the
NRC.


Part I
Item 1

Entergy
Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy

On June 18, 2009, the NRC issued
letters indicating that the NRC staff had concluded that there were shortfalls
in the amount of decommissioning funding assurance provided for Indian Point 2,
Vermont Yankee, Palisades, Waterford 3, and River Bend.  The NRC staff
conducted a telephone conference with Entergy on this issue on June 29, 2009,
and Entergy agreed to submit a plan by August 13, 2009, for addressing the
identified shortfalls.  In its August 13, 2009 submittal, Entergy
provided updated analyses to the NRC that indicated that there was no current
shortfall in the amounts of the required decommissioning funding assurance for
Palisades and Indian Point 2, based upon the balances as of July 31, 2009 and an
analysis of the costs that would be incurred if Entergy elected to use a
sixty-year period of safe storage for decommissioning, as permitted by the NRC's
rules.  The NRC accepted the analyses regarding Palisades and Indian
Point 2 by letters dated December 12, 2009 and December 28, 2009, and with
respect to each plant, the NRC concluded that no further action was
required.  For Vermont Yankee, Entergy concluded that, based upon the
balances as of July 31, 2009 and an analysis of the costs that would be incurred
if Entergy elected to use a sixty-year period of safe storage for
decommissioning, there was a shortfall of approximately $58 million, which could
be satisfied with additional financial assurance in a current dollar value of
approximately $51 million.  Entergy also indicated that it planned to
address this shortfall by December 31, 2009 by providing a financial assurance
mechanism that is consistent with the regulatory requirements and acceptable to
the NRC.  A subsequent submittal to the NRC indicated that increases
in the decommissioning fund, as of September 30, 2009, have lowered the
shortfall to approximately $40 million, or approximately $35 million on a
current dollar basis.  This submittal proposed using a corporate
guarantee as financial assurance, and a corporate guarantee in the amount of $40
million was executed by December 31, 2009 for this purpose.  For
Waterford 3 and River Bend, Entergy made the appropriate filings by December 31,
2009 with its retail regulators that request increases in rates to address the
shortfalls identified by the NRC.

For the Indian Point 3 and FitzPatrick
plants purchased in 2000, NYPA retained the decommissioning trusts and the
decommissioning liability.  NYPA and Entergy executed decommissioning
agreements, which specify their decommissioning obligations.  NYPA has
the right to require Entergy to assume the decommissioning liability provided
that it assigns the corresponding decommissioning trust, up to a specified
level, to Entergy.  If the decommissioning liability is retained by
NYPA, Entergy will perform the decommissioning of the plants at a price equal to
the lesser of a pre-specified level or the amount in the decommissioning
trusts.

Additional information with respect to
decommissioning costs is found in Note 9 to the financial
statements.

Price-Anderson
Act

The
Price-Anderson Act requires that reactor licensees purchase insurance and
participate in a secondary insurance pool that provides insurance coverage for
the public in the event of a nuclear power plant accident.  The costs
of this insurance are borne by the nuclear power industry.  Congress
amended and renewed the Price-Anderson Act in 2005 for a term through
2025.  The Price-Anderson Act limits contingent liability for a single
nuclear incident to approximately $117.5 million per reactor (with 104 nuclear
industry reactors currently participating).  Entergy Arkansas, Entergy
Gulf States Louisiana, Entergy Louisiana, System Energy, and Entergy's
Non-Utility Nuclear business have protection with respect to this liability
through a combination of private insurance and an industry assessment program,
as well as insurance for property damage, costs of replacement power, and other
risks relating to nuclear generating units.  The Price-Anderson Act
and insurance applicable to the nuclear programs of Entergy are discussed in
more detail in Note 8 to the financial statements.

Environmental
Regulation

Entergy's facilities and operations are
subject to regulation by various governmental authorities having jurisdiction
over air quality, water quality, control of toxic substances and hazardous and
solid wastes, and other environmental matters.  Management believes
that Entergy's businesses are in substantial compliance with environmental
regulations currently applicable to its facilities and
operations.  Because environmental regulations are subject to change,
future compliance requirements and costs cannot be precisely
estimated.  Except to the extent discussed below, at this time
compliance with federal, state, and local provisions regulating the discharge of
materials into the environment, or otherwise protecting the environment, is
incorporated into the routine cost structure of Entergy's businesses and is not
expected to have a material adverse effect on their competitive position,
results of operations, cash flows or financial position.


Part I
Item 1

Entergy
Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy

Clean Air Act and Subsequent
Amendments

The Clean Air Act and its subsequent
Amendments established several programs that currently or in the future may
affect Entergy's fossil-fueled generation facilities.  Individual
states also operate similar independent state programs or delegated federal
programs that may include requirements more stringent than federal regulatory
requirements.  These programs include:

·

New
      source review and preconstruction permits for new sources of criteria air
      pollutants and significant modifications to existing
      facilities;

·

Acid
      rain program for control of sulfur dioxide (SO


) and
      nitrogen oxides (NO

x

);

·

Nonattainment
      area programs for control of criteria air
  pollutants;

·

Hazardous
      air pollutant emissions reduction
program;

·

Interstate
      Air Transport;

·

Operating
      permits program for administration and enforcement of these and other
      Clean Air Act programs; and

·

Regional
      Haze and Best Available Retrofit Technology
  programs.

New
Source Review (NSR)

Preconstruction
permits are required for new facilities and for existing facilities that undergo
a modification that results in a significant net emissions increase and is not
classified as routine repair, maintenance, or replacement.  Units that
undergo a non-routine modification must obtain a permit modification and may be
required to install additional air pollution control
technologies.  Entergy has an established process for identifying
modifications requiring additional permitting approval and has followed the
regulations and associated guidance provided by the states and the federal
government with regard to the determination of routine repair, maintenance, and
replacement.  In recent years, however, the EPA has begun an
enforcement initiative, aimed primarily at coal plants, to identify
modifications that it does not consider routine and that have failed to obtain a
permit modification.  Entergy to date has not been included in any of
these enforcement actions. Nevertheless, various courts and the EPA have been
inconsistent in their judgments regarding what modifications are considered
routine.

In April
2007 the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the applicability of Clean Air Act NSR
requirements is not limited only to modifications that create an increase in
hourly emission rates, but also can apply to modifications that create an
increase in annual emission rates (

Environmental Defense v. Duke
Energy

).  This Supreme Court decision has resulted in a renewed
effort by the EPA to bring enforcement actions against electric generating units
for major non-permitted facility modifications.

Acid Rain
Program

The Clean
Air Act provides SO


allowances
to most of the affected Entergy generating units for emissions based upon past
emission levels and operating characteristics.  Each allowance is an
entitlement to emit one ton of SO


per
year.  Plant owners are required to possess allowances for SO


emissions
from affected generating units.  Virtually all Entergy fossil-fueled
generating units are subject to SO


allowance
requirements.  Entergy could be required to purchase additional
allowances when it generates power using fuel oil.  Fuel oil usage is
determined by economic dispatch and influenced by the price of natural gas,
incremental emission allowance costs, and the availability and cost of purchased
power.

Ozone
Nonattainment

Entergy
Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy Texas each operate fossil-fueled generating
units in geographic areas that are not in attainment of the currently-enforced
national ambient air quality standards for ozone.  The Louisiana
nonattainment area that affects Entergy Gulf States Louisiana is the Baton Rouge
area.  Texas nonattainment areas that affect Entergy Texas are the
Houston-Galveston-Brazoria and the Beaumont-Port Arthur areas.  Areas
in nonattainment are classified as "marginal", "moderate," "serious," or
"severe."  When an area fails to meet the ambient air standard, the
EPA requires state regulatory authorities to prepare state implementation plans
meant to cause progress toward bringing the area into attainment with applicable
standards.


Part I
Item 1

Entergy
Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy

In April 2004, the EPA issued a final
rule, effective June 2005, revoking a 1-hour ozone standard, including
designations and classifications.  In a separate action over the same
period, the EPA enacted 8-hour ozone nonattainment classifications and stated
that areas designated as nonattainment under a new 8-hour ozone standard shall
have one year to adjust to the new requirements with submittal of a new
attainment plan.

The Baton Rouge area was classified as
a ''marginal" nonattainment area under the 8-hour standard with an attainment
date of June 15, 2007.  On March 21, 2008, the EPA published a notice
that the Baton Rouge area had failed to meet the standard by the attainment date
and that the EPA was proceeding with a "bump-up" of the area to the next higher
nonattainment level.  The Baton Rouge area is now classified as a
"moderate" nonattainment area with an attainment date of June 15,
2010.

The Beaumont-Port Arthur area was
originally classified as a "marginal" nonattainment area under the 8-hour
standard with an attainment date of June 15, 2007.  On March 18, 2008,
the EPA published a notice that the Beaumont-Port Arthur area had failed to meet
the standard by the attainment date based on the area's 2004-2006 monitoring
data and that the EPA was proceeding with a "bump-up" of the area to the next
higher nonattainment level.  The 2005-2007 monitoring data showed the
area to be in attainment, however, and on July 9, 2008, the Texas Commission on
Environmental Quality proposed a plan for EPA re-designation of the area from
nonattainment to attainment under the 8-hour ozone standard.

The Houston-Galveston-Brazoria area was
originally classified as "moderate" nonattainment under the 8-hour standard with
an attainment date of June 15, 2010.  On June 15, 2007, the Texas
governor petitioned the EPA to reclassify Houston-Galveston-Brazoria from
"moderate" to "severe."  On October 1, 2008, the EPA granted the
request by the Texas governor to voluntarily reclassify the
Houston-Galveston-Brazoria area from a "moderate" 8-hour ozone nonattainment
area to a "severe" 8-hour ozone nonattainment area.  The EPA also set
April 15, 2010, as the date for the State of Texas to submit a revised state
implementation plan addressing the "severe" ozone nonattainment area
requirements of the Clean Air Act.  The area's new attainment date for
the 8-hour ozone standard is as expeditiously as practicable, but no later than
June 15, 2019.

In December 2006, the EPA's revocation
of the 1-hour ozone standard was rejected in a judicial
proceeding.  As a result, numerous requirements can return for areas
that fail to meet 1-hour ozone levels by dates set by the law.  These
requirements include the potential to increase fees significantly for plants
operating in these areas.  In addition, it is possible that new
emission controls may be required.  Specific costs of compliance
cannot be estimated at this time, but Entergy is monitoring development of the
respective state implementation plans and will develop specific compliance
strategies as the plans move through the adoption
process.  Additionally, in February 2010, the EPA published a
determination that the Baton Rouge area has reached attainment status for the
former 1-hour ozone level.  This determination may reduce or eliminate
any fees required in the area.

In March
2008, the EPA revised the National Ambient Air Quality Standard for ozone,
creating the potential for additional counties and parishes in which Entergy
operates to be placed in nonattainment status.  The LDEQ recommended
that eleven parishes be designated as nonattainment for the 75 parts per billion
ozone standard.  Entergy Gulf States Louisiana has two fossil plants
and Entergy Louisiana has one fossil plant affected by this
recommendation.  In Arkansas, the governor recommended that Pulaski
County be designated in nonattainment with the new ozone standard, where two of
Entergy Arkansas' smaller facilities are located.  These
recommendations have not been approved yet by the EPA, and in September 2009 the
EPA announced that it is reconsidering the 75 parts per billion standard and may
lower it further.  Lowering the standard would cause the need for
additional analysis of county and parish attainment status.  On
January 7, 2010, the EPA proposed to set the primary 8-hour ozone standard at a
level between 60 to 70 parts per billion.  The proposal is expected to
result in 11 additional Entergy facilities operating in areas designated as
non-attainment for ozone.  Following nonattainment designation, states
will be required to develop state implementation plans that outline control
requirements that will enable the affected counties and parishes to reach
attainment status.  Entergy facilities in these areas may be subject
to installation of NOx controls, but the degree of control will remain unknown
until the state implementation plans are developed.  Entergy will
continue to monitor and engage in the state implementation plan development
process in Entergy states.

Hazardous
Air Pollutants

In March 2005, the EPA issued a federal
rule to cap and reduce mercury emissions from coal-fired power
plants.  The Clean Air Mercury Rule (CAMR) established "standards of
performance" limiting mercury emissions from new and existing coal-fired power
plants and created a market-based cap-and-trade program intended to reduce
nationwide utility emissions of mercury in two distinct phases.  The
rule was challenged in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia
Circuit (D.C. Circuit).  On February 8, 2008, the D.C. Circuit struck
down CAMR and remanded the rule to the EPA for further
consideration.  The EPA likely will proceed with developing a Maximum
Achievable Control Technology (MACT) retrofit standard for coal and oil-fired
units.  In 2009 the EPA issued an Information Collection Request to
gather data needed for promulgation of Hazardous Air Pollutant
regulations.  It is currently expected that the EPA will propose a
mercury MACT rule in 2011 with a final rule in 2013.  Entergy is
continuing to conduct mercury research through coordination with the Electric
Power Research Institute (EPRI) and others and remains involved in the current
rulemaking process.

Interstate
Air Transport

In March 2005, the EPA finalized the
Clean Air Interstate Rule (CAIR), which is intended to reduce SO


and NOx
emissions from electric generation plants in order to improve air quality in
twenty-nine eastern states.  The rule requires a combination of
investment of capital to install pollution control equipment and increased
operating costs through the purchase of emission
allowances.  Entergy's capital investment and annual allowance
purchase costs under the CAIR will depend on the economic assessment of NOx and
SO


allowance markets, the cost of control technologies, and unit
usage.  Entergy began implementation in 2007, including installation
of controls at several facilities and the development of an emission allowance
procurement strategy.

The effect on capital spending could be
offset by emission allowance markets which allow for purchases or use of
allocated allowances; however, the allocation of the emission allowances and the
set up of the market will determine the ultimate cost to
Entergy.  Entergy believes that the original allocation was unfairly
skewed towards states with relatively higher emissions by the use of a
fuel-adjustment factor.  Entergy filed a challenge to this aspect of
the rule in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit (D.C.
Circuit).

The CAIR was vacated by the D.C.
Circuit in July 2008.  The court found that the EPA failed to
address basic obligations under the Clean Air Act's "good neighbor" provision
regarding "upwind" states' contribution to air quality impairment in "downwind"
states.  The court also ruled favorably on Entergy's challenge,
finding that the EPA exceeded its statutory authority when it included a fuel
adjustment factor to calculate the state NOx emission budgets.

On December 23, 2008, the D.C. Circuit
remanded the CAIR decision to the EPA without vacatur, allowing the CAIR to
become effective on January 1, 2009, while EPA revises the rule.  The
revised rule must address all the flaws identified in the D.C. Circuit decision,
including the use of a fuel adjustment factor and the use of acid rain SO


allowances
for the CAIR.  Entergy has reactivated its compliance effort for the
CAIR based on this court ruling.  The EPA is expected to issue a
proposed CAIR replacement rule in 2010.

Regional
Haze

In June 2005, the EPA issued final Best
Available Retrofit Control Technology (BART) regulations that could potentially
result in a requirement to install SO


pollution
control technology on certain of Entergy's coal and oil generation
units.  The rule leaves certain BART determinations to the
states.  The Arkansas Department of Environmental Quality (ADEQ)
prepared a State Implementation Plan (SIP) for Arkansas facilities to implement
its obligations under the Clean Air Visibility Rule.  The ADEQ
determined that Entergy Arkansas' White Bluff power plant affects a Class I Area
visibility and will be subject to the EPA's presumptive BART requirements to
install scrubbers and low NOx burners

.

Under current
regulations, the scrubbers would have to be operational by October
2013.  Entergy filed a petition in December 2009 with the Arkansas
Pollution Control and Ecology Commission


Part I
Item 1

Entergy
Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy

requesting
a variance from this deadline, however, because the EPA has not approved
Arkansas' Regional Haze SIP and the EPA has recently expressed concerns about
Arkansas' Regional Haze SIP and questioned the appropriateness of issuing an air
permit prior to that approval.  Entergy Arkansas' petition requests
that, consistent with federal law, the compliance deadline be changed to as
expeditiously as practicable, but in no event later than five years after EPA
approval of the Arkansas Regional Haze SIP.  The Arkansas Pollution
Control and Ecology (PC&E) Commission adopted a procedural schedule that
includes a public hearing and a comment period ending in March 2010 with the
expectation that the variance could be considered at the Commission's March 26,
2010 meeting.  The timeline for EPA action on the Arkansas Regional
Haze SIP is uncertain at this time.

In March 2009, Entergy Arkansas made a
filing with the APSC seeking a declaratory order that the White Bluff project is
in the public interest.  In May 2009 the APSC Staff filed a motion
requesting that the APSC require Entergy Arkansas to file testimony on several
issues.  In December 2009, in response to the EPA concerns regarding
Arkansas' Regional Haze SIP, the APSC suspended the procedural schedule in the
proceeding.

Currently, the White Bluff project is
suspended, but the latest conceptual cost estimate indicated that Entergy
Arkansas' share of the project could cost approximately $465
million.  The plant would continue to operate during construction,
although an outage would be necessary to complete the tie in of the
scrubbers.  Entergy continues to review potential environmental
spending needs and financing alternatives for any such spending, and future
spending estimates could change based on the results of this continuing
analysis.

Potential
Legislative, Regulatory, and Judicial Developments (Air)

In addition to the specific instances
described above, there are a number of legislative and regulatory initiatives
relating to the reduction of emissions that are under consideration at the
federal, state, and local level.  Because of the nature of Entergy's
business, the adoption of each of these could affect its
operations.  Entergy continues to monitor these initiatives and
activities in order to analyze their potential operational and cost
implications.  These initiatives include:

·

designation
      by the EPA and state environmental agencies of areas that are not in
      attainment with national ambient air quality
  standards;

·

introduction
      of several bills in Congress and development of regulations by the EPA
      proposing further limits on NOx, SO2, mercury and CO


and
      other greenhouse gas emissions.  New legislation or regulations
      applicable to stationary sources could take the form of market-based
      cap-and-trade programs, direct requirements for the installation of air
      emission controls onto air emission sources or other or combined
      regulatory programs.  Entergy cannot estimate the effect of any
      future legislation at this time due to the uncertainty of the regulatory
      format;

·

efforts
      to implement a voluntary program intended to reduce CO


emissions and efforts in Congress to establish a mandatory federal CO


emission control structure;

·

passage
      and implementation of the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative by several
      states in the northeast U.S. and similar actions in the Midwest and
      California;

·

efforts
      on the state and federal level to codify renewable portfolio standards
      requiring utilities to produce or purchase a certain percentage of their
      power from defined renewable energy sources;
and

·

efforts
      by certain external groups to encourage reporting and disclosure of
      CO


emissions and risk.  Entergy has prepared responses for the
      Carbon Disclosure Project's (CDP) annual questionnaire for the past
      several years and has given permission for those responses to be posted to
      CDP's website.

In addition to these initiatives,
certain states and environmental advocacy groups are seeking judicial action to
require the EPA to promulgate regulations under existing provisions of the Clean
Air Act to control CO


emissions
from power plants.  In April 2007 the U.S. Supreme Court held that the
EPA is authorized by the current provisions of the Clean Air Act to regulate
emissions of CO


and other
"greenhouse gases" as "pollutants" (

Massachusetts v. EPA

) and
that the EPA is required to regulate these emissions from motor vehicles if the
emissions are anticipated to endanger public health or welfare.  The
Supreme Court directed the EPA to make further findings in this
regard.  The decision is expected to affect a similar case pending in
the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit (

Coke Oven Environmental Task Force
v. EPA

) considering the same question under a similar Clean Air Act
provision in the context of CO


emissions
from electric generating units.  Entergy participated as a friend of
the court in

Massachusetts v.
EPA

and has been granted the same status in

Coke Oven

.  Entergy
will continue to advocate in support of reasonable market-based regulation of
CO


.  Entergy
has also supported the comments of various industry groups


Part I
Item 1

Entergy
Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy

advocating
national legislation to address CO


emissions
instead of attempting to regulate under the provisions of the Clean Air
Act.  Entergy continues to monitor these and similar actions in order
to analyze their potential operational and cost implications and
benefits.

In 2009, the EPA published an
"endangerment finding" stating that the emission of greenhouse gases "may
reasonably be anticipated to endanger public health or welfare" and that the
emission of these pollutants from mobile sources (such as cars and trucks)
contributes to this endangerment.  The EPA has stated that the
endangerment finding itself does not create any immediate requirements for any
emissions source; however, in 2009 the EPA also proposed rules limiting the
emissions of certain greenhouse gases, including CO


, from cars
and light trucks, adopting a policy that the "actual control" of greenhouse gas
emissions (such as by the mobile source rule) would trigger the application of
new source review permitting requirements for stationary sources under section
165 of the Clean Air Act, and creating a threshold of 25,000 tons of emissions
for the application of new source review permitting for new sources and 10,000
to 25,000 tons for modifications.  These changes, taken together and
if finalized by the EPA, would likely require new stationary sources of
greenhouse gas emissions and significant modifications of existing sources to
undergo a new source review permitting process that would include the required
application of best available control technology (BACT) for the control of such
emissions to the stationary source.  The likely outcome of
permit-by-permit determinations of required BACT and the associated costs is, at
this time, uncertain.  Additionally, subsequent to the endangerment
finding, the EPA may be required to develop new source performance standards for
both new and existing sources of greenhouse gas emissions.  The
details of these standards and any required operational changes are
uncertain.

In anticipation of the potential
imposition of CO


emission
limits on the electric industry in the future, Entergy has initiated actions
designed to reduce its exposure to potential new governmental requirements
related to CO


emissions.  These voluntary actions included establishment of a formal
program to stabilize power plant CO


emissions
at 2000 levels through 2005, and Entergy succeeded in actually reducing
emissions below 2000 levels.  Entergy has now established a second
formal voluntary program to stabilize power plant CO


emissions
and emissions from controllable power purchases at 20% below 2000 levels through
2010 and continues to support national legislation that would increase planning
certainty for electric utilities while addressing emissions in a responsible and
flexible manner.  By virtue of its proportionally large investment in
low- or non-emitting gas-fired and nuclear generation technologies, Entergy's
overall CO


emission
"intensity," or rate of CO


emitted
per kilowatt-hour of electricity generated, is already among the lowest in the
industry.  Total CO


emissions
representing Entergy's ownership share of power plants in the United States were
approximately 53.2 million tons in 2000, 49.6 million tons in 2001, 44.2 million
tons in 2002, 36.8 million tons in 2003, 38.3 million tons in 2004, 35.6 million
tons in 2005, 38.8 million tons in 2006, 40.2 million tons in 2007, 43.9 million
tons in 2008, and 39.8 million tons in 2009.  In 2006, Entergy
changed its method of calculating emissions and now includes emissions from
controllable power purchases as well as its ownership share of generation, which
accounts for the increase beginning in 2006 compared to the trend for the prior
years.

Greenhouse
Gas Reporting

In September 2009, the EPA finalized a
rule to require reporting of several greenhouse gases.  This rule will
require Entergy to annually report greenhouse gas emissions from operating power
plants and natural gas distribution operations.  Entergy has developed
compliance plans, is collecting the necessary data, and will report as required
in 2011.

Clean Water
Act

The 1972 amendments to the Federal
Water Pollution Control Act (known as the Clean Water Act) provide the statutory
basis for the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit
program and the basic structure for regulating the discharge of pollutants from
point sources to waters of the United States.  The Clean Water Act
requires all discharges of pollutants to waters of the United States to be
permitted, section 316(b) of the Clean Water Act regulates cooling water intake
structures, section 401 of the Clean Water Act requires a water quality
certification from the state in support of certain federal actions and
approvals, and section 404 regulates the dredge and fill of waters of the United
States, including jurisdictional wetlands.

NPDES
Permits and Section 401 Water Quality Certifications

NPDES permits are subject to renewal
every five years.  Consequently, Entergy is currently in various
stages of the data evaluation and discharge permitting process for its Utility
power plants and its Non-Utility Nuclear power plants.  Additionally,
the State of New York has taken the position that a new state-issued water
quality certification is required as part of the NRC license renewal
process.  Therefore, Non-Utility Nuclear's New York facilities also
are seeking, or have obtained, a section 401 certification prior to license
renewal.

FitzPatrick

As agreed to as settlement of the
FitzPatrick discharge permit and water quality certification, Entergy installed
Ristroph screens for safely removing fish from intake screens, and plans to
install an initial fish return system during the next five-year permit
cycle.  Additionally, Entergy is undertaking studies regarding the
feasibility and effectiveness of relocating FitzPatrick’s offshore intake
structure and of additional fish return technologies.  The permit
issued under the agreement requires that the New York State Department of
Environmental Conservation (NYSDEC) initiate a permit modification, triggering
Entergy's right to challenge, if New York State decides to require the
installation and operation of additional fish return technology.  The
Clean Water Act permit, water quality certification, and Coastal Zone Management
Act consistency determination have now been issued.

Vermont
Yankee

Opposition groups appealed a water
discharge permit amendment issued to Vermont Yankee pursuant to the state's
NPDES program in which the Vermont Agency of Natural Resources (VANR) allowed a
small increase in the amount of heat the facility can discharge to the
Connecticut River from June 16 to October 14 each year.  The VANR
permit amendment increases operational flexibility for the required usage rate
of the existing cooling towers and for the generation rate of the facility that
is especially helpful in conditions of high ambient temperatures or low river
flow conditions.  The trial of this matter occurred in the Vermont
Environmental Court during the summer of 2007.  On May 22, 2008, the
Vermont Environmental Court entered its judgment and order granting the
increased thermal discharge provided in the amendment for the period from July 8
through October 14 each year, but imposing additional management and measurement
requirements with respect to the period from June 16 through July
7.  Entergy and opposition groups appealed aspects of the ruling to
the Vermont Supreme Court.  On December 18, 2009, the Vermont Supreme
Court affirmed the thermal increase but overturned the Vermont Environmental
Court's imposition of additional management and measurement
requirements.

Indian
Point

Non-Utility Nuclear is involved in an
administrative permitting process with the NYSDEC for renewal of the Indian
Point 2 and 3 discharge permits.  In November 2003, the NYSDEC issued
a draft permit indicating that closed cycle cooling would be considered the
"best technology available" for minimizing alleged adverse environmental effects
attributable to the intake of cooling water at Indian Point 2 and Indian Point
3, subject to a feasibility determination and alternatives analysis for that
technology, if Entergy applied for and received NRC license renewal at Indian
Point 2 and Indian Point 3.  Upon becoming effective, the draft permit
also would have required payment of approximately $24 million annually, and an
annual 42 unit-day outage period, until closed cycle cooling is
implemented.  Non-Utility Nuclear is participating in the
administrative process to request that the draft permit be modified prior to
final issuance, and opposes any requirement to install cooling towers at Indian
Point 2 and Indian Point 3.  In the past Non-Utility Nuclear notified
the NYSDEC that the cost of retrofitting Indian Point 2 and Indian Point 3 with
cooling towers likely would cost, in 2003 dollars, at least $740 million in
capital costs and an additional $630 million in lost generation during
construction.

In the February 2010 feasibility report
noted in the paragraph below, Non-Utility Nuclear provided an updated estimate
of the cost to retrofit Indian Point 2 and Indian Point 3 with cooling
towers.  Construction costs for retrofitting with cooling towers are
now estimated to be at least $1.19 billion, in addition to lost generation of
approximately 14.5 TWh during the estimated 42-week forced outage of both
units.  Non-Utility Nuclear also proposed an alternative to the
cooling towers, the use of Wedgewire screens, that would cost up to
approximately $100 million to install.  Due to fluctuations in power
pricing and because a retrofitting of this size and complexity has never been
undertaken, significant uncertainties exist in these estimates and, therefore,
they could be materially higher than estimated.


Part I
Item 1

Entergy
Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy

An August 13, 2008 ruling by the
NYSDEC's Assistant Commissioner has restructured the permitting and
administrative process, including by applying a new economic test designed to
implement the Second Circuit's standard.  The NYSDEC has directed
Entergy to develop detailed feasibility information regarding the construction
and operation of cooling towers, and alternatives to closed cycle cooling, prior
to the issuance of a new draft permit by the NYSDEC staff and commencement of
the adjudicatory proceeding.  The reports include a visual impact and
aesthetics report filed on June 1, 2009, a plume and emissions report filed on
September 1, 2009, a technical feasibility report due and filed in February
2010, and an economic report to establish whether the technology, if feasible,
satisfies the economic test that is part of the New York
standard.  Entergy has also requested that the Assistant Commissioner
reconsider the New York standard in light of the U.S. Supreme Court decision
reversing the Second Circuit's alternative economic test adopted in the August
13, 2008 ruling.  The current procedural schedule calls for hearings
to commence in 2011.  The NYSDEC is expected to consider the
information submitted and issue another draft permit with a new best technology
available determination, which may or may not be cooling towers.  A
new comment period and further contested proceedings likely would
follow.

On April 6, 2009, with a reservation of
rights regarding the applicability of the section, Entergy's Indian Point
facility submitted a Section 401 water quality certification to the
NYSDEC.  The certification, or a waiver or exemption of the same, is
potentially required pursuant to Section 401 of the Clean Water Act as a
supporting document to the NRC's license renewal decision.  On May 13,
2009, the NYSDEC deemed the application incomplete and requested additional
information.  The NYSDEC requested that Entergy respond within 120
days or by September 10, 2009 and set the deadline for submitting all the
requested information as February 13, 2010.  Entergy continues to work
with the NYSDEC in order to provide the requested additional information and
filed two additional reports with the NYSDEC in early February
2010.  By law, the NYSDEC must act on the water quality certification
application within one year of receipt.

Effluent
Limitations

On December 1, 2009, the EPA published
a final rule directed at establishing effluent limitation guidelines and
standards for the construction and development water pollution point source
category.  Included within the industry sector affected by this
rulemaking are electric utility transmission line and substation construction
projects.  The effective date of this rulemaking is February 1,
2010.  In the rulemaking the EPA is promulgating a series of
non-numeric effluent limitations, as well as a numeric effluent limitation for
turbidity.  All construction sites will be required to meet the series
of non-numeric effluent limitations.  In general, the non-numeric
effluent limitations are a reiteration of the requirement to use siltation and
erosion control best management practices directed at stormwater pollution
prevention.

Of greater significance to Entergy,
construction sites that disturb ten or more acres of land at one time will be
required to monitor discharges from the site and comply with the numeric
effluent limitation.  If a project initially exceeds the acreage
threshold but later, due to permanent stabilization of disturbed areas, falls
below the threshold, the numeric effluent limit will no longer apply;
consequently, phasing construction projects to limit the amount of soil
disturbed at any given time will be an allowed strategy for addressing
applicability of the rulemaking.  The EPA is phasing in the numeric
effluent limitation over four years to allow permitting authorities adequate
time to develop monitoring requirements and to allow the regulated community
time to prepare for compliance with the numeric effluent
limitation.  The numeric limit established by this rulemaking is
measured as a daily maximum value.  Due to the nature of this
analytical parameter, sampling and analysis of the effluent must occur on-site
during any day that stormwater run-off occurs at a frequency that will be
established by the permitting authority.


Part I
Item 1

Entergy
Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy

The numeric turbidity limitation will
apply to all discharges from the site except on days when total precipitation
during the day exceeded the local 2-year, 24-hour storm.  If the total
precipitation in any one day is greater than the local 2-year, 24-hour storm
event, then permittees would still need to sample (because they wouldn't know in
advance whether the precipitation on that day was going to exceed the storm size
threshold) but the numeric effluent limitation would not apply to discharges for
that day.  The numeric effluent limitation is applicable to all
discharges from the site on subsequent days, however, if there is no 2-year,
24-hour storm event during those days.

In order to achieve the numeric
discharge limit, many Entergy construction projects exceeding the acreage
threshold will likely be required to utilize chemical flocullants, either
applied within a stormwater conveyance in the project watershed or in a
stormwater detention basin.  In some cases, capture of stormwater
run-off and usage of fractionation tanks to temporarily store the water until
sufficient settling of suspended soil particles may be required in order to meet
the numeric limit.

Construction sites that disturb 20 or
more acres at one time will be required to conduct monitoring of discharges from
the site and comply with the numeric effluent limitation beginning 18 months
after the effective date of the final rule.  Assuming the rulemaking
survives any legal challenge, this compliance deadline for 20 acre sites will be
August 1, 2011.  Construction sites that disturb ten or more acres at
one time will be required to conduct monitoring of discharges from the site and
comply with the numeric effluent limitation beginning four years after the
effective date of the final rule (February 1, 2014).

The final rule, in part based on the
considerations of linear projects (electrical line construction), no longer
contains a requirement to install a sediment basin and revisions were made to
the non-numeric effluent limitations based on comments concerning the
feasibility at linear projects.  However, the EPA disagreed with
comments from Entergy and the Utility Water Act Group that suggested the EPA
should either exempt all linear projects from the final rule or from the numeric
effluent limitation.  The EPA has determined that numeric effluent
limitations are feasible for linear projects and passive treatment systems
provide flexibility to linear projects to take into account site specific
considerations.  Additionally, the EPA believes that the permitting
authority, which in Entergy's Utility service area is delegated to the states,
should exercise discretion when determining the monitoring locations and
monitoring frequency for linear construction projects.  This
establishes what will likely be a very subjective development of requirements
for electrical line construction projects.

316(b)
Cooling Water Intake Structures

The EPA finalized new regulations in
July 2004 governing the intake of water at large existing power plants employing
cooling water intake structures.  The rule sought to reduce perceived
impacts on aquatic resources by requiring covered facilities to implement
technology or other measures to meet EPA-targeted reductions in water use and
corresponding perceived aquatic impacts.  Entergy, other industry
members and industry groups, environmental groups, and a coalition of
northeastern and mid-Atlantic states challenged various aspects of the
rule.  In January 2007, the United States Court of Appeals for the
Second Circuit remanded the rule to the EPA for reconsideration.  The
court instructed the EPA to reconsider several aspects of the rule that were
beneficial to the regulated community after finding that these provisions of the
rule were contrary to the language of the Clean Water Act or were not
sufficiently explained in the rule.  In April 2008, the United States
Supreme Court agreed to review the decision of the Second Circuit on the
question of whether the EPA may take into consideration a cost-benefit analysis
in developing these regulations, a consideration of potential benefit to the
regulated community that the Second Circuit disallowed.  In March
2009, the Supreme Court ruled in favor of the petitioners that cost-benefit
analysis may be taken into consideration.  The EPA may now reissue a
rule similar in structure to the rule remanded by the Second Circuit, or the EPA
may issue a rule with a substantially different structure and
effect.  Until the EPA issues guidance to the regulated community on
what actions should be taken to comply with the Clean Water Act, and until the
form and substance of the new rule itself is determined, it is impossible to
estimate the effect of the Supreme Court's decision on Entergy's
business.  See the discussion above regarding the Indian Point and
FitzPatrick permitting processes under similar New York state provisions of
law.

At the request of the EPA Region 1
(Boston), Entergy submitted extensive data to the agency in July 2008 concerning
cooling water intake impacts at the Pilgrim nuclear power
plant.  Analysis of technologies that may be appropriate for Pilgrim
continues, but it appears at this point that cooling towers are not feasible due
to restrictions in the plant's condenser design and capacity.  Other
technologies, such as variable speed pumps and the relocation of the cooling
water intake, are under analysis.

Entergy's Utility business generation

to the EPA and the affected states concerning cooling water intake
structures.  Entergy will continue to monitor the activities of the
EPA and the states toward the implementation of section 316(b) of the Clean
Water Act in the wake of the remand of the current rule and will respond
accordingly.  Deadlines for determining compliance with Section 316(b)
and for any required capital or operational expenditures are unknown at this
time due to the remand of the rule to the EPA.  As a result,
management cannot predict the amounts Entergy will ultimately be required to
spend to comply with Section 316(b) and any related state regulations, although
such amounts could be significant.

Coastal
Zone Management Act

The Coastal Zone Management Act
requires federal activities within a coastal zone to be consistent with the
state's federally approved coastal zone management
program.  Therefore, a nuclear facility located within a coastal zone
must obtain a consistency certification from the state as part of the NRC's
license renewal process.  Entergy has Non-Utility Nuclear plants that
are within coastal zones.  Pilgrim has received its consistency
determination from the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.  Vermont Yankee
is not within a coastal zone and does not need a consistency
determination.

In New York, the Coastal Management
Program promotes waterfront revitalization, protects fish and wildlife habitats,
protects and enhances scenic and historic areas, and promotes water access and
public recreation.  As discussed above, FitzPatrick already has
obtained its consistency certification.  Indian Point expects to file
its consistency determination application with the New York Department of State
in mid-2010.  The New York Department of State has six months from the
date it deems the application complete to issue or deny the consistency
certification.

Groundwater at Certain
Nuclear Sites

The NRC requires nuclear power plants
to regularly monitor and report the presence of radioactive material in the
environment.  Entergy joined other nuclear utilities and the Nuclear
Energy Institute in 2006 to develop a voluntary groundwater monitoring and
protection program.  This initiative began after detection of very low
levels of radioactive material, primarily tritium, in groundwater at several
plants in the United States, including the Indian Point Energy
Center.  In addition to tritium, other radionuclides have been found
in on site ground water at Indian Point.

As part of the groundwater monitoring
and protection program, Entergy has: (1) performed reviews of plant groundwater
characteristics (hydrology) and historical records of past events on site that
may have potentially impacted groundwater; (2) implemented fleet procedures on
how to handle events that could impact groundwater; and (3) installed
groundwater monitoring wells and began periodic sampling.  The program
also includes protocols for notifying local officials if contamination is
found.  To date, radionuclides have been detected at Entergy's
FitzPatrick, Indian Point, Palisades, Pilgrim, and Vermont Yankee
plants.

Entergy identified and addressed two
sources of the contamination at Indian Point: the Unit 1 and 2 spent fuel
pools.  In October 2007, the EPA announced that it was consulting with
the NRC and the NYSDEC regarding Indian Point.  The EPA stated that
after reviewing data it confirmed with New York State that there have been no
violations of federal drinking water standards for radionuclides in drinking
water supplies.  Indian Point has implemented an extensive groundwater
monitoring and protection program, including installing approximately 35
monitoring wells, with five to six sampling points per well.  Entergy
has been working cooperatively with the NRC and the NYSDEC in a split sample
program to independently analyze test samples.

At Palisades, Entergy identified
tritium in two monitoring wells in December 2007 caused by leakage from the
buried piping for a recirculation line.  Non-destructive evaluation of
the line identified one area of leakage and repairs were completed in
2008.  Since early 2008, groundwater from three wells have been
sampled and analyzed on a bi-weekly basis. Following the repairs, tritium levels
declined in all of the wells and trended downward until one well spiked in March
2009.  Additional investigation was performed to locate the
source,


Part I
Item 1

Entergy
Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy

including
installation of 18 temporary monitoring wells along the path of the buried
piping.  A new leak location was identified and repairs at the
location were completed in mid-summer 2009.  However, when the system
was put back in service, it became evident from groundwater samples that this
same buried piping system was also breached at locations other than at the leak
location that had earlier been repaired.  Therefore, the piping system
was again taken out of service and drained to prevent further leakage into the
ground.  Subsequently, Entergy decided to abandon this piping and to
run new replacement buried pipe for this system.  This effort was
completed in December 2009.  Bi-weekly sampling will continue until
the groundwater tritium levels in the monitoring wells are below minimum
detection levels.

At Pilgrim, six existing monitoring
wells are being sampled and analyzed on a periodic basis.  Results
continue to show low levels of tritium.  A hydrogeological analysis
was performed in 2009 to pinpoint the location for six additional wells to
further study the situation, and these wells will be installed in
2010.  Currently, the detections are believed to be from wash out of
atmospheric tritium.  Precipitation studies are being performed to
confirm this theory.

At FitzPatrick, a sample collected from
a reactor building perimeter sump in November 2009 showed elevated levels of
tritium.  Follow up samples collected in December 2009 from a storm
drain that communicates with this sump also found elevated levels of
tritium.  Investigations are ongoing to determine the source of the
tritium and to determine what action should be taken.  No elevated
levels of tritium have been found in manholes, equipment pits or any of the
groundwater monitoring wells.

In January 2010, Vermont Yankee was
notified by its off-site analytical laboratory that a sample collected from a
groundwater monitoring well in mid-November 2009 showed elevated levels of
tritium.  Subsequent analyses continue to confirm the presence of an
elevated tritium concentration.  Investigations are ongoing to
determine the source of the tritium, including the installation of additional
monitoring wells in February 2010, and to determine what action should be
taken.  No elevated levels of tritium have been found in any potable
water wells located on- or off-site.

Indian Point Units 1 and 2
Hazardous Waste Remediation

As part
of the effort to terminate the current Indian Point 2 mixed waste storage
permit, Entergy was required to perform groundwater and soil sampling for
metals, PCBs and other non-radiological contaminants on plant property,
regardless of whether these contaminants stem from onsite activities or were
related to the waste stored on-site pursuant to the permit.  Entergy
believes this permit is no longer necessary for the facility due to an exemption
for mixed wastes (hazardous waste that is also radioactive) promulgated as part
of the EPA's hazardous waste regulations.  This exemption allows mixed
waste to be regulated through the NRC license instead of through a separate EPA
or state hazardous waste permit.  In February 2008, Entergy submitted
its report on this sampling effort to the NYSDEC.  The report
indicated the presence of various metals in soils at levels above the NYSDEC
cleanup objectives.  It does not appear that these metals are
connected to operation of the nuclear facility.  At the request of the
NYSDEC, Entergy submitted a plan on August 8, 2008, for a study that will
identify the sources of the metals.  The NYSDEC recently approved this
workplan with some conditions related to the need to study whether the soil
impact observed may have originated from plant construction
materials.  This issue is being studied by Entergy to determine if any
changes to the workplan are necessary.  The NYSDEC may require
additional work to define the vertical and lateral extent of the contamination
on-site, and evaluate any potential for migration off-site.  The
NYSDEC plans to use the results of this investigation to determine whether the
permit can be terminated and the metals left in place until plant
decommissioning or if further investigation or remediation is
required.  Entergy is unable to determine what the extent or cost of
required remediation, if any, will be at this time.

Prior to
Entergy's purchase of Indian Point Unit 1, the previous owner completed the
cleanup and desludging of the Unit 1 water storage pool, generating mixed waste
(waste that is regulated as both low-level nuclear waste and hazardous
waste).  The waste currently is stored in the Unit 1 containment
building in accordance with NRC regulations controlling low level radioactive
waste.  The waste is also regulated by the NYSDEC.  The NYSDEC
requires Entergy to survey quarterly the availability of any commercial facility
capable of treating, processing and disposing of this waste in a commercially
reasonable manner.  Entergy continues to review this matter and to conduct
its quarterly searches for a commercially reasonable vendor that is acceptable
both to the NRC and the NYSDEC.  The cost of this disposal cannot be
estimated at this time due to the many variables existing in the type and manner
of disposal.

Comprehensive Environmental
Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980

The Comprehensive Environmental
Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980, as amended (CERCLA),
authorizes the EPA to mandate clean-up by, or to collect reimbursement of
clean-up costs from, owners or operators of sites at which hazardous substances
may be or have been released.  Certain private parties also may use
CERCLA to recover response costs.  Parties that transported hazardous
substances to these sites or arranged for the disposal of the substances are
also deemed liable by CERCLA.  CERCLA has been interpreted to impose
strict, joint, and several liability on responsible
parties.  Entergy's Utility and Non-Utility Nuclear businesses have
sent waste materials to various disposal sites over the years, and releases have
occurred at Entergy facilities.  In addition, environmental laws now
regulate certain of Entergy's operating procedures and maintenance practices
that historically were not subject to regulation.  Some disposal sites
used by Entergy have been the subject of governmental action under CERCLA,
resulting in site clean-up activities.  Entergy's Utility and
Non-Utility Nuclear businesses have participated to various degrees in
accordance with their respective potential liabilities in such site clean-ups
and have developed experience with clean-up costs.  The affected
Entergy companies have established reserves for such environmental clean-up and
restoration activities.  Details of significant CERCLA liabilities are
discussed in the "Other Environmental Matters" section below.

Other Environmental
Matters

Entergy
Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy Texas

Several class action and other suits
have been filed in state and federal courts seeking relief from Entergy Gulf
States, Inc. and others for damages caused by the disposal of hazardous waste
and for asbestos-related disease allegedly resulting from exposure on Entergy
Gulf States, Inc.'s premises (see "

Litigation

"
below).

Entergy Gulf States Louisiana is
currently involved in the second phase of the remedial investigation of the Lake
Charles Service Center site, located in Lake Charles, Louisiana.  A
manufactured gas plant (MGP) is believed to have operated at this site from
approximately 1916 to 1931.  Coal tar, a by-product of the
distillation process employed at MGPs, was apparently routed to a portion of the
property for disposal.  The same area has also been used as a
landfill.  In 1999, Entergy Gulf States, Inc. signed a second
Administrative Consent Order with the EPA to perform removal action at the
site.  In 2002, approximately 7,400 tons of contaminated soil and
debris were excavated and disposed of from an area within the service
center.  In 2003, a cap was constructed over the remedial area to
prevent the migration of contamination to the surface.  In August
2005, an administrative order was issued by the EPA requiring that a 10-year
groundwater study be conducted at this site.  The groundwater
monitoring study commenced in January 2006, and is continuing on a quarterly
basis.  Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy Texas each believe
that its ultimate responsibility for this site will not materially exceed the
existing clean-up provisions of $0.4 million for Entergy Gulf States Louisiana
and $0.3 million for Entergy Texas.

In 1994, Entergy Gulf States, Inc.
performed a site assessment in conjunction with a construction project at the
Louisiana Station Generating Plant (Louisiana Station).  In 1995, a
further assessment confirmed subsurface soil and groundwater impact to three
areas on the plant site.  After validation, a notification was made to
the LDEQ and a phased process was executed to remediate each area of
concern.  The final phase of groundwater clean-up and monitoring at
Louisiana Station is expected to continue for several more years.  The
remediation cost incurred through December 31, 2009 for this site was $6.8
million.  Future costs are not expected to exceed Entergy Gulf States
Louisiana's existing provision of $0.7 million.

The Texas Commission on Environmental
Quality (TCEQ) notified Entergy Gulf States, Inc. that the TCEQ believed that
Entergy Gulf States, Inc. is one of many potentially responsible parties (PRP)
concerning contamination existing at the Spector Salvage Yard proposed state
superfund site in Orange, Texas.  The TCEQ conducted a removal
action


Part I
Item 1

Entergy
Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy

consisting
of the excavation and offsite disposal of contaminated surface
soil.  Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy Texas do not believe
at this time that the former Gulf States Utilities contributed any significant
amount of hazardous substances to this site and therefore are contesting
liability.  Entergy Texas and Entergy Gulf States Louisiana believe
that their ultimate responsibility for this site will not exceed their existing
clean-up provisions.

Entergy
Louisiana and Entergy New Orleans

Several class action and other suits
have been filed in state and federal courts seeking relief from Entergy
Louisiana and Entergy New Orleans and others for damages caused by the disposal
of hazardous waste and for asbestos-related disease allegedly resulting from
exposure on Entergy Louisiana's and Entergy New Orleans' premises (see "

Litigation

"
below).

During 1993, the LDEQ issued new rules
for solid waste regulation, including regulation of wastewater
impoundments.  Entergy Louisiana has determined that some of its power
plant wastewater impoundments were affected by these regulations and may require
remediation, repair, or closure.  Completion of this work is dependent
on pending LDEQ approval of submitted solid waste permit
applications.  As a result, a recorded liability in the amount of $1.9
million for Entergy Louisiana existed at December 31, 2009 for ongoing
wastewater remediation and repairs and closures.  Management believes
this reserve to be adequate based on current estimates.

Transmission
and distribution storm teams entered wetland areas of Lafourche Parish to
restore Entergy Louisiana's Barataria-Golden Meadow line shortly after
Hurricane Katrina.  A portion of this line crosses property owned by a
third party.  The landowner has requested that Entergy Louisiana conduct an
extensive wetland mitigation program over a ten-acre area and has filed suit
against Entergy Louisiana and certain other Entergy subsidiaries concerning the
extent of the mitigation.  Entergy Louisiana believes that the marsh area
affected by its activities is less than 2 acres and that restoration can be
conducted to the satisfaction of the U. S. Corps of Engineers and the State of
Louisiana for substantially less than the over $4 million claimed by the
plaintiff.  Entergy Louisiana will meet with the Corps of Engineers
and the State of Louisiana to determine the extent of mitigation required by the
Clean Water Act and parallel state law.

Entergy
Louisiana and Entergy Texas

Damage sustained by Entergy Louisiana's
and Entergy Texas' electrical transmission infrastructure due to the effects of
Hurricane Gustav and Hurricane Ike necessitated that significant amounts of
restoration work occur in areas classified as jurisdictional wetlands and
coastal marsh.  While measures were taken to minimize the impact in
these environmentally-sensitive areas, some level of damage to the wetland and
marsh areas likely occurred.  Mitigation requirements for these
possible impacts have yet to be assessed or required by regulatory
authorities.  Following Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane Rita, the
regulatory authorities deferred assessing mitigation requirements for such
impacts pending an evaluation of spontaneous recovery of the marsh and wetlands
damaged during line repairs.

Entergy
Arkansas, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy New Orleans,
and Entergy Texas

The TCEQ
notified Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, Entergy Texas, Entergy
Louisiana, and Entergy New Orleans that the TCEQ believes those entities are
PRPs concerning contamination existing at the San Angelo Electric Service
Company (SESCO) facility in San Angelo, Texas.  The facility operated
as a transformer repair and scrapping facility from the 1930s until
2003.  Both soil and groundwater contamination exists at the
site.  Entergy Gulf States, Inc. and Entergy Louisiana sent
transformers to this facility during the 1980s.  Entergy Gulf States
Louisiana, Entergy Texas, Entergy Louisiana, and Entergy Arkansas responded to
an information request from the TCEQ and continue to cooperate in this
investigation.  Entergy New Orleans provided requested information
concerning its former status in bankruptcy. Entergy Gulf States Louisiana,
Entergy Texas, and Entergy Louisiana joined a group of PRPs responding to site
conditions in cooperation with the State of Texas, creating cost allocation
models based on review of SESCO documents and employee interviews, and
investigating contribution actions against other PRPs.  Entergy Gulf States
Louisiana, Entergy Louisiana, and Entergy Texas have agreed to contribute to the
remediation of contaminated soil and groundwater at the site in a measure
proportionate to those companies' involvement at the site, while Entergy
Arkansas and Entergy New Orleans


Part I

Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy

likely
will pay de minimis amounts.  Current estimates, although preliminary and
variable depending on the level of third-party cost contributions, indicate that
Entergy's total share of remediation costs likely will be less than $1 million.
The TCEQ approved an Agreed Administrative Order on September 20, 2006, that
allows the implementation of a Remedial Investigation/Feasibility Study at the
SESCO site; with the ultimate disposition being a remedial action to remove
contaminants of concern.  TCEQ approved the Remedial Investigation
Work Plan in May 2007 and field sampling began in July 2007.

Entergy
Mississippi, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy New
Orleans, and Entergy Texas

The EPA
has notified Entergy Mississippi, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, Entergy Texas,
and Entergy New Orleans that the EPA believes those entities are PRPs concerning
contamination of an area known as "Devil's Swamp Lake" near the Port of Baton
Rouge, Louisiana.  The area allegedly was contaminated by the operations of
Rollins Environmental (LA), Inc, which operated a disposal facility to which
many companies contributed waste.  Documents provided by the EPA indicate
that Entergy Louisiana may also be a PRP.  Entergy continues to monitor
this developing situation.

Litigation

Entergy uses legal and appropriate
means to contest litigation threatened or filed against it, but certain states
in which Entergy operates have proven to be unusually litigious
environments.  Judges and juries in Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas
have demonstrated a willingness to grant large verdicts, including punitive
damages, to plaintiffs in personal injury, property damage, and business tort
cases.  The litigation environment in these states poses a significant
business risk to Entergy.

Ratepayer and Fuel Cost
Recovery Lawsuits

(Entergy Corporation, Entergy Arkansas,
Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, Entergy New Orleans, and Entergy
Texas)

Entergy
New Orleans Fuel Adjustment Clause Litigation

In April
1999, a group of ratepayers filed a complaint against Entergy New Orleans,
Entergy Corporation, Entergy Services, and Entergy Power in state court in
Orleans Parish purportedly on behalf of all Entergy New Orleans
ratepayers.  The plaintiffs seek treble damages for alleged injuries
arising from the defendants' alleged violations of Louisiana's antitrust laws in
connection with certain costs passed on to ratepayers in Entergy New Orleans'
fuel adjustment filings with the City Council.  In particular,
plaintiffs allege that Entergy New Orleans improperly included certain costs in
the calculation of fuel charges and that Entergy New Orleans imprudently
purchased high-cost fuel or energy from other Entergy
affiliates.  Plaintiffs allege that Entergy New Orleans and the other
defendant Entergy companies conspired to make these purchases to the detriment
of Entergy New Orleans' ratepayers and to the benefit of Entergy's shareholders,
in violation of Louisiana's antitrust laws.  Plaintiffs also seek to
recover interest and attorneys' fees.  Entergy filed exceptions to the
plaintiffs' allegations, asserting, among other things, that jurisdiction over
these issues rests with the City Council and the FERC.  In March 2004,
the plaintiffs supplemented and amended their petition.  If necessary,
at the appropriate time, Entergy will also raise its defenses to the antitrust
claims.  The suit in state court was stayed by stipulation of the
parties and order of the court pending review of the decision by the City
Council in the proceeding discussed in the next paragraph.

Plaintiffs
also filed a corresponding complaint with the City Council in order to initiate
a review by the City Council of the plaintiffs' allegations and to force
restitution to ratepayers of all costs they allege were improperly and
imprudently included in the fuel adjustment filings.  Testimony was
filed on behalf of the plaintiffs in this proceeding asserting, among other
things, that Entergy New Orleans and other defendants have engaged in fuel
procurement and power purchasing practices and included costs in Entergy New
Orleans' fuel adjustment that could have resulted in Entergy New Orleans
customers being overcharged by more than $100 million over a period of years.
Hearings were held in February and March 2002.  In February 2004, the
City Council approved a resolution that resulted in a refund to customers of
$11.3 million, including interest, during the months of June through September
2004.  In May 2005 the Civil District Court for the Parish of
Orleans affirmed the City Council resolution, finding no support for the
plaintiffs' claim that the refund amount should be higher.  In
June 2005, the plaintiffs appealed the Civil District Court decision to the
Louisiana Fourth Circuit Court of Appeal.  On February 25, 2008, the
Fourth Circuit Court of Appeal


Part I
Item 1

Entergy
Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy

issued a
decision affirming in part, and reversing in part, the Civil District Court's
decision.  Although the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeal did not reverse any
of the substantive findings and conclusions of the City Council or the Civil
District Court, the Fourth Circuit found that the amount of the refund was
arbitrary and capricious and increased the amount of the refund to $34.3
million.  Entergy New Orleans and the City Council filed with the Louisiana
Supreme Court seeking, among other things, review and reversal of the Fourth
Circuit decision.  In April 2009 the Louisiana Supreme Court reversed
the decision of the Louisiana Fourth Circuit Court of Appeal and reinstated the
decision of the Civil District Court.  In May 2009 the Louisiana
Supreme Court denied the plaintiffs' request for rehearing.  In
January 2010 the plaintiffs filed a motion to lift the stay and to supplement
and amend their state court petition.

In the Entergy New Orleans bankruptcy
proceeding, the named plaintiffs in the Entergy New Orleans fuel clause lawsuit,
together with the named plaintiffs in the Entergy New Orleans rate of return
lawsuit, filed a Complaint for Declaratory Judgment asking the court to declare
that Entergy New Orleans, Entergy Corporation, and Entergy Services are a single
business enterprise, and, as such, are liable in solido with Entergy New Orleans
for any claims asserted in the Entergy New Orleans fuel adjustment clause
lawsuit and the Entergy New Orleans rate of return lawsuit, and, alternatively,
that the automatic stay be lifted to permit the movants to pursue the same
relief in state court.  The bankruptcy court dismissed the action on April
26, 2006.  The matter was appealed to the U.S. District Court for the
Eastern District of Louisiana, and the district court affirmed the dismissal in
October 2006, but on different grounds, concluding that the lawsuit was
premature.  In Entergy New Orleans' plan of reorganization that was
confirmed by the bankruptcy court in May 2007, the plaintiffs' claims are
treated as unimpaired "Litigation Claims," which will "ride through" the
bankruptcy proceeding, with any legal, equitable and contractual rights to which
the plaintiffs' Litigation Claim entitles the plaintiffs unaltered by the plan
of reorganization.

Entergy
New Orleans Rate of Return Lawsuit

In April 1998, a group of residential
and business ratepayers filed a complaint against Entergy New Orleans in state
court in Orleans Parish purportedly on behalf of all ratepayers in New
Orleans.  The plaintiffs allege that Entergy New Orleans overcharged
ratepayers by at least $300 million since 1975 in violation of limits on Entergy
New Orleans' rate of return that the plaintiffs allege were established by
ordinances passed by the City Council in 1922.  The plaintiffs seek,
among other things, (i) a declaratory judgment that such franchise ordinances
have been violated; and (ii) a remand to the City Council for the establishment
of the amount of overcharges plus interest.  Entergy New Orleans
believes the lawsuit is without merit.  Entergy New Orleans has
charged only those rates authorized by the City Council in accordance with
applicable law.  In May 2000, a court of appeal granted Entergy New
Orleans' exception to jurisdiction in the case and dismissed the
proceeding.  The Louisiana Supreme Court denied the plaintiffs'
request for a writ of certiorari.

The
plaintiffs then commenced a similar proceeding before the City
Council.  The plaintiffs and the advisors for the Council each filed
their first round of testimony in January 2002.  In their testimony,
the plaintiffs allege that Entergy New Orleans earned in excess of the legally
authorized rate of return during the period 1979 to 2000 and that Entergy New
Orleans should be required to refund between $240 million and $825 million to
its ratepayers.  In the testimony submitted by the Council advisors,
the advisors allege that Entergy New Orleans has not earned in excess of its
authorized rate of return for the period at issue and that no refund is
therefore warranted.

In December 2003, the Council advisors
filed a motion in the City Council proceedings to bifurcate the hearing in this
matter, such that the effect of the provision of the 1922 Ordinance in setting
lawful rates would be considered first.  Only if it is determined that
this provision establishes a limitation would the remaining issues be reached.
The motion to bifurcate was granted by the City Council in April 2004, and a
hearing on the first part of the bifurcated proceeding was completed in June
2005.  After the submission of briefs and oral argument in April 2006,
the City Council dismissed with prejudice the plaintiffs' claims on multiple
grounds.  In May 2006, the plaintiffs appealed the City Council's
decision, and the plaintiffs' appeal is currently pending in Civil District
Court for the Parish of Orleans.  Entergy New Orleans also appealed,
separately, certain evidentiary rulings included in the City Council's
decision.  These matters were consolidated and oral argument on these
appeals took place before the Civil District Court in August 2008.

Additionally,
in the Entergy New Orleans bankruptcy proceeding, the named plaintiffs in the

in the Entergy New Orleans fuel adjustment clause lawsuit, filed a Complaint for
Declaratory Judgment asking the court to declare that Entergy New Orleans,
Entergy Corporation, and Entergy Services are a single business enterprise, and,
as such, are liable in solido with Entergy New Orleans for any claims asserted
in the Entergy New Orleans rate of return lawsuit and the Entergy New Orleans
fuel adjustment clause lawsuit, and, alternatively, that the automatic stay be
lifted to permit the movants to pursue the same relief in state court.  The
bankruptcy court dismissed the action on April 26, 2006.  The matter
was appealed to the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana,
and the district court affirmed the dismissal in October 2006, but on different
grounds, concluding that the lawsuit was premature.  In Entergy New

which will "ride through" the bankruptcy proceeding, with any legal, equitable
and contractual rights to which the plaintiffs' Litigation Claim entitles the
plaintiffs unaltered by the plan of reorganization.

Texas
Power Price Lawsuit

In August
2003, a lawsuit was filed in the district court of Chambers County, Texas by
Texas residents on behalf of a purported class apparently of the Texas retail
customers of Entergy Gulf States, Inc. who were billed and paid for electric
power from January 1, 1994 to the present.  The named defendants
include Entergy Corporation, Entergy Services, Entergy Power, Entergy Power
Marketing Corp., and Entergy Arkansas.  Entergy Gulf States, Inc. was
not a named defendant, but is alleged to be a co-conspirator.  The
court granted the request of Entergy Gulf States, Inc. to intervene in the
lawsuit to protect its interests.

Plaintiffs
allege that the defendants implemented a "price gouging accounting scheme" to
sell to plaintiffs and similarly situated utility customers higher priced power
generated by the defendants while rejecting and/or reselling to off-system
utilities less expensive power offered and/or purchased from off-system
suppliers and/or generated by the Entergy system.  In particular,
plaintiffs allege that the defendants manipulated and continue to manipulate the
dispatch of generation so that power is purchased from affiliated expensive
resources instead of buying cheaper off-system power.

Plaintiffs
stated in their pleadings that customers in Texas were charged at least $57
million above prevailing market prices for power.  Plaintiffs seek
actual, consequential and exemplary damages, costs and attorneys' fees, and
disgorgement of profits.  The plaintiffs' experts have tendered a
report calculating damages in a large range, from $153 million to $972 million
in present value, under various scenarios.  The Entergy defendants
have tendered expert reports challenging the assumptions, methodologies, and
conclusions of the plaintiffs' expert reports.

The case
is pending in state district court, and the court has not set a date for a class
certification hearing.

Mississippi
Attorney General Complaint

The
Mississippi attorney general filed a complaint in state court in December 2008
against Entergy Corporation, Entergy Mississippi, Entergy Services, and Entergy
Power alleging, among other things, violations of Mississippi statutes, fraud,
and breach of good faith and fair dealing, and requesting an accounting and
restitution.  The litigation is wide ranging and relates to tariffs
and procedures under which Entergy Mississippi purchases power not generated in
Mississippi to meet electricity demand.  Entergy believes the
complaint is unfounded.  On December 29, 2008, the defendant Entergy
companies filed to remove the attorney general's suit to U.S. District Court
(the forum that Entergy believes is appropriate to resolve the types of federal
issues raised in the suit), where it is currently pending, and additionally
answered the complaint and filed a counter-claim for relief based upon the
Mississippi Public Utilities Act and the Federal Power Act.  The
Mississippi attorney general has filed a pleading seeking to remand the matter
to state court.  In May 2009, the defendant Entergy companies filed a
motion for judgment on the pleadings asserting grounds of federal preemption,
the exclusive jurisdiction of the MPSC, and factual errors in the attorney
general's complaint.

Several
property owners have filed a class action suit against Entergy Louisiana,
Entergy Services, ETHC, and Entergy Technology Company in state court in St.
James Parish, Louisiana purportedly on behalf of all property owners in
Louisiana who have conveyed easements to the defendants.  The lawsuit
alleges that Entergy installed fiber optic cable across the plaintiffs' property
without obtaining appropriate easements.  The plaintiffs seek damages
equal to the fair market value of the surplus fiber optic cable capacity,
including a share of the profits made through use of the fiber optic cables, and
punitive damages.  Entergy removed the case to federal court in New
Orleans; however, the district court remanded the case back to state
court.  In February 2004, the state court entered an order certifying
this matter as a class action.  Entergy's appeals of this ruling were
denied.  The parties have entered into a term sheet establishing basic
terms for a settlement that must be approved by the court.

Numerous lawsuits have been filed in
federal and state courts primarily in Texas and Louisiana, primarily by
contractor employees who worked in the 1940-1980s timeframe, against Entergy
Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy Texas, and to a lesser extent the other
Utility operating companies, as premises owners of power plants, for damages
caused by alleged exposure to asbestos.  Many other defendants are
named in these lawsuits as well.  Currently, there are approximately
500 lawsuits involving approximately 5,000 claimants.  Management
believes that adequate provisions have been established to cover any
exposure.  Additionally, negotiations continue with insurers to
recover reimbursements.  Management believes that loss exposure has
been and will continue to be handled so that the ultimate resolution of these
matters will not be material, in the aggregate, to the financial position or
results of operation of the Utility operating companies.
