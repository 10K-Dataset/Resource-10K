ENTERGY’S BUSINESS

Entergy is an integrated energy company engaged primarily in electric power production and retail electric distribution operations.  Entergy owns and operates power plants with approximately 30,000 MW of aggregate electric generating capacity, including over 10,000 MW of nuclear-fueled capacity.  Entergy’s Utility business delivers electricity to 2.8 million utility customers in Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas.  Entergy generated annual revenues of $11.2 billion in 2011 and had approximately 15,000 employees as of December 31, 2011.

Entergy operates primarily through two business segments: Utility and Entergy Wholesale Commodities.

·

The

Utility

business segment includes the generation, transmission, distribution, and sale of electric power in portions of Arkansas, Mississippi, Texas, and Louisiana, including the City of New Orleans; and operates a small natural gas distribution business.  As discussed in more detail in “

Plan to Spin Off the Utility’s Transmission Business

” section of Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis in December 2011, Entergy entered into an agreement to spin off its transmission business and merge it with a newly-formed subsidiary of ITC Holdings Corp.

·

The

Entergy Wholesale Commodities

business segment includes the ownership and operation of six nuclear power plants located in the northern United States and the sale of the electric power produced by those plants to wholesale customers.  This business also provides services to other nuclear power plant owners.  Entergy Wholesale Commodities also owns interests in non-nuclear power plants that sell the electric power produced by those plants to wholesale customers.

See Note 13 to the financial statements for financial information regarding Entergy’s business segments.

Strategy

Entergy aspires to achieve industry-leading total shareholder returns in an environmentally responsible fashion by leveraging the scale and expertise inherent in its core nuclear and utility operations.  Entergy’s current scope includes electricity generation, transmission and distribution as well as natural gas transportation and distribution.  Entergy focuses on operational excellence with an emphasis on safety, reliability, customer service, sustainability, cost efficiency, and risk management.  Entergy also focuses on portfolio management to make periodic buy, build, hold, or sell decisions based upon its analytically-derived points of view, which are updated as market conditions evolve.

Utility

The Utility business segment includes six wholly-owned retail electric utility subsidiaries: Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, Entergy New Orleans, and Entergy Texas.  These companies generate, transmit, distribute and sell electric power to retail and wholesale customers in Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas.  Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy New Orleans also provide natural gas utility services to customers in and around Baton Rouge, Louisiana, and New Orleans, Louisiana, respectively.  Also included in the Utility is System Energy, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Entergy Corporation that owns or leases 90 percent of Grand Gulf.  System Energy sells its power and capacity from Grand Gulf at wholesale to Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, and Entergy New Orleans.

The six retail utility subsidiaries are each regulated by the FERC and by state utility commissions, or, in the case of Entergy New Orleans, the City Council.  System Energy is regulated by the FERC because all of its transactions are at wholesale.  The Utility continues to operate as a rate-regulated business as efforts toward deregulation have been abandoned or have not been initiated in its service territories.  The overall generation portfolio of the Utility, which relies heavily on natural gas and nuclear generation, is consistent with Entergy’s strong support for the environment.

Retail Rate Regulation

General

(Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, Entergy New Orleans, and Entergy Texas)

Each Utility operating company regularly participates in retail rate proceedings.  The status of material retail rate proceedings is described in Note 2 to the financial statements.  Certain aspects of the Utility operating companies’ retail rate mechanisms are discussed below.

Entergy Arkansas

Fuel and Purchased Power Cost Recovery

Entergy Arkansas’s rate schedules include an energy cost recovery rider to recover fuel and purchased energy costs in monthly bills.  The rider utilizes prior calendar year energy costs and projected energy sales for the twelve-month period commencing on April 1 of each year to develop an energy cost rate, which is redetermined annually and includes a true-up adjustment reflecting the over-recovery or under-recovery, including carrying charges, of the energy cost for the prior calendar year.  The energy cost recovery rider tariff also allows an interim rate request depending upon the level of over- or under-recovery of fuel and purchased energy costs.  In December 2007, the APSC issued an order stating that Entergy Arkansas’s energy cost recovery rider will remain in effect, and any future termination of the rider would be subject to eighteen months advance notice by the APSC, which would occur following notice and hearing.





Storm Cost Recovery

See Note 2 to the financial statements for a discussion of proceedings regarding recovery of Entergy Arkansas’s storm restoration costs.

Entergy Gulf States Louisiana

Fuel Recovery

Entergy Gulf States Louisiana’s electric rates include a fuel adjustment clause designed to recover the cost of fuel and purchased power costs.  The fuel adjustment clause contains a surcharge or credit for deferred fuel expense and related carrying charges arising from the monthly reconciliation of actual fuel costs incurred with fuel cost revenues billed to customers, including carrying charges.

To help stabilize electricity costs, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana received approval from the LPSC to hedge its exposure to natural gas price volatility through the use of financial instruments.  Entergy Gulf States Louisiana hedges approximately one-third of the projected exposure to natural gas price changes for the gas used to serve its native electric load for all months of the year.  The hedge quantity is reviewed on an annual basis.

Entergy Gulf States Louisiana’s gas rates include a purchased gas adjustment clause based on estimated gas costs for the billing month adjusted by a surcharge or credit that arises from an annual reconciliation of fuel costs incurred with fuel cost revenues billed to customers, including carrying charges.

To help stabilize retail gas costs, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana received approval from the LPSC to hedge its exposure to natural gas price volatility for its gas purchased for resale through the use of financial instruments.  Entergy Gulf States Louisiana hedges approximately one-half of the projected natural gas volumes used to serve its natural gas customers for November through March.  The hedge quantity is reviewed on an annual basis.

Storm Cost Recovery

See Note 2 to the financial statements for a discussion of Entergy Gulf States Louisiana’s filings to recover storm-related costs.

Entergy Louisiana

Fuel Recovery

Entergy Louisiana’s rate schedules include a fuel adjustment clause designed to recover the cost of fuel and purchased power costs.  The fuel adjustment clause contains a surcharge or credit for deferred fuel expense and related carrying charges arising from the monthly reconciliation of actual fuel costs incurred with fuel cost revenues billed to customers, including carrying charges.

In the Delaney vs. Entergy Louisiana proceeding, the LPSC ordered Entergy Louisiana, beginning with the May 2000 fuel adjustment clause filing, to re-price costs flowed through its fuel adjustment clause related to the Evangeline gas contract so that the price included for fuel adjustment clause recovery shall thereafter be at the rate of the Henry Hub first of the month cash market price (as reported by the publication

Inside FERC

) plus $0.24 per mmBtu for the month for which the fuel adjustment clause is calculated, irrespective of the actual cost for the Evangeline contract quantity reflected in that month’s fuel adjustment clause.  The Evangeline gas contract expires on January 1, 2013.

To help stabilize electricity costs, Entergy Louisiana received approval from the LPSC in 2001 to hedge its exposure to natural gas price volatility through the use of financial instruments.  Entergy Louisiana hedges approximately one-third of the projected exposure to natural gas price changes for the gas used to serve its native electric load for all months of the year.  The hedge quantity is reviewed on an annual basis.





In September 2002, Entergy Louisiana settled a proceeding that concerned a contract entered into by Entergy Louisiana to purchase, through 2031, energy generated by a hydroelectric facility known as the Vidalia project.  In the settlement, the LPSC approved Entergy Louisiana’s proposed treatment of the regulatory effect of the benefit from a tax accounting election related to that project.  In general, the settlement permitted Entergy Louisiana to keep a portion of the tax benefit in exchange for bearing the risk associated with sustaining the tax treatment.  See Note 8 to the financial statements for additional discussion of the obligations related to the Vidalia project and the sharing of tax benefits with customers.

Storm Cost Recovery

See Note 2 to the financial statements for a discussion of Entergy Louisiana’s filings to recover storm-related costs.

Entergy Mississippi

Fuel Recovery

Entergy Mississippi’s rate schedules include energy cost recovery riders to recover fuel and purchased energy costs.  The rider utilizes projected energy costs filed quarterly by Entergy Mississippi to develop an energy cost rate.  The energy cost rate is redetermined each calendar quarter and includes a true-up adjustment reflecting the over-recovery or under-recovery of the energy cost as of the second quarter preceding the redetermination.  Entergy Mississippi’s fuel cost recoveries are subject to annual audits conducted pursuant to the authority of the MPSC.

Power Management Rider

The MPSC approved the purchase of the Attala power plant in November 2005.  In December 2005, the MPSC issued an order approving the investment cost recovery through its power management rider and limited the recovery to a period that begins with the closing date of the purchase and ends the earlier of the date costs are incorporated into base rates or December 31, 2006.  As a consequence of the events surrounding Entergy Mississippi’s ongoing efforts to recover storm restoration costs associated with Hurricane Katrina, in October 2006, the MPSC approved a revision to Entergy Mississippi’s power management rider.  The revision has the effect of allowing Entergy Mississippi to recover the annual ownership costs of the Attala plant until such time as a general rate case is filed.

To help stabilize electricity costs, Entergy Mississippi received approval from the MPSC to hedge its exposure to natural gas price volatility through the use of financial instruments.  Entergy Mississippi hedges approximately one-half of the projected exposure to natural gas price changes for the gas used to serve its native electric load for all months of the year.  The hedge quantity is reviewed on an annual basis.

Storm Cost Recovery

Entergy Mississippi maintains a storm damage reserve pursuant to orders of the MPSC and consistent with the regulatory accounting requirements.  Entergy Mississippi's storm damage reserve is funded through its storm damage rider schedule.  In August 2011, Entergy Mississippi filed with the MPSC a notice of its intent to revise the storm damage rider schedule to recover over a 36-month period approximately $30 million and to increase the level of monthly accruals to the storm damage reserve from the current level of $750,000 per month to $1.75 million per month, and to increase the current level of the storm reserve cap during which funds will accrue from $15 million to $25 million.  The cap is the level of the storm reserve balance at which monthly accruals would temporarily cease.  The amounts of the monthly accruals and the cap have not been revised since 2001 and the current amounts do not reflect the costs of current storm restoration activities.  Consideration of Entergy Mississippi’s notice is pending.





Entergy New Orleans

Fuel Recovery

Entergy New Orleans’s electric rate schedules include a fuel adjustment tariff designed to reflect no more than targeted fuel and purchased power costs, adjusted by a surcharge or credit for deferred fuel expense arising from the monthly reconciliation of actual fuel and purchased power costs incurred with fuel cost revenues billed to customers, including carrying charges.

Entergy New Orleans’s gas rate schedules include a purchased gas adjustment to reflect estimated gas costs for the billing month, adjusted by a surcharge or credit similar to that included in the electric fuel adjustment clause, including carrying charges.  In October 2005, the City Council approved modification of the current gas cost collection mechanism effective November 2005 in order to address concerns regarding its fluctuations, particularly during the winter heating season.  The modifications are intended to minimize fluctuations in gas rates during the winter months.

To help stabilize retail gas costs, Entergy New Orleans received approval from the City Council to hedge its exposure to natural gas price volatility for its gas purchased for resale through the use of financial instruments.  Entergy New Orleans hedges approximately one-half of the projected natural gas volumes used to serve its natural gas customers for November through March.  The hedge quantity is reviewed on an annual basis.

Storm Cost Recovery

See Note 2 to the financial statements for a discussion of Entergy New Orleans’s efforts to recover storm-related costs.

Entergy Texas

Fuel Recovery

Entergy Texas’s rate schedules include a fixed fuel factor to recover fuel and purchased power costs, including carrying charges, that are not included in base rates.  Semi-annual revisions of the fixed fuel factor are made in March and September based on the market price of natural gas and changes in fuel mix.  The amounts collected under Entergy Texas’s fixed fuel factor and any interim surcharge or refund are subject to fuel reconciliation proceedings before the PUCT.  The PUCT fuel cost reviews are discussed in Note 2 to the financial statements.

Storm Cost Recovery

See Note 2 to the financial statements for a discussion of proceedings regarding recovery of Entergy Texas’s storm restoration costs.

Electric Industry Restructuring

In June 2009, a law was enacted in Texas that requires Entergy Texas to cease all activities relating to Entergy Texas’s transition to competition.  The law allows Entergy Texas to remain a part of the SERC Region, although it does not prevent Entergy Texas from joining another power region.  The law provides that proceedings to certify a power region that Entergy Texas belongs to as a qualified power region can be initiated by the PUCT, or on motion by another party, when the conditions supporting such a proceeding exist.  Under the new law, the PUCT may not approve a transition to competition plan for Entergy Texas until the expiration of four years from the PUCT’s certification of Entergy Texas’s power region.  In response to the new law, Entergy Texas in June 2009 gave notice to the PUCT of the withdrawal of its previously filed transition to competition plan, and requested that its transition to competition proceeding be dismissed.  In July 2009 the ALJ dismissed the proceeding.





The new law also contains provisions that allow Entergy Texas take advantage of a cost recovery mechanism that permits annual filings for the recovery of reasonable and necessary expenditures for transmission infrastructure improvement and changes in wholesale transmission charges.  This mechanism was previously available to other non-ERCOT Texas utility companies, but not to Entergy Texas.

I

n September 2011, the PUCT adopted a proposed rule implementing a Distribution Cost Recovery Factor to recover capital and capital-related costs related to distribution infrastructure.  The Distribution Cost Recovery Factor permits utilities once per year to implement an increase in rates above amounts reflected in base rates to reflect depreciation expense, federal income tax and other taxes, and return on investment.  The Distribution Cost Recovery Factor rider may be changed a maximum of four times between base rate cases, and expires in January 2017, unless otherwise extended by the Texas Legislature.

The new law further amends already existing law that had required Entergy Texas to propose for PUCT approval a tariff to allow eligible customers the ability to contract for competitive generation.  The amending language in the new law provides, among other things, that:  1) the tariff shall not be implemented in a manner that harms the sustainability or competitiveness of manufacturers who choose not to participate in the tariff; 2) Entergy Texas shall “purchase competitive generation service, selected by the customer, and provide the generation at retail to the customer”; and 3)  Entergy Texas shall provide and price transmission service and ancillary services under that tariff at a rate that is unbundled from its cost of service.    The new law directs that the PUCT may not issue an order on the tariff that is contrary to an applicable decision, rule, or policy statement of a federal regulatory agency having jurisdiction.

Entergy Texas and the other parties to the PUCT proceeding to determine the design of the competitive generation tariff were involved in negotiations throughout 2011 with the objective of resolving as many disputed issues as possible regarding the tariff.  While these negotiations remain pending, the PUCT has directed the parties to file testimony allowing it to consider and resolve certain threshold issues related to the design of the program, including:  1) the definition and calculation of any cost unrecovered by Entergy Texas as a result of the tariff; 2) who should be eligible to take service under the tariff; and 3) what ratepayers should be responsible for paying any unrecovered costs experienced by Entergy Texas.  Testimony addressing these issues has been submitted and a hearing is scheduled for April 2012.

Franchises

Entergy Arkansas holds exclusive franchises to provide electric service in approximately 307 incorporated cities and towns in Arkansas.  These franchises are unlimited in duration and continue unless the municipalities purchase the utility property.  In Arkansas, franchises are considered to be contracts and, therefore, are terminable pursuant to the terms of the franchise agreement and applicable statutes.

Entergy Gulf States Louisiana holds non-exclusive franchises to provide electric service in approximately 56 incorporated municipalities and the unincorporated areas of approximately 18 parishes, and to provide gas service in the City of Baton Rouge and the unincorporated areas of two parishes.  Most of Entergy Gulf States Louisiana’s franchises have a term of 60 years.  Entergy Gulf States Louisiana’s current electric franchises expire during 2015-2046.

Entergy Louisiana holds non-exclusive franchises to provide electric service in approximately 116 incorporated Louisiana municipalities.  Most of these franchises have 25-year terms.  Entergy Louisiana also supplies electric service in approximately 45 Louisiana parishes in which it holds non-exclusive franchises.  Entergy Louisiana’s electric franchises expire during 2015-2036.

Entergy Mississippi has received from the MPSC certificates of public convenience and necessity to provide electric service to areas within 45 counties, including a number of municipalities, in western Mississippi.  Under Mississippi statutory law, such certificates are exclusive.  Entergy Mississippi may continue to serve in such municipalities upon payment of a statutory franchise fee, regardless of whether an original municipal franchise is still in existence.





Entergy New Orleans provides electric and gas service in the City of New Orleans pursuant to indeterminate permits set forth in city ordinances (except electric service in Algiers, which is provided by Entergy Louisiana).  These ordinances contain a continuing option for the City of New Orleans to purchase Entergy New Orleans’s electric and gas utility properties.

Entergy Texas holds a certificate of convenience and necessity from the PUCT to provide electric service to areas within approximately 27 counties in eastern Texas, and holds non-exclusive franchises to provide electric service in approximately 68 incorporated municipalities.  Entergy Texas was typically granted 50-year franchises, but recently has been receiving 25-year franchises.  Entergy Texas’s electric franchises expire during 2013-2058.

The business of System Energy is limited to wholesale power sales.  It has no distribution franchises.

“Owned and Leased Capability” is the dependable load carrying capability as demonstrated under actual operating conditions based on the primary fuel (assuming no curtailments) that each station was designed to utilize.

The Entergy System's load and capacity projections are reviewed periodically to assess the need and timing for additional generating capacity and interconnections.  These reviews consider existing and projected demand, the availability and price of power, the location of new load, and the economy.  Summer peak load in the Entergy System service territory has averaged 21,246 MW from 2002-2011.  In the 2002 time period, the Entergy System's long-term capacity resources, allowing for an adequate reserve margin, were approximately 3,000 MW less than the total capacity required for peak period demands.  In this time period the Entergy System met its capacity shortages almost entirely through short-term power purchases in the wholesale spot market.  In the fall of 2002, the Entergy System began a program to add new resources to its existing generation portfolio and began a process of issuing requests for proposals (RFP) to procure supply-side resources from sources other than the spot market to meet the unique regional needs of the Utility operating companies.  The Entergy System has adopted a long-term resource strategy that calls for the bulk of capacity needs to be met through long-term resources, whether owned or contracted.  Entergy refers to this strategy as the "Portfolio Transformation Strategy".  Over the past nine years, Portfolio Transformation has resulted in the addition of about 4,500 MW of new long-term resources.  These figures do not include transactions currently pending as a result of the Summer 2009 RFP.  When the Summer 2009 RFP transactions are included in





the Entergy System portfolio of long-term resources and adjusting for unit deactivations of older generation, the Entergy System is approximately 500 MW short of its projected 2012 peak load plus reserve margin.  This remaining need is expected to be met through a nuclear uprate at Grand Gulf and limited-term resources.  The Entergy System will continue to access the spot power market to economically purchase energy in order to minimize customer cost.  In addition, Entergy considers in its planning processes the notices from Entergy Arkansas and Entergy Mississippi regarding their future withdrawal from the System Agreement.  Furthermore, as with other transmission systems, there are certain times during which congestion occurs on the Utility operating companies' transmission system that limits the ability of the Utility operating companies as well as other parties to fully utilize the generating resources that have been granted transmission service.

RFP Procurements

The RFPs issued by the Entergy System since the fall of 2002 have sought resources needed to meet near-term summer reliability requirements as well as longer-term resources through a broad range of wholesale power products, including limited-term (1 to 3 years) and long-term contractual products and asset acquisitions.  Detailed evaluation processes have been developed to analyze submitted proposals, and, with the exception of the January 2008 RFP and the 2008 Western Region RFP, each RFP has been overseen by an independent monitor.  The following table illustrates the results of the RFP process for resources acquired since the Fall 2002 RFP.  The contracts below were primarily with non-affiliated suppliers, with the exception of contracts with EWO Marketing for the sale of 185 MW to 206 MW from the RS Cogen plant and contracts with Entergy Power for the sale of approximately 100 MW from the Independence plant.

Entergy Louisiana and Entergy New Orleans currently purchase, pursuant to ten-year purchased power agreements that expire in 2013, 121 MW of capacity and energy from Entergy Power sourced from Independence Steam Electric Station Unit 2.  The transaction, which originated from the Fall 2002 RFP, included an option for Entergy Louisiana and Entergy New Orleans to acquire an ownership interest in the unit for a total price of $80 million, subject to various adjustments.  In March 2008, Entergy Louisiana and Entergy New Orleans provided notice of their intent to exercise the option.  Entergy Louisiana and Entergy New Orleans continue to evaluate the economics of proceeding with this option.  Based upon changes in the long-term economics of the resource relative to current options, in August 2011, Entergy Louisiana made a filing with the LPSC seeking relief from the prior directive to exercise the option to purchase an ownership interest in the Independence unit.  The LPSC staff filed testimony suggesting that the option should be exercised but noting that this is largely a policy decision for the LPSC.

In June 2011, Entergy Louisiana filed with the LPSC an application seeking certification that the public necessity and convenience would be served by Entergy Louisiana’s construction of a nominally-sized 550 MW combined-cycle gas turbine generating facility (Ninemile 6) at its existing Ninemile Point electric generating station that was selected in the Summer 2009 Long-Term RFP.  For additional discussion of the Ninemile 6 project see

Capital Expenditure Plans and Other uses of Capital

in Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Management’s Discussion and Analysis.

In December 2010, on behalf of Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Services issued the 2010 RFP for Long-Term Renewable Energy Resources seeking up to 233 MW of renewable generation resources to meet the requirements of an LPSC general order issued in December 2010.  In November 2011, Entergy Services selected five resources for a total of 143 MW for the primary selection list and two additional proposals, representing 103 MW for the secondary selection list.  The seven proposals collectively represent a mixture of as-available and baseload products, technologies, and geographic locations.

In June 2011, on behalf of Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Services issued the 2011 RFP for Transition Plan Resources.  The RFP sought up to 750 MW of flexible generation resources through one or more purchased power agreements to address Entergy Arkansas’s requirements for its 2014-2016 time frame.  Entergy Arkansas concluded its review and evaluation of the proposals submitted in response to the RFP in November 2011 and selected two proposals totaling approximately 795 MW for negotiation of definitive agreements.





In December 2011, on behalf of Entergy Texas, Entergy Services issued the 2011 Western Region RFP for Long-Term Supply Side Resources.  This RFP is seeking approximately 300 MW of baseload or flexible capacity, energy, and other electric products to meet the long-term reliability needs of the Western Region beginning in 2017.  This RFP includes a self-build option at Entergy Texas’s Lewis Creek site.

Other Procurements From Third Parties

The above table does not include resource acquisitions made outside of the RFP process, including Entergy Mississippi's January 2006 acquisition of the 480 MW, combined-cycle, gas-fired Attala power plant; Entergy Gulf States Louisiana's March 2008 acquisition of the 322 MW, simple-cycle, gas-fired Calcasieu Generating Facility; and Entergy Louisiana’s April 2011 acquisition of the 580 MW, combined-cycle, gas-fired Acadia Energy Center Unit 2.  The above table also does not reflect various limited- and long-term contracts that have been entered into in recent years by the Utility operating companies as a result of bilateral negotiations.

Interconnections

The Entergy System's generating units are interconnected by a transmission system operating at various voltages up to 500 kV.  These generating units consist primarily of steam-electric production facilities and are centrally dispatched and operated.  Entergy's Utility operating companies are interconnected with many neighboring utilities.  In addition, the Utility operating companies are members of the SERC Reliability Corporation.  The primary purpose of SERC is to ensure the reliability and adequacy of the electric bulk power supply in the southeast region of the United States.  SERC is a member of the North American Electric Reliability Corporation.

Gas Property

As of December 31, 2011, Entergy New Orleans distributed and transported natural gas for distribution within Algiers and New Orleans, Louisiana, through 2,500 miles of gas pipeline.  As of December 31, 2011, the gas properties of Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, which are located in and around Baton Rouge, Louisiana, were not material to Entergy Gulf States Louisiana's financial position.

Title

The Entergy System's generating stations are generally located on properties owned in fee simple.  Most of the substations and transmission and distribution lines are constructed on private property or public rights-of-way pursuant to easements, servitudes, or appropriate franchises.  Some substation properties are owned in fee simple.  The Utility operating companies generally have the right of eminent domain, whereby they may perfect title to, or secure easements or servitudes on, private property for their utility operations.

Substantially all of the physical properties and assets owned by Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, Entergy New Orleans, Entergy Texas, and System Energy are subject to the liens of mortgages securing bonds issued by those companies.  The Lewis Creek generating station is owned by GSG&T, Inc., a subsidiary of Entergy Texas, and is not subject to its mortgage lien.  Lewis Creek is leased to and operated by Entergy Texas.

Hydroelectric power provided less than 1% of Entergy Arkansas’s generation in 2011 and is expected to provide less than 1% of its generation in 2012.

(b)

Capacity and energy from System Energy’s interest in Grand Gulf is allocated as follows under the Unit Power Sales Agreement: Entergy Arkansas - 36%; Entergy Louisiana - 14%; Entergy Mississippi - 33%; and Entergy New Orleans - 17%.  Pursuant to purchased power agreements, Entergy Arkansas is selling a portion of its owned capacity and energy from Grand Gulf to Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, and Entergy New Orleans.

Some of the Utility’s gas-fired plants are capable of also using fuel oil, if necessary.  Although based on current economics the Utility does not expect fuel oil use in 2012, it is possible that various operational events including weather or pipeline maintenance may require the use of fuel oil.

Natural Gas

The Utility operating companies have long-term firm and short-term interruptible gas contracts for both supply and transportation.  Long-term firm contracts for power plants comprise less than 25% of the Utility operating companies' total requirements.  Short-term contracts and spot-market purchases satisfy additional gas requirements.  Entergy Texas owns a gas storage facility that provides reliable and flexible natural gas service to certain generating stations.

Entergy Louisiana has a long-term natural gas supply contract, which expires January 1, 2013, in which Entergy Louisiana agreed to purchase natural gas in annual amounts equal to approximately one-third of its projected annual fuel requirements for certain generating units.  Annual demand charges associated with this contract are estimated to be $6.6 million.  Entergy Louisiana conducted an RFP to obtain a replacement supplier for this contract and is in negotiations with the prevailing bidder.





Many factors, including wellhead deliverability, storage and pipeline capacity, and demand requirements of end users, influence the availability and price of natural gas supplies for power plants.  Demand is tied to weather conditions as well as to the prices and availability of other energy sources.  Pursuant to federal and state regulations, gas supplies to power plants may be interrupted during periods of shortage.  To the extent natural gas supplies are disrupted or natural gas prices significantly increase, the Utility operating companies will use alternate fuels, such as oil, or rely to a larger extent on coal, nuclear generation, and purchased power.

Coal

Entergy Arkansas has committed to four one- to three-year contracts that will supply approximately 90% of the total coal supply needs in 2012.  These contracts are staggered in term so that not all contracts have to be renewed the same year.  The remaining 10% of total coal requirements will be satisfied by contracts with a term of less than one year.  Based on greater Powder River Basin (PRB) coal deliveries and the high cost of foreign coal, no alternative coal consumption is expected at Entergy Arkansas during 2012.  Entergy Arkansas has an existing long-term railroad transportation contract that will provide up to approximately 85% of Entergy Arkansas’s coal transportation requirements for 2012.  An RFP for Entergy Arkansas’ open rail transportation position was issued in 2011 and a definitive agreement is expected by mid-2012.

Entergy Gulf States Louisiana has executed three one- to three-year contracts that will supply approximately 90% of Nelson Unit 6 coal needs in 2012.  Additional PRB coal will be purchased through contracts with a term of less than one year to provide the remaining supply needs.  For the same reasons as for Entergy Arkansas’s plants, no alternative coal consumption is expected at Nelson Unit 6 during 2012.  Coal will be transported to Nelson via a new transportation agreement beginning January 1, 2012 that will provide approximately 90% to 100% of rail transportation requirements for 2012.

For the year 2011, coal transportation delivery to Entergy Arkansas operated coal-fired units met coal demand at the plants and it is expected that delivery times experienced in 2010 and 2011 will continue through 2012.  In the fourth quarter 2011, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana experienced significant delivery shortfalls as the result of flood-related disruptions on the BNSF Railway.  Inventory levels recovered by year end and improved transportation times are expected under the new transportation agreement beginning in 2012.  Both Entergy Arkansas and Entergy Gulf States Louisiana control a sufficient number of railcars to satisfy the rail transportation requirement.

The operator of Big Cajun 2 - Unit 3, Louisiana Generating, LLC, has advised Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy Texas that it has adequate rail car and barge capacity to meet the volumes of low-sulfur PRB coal requested for 2012.  Entergy Gulf States Louisiana’s and Entergy Texas’s coal nomination requests to Big Cajun 2 - Unit 3 are made on an annual basis.

Nuclear Fuel

The nuclear fuel cycle consists of the following:

·

mining and milling of uranium ore to produce a concentrate;

·

conversion of the concentrate to uranium hexafluoride gas;

·

enrichment of the uranium hexafluoride gas;

·

fabrication of nuclear fuel assemblies for use in fueling nuclear reactors; and

·

disposal of spent fuel.

The Registrant Subsidiaries that own nuclear plants (Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, Entergy Louisiana, and System Energy), are responsible through a shared regulated uranium pool for contracts to acquire nuclear material to be used in fueling Entergy's Utility nuclear units.  These companies own the materials and services in this shared regulated uranium pool on a pro rata fractional basis determined by the nuclear generation capability of each company.  Any liabilities for obligations of the pooled contracts are on a several but not joint basis.  The shared regulated uranium pool maintains inventories of nuclear materials during the various stages of





processing.  The Registrant Subsidiaries purchase enriched uranium hexafluoride for their nuclear plant reload requirements at the average inventory cost from the shared regulated uranium pool.  Entergy Operations Inc. contracts separately for the fabrication of nuclear fuel as agent on behalf of each of the Registrant Subsidiaries that owns a nuclear plant.  All contracts for the disposal of spent nuclear fuel are between the Department of Energy (DOE) and the owner of a nuclear power plant.

Based upon currently planned fuel cycles, the nuclear units in both the Utility and Entergy Wholesale Commodities segments have a diversified portfolio of contracts and inventory that provides substantially adequate nuclear fuel materials and conversion and enrichment services at what Entergy believes are reasonably predictable or fixed prices through most of 2012.  Entergy’s ability to purchase nuclear fuel at reasonably predictable prices, however, depends upon the performance reliability of uranium miners.  There are a number of possible alternate suppliers that may be accessed to mitigate any supplier performance failure, including potentially drawing upon Entergy’s inventory intended for later generation periods depending upon its risk management strategy at that time, although the pricing of any alternate uranium supply from the market will be dependent upon the market for uranium supply at that time.  In addition, some nuclear fuel contracts are on a non-fixed price basis subject to prevailing prices at the time of delivery.

The effects of market price changes may be reduced and deferred by risk management strategies, such as negotiation of floor and ceiling amounts for long-term contracts, buying for inventory or entering into forward physical contracts at fixed prices when Entergy believes it is appropriate and useful.  Entergy buys uranium from a diversified mix of sellers located in a diversified mix of countries, and from time to time purchases from nearly all qualified reliable major market participants worldwide that sell into the U.S.

Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, Entergy Louisiana, and System Energy each have made arrangements to lease nuclear fuel and related equipment and services.  The lessors, which are consolidated in the financial statements of Entergy and the applicable Registrant Subsidiary, finance the acquisition and ownership of nuclear fuel through credit agreements and the issuance of notes.  These arrangements are subject to periodic renewal.

Natural Gas Purchased for Resale

Entergy New Orleans has several suppliers of natural gas.  Its system is interconnected with three interstate and three intrastate pipelines.  Entergy New Orleans has a "no-notice" service gas purchase contract with Atmos Energy which guarantees Entergy New Orleans gas delivery at specific delivery points and at any volume within the minimum and maximum set forth in the contract amounts.  The Atmos Energy gas supply is transported to Entergy New Orleans pursuant to a transportation service agreement with Gulf South Pipeline Co.  This service is subject to FERC-approved rates.  Entergy New Orleans also makes interruptible spot market purchases.  In recent years, natural gas deliveries to Entergy New Orleans have been subject primarily to weather-related curtailments.

As a result of the implementation of FERC-mandated interstate pipeline restructuring in 1993, curtailments of interstate gas supply could occur if Entergy New Orleans's suppliers failed to perform their obligations to deliver gas under their supply agreements.  Gulf South Pipeline Co. could curtail transportation capacity only in the event of pipeline system constraints.

Entergy Gulf States Louisiana purchases natural gas for resale under a firm contract from Enbridge Marketing (U.S.) Inc.  The gas is delivered through a combination of intrastate and interstate pipelines.

Federal Regulation of the Utility

State or local regulatory authorities, as described above, regulate the retail rates of the Utility operating companies.  The FERC regulates wholesale rates (including intrasystem sales pursuant to the System Agreement) and interstate transmission of electricity, as well as rates for System Energy’s sales of capacity and energy from Grand Gulf to Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, and Entergy New Orleans pursuant to the Unit Power Sales Agreement.





System Agreement

(Entergy Corporation, Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, Entergy New Orleans, and Entergy Texas)

The Utility operating companies historically have engaged in the coordinated planning, construction, and operation of generating and bulk transmission facilities under the terms of the System Agreement, which is a rate schedule that has been approved by the FERC.  Under the terms of the System Agreement, generating capacity and other power resources are jointly operated by the Utility operating companies.  The System Agreement provides, among other things, that parties having generating reserves greater than their allocated share of reserves (long companies) shall receive payments from those parties having generating reserves that are less than their allocated share of reserves (short companies).  Such payments are at amounts sufficient to cover certain of the long companies’ costs for intermediate and peaking oil/gas-fired generation, including operating expenses, fixed charges on debt, dividend requirements on preferred equity, and a fair rate of return on common equity investment.  Under the System Agreement, the rates used to compensate long companies are based on costs associated with the long companies’ steam electric generating units fueled by oil or gas and having an annual average heat rate above 10,000 Btu/kWh.  In addition, for all energy exchanged among the Utility operating companies under the System Agreement, the companies purchasing exchange energy are required to pay the cost of fuel consumed in generating such energy plus a charge to cover other associated costs.

Citing its concerns that the benefits of its continued participation in the current form of the System Agreement have been seriously eroded, in December 2005, Entergy Arkansas submitted its notice that it will terminate its participation in the current System Agreement effective ninety-six (96) months from the date of the notice or such earlier date as authorized by the FERC.  In November 2007, pursuant to the provisions of the System Agreement, Entergy Mississippi provided its written notice to terminate its participation in the System Agreement effective ninety-six (96) months from the date of the notice or such earlier date as authorized by the FERC.  In light of the notices of Entergy Arkansas and Entergy Mississippi to terminate participation in the current System Agreement, in January 2008 the LPSC unanimously voted to direct the LPSC Staff to begin evaluating the potential for a new agreement.  Likewise, the New Orleans City Council opened a docket to gather information on progress towards a successor agreement.

In November 2009 the FERC accepted the notices of cancellation and determined that Entergy Arkansas and Entergy Mississippi are permitted to withdraw from the System Agreement following the 96 month notice period without payment of a fee or being required to otherwise compensate the remaining Utility operating companies as a result of withdrawal.  In February 2011 the FERC denied the LPSC’s and the City Council’s rehearing requests.  The LPSC has appealed the FERC’s decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, and oral argument was held in the case in January 2012.

System Energy and Related Agreements

System Energy recovers costs related to its interest in Grand Gulf through rates charged to Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, and Entergy New Orleans for capacity and energy under the Unit Power Sales Agreement (described below).  In December 1995, System Energy commenced a rate proceeding at the FERC.  In July 2001, the rate proceeding became final, with the FERC approving a prospective 10.94% return on equity.  The





FERC’s decision also affected other aspects of System Energy’s charges to the Utility operating companies that it supplies with power.  In 1998, the FERC approved requests by Entergy Arkansas and Entergy Mississippi to accelerate a portion of their Grand Gulf purchased power obligations.  Entergy Arkansas’s and Entergy Mississippi’s acceleration of Grand Gulf purchased power obligations ceased effective July 2001 and July 2003, respectively, as approved by the FERC.

Unit Power Sales Agreement

The Unit Power Sales Agreement allocates capacity, energy, and the related costs from System Energy’s ownership and leasehold interests in Grand Gulf to Entergy Arkansas (36%), Entergy Louisiana (14%), Entergy Mississippi (33%), and Entergy New Orleans (17%).  Each of these companies is obligated to make payments to System Energy for its entitlement of capacity and energy on a full cost-of-service basis regardless of the quantity of energy delivered.  Payments under the Unit Power Sales Agreement are System Energy’s only source of operating revenue.  The financial condition of System Energy depends upon the continued commercial operation of Grand Gulf and the receipt of such payments.  Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, and Entergy New Orleans generally recover payments made under the Unit Power Sales Agreement through rates charged to their customers.

In the case of Entergy Arkansas and Entergy Louisiana, payments are also recovered through sales of electricity from their respective retained shares of Grand Gulf.  Under a settlement agreement entered into with the APSC in 1985 and amended in 1988, Entergy Arkansas retains 22% of its 36% share of Grand Gulf-related costs and recovers the remaining 78% of its share in rates.  In the event that Entergy Arkansas is not able to sell its retained share to third parties, it may sell such energy to its retail customers at a price equal to its avoided cost, which is currently less than Entergy Arkansas’s cost from its retained share.  Entergy Arkansas has life-of-resources purchased power agreements with Entergy Louisiana and Entergy New Orleans that sell a portion of the output of Entergy Arkansas’s retained share of Grand Gulf to those companies.  In a series of LPSC orders, court decisions, and agreements from late 1985 to mid-1988, Entergy Louisiana was granted rate relief with respect to costs associated with Entergy Louisiana’s share of capacity and energy from Grand Gulf, subject to certain terms and conditions.  Entergy Louisiana retains and does not recover from retail ratepayers 18% of its 14% share of the costs of Grand Gulf capacity and energy and recovers the remaining 82% of its share in rates.  Entergy Louisiana is allowed to recover through the fuel adjustment clause at 4.6 cents per kWh for the energy related to its retained portion of these costs.  Alternatively, Entergy Louisiana may sell such energy to non-affiliated parties at prices above the fuel adjustment clause recovery amount, subject to the LPSC’s approval.

Availability Agreement

The Availability Agreement among System Energy and Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, and Entergy New Orleans was entered into in 1974 in connection with the financing by System Energy of Grand Gulf. The Availability Agreement provides that System Energy make available to Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, and Entergy New Orleans all capacity and energy available from System Energy’s share of Grand Gulf.

Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, and Entergy New Orleans also agreed severally to pay System Energy monthly for the right to receive capacity and energy from Grand Gulf in amounts that (when added to any amounts received by System Energy under the Unit Power Sales Agreement) would at least equal System Energy’s total operating expenses for Grand Gulf (including depreciation at a specified rate and expenses incurred in a permanent shutdown of Grand Gulf) and interest charges. The September 1989 write-off of System Energy’s investment in Grand Gulf 2, amounting to approximately $900 million, is being amortized for Availability Agreement purposes over 27 years.

The allocation percentages under the Availability Agreement are fixed as follows: Entergy Arkansas - 17.1%; Entergy Louisiana - 26.9%; Entergy Mississippi - 31.3%; and Entergy New Orleans - 24.7%. The allocation percentages under the Availability Agreement would remain in effect and would govern payments made under such agreement in the event of a shortfall of funds available to System Energy from other sources, including payments under the Unit Power Sales Agreement.





System Energy has assigned its rights to payments and advances from Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, and Entergy New Orleans under the Availability Agreement as security for its first mortgage bonds and reimbursement obligations to certain banks providing letters of credit in connection with the equity funding of the sale and leaseback transactions described in Note 10 to the financial statements under “

Sale and Leaseback Transactions

- Grand Gulf Lease Obligations

.”  In these assignments, Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, and Entergy New Orleans further agreed that, in the event they were prohibited by governmental action from making payments under the Availability Agreement (for example, if the FERC reduced or disallowed such payments as constituting excessive rates), they would then make subordinated advances to System Energy in the same amounts and at the same times as the prohibited payments. System Energy would not be allowed to repay these subordinated advances so long as it remained in default under the related indebtedness or in other similar circumstances.

Each of the assignment agreements relating to the Availability Agreement provides that Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, and Entergy New Orleans will make payments directly to System Energy. However, if there is an event of default, those payments must be made directly to the holders of indebtedness that are the beneficiaries of such assignment agreements. The payments must be made pro rata according to the amount of the respective obligations secured.

The obligations of Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, and Entergy New Orleans to make payments under the Availability Agreement are subject to the receipt and continued effectiveness of all necessary regulatory approvals.  Sales of capacity and energy under the Availability Agreement would require that the Availability Agreement be submitted to the FERC for approval with respect to the terms of such sale. No such filing with the FERC has been made because sales of capacity and energy from Grand Gulf are being made pursuant to the Unit Power Sales Agreement.  If, for any reason, sales of capacity and energy are made in the future pursuant to the Availability Agreement, the jurisdictional portions of the Availability Agreement would be submitted to the FERC for approval.

Since commercial operation of Grand Gulf began, payments under the Unit Power Sales Agreement to System Energy have exceeded the amounts payable under the Availability Agreement. Therefore, no payments under the Availability Agreement have ever been required.  If Entergy Arkansas or Entergy Mississippi fails to make its Unit Power Sales Agreement payments, and System Energy is unable to obtain funds from other sources, Entergy Louisiana and Entergy New Orleans could become subject to claims or demands by System Energy or its creditors for payments or advances under the Availability Agreement (or the assignments thereof) equal to the difference between their required Unit Power Sales Agreement payments and their required Availability Agreement payments because their Availability Agreement obligations exceed their Unit Power Sales Agreement obligations.

The Availability Agreement may be terminated, amended, or modified by mutual agreement of the parties thereto, without further consent of any assignees or other creditors.

Capital Funds Agreement

System Energy and Entergy Corporation have entered into the Capital Funds Agreement, whereby Entergy Corporation has agreed to supply System Energy with sufficient capital to (i) maintain System Energy’s equity capital at an amount equal to a minimum of 35% of its total capitalization (excluding short-term debt) and (ii) permit the continued commercial operation of Grand Gulf and pay in full all indebtedness for borrowed money of System Energy when due.

Entergy Corporation has entered into various supplements to the Capital Funds Agreement. System Energy has assigned its rights under such supplements as security for its first mortgage bonds and for reimbursement obligations to certain banks providing letters of credit in connection with the equity funding of the sale and leaseback transactions described in Note 10 to the financial statements under “

Sale and Leaseback Transactions

- Grand Gulf Lease Obligations

.”  Each such supplement provides that permitted indebtedness for borrowed money incurred by System Energy in connection with the financing of Grand Gulf may be secured by System Energy’s rights under





the Capital Funds Agreement on a pro rata basis (except for the Specific Payments, as defined below). In addition, in the supplements to the Capital Funds Agreement relating to the specific indebtedness being secured, Entergy Corporation has agreed to make cash capital contributions directly to System Energy sufficient to enable System Energy to make payments when due on such indebtedness (Specific Payments). However, if there is an event of default, Entergy Corporation must make those payments directly to the holders of indebtedness benefiting from the supplemental agreements. The payments (other than the Specific Payments) must be made pro rata according to the amount of the respective obligations benefiting from the supplemental agreements.

The Capital Funds Agreement may be terminated, amended, or modified by mutual agreement of the parties thereto, upon obtaining the consent, if required, of those holders of System Energy’s indebtedness then outstanding who have received the assignments of the Capital Funds Agreement.

Service Companies

Entergy Services, a corporation wholly-owned by Entergy Corporation, provides management, administrative, accounting, legal, engineering, and other services primarily to the Utility operating companies. Entergy Operations is also wholly-owned by Entergy Corporation and provides nuclear management, operations and maintenance services under contract for ANO, River Bend, Waterford 3, and Grand Gulf, subject to the owner oversight of Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, Entergy Louisiana, and System Energy, respectively.  Entergy Services and Entergy Operations provide their services to the Utility operating companies and System Energy on an “at cost” basis, pursuant to cost allocation methodologies for these service agreements that were approved by the FERC.

Jurisdictional Separation of Entergy Gulf States, Inc. into Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy Texas

Effective December 31, 2007, Entergy Gulf States, Inc. completed a jurisdictional separation into two vertically integrated utility companies, one operating under the sole retail jurisdiction of the PUCT, Entergy Texas, and the other operating under the sole retail jurisdiction of the LPSC, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana.  Management believes that the jurisdictional separation better aligns Entergy Gulf States, Inc.’s Louisiana and Texas operations to serve customers in those states and to operate consistent with state-specific regulatory requirements as the utility regulatory environments in those jurisdictions evolve.  The jurisdictional separation provides for regulation of each separated company by a single retail regulator, which should reduce regulatory complexity.

Entergy Texas now owns all Entergy Gulf States, Inc. distribution and transmission assets located in Texas, the gas-fired generating plants located in Texas, undivided 42.5% ownership shares of Entergy Gulf States, Inc.’s 70% ownership interest in Nelson 6 and 42% ownership interest in Big Cajun 2, Unit 3, which are coal-fired generating plants located in Louisiana, and other assets and contract rights to the extent related to utility operations in Texas.  Entergy Gulf States Louisiana now owns all of the remaining assets that were owned by Entergy Gulf States, Inc.  On a book value basis, approximately 58.1% of the Entergy Gulf States, Inc. assets were allocated to Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and approximately 41.9% were allocated to Entergy Texas.

Entergy Gulf States Louisiana remained primarily liable for all of the long-term debt issued by Entergy Gulf States, Inc. that was outstanding on December 31, 2007.  Under a debt assumption agreement with Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, Entergy Texas assumed its pro rata share of this long-term debt, which was $1.079 billion, or approximately 46%, which had been entirely paid-off as of December 31, 2010.  The pro rata share of the long-term debt assumed by Entergy Texas was determined by first determining the net assets for each company on a book value basis, and then calculating a debt assumption ratio that resulted in the common equity ratios for each company being approximately the same as the Entergy Gulf States, Inc. common equity ratio immediately prior to the jurisdictional separation.

Entergy Texas purchases from Entergy Gulf States Louisiana pursuant to a life-of-unit purchased power agreement (PPA) a 42.5% share of capacity and energy from the 70% of River Bend subject to retail regulation.  Entergy Texas was allocated a share of River Bend’s nuclear and environmental liabilities that is identical to the share of the plant’s output purchased by Entergy Texas under the PPA.  Entergy Gulf States Louisiana purchases a 57.5% share





of capacity and energy from the gas-fired generating plants owned by Entergy Texas, and Entergy Texas purchases a 42.5% share of capacity and energy from the gas-fired generating plants owned by Entergy Gulf States Louisiana.  The PPAs associated with the gas-fired generating plants will terminate when the unit(s) is/are no longer dispatched by the Entergy System.  The dispatch and operation of the generating plants will not change as a result of the jurisdictional separation.

The jurisdictional separation occurred through completion of the following steps:

·

Through a Texas statutory merger-by-division, Entergy Gulf States, Inc. was renamed as Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, Inc., a Texas corporation, and the new Texas business corporation Entergy Texas, Inc. was formed.

·

Entergy Gulf States, Inc. allocated the assets described above to Entergy Texas, and all of the capital stock of Entergy Texas was issued directly to Entergy Gulf States, Inc.’s parent company, Entergy Corporation.

·

Entergy Wholesale Commodities

During 2010 Entergy integrated its non-utility nuclear and its non-nuclear wholesale assets businesses into a new organization called Entergy Wholesale Commodities.

Entergy Wholesale Commodities includes the ownership and operation of six nuclear power plants, five of which are located in the Northeast United States, with the sixth located in Michigan, and is primarily focused on selling electric power produced by those plants to wholesale customers.  Entergy Wholesale Commodities’ revenues are primarily derived from sales of energy and generation capacity from these plants.  Entergy Wholesale Commodities also provides operations and management services, including decommissioning services, to nuclear power plants owned by other utilities in the United States.

Entergy Wholesale Commodities also includes the ownership of, or participation in joint ventures that own, non-nuclear power plants and the sale to wholesale customers of the electric power produced by these plants.

Entergy Wholesale Commodities also includes the ownership of two non-operating nuclear facilities, Big Rock Point in Michigan and Indian Point 1 in New York that were acquired when Entergy purchased the Palisades and Indian Point 2 nuclear plants, respectively.  These facilities are in various stages of the decommissioning process.

The NRC operating license for Vermont Yankee was to expire in March 2012.  In March 2011 the NRC renewed Vermont Yankee’s operating license for an additional 20 years, as a result of which the license now expires in 2032.  For additional discussion regarding the continued operation of the Vermont Yankee plant, see “

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets

” in Note 1 to the financial statements.

The operating licenses for Pilgrim, Indian Point 2, and Indian Point 3 expire between 2012 and 2015.  Under federal law, nuclear power plants may continue to operate beyond their license expiration dates while their renewal applications are pending NRC approval.  Various parties have expressed opposition to renewal of the licenses.  With respect to the Pilgrim license renewal, the Atomic Safety and Licensing Board (ASLB) of the NRC, after issuing an order denying a new hearing request, terminated its proceeding on Pilgrim’s license renewal application.  With the ASLB process concluded the proceeding, including appeals of certain ASLB decisions, is now before the NRC.

In April 2007, Entergy submitted an application to the NRC to renew the operating licenses for Indian Point 2 and 3 for an additional 20 years.  The ASLB has admitted 21 contentions raised by the State of New York or other parties, which were combined into 16 discrete issues.  Two of the issues have been resolved, leaving 14 issues that are currently subject to ASLB hearings.  In July 2011, the ASLB granted the State of New York’s motion for summary





disposition of an admitted contention challenging the adequacy of a section of Indian Point’s environmental analysis as incorporated in the FSEIS (discussed below).  That section provided cost estimates for Severe Accident Mitigation Alternatives (SAMAs), which are hardware and procedural changes that could be implemented to mitigate estimated impacts of off-site radiological releases in case of a hypothesized severe accident.  In addition to finding that the SAMA cost analysis was insufficient, the ASLB directed the NRC staff to explain why cost-beneficial SAMAs should not be required to be implemented.  Entergy appealed the ASLB’s decision to the NRC and the NRC staff supported Entergy’s appeal, while the State of New York opposed it.  In December 2011 the NRC denied Entergy’s appeal as premature, stating that the appeal could be renewed at the conclusion of the ASLB proceedings.

In November 2011 the ASLB issued an order establishing deadlines for the submission of several rounds of testimony on most of the contentions pending before the ASLB and for the filing of motions to limit or exclude testimony.  Initial hearings before the ASLB on the contentions for which testimony is submitted are expected to begin by the end of 2012.  Filing deadlines for testimony on certain admitted contentions remain to be set by the ASLB.

The NRC staff currently is also performing its technical and environmental reviews of the application.  The NRC staff issued a Final Safety Evaluation Report (FSER) in August 2009, a supplement to the FSER in August 2011, and a Final Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement (FSEIS) in December 2010.  The NRC staff has stated its intent to file a supplemental FSEIS in May 2012.  The New York State Department of Environmental Conservation has taken the position that Indian Point must obtain a new state-issued Clean Water Act Section 401 water quality certification as part of the license renewal process.  In addition, the consistency of Indian Point’s operations with New York State’s coastal management policies must be resolved as required by the Coastal Zone Management Act.  Entergy Wholesale Commodities’ efforts to obtain these certifications and determinations continue in 2012.

The hearing process is an integral component of the NRC’s regulatory framework, and evidentiary hearings on license renewal applications are not uncommon.  Entergy intends to participate fully in the hearing process as permitted by the NRC’s hearing rules.  As noted in Entergy’s responses to the various intervenor filings, Entergy believes the contentions proposed by the intervenors are unsupported and without merit.  Entergy will continue to work with the NRC staff as it completes its technical and environmental reviews of the license renewal application.

Entergy Louisiana and Entergy New Orleans currently purchase 101 MW of capacity and energy from Independence Unit 2.  The transaction included an option for Entergy Louisiana and Entergy New Orleans to acquire an ownership interest in the unit for a total price of $80 million, subject to various adjustments.  In March 2008, Entergy Louisiana and Entergy New Orleans provided notice of their intent to exercise the option.  Entergy Louisiana and Entergy New Orleans continue to evaluate the economics of proceeding with this option.  Based upon changes in the long-term economics of the resource relative to current options, in August 2011, Entergy Louisiana made a filing with the LPSC seeking relief from the prior directive to exercise the option to purchase an ownership interest in the Independence unit.  The LPSC staff filed testimony suggesting that the option should be exercised but noting that this is largely a policy decision for the LPSC.





(3)

The owned MW capacity is the portion of the plant capacity owned by Entergy Wholesale Commodities.  For a complete listing of Entergy’s jointly-owned generating stations, refer to “

Jointly-Owned Generating Stations

” in Note 1 to the financial statements.

(4)

Indirectly owned through interests in unconsolidated joint ventures.

In the fourth quarter 2010, Entergy sold its 61 percent share of the Harrison County 550 MW combined cycle gas-fired power plant.

Independent System Operators

The Pilgrim and Vermont Yankee and Rhode Island plants fall under the authority of the Independent System Operator (ISO) New England and the FitzPatrick and Indian Point plants fall under the authority of the New York Independent System Operator (NYISO).  The Palisades plant falls under the authority of the MISO.  The primary purpose of ISO New England, NYISO, and MISO is to direct the operations of the major generation and transmission facilities in their respective regions; ensure grid reliability; administer and monitor wholesale electricity markets; and plan for their respective region’s energy needs.

Energy and Capacity Sales

As a wholesale generator, Entergy Wholesale Commodities core business is selling energy, measured in MWh, to its customers.  Entergy Wholesale Commodities enters into forward contracts with its customers and sells energy in the day ahead or spot markets.  In addition to selling the energy produced by its plants, Entergy Wholesale Commodities sells unforced capacity, which allows load-serving entities to meet specified reserve and related requirements placed on them by the ISOs in their respective areas.  Entergy Wholesale Commodities’ forward fixed price power contracts consist of contracts to sell energy only, contracts to sell capacity only, and bundled contracts in which it sells both capacity and energy.  While the terminology and payment mechanics vary in these contracts, each of these types of contracts requires Entergy Wholesale Commodities to deliver MWh of energy, make capacity available, or both.  See “

Commodity Price Risk

- Power Generation” in Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis for additional information regarding these contracts.

In addition to the contracts discussed in “

Commodity Price Risk

- Power Generation,” Entergy’s purchase of the Vermont Yankee plant included a value sharing agreement providing for payments to the seller in the event that the plant operates beyond March 2012 pursuant to a renewed NRC operating license.  Under the value sharing agreement, to the extent that the average annual price of the energy sales from the plant exceeds the specified strike price, initially $61/MWh and then adjusted annually based on three indices, Vermont Yankee will pay 50% of the amount exceeding the strike prices to the seller.  These payments, if required, will be recorded as adjustments to the purchase price of the plants.  The value sharing would begin in 2012 and extend into 2022.

As part of the purchase of the Palisades plant, Entergy executed a 15-year PPA with the seller, Consumers Energy, for 100% of the plant’s output, excluding any future uprates.  Under the purchased power agreement, Consumers Energy will receive the value of any new environmental credits for the first ten years of the agreement.  Palisades and Consumers Energy will share on a 50/50 basis the value of any new environmental credits for years 11 through 15 of the agreement.  The environmental credits are defined as benefits from a change in law that causes capability of the plant as of the purchase date to become a tradable attribute (e.g., emission credit, renewable energy credit, environmental credit, “green” credit, etc.) or otherwise to have a market value.

Customers

Entergy Wholesale Commodities’ customers for the sale of both energy and capacity from its nuclear plants include retail power providers, utilities, electric power co-operatives, power trading organizations and other power generation companies.  These customers include Consolidated Edison, NYPA, and Consumers Energy, companies from which Entergy purchased plants, and ISO New England and NYISO.  Substantially all of the counterparties or their guarantors for the planned energy output under contract for Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear plants have public investment grade credit ratings or are load-serving entities without public credit ratings.





Competition

The ISO New England and NYISO markets are highly competitive.  Entergy Wholesale Commodities has numerous competitors in New England and New York, including generation companies affiliated with regulated utilities, other independent power producers, municipal and co-operative generators, owners of co-generation plants and wholesale power marketers.  Entergy Wholesale Commodities is an independent power producer, which means it generates power for sale to third parties at day ahead or spot market prices to the extent that the power is not sold under a fixed price contract.  Municipal and co-operative generators also generate power but use most of it to deliver power to their municipal or co-operative power customers.  Owners of co-generation plants produce power primarily for their own consumption.  Wholesale power marketers do not own generation; rather they buy power from generators or other market participants and resell it to retail providers or other market participants.  Competition in the New England and New York power markets is affected by, among other factors, the amount of generation and transmission capacity in these markets.  MISO does not have a formal, centralized forward capacity market, but load serving entities do transact capacity through bilateral contracts.  Palisades’s current output is contracted to Consumers Energy through 2022 and, therefore, Entergy Wholesale Commodities does not expect to be materially affected by competition in the MISO market in the near term.

Seasonality

Entergy Wholesale Commodities’ revenues and operating income are subject to fluctuations during the year due to seasonal factors, weather conditions, and contract pricing.  Refueling outages are generally scheduled for the spring and the fall, and cause volumetric decreases during those seasons.  When outdoor and cooling water temperatures are lower, generally during colder months, Entergy Wholesale Commodities’ nuclear power plants operate more efficiently, and consequently, generate more electricity.  Many of Entergy Wholesale Commodities’ contracts provide for shaped pricing over the course of the year.  As a result of these factors, Entergy Wholesale Commodities’ revenues are typically higher in the first and third quarters than in the second and fourth quarters.

Fuel Supply

Nuclear Fuel

See “

Fuel Supply

,

Nuclear Fuel

” in the Utility portion of Part I, Item 1 for a discussion of the nuclear fuel cycle and markets.  Entergy Nuclear Fuels Company, a wholly-owned subsidiary, is responsible for contracts to acquire nuclear materials, except for fuel fabrication, for Entergy Wholesale Commodities’ nuclear power plants, while Entergy Nuclear Operations, Inc. acts as the agent for the purchase of nuclear fuel assembly fabrication services.  All contracts for the disposal of spent nuclear fuel are between the DOE and each of the nuclear power plants.

Other Business Activities

Entergy Nuclear Power Marketing, LLC (ENPM) was formed in 2005 to centralize the power marketing function for Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear plants.  Upon its formation, ENPM entered into long-term power purchase agreements with the Entergy Wholesale Commodities subsidiaries that own nuclear power plants (generating subsidiaries).  As part of a series of agreements, ENPM agreed to assume and/or otherwise service the existing power purchase agreements that were in effect between the generating subsidiaries and their customers.  ENPM functions include origination of new energy and capacity transactions, generation scheduling, contract management (including billing and settlements), and market and credit risk mitigation.

Entergy Nuclear, Inc. pursues service agreements with other nuclear power plant owners who seek the advantages of Entergy’s scale and expertise but do not necessarily want to sell their assets.  Services provided by either Entergy Nuclear, Inc. or other Entergy Wholesale Commodities subsidiaries include engineering, operations and maintenance, fuel procurement, management and supervision, technical support and training, administrative support, and other managerial or technical services required to operate, maintain, and decommission nuclear electric power facilities.  Entergy Nuclear, Inc. provided decommissioning services for the Maine Yankee nuclear power plant and continues to pursue opportunities for Entergy Wholesale Commodities with other nuclear plant owners through operating agreements or innovative arrangements such as structured leases.





Entergy Nuclear, Inc. also offers operating license renewal and life extension services to nuclear power plant owners.  TLG Services, a subsidiary of Entergy Nuclear Inc., offers decommissioning, engineering, and related services to nuclear power plant owners.  In April 2009, Entergy announced that it will team with energy firm ENERCON to offer nuclear development services ranging from plant relicensing to full-service, new plant deployment.  ENERCON has experience in engineering, environmental, technical and management services.

In September 2003, Entergy agreed to provide plant operation support services for the 800 MW Cooper Nuclear Station located near Brownville, Nebraska.  The original contract was to expire in 2014 corresponding to the original operating license life of the plant.  In 2006, an Entergy subsidiary signed an agreement to provide license renewal services for the Cooper Nuclear Station.  The Cooper Nuclear Station received its license renewal from the NRC on November 29, 2010.  Entergy continues to provide implementation services for the renewed license.  In 2010 an Entergy subsidiary signed an agreement to extend the management support services to Cooper Nuclear Station by 15 years, through January 2029.

Entergy-Koch

Entergy-Koch is a joint venture owned 50% each by subsidiaries of Entergy and Koch Industries, Inc, and is no longer an operating entity.  Entergy-Koch began operations on February 1, 2001.  Entergy contributed most of the assets and trading contracts of its power marketing and trading business and $414 million cash to the venture and Koch contributed its approximately 8,000-mile Koch Gateway Pipeline (renamed Gulf South Pipeline), gas storage facilities, and Koch Energy Trading, which marketed and traded electricity, gas, weather derivatives, and other energy-related commodities and services.  In the fourth quarter 2004, Entergy-Koch sold its energy trading and pipeline businesses to third parties.  Entergy received $862 million of cash distributions in 2004 from Entergy-Koch after the business sales.  Due to the November 2006 expiration of contingencies on the sale of Entergy-Koch’s trading business, and the corresponding release to Entergy-Koch of sales proceeds held in escrow, Entergy received additional cash distributions of approximately $163 million during the fourth quarter of 2006 and recorded a gain of approximately $55 million (net-of-tax).  In December 2009, Entergy reorganized its investment in Entergy-Koch, received a $25.6 million cash distribution, and received a distribution of certain software owned by the joint venture.

Regulation of the Nuclear Power Industry

Atomic Energy Act of 1954 and Energy Reorganization Act of 1974

Under the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 and the Energy Reorganization Act of 1974, the operation of nuclear plants is heavily regulated by the NRC, which has broad power to impose licensing and safety-related requirements.  The NRC has broad authority to impose fines or shut down a unit, or both, depending upon its assessment of the severity of the situation, until compliance is achieved.  Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, Entergy Louisiana, and System Energy, as owners of all or portions of ANO, River Bend, Waterford 3, and Grand Gulf, respectively, and Entergy Operations, as the licensee and operator of these units, are subject to the jurisdiction of the NRC.  Entergy subsidiaries in the Entergy Wholesale Commodities segment are subject to the NRC’s jurisdiction as the owners and operator of Pilgrim, Indian Point Energy Center, FitzPatrick, Vermont Yankee, and Palisades.  Substantial capital expenditures at Entergy’s nuclear plants because of revised safety requirements of the NRC could be required in the future.

Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982

Spent Nuclear Fuel

Under the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982, the DOE is required, for a specified fee, to construct storage facilities for, and to dispose of, all spent nuclear fuel and other high-level radioactive waste generated by domestic nuclear power reactors.  Entergy’s nuclear owner/licensee subsidiaries provide for the estimated future disposal costs of spent nuclear fuel in accordance with the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982.  The affected Entergy companies entered into contracts with the DOE, whereby the DOE is to furnish disposal services at a cost of one mill per net kWh generated and sold after April 7, 1983, plus a one-time fee for generation prior to that date.  Entergy Arkansas is the only one of the Utility operating companies that generated electric power with nuclear fuel prior to that date and has a recorded liability as of December 31, 2011 of $181.0 million for the one-time fee.  Entergy accepted assignment of the Pilgrim, FitzPatrick and Indian Point 3, Indian Point 1 and 2, Vermont Yankee, Palisades, and Big Rock Point spent fuel disposal contracts with the DOE held by their previous owners.  The previous owners have paid or retained liability for the fees for all generation prior to the purchase dates of those plants.  The fees payable to the DOE may be adjusted in the future to assure full recovery.  Entergy considers all costs incurred for the disposal of spent nuclear fuel, except accrued interest, to be proper components of nuclear fuel expense.  Provisions to recover such costs have been or will be made in applications to regulatory authorities for the Utility plants.  Entergy’s total spent fuel fees to date, including the one-time fee liability of Entergy Arkansas, have almost reached $1.5 billion.

The permanent spent fuel repository in the U.S. has been legislated to be Yucca Mountain, Nevada.  The DOE is required by law to proceed with the licensing (the DOE filed the license application in June 2008) and, after the license is granted by the NRC, proceed with the repository construction and commencement of receipt of spent fuel.  Because the DOE has not begun accepting spent fuel, it is in non-compliance with the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 and has breached its spent fuel disposal contracts.  The DOE continues to delay meeting its obligation.  Moreover, the Obama administration has expressed its intention and taken specific steps to discontinue the Yucca





Mountain project and study a new spent fuel strategy.  Such actions include a motion to the NRC to withdraw the license application with prejudice and the establishment of a commission to develop recommendations for alternative spent fuel storage solutions.  On June 29, 2010, however, a panel of the NRC’s Atomic Safety and Licensing Board denied the administration’s motion to withdraw the application.  In November 2011 the NRC Commissioners issued an order effectively affirming the ASLB’s denial of the withdrawal, but the order also shut down the continued adjudication of the license application.  Accordingly, large uncertainty remains regarding the time frame under which the DOE will begin to accept spent fuel from Entergy's facilities for storage or disposal.  As a result, continuing future expenditures will be required to increase spent fuel storage capacity at Entergy's nuclear sites.

As a result of the DOE's failure to begin disposal of spent nuclear fuel in 1998 pursuant to the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 and the spent fuel disposal contracts, Entergy's nuclear owner/licensee subsidiaries have incurred and will continue to incur damages.  In November 2003 these subsidiaries, except for the owner of Palisades, began litigation to recover the damages caused by the DOE's delay in performance.  In October 2007, the U.S. Court of Federal Claims awarded $48.7 million jointly to System Fuels and Entergy Arkansas in damages related to the DOE's breach of its obligations.  In a revised decision issued in March 2010, the court awarded $9.7 million jointly to System Fuels, System Energy, and SMEPA.  Also in March 2010, in two separate decisions, the court awarded $106.1 million to Entergy Nuclear Indian Point 2, and $4.2 million to Entergy Nuclear Generation Company (the owner of Pilgrim).  In September 2010 the court awarded $46.6 million to Entergy Nuclear Vermont Yankee.  All of these decisions were appealed by the DOE to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.  In September 2011, the appeals court affirmed most of the Entergy Nuclear Generation Company award, but remanded to the trial court for recalculation of certain damages.  In January 2012 the appeals court affirmed the System Fuels and Entergy Arkansas award in large part, and reversed the trial court’s denial of certain damages sought, but remanded to the trial court for recalculation of certain damages.  Also in January 2012, the appeals court affirmed the System Fuels, System Energy and SMEPA award, and reversed the trial court’s denial of certain damages, raising the final award to $10.2 million.  Management cannot predict the timing or amount of any potential recoveries on other claims filed by Entergy subsidiaries, and cannot predict the timing of any eventual receipt from the DOE of the U.S. Court of Federal Claims damage awards.

Pending DOE acceptance and disposal of spent nuclear fuel, the owners of nuclear plants are providing their own spent fuel storage.  Storage capability additions using dry casks began operations at Palisades in 1993, at ANO in 1996, at FitzPatrick in 2002, at River Bend in 2005, at Grand Gulf in 2006, at Indian Point and Vermont Yankee in 2008, and at Waterford 3 in 2011.  These facilities will be expanded as needed.  Current on-site spent fuel storage capacity at Pilgrim is estimated to be sufficient until approximately 2014, by which time dry cask storage facilities are planned to be placed into service at that unit.

Nuclear Plant Decommissioning

Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Texas, and System Energy are entitled to recover from customers through electric rates the estimated decommissioning costs for ANO, the portion of River Bend subject to retail rate regulation, Waterford 3, and Grand Gulf, respectively.  These amounts are deposited in trust funds that can only be used for future decommissioning costs.  Entergy periodically reviews and updates the estimated decommissioning costs to reflect inflation and changes in regulatory requirements and technology, and then makes applications to the regulatory authorities to reflect, in rates, the changes in projected decommissioning costs.

In 2008, Entergy experienced declines in the market value of assets held in the trust funds for meeting the decommissioning funding assurance obligations for the nuclear plants.  This decline adversely affected certain Entergy subsidiaries’ abilities to demonstrate compliance with the NRC’s requirements for providing financial assurance for decommissioning funding for some of its plants.  Following a review in 2009, Entergy concluded that there

was a funding shortfall for Vermont Yankee of approximately $40 million, which it satisfied with a $40 million guarantee from Entergy Corporation that was effective as of December 31, 2009.  For Waterford 3 and River Bend, Entergy subsidiaries made appropriate filings by December 31, 2009 with their retail regulators that requested decommissioning funding from customers to address the shortfalls identified by the NRC.  On July 28, 2010, the LPSC approved increased decommissioning collections for Waterford 3 and the Louisiana regulated share of River Bend.  On December 13, 2010, the PUCT approved increased decommissioning collections for the Texas share of River Bend.  Entergy currently believes its decommissioning funding will be sufficient to address the identified shortfalls, although decommissioning cost inflation and trust fund performance will ultimately determine the adequacy of the funding amounts.





For the Indian Point 3 and FitzPatrick plants purchased in 2000, NYPA retained the decommissioning trusts and the decommissioning liability.  NYPA and Entergy subsidiaries executed decommissioning agreements, which specify their decommissioning obligations.  NYPA has the right to require the Entergy subsidiaries to assume the decommissioning liability provided that it assigns the corresponding decommissioning trust, up to a specified level, to the Entergy subsidiaries.  If the decommissioning liability is retained by NYPA, the responsible Entergy subsidiary will perform the decommissioning of the plants at a price equal to the lesser of a pre-specified level or the amount in the decommissioning trusts.

Additional information with respect to Entergy’s decommissioning costs and decommissioning trust funds is found in Note 9 and Note 17 to the financial statements.

The Price-Anderson Act requires that reactor licensees purchase insurance and participate in a secondary insurance pool that provides insurance coverage for the public in the event of a nuclear power plant accident.  The costs of this insurance are borne by the nuclear power industry.  Congress amended and renewed the Price-Anderson Act in 2005 for a term through 2025.  The Price-Anderson Act limits contingent liability for a single nuclear incident to approximately $117.5 million per reactor (with 104 nuclear industry reactors currently participating).  Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, Entergy Louisiana, System Energy, and Entergy Wholesale Commodities have protection with respect to this liability through a combination of private insurance and an industry assessment program, as well as insurance for property damage, costs of replacement power, and other risks relating to nuclear generating units.  The Price-Anderson Act and insurance applicable to the nuclear programs of Entergy are discussed in more detail in Note 8 to the financial statements.

Environmental Regulation

Entergy’s facilities and operations are subject to regulation by various governmental authorities having jurisdiction over air quality, water quality, control of toxic substances and hazardous and solid wastes, and other environmental matters.  Management believes that Entergy’s businesses are in substantial compliance with environmental regulations currently applicable to its facilities and operations.  Because environmental regulations are subject to change, future compliance requirements and costs cannot be precisely estimated.  Except to the extent discussed below, at this time compliance with federal, state, and local provisions regulating the discharge of materials into the environment, or otherwise protecting the environment, is incorporated into the routine cost structure of Entergy’s businesses and is not expected to have a material effect on their competitive position, results of operations, cash flows or financial position.

Clean Air Act and Subsequent Amendments

The Clean Air Act and its amendments establish several programs that currently or in the future may affect Entergy’s fossil-fueled generation facilities and, to a much lesser extent, certain operations at nuclear and other  facilities.  Individual states also operate similar independent state programs or delegated federal programs that may include requirements more stringent than federal regulatory requirements.  These programs include:

·

New source review and preconstruction permits for new sources of criteria air pollutants and significant modifications to existing facilities;

·

Acid rain program for control of sulfur dioxide (SO


) and nitrogen oxides (NO

x

);

·

Nonattainment area programs for control of criteria air pollutants;

·

Hazardous air pollutant emissions reduction programs;

·

Interstate Air Transport;

·

Operating permits program for administration and enforcement of these and other Clean Air Act programs; and

·

Regional Haze and Best Available Retrofit Technology programs.





New Source Review (NSR)

Preconstruction permits are required for new facilities and for existing facilities that undergo a modification that results in a significant net emissions increase and is not classified as routine repair, maintenance, or replacement.  Units that undergo a non-routine modification must obtain a permit modification and may be required to install additional air pollution control technologies. Entergy has an established process for identifying modifications requiring additional permitting approval and has followed the regulations and associated guidance provided by the states and the federal government with regard to the determination of routine repair, maintenance, and replacement.  In recent years, however, the EPA has begun an enforcement initiative, aimed primarily at coal plants, to identify modifications that it does not consider routine for which the unit did not obtain a modified permit.  Various courts and the EPA have been inconsistent in their judgments regarding modifications that are considered routine.

In September 2010 the owner of a minority interest in Entergy’s White Bluff and Independence facilities, both located in Arkansas, received a request from the EPA for several categories of information concerning capital and maintenance projects at the facilities in order to determine compliance with the Clean Air Act.  The EPA request for information does not allege that either facility violated the law.  In February 2011, Entergy received a similar request from the EPA and has responded to it.  In August 2011, Entergy’s Nelson facility, located in Louisiana, received a similar request for information from the EPA.  Entergy responded to this request.

Acid Rain Program

The Clean Air Act provides SO


allowances to most of the affected Entergy generating units for emissions based upon past emission levels and operating characteristics.  Each allowance is an entitlement to emit one ton of SO


per year.  Plant owners are required to possess allowances for SO


emissions from affected generating units.  Virtually all Entergy fossil-fueled generating units are subject to SO


allowance requirements.  Entergy could be required to purchase additional allowances when it generates power using fuel oil.  Fuel oil usage is determined by economic dispatch and influenced by the price of natural gas, incremental emission allowance costs, and the availability and cost of purchased power.

Ozone Nonattainment

Entergy Texas operates one fossil-fueled generating unit (Lewis Creek) in a geographic area that is not in attainment of the currently-enforced national ambient air quality standards for ozone.  The nonattainment area that affects Entergy Texas is the Houston-Galveston-Brazoria area.  Areas in nonattainment are classified as "marginal," "moderate," "serious," or "severe."  When an area fails to meet the ambient air standard, the EPA requires state regulatory authorities to prepare state implementation plans meant to cause progress toward bringing the area into attainment with applicable standards.

The Houston-Galveston-Brazoria area was originally classified as "moderate" nonattainment under the 8-hour standard with an attainment date of June 15, 2010.  On June 15, 2007, the Texas governor petitioned the EPA to reclassify Houston-Galveston-Brazoria from "moderate" to "severe."  On October 1, 2008, the EPA granted the request by the Texas governor to voluntarily reclassify the Houston-Galveston-Brazoria area from a "moderate" 8-hour ozone nonattainment area to a "severe" 8-hour ozone nonattainment area.  The EPA also set April 15, 2010, as the date for the State of Texas to submit a revised state implementation plan (SIP) addressing the "severe" ozone

nonattainment area requirements of the Clean Air Act.  In March 2010 the Texas commission adopted the Houston-Galveston-Brazoria Attainment Demonstration SIP Revision and the Houston-Galveston-Brazoria Reasonable Further Progress SIP Revision for the 1997 eight-hour ozone standard and associated rules.  EPA approval is pending.  The area's new attainment date for the 8-hour ozone standard is as expeditiously as practicable, but no later than June 15, 2019.

Entergy Gulf States Louisiana operates two fossil-fueled generating facilities in the Baton Rouge metropolitan area which was previously classified as a non-attainment area for the 1997 eight-hour ozone standard.  However, in November 2011, the EPA finalized approval of Louisiana’s request to redesignate the Baton Rouge area to attainment for this standard.  Louisiana has demonstrated that the five parish area (East Baton Rouge, Ascension, Iberville, Livingston and West Baton Rouge parishes) will be able to maintain compliance with the ozone standard for the next ten years.





In December 2006, the EPA's revocation of the 1-hour ozone standard was rejected in a judicial proceeding.  As a result, numerous requirements can return for areas that had been designated as nonattainment for this standard.  These requirements include the potential to increase emission fees significantly for plants operating in these areas pursuant to Section 185 of the Clean Air Act.  In addition, it is possible that new emission controls may be required.  Specific costs of compliance cannot be estimated at this time, but Entergy is monitoring development of the respective state implementation plans and will develop specific compliance strategies as the plans move through the adoption process.  (The Houston-Galveston-Brazoria area was classified as “severe” nonattainment for 1-hour ozone.)

In March 2008, the EPA revised the National Ambient Air Quality Standard for ozone, creating the potential for additional counties and parishes in which Entergy operates to be placed in nonattainment status.  The LDEQ recommended that eleven parishes be designated as nonattainment for the 75 parts per billion ozone standard.  Entergy Gulf States Louisiana owns and operates two fossil plants and Entergy Louisiana owns and operates one fossil plant affected by this recommendation.  In Arkansas, the governor recommended that Pulaski County be designated in nonattainment with the new ozone standard, where two of Entergy Arkansas’s smaller facilities are located.  These initial recommendations were not approved by the EPA, however, due to various procedural delays.  In September 2011, the EPA announced that it will begin implementing the 2008 ozone standards by requiring that states resubmit recommendations for nonattainment status.  In Entergy’s utility service area, EPA predicts that the Houston-Galveston-Brazoria, Texas; Baton Rouge, Louisiana; and Memphis, Tennessee/Arkansas areas will be in non-attainment.  Nonattainment designations are expected to be final in mid-2012.

Following nonattainment designation, states will be required to develop state implementation plans that outline control requirements that will enable the affected counties and parishes to reach attainment status.  Entergy facilities in these areas may be subject to installation of NO

x

controls, but the degree of control will remain unknown until the state implementation plans are developed.  Entergy will continue to monitor and engage in the state implementation plan development process in Entergy states.

Potential SO


Nonattainment

The EPA issued a final rule in June 2010 adopting an SO


1-hour national ambient air quality standard of 75 ppb.  The EPA designations for counties in attainment and nonattainment are expected in June 2012.  Analysis will be required to determine whether emissions from Entergy facilities contribute significantly to any violation of this new standard.  If violations exist, additional capital projects or operational changes may be required.

Hazardous Air Pollutants

The EPA has been in the process of developing a Maximum Achievable Control Technology (MACT) retrofit standard for new and existing coal and oil-fired units.  The EPA released the final Mercury and Air Toxics Standard (MATS) rule in December 2011.  Entergy currently is reviewing the rule and developing compliance plans to meet requirements of the rule, which could result in significant capital expenditures for Entergy’s coal-fired units.  Compliance with MATS is required by the Clean Air Act within three years, or by 2015, although certain extensions of this deadline are available from state permit authorities and the EPA.

Interstate Air Transport

In March 2005, the EPA finalized the Clean Air Interstate Rule (CAIR), which was intended to reduce SO


and NO

x

emissions from electric generation plants in order to improve air quality in twenty-nine eastern states.  The rule required a combination of investment of capital to install pollution control equipment and increased operating costs through the purchase of emission allowances.  Entergy began implementation in 2007, including installation of controls at several facilities and the development of an emission allowance procurement strategy.





Based on several court challenges, the CAIR was vacated and remanded to the EPA by the D.C. Circuit in 2008.  The court allowed the CAIR to become effective in January 2009, while the EPA revised the rule.  On July 7, 2011, the EPA released its final Cross-State Air Pollution Rule (CSAPR, which previously was referred to as the Transport Rule).  The rule is directed at limiting the interstate transport of emissions of NO

x

and SO


as precursors to ozone and fine particulate matter.  The final rule provides a significantly lower number of allowances to Entergy’s Utility states than did the draft rule.  Entergy’s capital investment and annual allowance purchase costs under the CSAPR will depend on the economic assessment of NO

x

and SO


allowance markets, the cost of control technologies, generation unit utilization, and the availability and cost of purchased power.

Entergy filed a petition for review with the United States Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit and a petition with the EPA for reconsideration of the rule and stay of its effectiveness.  Several other parties filed similar petitions.  On December 30, 2011, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals stayed CSAPR and instructed EPA to continue administering CAIR, pending further judicial review.  Oral argument in the case is scheduled for April 2012.  The court of appeals may reverse or remand the rule in whole or in part, or may affirm the rule.  This uncertainty makes it impossible to predict costs of compliance.  In the interim, Entergy is taking measures to prepare for compliance with either CAIR as it continues to be implemented or CSAPR, if it is affirmed in whole or in part or eventually reissued.

In October 2011 the EPA released a proposed rule increasing the emission allocation budgets for some states and moving the limited trading period back to 2014.  This proposal also increased the Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas NOx allocation budgets.  The EPA has not finalized this proposal.

Regional Haze

In June 2005, the EPA issued final Best Available Retrofit Control Technology (BART) regulations that could potentially result in a requirement to install SO


and NO

x

pollution control technology on certain of Entergy’s coal and oil generation units.  The rule leaves certain BART determinations to the states.  The Arkansas Department of Environmental Quality (ADEQ) prepared a State Implementation Plan (SIP) for Arkansas facilities to implement its obligations under the Clean Air Visibility Rule.  The ADEQ determined that Entergy Arkansas’s White Bluff power plant affects a Class I Area’s visibility and will be subject to the EPA’s presumptive BART limits, which likely would require the installation of scrubbers and low NO

x

burners.  Under then-current state regulations, the scrubbers would have had to be operational by October 2013.  Entergy Arkansas filed a petition in December 2009 with the Arkansas Pollution Control and Ecology Commission requesting a variance from this deadline, however, because the EPA has expressed concerns about Arkansas’s Regional Haze SIP and questioned the appropriateness of issuing an air permit prior to that approval.  EAI’s petition requested that, consistent with federal law, the compliance deadline be changed to as expeditiously as practicable, but in no event later than five years after EPA approval of the Arkansas Regional Haze SIP.  The Arkansas Pollution Control and Ecology Commission approved the variance in March 2010.  In October 2011 the EPA released a proposed rule addressing the Arkansas Regional Haze SIP.  In the proposal the EPA disapproves a large portion of the Arkansas Regional Haze SIP, including the emission limits for NO

x

and SO


at White Bluff.  The EPA did not issue a Federal Implementation Plan for regional haze requirements because Arkansas has indicated it wishes to correct its SIP and resubmit it.  Due to an extension in the comment period for the proposed rule, EPA has yet to issue a final rule.  It is expected that after the EPA’s proposed rule becomes final, there will be a two-year timeframe in which the EPA must either approve a SIP issued by Arkansas or issue a Federal Implementation Plan.

Potential Legislative, Regulatory, and Judicial Developments (Air)

In addition to the specific instances described above, there are a number of legislative and regulatory initiatives relating to the reduction of emissions that are under consideration at the federal, state, and local level.  Because of the nature of Entergy’s business, the imposition of any of these initiatives could affect Entergy’s operations.  Entergy continues to monitor these initiatives and activities in order to analyze their potential operational and cost implications.  These initiatives include:

·

designation by the EPA and state environmental agencies of areas that are not in attainment with national ambient air quality standards;





·

introduction of bills in Congress and development of regulations by the EPA proposing further limits on NO

x

, SO


, mercury, and carbon dioxide and other gas emissions.  New legislation or regulations applicable to stationary sources could take the form of market-based cap-and-trade programs, direct requirements for the installation of air emission controls onto air emission sources, or other or combined regulatory programs.  Entergy cannot estimate the effect of any future legislation at this time due to the uncertainty of the regulatory format;

·

efforts to implement a voluntary program intended to reduce carbon dioxide emissions and efforts in Congress to establish a mandatory federal carbon dioxide emission control structure;

·

passage and implementation of the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative by several states in the northeastern United States and similar actions in other regions of the United States;

·

efforts on the state and federal level to codify renewable portfolio standards requiring utilities to produce or purchase a certain percentage of their power from defined renewable energy sources;

·

efforts to develop more stringent state water quality standards, effluent limitations for Entergy’s industry sector, stormwater runoff control regulations, and cooling water intake structure requirements; and

·

efforts by certain external groups to encourage reporting and disclosure of carbon dioxide emissions and risk.  Entergy has prepared responses for the Carbon Disclosure Project’s (CDP) annual questionnaire for the past several years and has given permission for those responses to be posted to CDP’s website.

In addition to these initiatives, certain states and environmental advocacy groups sought judicial action to require the EPA to promulgate regulations under existing provisions of the Clean Air Act to control carbon dioxide emissions from power plants.  In April 2007 the U.S. Supreme Court held that the EPA is authorized by the current provisions of the Clean Air Act to regulate emissions of carbon dioxide and other “greenhouse gases” as “pollutants” (

Massachusetts v. EPA

) and that the EPA is required to regulate these emissions from motor vehicles if the emissions are anticipated to endanger public health or welfare.  The Supreme Court directed the EPA to make further findings in this regard.  Entergy participated as a friend of the court in

Massachusetts v. EPA

.  Entergy will continue to advocate in support of reasonable market-based regulation of carbon dioxide.  Entergy has also supported the comments of various industry groups advocating national legislation to address carbon dioxide emissions instead of attempting to regulate under the provisions of the Clean Air Act.  Entergy continues to monitor these and similar actions in order to analyze their potential operational and cost implications and benefits.

In 2009 the EPA published an “endangerment finding” stating that the emission of “greenhouse” gases “may reasonably be anticipated to endanger public health or welfare” and that the emission of these pollutants from mobile sources (such as cars and trucks) contributes to this endangerment.  The EPA issued final mobile source emission regulations on April 1, 2010.  On April 2, 2010, the EPA issued a policy stating that the regulation of greenhouse gas emissions from mobile sources would, as of January 2, 2011 (the date that the mobile source rule “takes effect”), trigger the regulation of greenhouse gases from stationary sources under the Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) and Title V programs of the Clean Air Act.

In June 2010 the EPA published the final Tailoring Rule outlining the applicability criteria that determine which stationary sources and modification projects become subject to permitting requirements for greenhouse gas emissions under the Clean Air Act.  The Tailoring Rule establishes a two-step process for implementing regulation of greenhouse gas emissions under the PSD and Title V programs.  The first step, which began on January 2, 2011,

limits the applicability of the PSD and Title V requirements for greenhouse gas emissions to sources that are already subject to PSD and Title V based on the emission of non-greenhouse gas pollutants.  Specifically, projects undertaken at stationary sources will trigger PSD permitting requirements if the project increases net greenhouse gas emissions by at least 75,000 tons per year carbon dioxide equivalent and significantly increases emissions of at least one non-greenhouse gas pollutant.  During step one, only sources subject to Title V based on their emission of non-greenhouse gas pollutants were required to address greenhouse gas emissions in their Title V permit.

The second step of the Tailoring Rule, which began on July 1, 2011, subjects to Title V requirements any new or existing source not already subject to Title V that emits, or has the potential to emit, at least 100,000 tons per year carbon dioxide equivalent.  In addition, new sources that have the potential to emit at least 100,000 tons per year carbon dioxide equivalent and significantly modified existing sources that emit or have the potential to emit at least 75,000 tons per year carbon dioxide equivalent are subject to PSD requirements.





Both the Endangerment Finding and the Tailoring Rule are subject to pending judicial review.  The rules have not been stayed by the court and are in effect pending review.

Entergy continues to support national legislation that would increase planning certainty for electric utilities while addressing carbon dioxide emissions in a responsible and flexible manner.  By virtue of its proportionally large investment in low- or non-emitting gas-fired and nuclear generation technologies, Entergy has a low overall carbon dioxide emission “intensity,” or rate of carbon dioxide emitted per kilowatt-hour of electricity generated.  In anticipation of the potential imposition of carbon dioxide emission limits on the electric industry in the future, Entergy initiated actions designed to reduce its exposure to potential new governmental requirements related to carbon dioxide emissions.  These voluntary actions included establishment of a formal program to stabilize power plant carbon dioxide emissions at 2000 levels through 2005, and Entergy succeeded in actually reducing emissions below 2000 levels. Total carbon dioxide emissions representing Entergy’s ownership share of power plants in the United States were approximately 53.2 million tons in 2000 and 35.6 million tons in 2005.  In 2006, Entergy changed its method of calculating emissions and now includes emissions from controllable power purchases as well as its ownership share of generation.  Entergy established a second formal voluntary program to stabilize power plant carbon dioxide emissions and emissions from controllable power purchases at 20% below 2000 levels through 2010.  Entergy has extended this commitment through 2020.  Total carbon dioxide emissions representing Entergy’s ownership share of power plants and controllable power purchases in the United States were approximately 44.9 million tons in 2010 and approximately 46.3 million tons in 2011.

Greenhouse Gas Reporting

In September 2009, the EPA finalized a rule to require reporting of several greenhouse gases.  This rule will require Entergy to report annually greenhouse gas emissions from operating power plants and natural gas distribution operations.  Entergy developed compliance plans, collected the necessary data, and reported as required in 2011.

New Source Performance Standards for Greenhouse Gas Emissions

The EPA announced a schedule for establishing new source performance standards (NSPS) for greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from power plants and refineries.  Under the schedule, the EPA would have issued proposed regulations for power plants by July 26, 2011

and final regulations no later than May 26, 2012.  However, the EPA has not yet issued the proposed regulations.  These regulations would establish GHG NSPS for new and significantly modified sources, and possibly emission guidelines for existing sources.  Entergy will continue to monitor and be engaged in the rulemaking process.

Nelson Unit 6 (Entergy Gulf States Louisiana)

Entergy Gulf States Louisiana self-reported to the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality (LDEQ) potential exceedances of annual carbon monoxide emission limits at the Nelson Unit 6 coal-fired facility for the years 2006-2010 and the failure to report these potential exceedances in semi-annual reporting and in annual Title V compliance certifications.  Entergy Gulf States Louisiana is not required to monitor carbon monoxide emissions from Nelson Unit 6 on a regular or continuous schedule.  Stack tests performed in 2010 appear to indicate carbon monoxide emissions in excess of the maximum hourly limit for three 1-hour test runs and the annual limit.  Comparison of the 2010

stack tests with the most recent previous tests from 2006, however, appear to indicate that the permit limits were calculated incorrectly and should have been higher.  The 2010 test emission levels did not cause a violation of National Ambient Air Quality Standards.  Additionally, the 2010 stack testing, which was performed in compliance with an EPA data request connected to the EPA’s development of a new air emissions rule, was not taken during a period of normal and representative operations for Nelson Unit 6.  Entergy Gulf States Louisiana continues to develop data regarding this matter in coordination with the LDEQ.  In December 2011, the LDEQ issued a compliance order setting limits for the unit until and if the permit is modified and issued a notice of potential penalty requiring the submission of additional information.





Clean Water Act

The 1972 amendments to the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (known as the Clean Water Act) provide the statutory basis for the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit program and the basic structure for regulating the discharge of pollutants from point sources to waters of the United States.  The Clean Water Act requires virtually all discharges of pollutants to waters of the United States to be permitted.  Section 316(b) of the Clean Water Act regulates cooling water intake structures, section 401 of the Clean Water Act requires a water quality certification from the state in support of certain federal actions and approvals, and section 404 regulates the dredge and fill of waters of the United States, including jurisdictional wetlands.

NPDES Permits and Section 401 Water Quality Certifications

NPDES permits are subject to renewal every five years.  Consequently, Entergy is currently in various stages of the data evaluation and discharge permitting process for its power plants.  Additionally, the State of New York (and more recently, Vermont) has taken the position that a new state-issued water quality certification is required as part of the NRC license renewal process.  Entergy Wholesale Commodities’ Indian Point nuclear facility in New York is seeking a new section 401 certification prior to license renewal under full reservation of rights.

Indian Point

Entergy is involved in an administrative permitting process with the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (NYSDEC) for renewal of the Indian Point 2 and Indian Point 3 discharge permits.  In November 2003, the NYSDEC issued a draft permit indicating that closed cycle cooling would be considered the “best technology available” for minimizing alleged adverse environmental effects attributable to the intake of cooling water at Indian Point, subject to a feasibility determination and alternatives analysis for that technology, if Entergy applied for and received NRC license renewal for Indian Point 2 and Indian Point 3.  Upon becoming effective, the draft permit also would have required payment of approximately $24 million annually, and an annual 42 unit-day outage period, until closed cycle cooling is implemented.  Entergy is participating in the administrative process to request that the draft permit be modified prior to final issuance, and opposes any requirement to install cooling towers at Indian Point.

An August 2008 ruling by the NYSDEC’s Assistant Commissioner has restructured the permitting and administrative process, including the application of a new economic test designed to implement the U.S. Second Circuit Court of Appeals standard in that court’s review of EPA’s cooling water intake structure rules, which is discussed in the 316(b) Cooling Water Intake Structures section below.  The NYSDEC has directed Entergy to develop detailed feasibility information regarding the construction and operation of cooling towers, and alternatives to closed cycle cooling, prior to the issuance of a new draft permit by the NYSDEC staff and commencement of the adjudicatory proceeding.  The reports include a visual impact and aesthetics report filed in June 2009, a plume and emissions report filed in September 2009, a technical feasibility report and alternatives analysis filed in February 2010, and an economic report to establish whether the technology, if feasible, satisfies the economic test that is part of the New York standard.  Entergy has also requested that the Assistant Commissioner reconsider the New York standard in light of the U.S. Supreme Court decision reversing the Second Circuit’s alternative economic test adopted in the August 2008 ruling.

In February 2010, Entergy provided to the NYSDEC an updated estimate of the capital cost to retrofit Indian Point 2 and Indian Point 3 with cooling towers.  Construction costs for retrofitting with cooling towers are estimated to be at least $1.19 billion, in addition to lost generation of approximately 14.5 terawatt-hours (TWh) during the forced outage of both units that is estimated to take at least 42 weeks.  Entergy also proposed an alternative to the cooling towers, the use of cylindrical wedgewire screens, the capital costs of which are currently expected to be approximately $200 million to $250 million to install.  Because a cooling tower retrofitting of this size and complexity





has never been undertaken at an operating nuclear facility, significant uncertainties exist in the capital cost estimates and, therefore, the actual capital costs could be materially higher than estimated.  Moreover, construction outage-related costs to Entergy have not been calculated because of the significant variability in power pricing at any given time, but they are expected to be significant and may exceed the capital costs.  The capital cost estimate for the wedgewire screen construction is also subject to uncertainty.  Hearings on certain issues began in 2011 in consolidation with certain issues in the water quality certification matter that is discussed further below.  The NYSDEC is expected to consider the information submitted and issue another draft permit with a new best technology available determination, which could still be cooling towers.  A new comment period and further contested proceedings likely would follow.

Entergy submitted its application for a water quality certification to the NYSDEC in April 2009, with a reservation of rights regarding the applicability of Section 401 in this case.  After Entergy submitted certain additional information in response to NYSDEC requests for additional information, in February 2010 the NYSDEC staff determined that Entergy’s water quality certification application was complete.  In April 2010 the NYSDEC staff issued a proposed notice of denial of Entergy’s water quality certification application (the Notice).  NYSDEC staff’s Notice triggered an administrative adjudicatory hearing before NYSDEC ALJs on the proposed Notice.  The NYSDEC staff decision does not restrict Indian Point operations, but the issuance of a certification is potentially required prior to NRC issuance of renewed unit licenses.

In June 2011, Entergy filed notice with the NRC that the NYSDEC, the agency that would issue or deny a water quality certification for the Indian Point license renewal process, has taken longer than one year to take final action on Entergy’s application for a water quality certification and, therefore, has waived its opportunity to require a certification under the provisions of Section 401 of the Clean Water Act.  The NYSDEC has notified the NRC that it disagrees with Entergy’s position and does not believe that it has waived the right to require a certification.  The NYSDEC ALJs overseeing the agency’s certification adjudicatory process stated in a ruling issued in July 2011 that while the waiver issue is pending before the NRC, the NYSDEC hearing process will continue on selected issues.  The judge held a Legislative Hearing (agency public comment session) and an Issues Conference (pre-trial conference) in July 2010 and set certain issues for trial in October 2011, which is continuing into 2012.  After the full hearing on the merits, the ALJs will issue a recommended decision to the Commissioner who will then issue the final agency decision.  A party to the proceeding can appeal the decision of the Commissioner to state court.

316(b) Cooling Water Intake Structures

EPA finalized regulations in July 2004 governing the intake of water at large existing power plants employing cooling water intake structures.  The rule sought to reduce perceived impacts on aquatic resources by requiring covered facilities to implement technology or other measures to meet EPA-targeted reductions in water use and corresponding perceived aquatic impacts.  Entergy, other industry members and industry groups, environmental groups, and a coalition of northeastern and mid-Atlantic states challenged various aspects of the rule.  In January 2007, the U.S. Second Circuit Court of Appeals remanded the rule to the EPA for reconsideration.  The court instructed the EPA to reconsider several aspects of the rule that were beneficial to businesses affected by the rule after finding that these provisions of the rule were contrary to the language of the Clean Water Act or were not sufficiently explained in the rule.  In April 2008, the U.S. Supreme Court agreed to review the Second Circuit decision on the question of whether the EPA may take into consideration a cost-benefit analysis in developing these regulations, a consideration of potential benefit to businesses affected by the rule that the Second Circuit disallowed.  In March 2009, the Supreme Court ruled in favor of the petitioners that cost-benefit analysis may be taken into consideration.  The EPA reissued the proposed rule in April 2011, with finalization anticipated by July 27, 2012.  Entergy filed comments with the EPA on the proposed rule.

At the request of the EPA Region 1 (Boston), Entergy submitted extensive data to the agency in July 2008 concerning cooling water intake impacts at the Pilgrim nuclear power plant.  The Engineering Study, included as part of the July 2008 submittal, concluded that cooling towers are not feasible due to restrictions in the plant's condenser design and capacity.  Other technologies, such as variable speed pumps and the relocation of the cooling water intake, were also analyzed as part of that submittal.  EPA has not yet responded to the July 2008 submittal.

Entergy will continue to review the revised proposed rule and monitor the activities of the EPA and the states toward the implementation of section 316(b) of the Clean Water Act.  Until analysis of this revised proposed rule is complete, deadlines for determining compliance with Section 316(b) and for any required capital or operational expenditures are unknown at this time.  As a result, management cannot predict the amounts Entergy will ultimately be required to spend to comply with Section 316(b) and any related state regulations, although such amounts could be significant.





Coastal Zone Management Act

The Coastal Zone Management Act (CZMA) requires federally-permitted activities within a coastal zone to be consistent with the state’s federally-approved coastal zone management program.  Accordingly, Entergy must ensure that the requirements of the CZMA, which is administered in New York primarily by the New York Department of State, are satisfied before the NRC may issue renewed licenses for Indian Point 2 and 3.  Indian Point expects to file its consistency determination application with the New York Department of State in 2012.  When the application is deemed complete, the New York Department of State has six months from the date of the application to issue or deny the consistency certification.

Groundwater at Certain Nuclear Sites

The NRC requires nuclear power plants to regularly monitor and report the presence of radioactive material in the environment.  Entergy joined other nuclear utilities and the Nuclear Energy Institute in 2006 to develop a voluntary groundwater monitoring and protection program.  This initiative began after detection of very low levels of radioactive material, primarily tritium, in groundwater at several plants in the United States.  Tritium is a radioactive form of hydrogen that occurs naturally and is also a byproduct of nuclear plant operations.  In addition to tritium, other radionuclides have been found in on site ground water at nuclear plants.

As part of the groundwater monitoring and protection program, Entergy has: (1) performed reviews of plant groundwater characteristics (hydrology) and historical records of past events on site that may have potentially impacted groundwater; (2) implemented fleet procedures on how to handle events that could impact groundwater; and (3) installed groundwater monitoring wells and began periodic sampling.  The program also includes protocols for notifying local officials if contamination is found.  To date, radionuclides such as tritium have been detected at Entergy’s FitzPatrick, Indian Point, Palisades, Pilgrim, Grand Gulf, Vermont Yankee, and River Bend plants.  Based on current information, the concentrations and locations of tritium detected at these plants pose no threat to public health or safety.

At FitzPatrick, twenty-one (21) monitoring wells are installed and being routinely monitored for tritium and other radioisotopes.  Tritium and Strontium-90 have been detected in several of these wells at trace concentrations well below the EPA drinking water standard.  A more significant concentration of tritium was identified in the reactor building perimeter drain piping and associated collection sump.  The site identified the sources as a piping leak that subsequently migrated to the environment via a failed concrete expansion joint.  Repairs to the piping system were completed in September 2010.  There are no drinking water wells on-site.

Entergy identified and addressed two sources of the contamination at Indian Point: the Unit 1 and 2 spent fuel pools.  In October 2007, the EPA announced that it was consulting with the NRC and the NYSDEC regarding Indian Point.  The EPA stated that after reviewing data it confirmed with New York State that there have been no violations of federal drinking water standards for radionuclides in drinking water supplies.  Indian Point has implemented an extensive groundwater monitoring and protection program, including installing approximately 35 monitoring wells.  Entergy has been working cooperatively with the NRC and the NYSDEC in a split sample program to independently analyze test samples.

At Palisades, Entergy identified tritium in two groundwater monitoring wells in December 2007 caused by leakage from the buried piping for a recirculation line.  Following investigation and repair work on this line, the decision was made to abandon the line and install new, replacement buried pipe for this system.  This effort was completed in December 2009.  Groundwater from three site monitoring wells continued to show positive detections of

tritium resulting in renewed investigation and subsequent piping repair during May 2011.  Monitoring wells are being sampled and analyzed on a bi-weekly basis and remaining site monitoring wells are being sampled and analyzed quarterly.





At Pilgrim, 18 monitoring wells are being sampled and analyzed on a routine basis.  Results continue to show low levels of tritium.  A hydrogeological analysis was performed in 2009 to pinpoint locations for additional evaluation wells, and these wells were installed in 2010.  Tritium was discovered in two onsite wells.  Investigations are underway to determine the source of the tritium, and split sampling is being performed routinely with the State of Massachusetts.  In order to further its tritium investigations, Pilgrim added two more groundwater monitoring wells in December 2011, bringing the total number of monitoring wells to 20.  The Pilgrim tritium technical team meets twice per week to discuss investigative options and weekly update calls are held with the Massachusetts Department of Public Health.

At Grand Gulf, groundwater samples collected in June 2010 and thereafter have revealed the presence of low-level tritium.  These groundwater detections are believed to be from a leak of a temporary chiller unit that occurred in 1997.  The leak was detected and halted in 1997, but approximately 1,200 gallons of water spilled from the temporary chiller unit.  In addition to these groundwater samples, certain surface water samples at Grand Gulf also have detected the presence of low-level tritium.  These surface water detections are believed to be from tritium recapture from atmospheric deposition; however, further analysis and investigation are taking place to determine the cause of all the tritium detections.

In January 2010, Vermont Yankee was notified by its off-site analytical laboratory that a sample collected from a groundwater monitoring well in mid-November 2009 showed elevated levels of tritium.  In March 2010, Vermont Yankee announced that it had identified the source of the tritium leakage at the plant, and that it had stopped the leakage.  Remediation of the soil is complete and groundwater remediation is ongoing.  In September 2011 the NRC concluded that Vermont Yankee had complied with all applicable regulatory requirements and standards pertaining to radiological effluent monitoring, dose and assessment and radiological evaluation.  It also found that there has been no impact on public health and safety due to the groundwater contamination event that led to the detection of tritium in groundwater samples in January 2010.

In February 2010 the Vermont Public Service Board (VPSB) began a proceeding to conduct an investigation into whether Vermont Yankee should be required to cease operations, or take other ameliorative actions, pending completion of repairs to stop releases of tritium or other radionuclides into the environment.  This investigation will also consider whether good cause exists to modify or revoke the Vermont Yankee certificate of public good that the VPSB issued in 2002 and whether any penalties should be imposed on Vermont Yankee for any identified violations of Vermont statutes or VPSB orders related to those releases.  The proceeding and VPSB investigation were opened prior to Vermont Yankee locating the source and beginning the remediation of the tritium leaking into groundwater at the site.  The VPSB conceded in its order that its jurisdiction to impose some or all of the relief requested may be preempted by federal law or regulation, and the parties were asked to brief preemption issues during the initial phase of the proceeding.  Initial and reply briefs on the issue of the VPSB’s jurisdiction were filed by the parties, including Vermont Yankee, in August and September 2010.  The VPSB held evidentiary hearings in January 2011 on the facts of the tritium leakage and remediation and on various parties’ requests for relief.  There is no schedule for decision by the VPSB on jurisdiction or other issues.

In December 2011, River Bend sampled a groundwater well previously installed for the purpose of collecting groundwater elevation measurements.  The sample revealed the presence of tritium above the drinking water threshold set by the EPA.  No groundwater wells are used for drinking on-site and tritium was not detected in any wells downgradient or surrounding this well.  Notification was made to the NRC, as well as to state and local agencies.  Entergy is performing an evaluation and review of this condition.

Indian Point Units 1 and 2 Hazardous Waste Remediation

As part of the effort to terminate the current Indian Point 2 mixed waste storage permit, Entergy was required to perform groundwater and soil sampling for metals, PCBs and other non-radiological contaminants on plant property, regardless of whether these contaminants stem from onsite activities or were related to the waste stored on-site pursuant to the permit.  Entergy believes this permit is no longer necessary for the facility due to an exemption for mixed wastes (hazardous waste that is also radioactive) promulgated as part of the EPA’s hazardous waste regulations.  This exemption allows mixed waste to be regulated through the NRC license instead of through a separate





EPA or state hazardous waste permit.  In February 2008, Entergy submitted its report on this sampling effort to the NYSDEC.  The report indicated the presence of various metals in soils and groundwater at levels above the NYSDEC cleanup objectives.  It does not appear that these metals are connected to operation of the nuclear facility.  At the request of the NYSDEC, Entergy submitted a plan in August 2008 for a study that identified the sources of the metals.  The NYSDEC approved the work plan with some conditions related to the need to study whether the soil impact observed may have originated from plant construction materials.  Entergy has conducted additional sampling and currently is evaluating the results in order to provide additional information to the NYSDEC.  Entergy is unable to determine what the extent or cost of required remediation, if any, will be at this time.

Prior to Entergy’s purchase of Indian Point Unit 1, the previous owner completed the cleanup and desludging of the Unit 1 water storage pool, generating mixed waste.  The waste currently is stored in the Unit 1 containment building in accordance with NRC regulations controlling low level radioactive waste.  The waste is also regulated by the NYSDEC.  The NYSDEC requires a quarterly survey of the availability of any commercial facility capable of treating, processing, and disposing of this waste in a commercially reasonable manner.  Entergy continues to review this matter and to conduct its quarterly searches for a commercially reasonable vendor that is acceptable both to the NRC and the NYSDEC.  The cost of this disposal cannot be estimated at this time due to the many variables existing in the type and manner of disposal.

Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980

The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980, as amended (CERCLA), authorizes the EPA to mandate clean-up by, or to collect reimbursement of clean-up costs from, owners or operators of sites at which hazardous substances may be or have been released.  Certain private parties also may use CERCLA to recover response costs.  Parties that transported hazardous substances to these sites or arranged for the disposal of the substances are also deemed liable by CERCLA.  CERCLA has been interpreted to impose strict, joint and several liability on responsible parties.  Entergy subsidiaries in the Utility and Entergy Wholesale Commodities businesses have sent waste materials to various disposal sites over the years, and releases have occurred at Entergy facilities.  In addition, environmental laws now regulate certain of Entergy’s operating procedures and maintenance practices that historically were not subject to regulation.  Some disposal sites used by Entergy subsidiaries have been the subject of governmental action under CERCLA, resulting in site clean-up activities.  Entergy subsidiaries have participated to various degrees in accordance with their respective potential liabilities in such site clean-ups and have developed experience with clean-up costs.  The affected Entergy subsidiaries have established provisions for the liabilities for such environmental clean-up and restoration activities.  Details of CERCLA liabilities that are not

de minimis

are discussed in the “Other Environmental Matters” section below.

Coal Combustion Residuals

In June 2010 the EPA issued a proposed rule on coal combustion residuals (CCRs) that contains two primary regulatory options: (1) regulating CCRs destined for disposal in landfills or received (including stored) in surface impoundments as so-called “special wastes” under the hazardous waste program of RCRA Subtitle C; or (2) regulating CCRs destined for disposal in landfills or surface impoundments as non-hazardous wastes under Subtitle D of RCRA.  Under both options, CCRs that are beneficially used in certain processes would remain excluded from hazardous waste regulation.

The proposed regulations would create new compliance requirements including modified storage, new notification and reporting practices, new financial assurance requirements, and product disposal considerations.  According to EPA estimates, the annualized cost of on-site disposal under the two proposals would be $3.6 million to $9 million for the White Bluff and Independence facilities and $1.7 million to $3.3 million for the Nelson Unit 6 facility.  If Entergy utilized off-site disposal, which it would not plan to do, the EPA’s total cost estimates for disposal of CCRs under Subtitle C regulation ranges from $250 to $350 million per year.





Other Environmental Matters

Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy Texas

Several class action and other suits have been filed in state and federal courts seeking relief from Entergy Gulf States, Inc. and others for damages caused by the disposal of hazardous waste and for asbestos-related disease allegedly resulting from exposure on Entergy Gulf States, Inc.’s premises (see “

Litigation

” below).

Entergy Gulf States Louisiana is currently involved in the second phase of the remedial investigation of the Lake Charles Service Center site, located in Lake Charles, Louisiana.  A manufactured gas plant (MGP) is believed to have operated at this site from approximately 1916 to 1931.  Coal tar, a by-product of the distillation process employed at MGPs, was apparently routed to a portion of the property for disposal.  The same area has also been used as a landfill.  In 1999, Entergy Gulf States, Inc. signed a second administrative consent order with the EPA to perform removal action at the site.  In 2002, approximately 7,400 tons of contaminated soil and debris were excavated and disposed of from an area within the service center.  In 2003, a cap was constructed over the remedial area to prevent the migration of contamination to the surface.  In August 2005, an administrative order was issued by the EPA requiring that a 10-year groundwater study be conducted at this site.  The groundwater monitoring study commenced in January 2006 and is continuing.  Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy Texas each believe that its remaining responsibility for this site will not materially exceed the existing clean-up provisions of $0.5 million for Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and $0.4 million for Entergy Texas.

In 1994, Entergy Gulf States, Inc. performed a site assessment in conjunction with a construction project at the Louisiana Station Generating Plant (Louisiana Station).  In 1995, a further assessment confirmed subsurface soil and groundwater impact to three areas on the plant site.  After validation, a notification was made to the LDEQ and a phased process was executed to remediate each area of concern.  The final phase of groundwater clean-up and monitoring at Louisiana Station is expected to continue for several more years.  Future costs are not expected to exceed Entergy Gulf States Louisiana’s existing provision of $0.7 million.

Entergy Louisiana and Entergy New Orleans

Several class action and other suits have been filed in state and federal courts seeking relief from Entergy Louisiana and Entergy New Orleans and others for damages caused by the disposal of hazardous waste and for asbestos-related disease allegedly resulting from exposure on Entergy Louisiana’s and Entergy New Orleans’s premises (see “

Litigation

” below).

During 1993, the LDEQ issued new rules for solid waste regulation, including regulation of wastewater impoundments.  Entergy Louisiana has determined that some of its power plant wastewater impoundments were affected by these regulations and may require remediation, repair, or closure.  Completion of this work is dependent on pending LDEQ approval of submitted solid waste permit applications.  As a result, a recorded liability in the amount of $1.9 million for Entergy Louisiana existed at December 31, 2011 for ongoing wastewater remediation and repairs and closures.  Management believes this reserve to be adequate based on current estimates.

Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy New Orleans, and Entergy Texas

The Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) notified Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy New Orleans, and Entergy Texas that the TCEQ believes those entities are PRPs concerning contamination existing at the San Angelo Electric Service Company (SESCO) facility in San Angelo, Texas.  The facility operated as a transformer repair and scrapping facility from the 1930s until 2003.  Both soil and groundwater contamination exists at the site.  Entergy Gulf States, Inc. and Entergy Louisiana sent transformers to this facility during the 1980s.  Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, Entergy Texas, Entergy Louisiana, and Entergy Arkansas responded to an information request from the TCEQ and continue to cooperate in this investigation.  Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, Entergy Texas, and Entergy Louisiana joined a group of PRPs responding to site conditions in





cooperation with the State of Texas, creating cost allocation models based on review of SESCO documents and employee interviews, and investigating contribution actions against other PRPs.  Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, Entergy Louisiana, and Entergy Texas have agreed to contribute to the remediation of contaminated soil and groundwater at the site in a measure proportionate to those companies’ involvement at the site, while Entergy Arkansas and Entergy New Orleans likely will pay de minimis amounts.  Current estimates, although preliminary and variable depending on the level of third-party cost contributions, indicate that Entergy’s total share of remediation costs likely will be less than $1 million.  The TCEQ approved an agreed administrative order in September 2006 that allows the implementation of a Remedial Investigation/Feasibility Study at the SESCO site; with the ultimate disposition being a remedial action to remove contaminants of concern.  The TCEQ approved the Remedial Investigation Work Plan in May 2007 and field sampling began in July 2007.  Off-site removal of certain PCB-impacted soil and debris were completed at the site in December 2010.  The Remedial Investigation report was submitted in February 2011 to the TCEQ and was approved on April 15, 2011.  The PRP working group prepared a Feasibility Study and description of proposed site remediation and management actions for TCEQ’s review.  This information was submitted to the TCEQ in June 2011.

Entergy Mississippi, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy New Orleans, and Entergy Texas

The EPA notified Entergy Mississippi, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, Entergy Texas, and Entergy New Orleans that the EPA believes those entities are PRPs concerning contamination of an area known as “Devil’s Swamp Lake” near the Port of Baton Rouge, Louisiana.  The area allegedly was contaminated by the operations of Rollins Environmental (LA), Inc, which operated a disposal facility to which many companies contributed waste.  Documents provided by the EPA indicate that Entergy Louisiana may also be a PRP.  Entergy continues to monitor this developing situation.

Entergy

In November 2010 a transformer at the Indian Point facility failed, resulting in a fire and the release of non-PCB oil to the ground surface.  The fire was extinguished by the facility’s fire deluge system.  No injuries occurred due to the transformer failure or company response.  Non-PCB oil and deluge water were released into the facility’s discharge canal and the environment surrounding the transformer and discharge canal, including the Hudson River, as a result of the failure, fire, and fire suppression.  Once the fire was extinguished, Indian Point personnel and contractors began recovering the oil from the damaged transformer, the transformer containment moat, and the area surrounding the transformer.  The State of New York has indicated its intention to assess a penalty due to the release of oil to waters of the state and the failure of the transformer containment moat to prevent this release of oil.  Discussions with the state continue.

Litigation

Entergy uses legal and appropriate means to contest litigation threatened or filed against it, but certain states in which Entergy operates have proven to be unusually litigious environments.  Judges and juries in Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas have demonstrated a willingness to grant large verdicts, including punitive damages, to plaintiffs in personal injury, property damage, and business tort cases.  The litigation environment in these states poses a significant business risk to Entergy.

Ratepayer and Fuel Cost Recovery Lawsuits

(Entergy Corporation, Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, Entergy New Orleans, and Entergy Texas)

Texas Power Price Lawsuit

In August 2003, a lawsuit was filed in the district court of Chambers County, Texas by Texas residents on behalf of a purported class apparently of the Texas retail customers of Entergy Gulf States, Inc. who were billed and paid for electric power from January 1, 1994 to the present.  The named defendants include Entergy Corporation, Entergy Services, Entergy Power, Entergy Power Marketing Corp., and Entergy Arkansas.  Entergy Gulf States, Inc. was not a named defendant, but is alleged to be a co-conspirator.  The court granted the request of Entergy Gulf States, Inc. to intervene in the lawsuit to protect its interests.





Plaintiffs allege that the defendants implemented a “price gouging accounting scheme” to sell to plaintiffs and similarly situated utility customers higher priced power generated by the defendants while rejecting and/or reselling to off-system utilities less expensive power offered and/or purchased from off-system suppliers and/or generated by the Entergy system.  In particular, plaintiffs allege that the defendants manipulated and continue to manipulate the dispatch of generation so that power is purchased from affiliated expensive resources instead of buying cheaper off-system power.

Plaintiffs stated in their pleadings that customers in Texas were charged at least $57 million above prevailing market prices for power.  Plaintiffs seek actual, consequential and exemplary damages, costs and attorneys’ fees, and disgorgement of profits.  The plaintiffs’ experts have tendered a report calculating damages in a large range, from $153 million to $972 million in present value, under various scenarios.  The Entergy defendants have tendered expert reports challenging the assumptions, methodologies, and conclusions of the plaintiffs’ expert reports.

The case is pending in state district court, and a class certification hearing was held in August 2011.  The decision of the court on class certification is pending.

Mississippi Attorney General Complaint

The Mississippi attorney general filed a complaint in state court in December 2008 against Entergy Corporation, Entergy Mississippi, Entergy Services, and Entergy Power alleging, among other things, violations of Mississippi statutes, fraud, and breach of good faith and fair dealing, and requesting an accounting and restitution.  The litigation is wide ranging and relates to tariffs and procedures under which Entergy Mississippi purchases power not generated in Mississippi to meet electricity demand.  Entergy believes the complaint is unfounded.  On December 29, 2008, the defendant Entergy companies filed to remove the attorney general’s suit to U.S. District Court (the forum that Entergy believes is appropriate to resolve the types of federal issues raised in the suit), where it is currently pending, and additionally answered the complaint and filed a counter-claim for relief based upon the Mississippi Public Utilities Act and the Federal Power Act.  The Mississippi attorney general has filed a pleading seeking to remand the matter to state court.  In May 2009, the defendant Entergy companies filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings asserting grounds of federal preemption, the exclusive jurisdiction of the MPSC, and factual errors in the attorney general’s complaint.

In July 2011, the attorney general requested a status conference regarding its motion to remand.  The court granted the attorney general’s request for a status conference, which was held in September 2011.  Consistent with the court’s instructions, both parties submitted letters to the court in September 2011 providing updates on the facts of the case and the law, and the court has now taken the parties’ arguments under advisement.

Fiber Optic Cable Litigation

(Entergy Corporation and Entergy Louisiana)

Several property owners have filed a class action suit against Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Services, ETHC, and Entergy Technology Company in state court in St. James Parish, Louisiana purportedly on behalf of all property owners in Louisiana who have conveyed easements to the defendants.  The lawsuit alleges that Entergy installed fiber optic cable across the plaintiffs’ property without obtaining appropriate easements.  The plaintiffs seek damages equal to the fair market value of the surplus fiber optic cable capacity, including a share of the profits made through use of the fiber optic cables, and punitive damages.  Entergy removed the case to federal court in New Orleans; however, the district court remanded the case back to state court.  In February 2004, the state court entered an order certifying this matter as a class action.  Entergy’s appeals of this ruling were denied.  The parties have entered into a term sheet establishing basic terms for a settlement that must be approved by the court.





Asbestos Litigation

(Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, Entergy New Orleans, and Entergy Texas)

Numerous lawsuits have been filed in federal and state courts primarily in Texas and Louisiana, primarily by contractor employees who worked in the 1940-1980s timeframe, against Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy Texas, and to a lesser extent the other Utility operating companies, as premises owners of power plants, for damages caused by alleged exposure to asbestos.  Many other defendants are named in these lawsuits as well.  Currently, there are approximately 500 lawsuits involving approximately 5,000 claimants.  Management believes that adequate provisions have been established to cover any exposure.  Additionally, negotiations continue with insurers to recover reimbursements.  Management believes that loss exposure has been and will continue to be handled so that the ultimate resolution of these matters will not be material, in the aggregate, to the financial position or results of operation of the Utility operating companies.

Employment and Labor-related Proceedings

(Entergy Corporation, Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, Entergy New Orleans, Entergy Texas, and System Energy)

The Registrant Subsidiaries and other Entergy subsidiaries are responding to various lawsuits in both state and federal courts and to other labor-related proceedings filed by current and former employees.  Generally, the amount of damages being sought is not specified in these proceedings.  These actions include, but are not limited to, allegations of wrongful employment actions; wage disputes and other claims under the Fair Labor Standards Act or its state counterparts; claims of race, gender and disability discrimination; disputes arising under collective bargaining agreements; unfair labor practice proceedings and other administrative proceedings before the National Labor Relations Board; claims of retaliation; and claims for or regarding benefits under various Entergy Corporation sponsored plans. Entergy and the Registrant Subsidiaries are responding to these suits and proceedings and deny liability to the claimants.
