(“SEC”) was declared effective on October 6, 2011. Xylem’s common stock began “regular-way” trading on the New York Stock Exchange on November 1, 2011 under the symbol “XYL”.

Business Overview

Xylem, with 2011 revenue of $3.8 billion,
is a world leader in the design, manufacturing, and application of highly engineered technologies for the water industry. We are a leading equipment and service provider for water and wastewater applications with a broad portfolio of products and
services addressing the full cycle of water, from collection, distribution and use to the return of water to the environment. We have leading market







positions among equipment and service providers in the core application areas of the water equipment industry: transport, treatment, test, building services, industrial processing and irrigation.
Our Company’s brands, such as Bell & Gossett and Flygt, are well known throughout the industry and have served the water market for many years.

We operate in two segments, Water Infrastructure and Applied Water. The Water Infrastructure segment focuses on the transportation, treatment and testing of water, offering a range of products including water and
wastewater pumps, treatment and testing equipment, and controls and systems. Key brands in this segment include Flygt, Wedeco, Godwin Pumps, WTW, Sanitaire, AADI and Leopold. The Applied Water segment encompasses the uses of water and focuses on the
residential, commercial, industrial and agricultural markets. The segment’s major products include pumps, valves, heat exchangers, controls and dispensing equipment. Key brands in this segment include Goulds Water Technology
(“Goulds”), Bell & Gossett, AC Fire, Standard, Flojet, Lowara, Jabsco and Flowtronex. In both our segments, we benefit from a large and growing installed base of products driving growth in aftermarket revenue for replacement parts
and services.

We serve a global customer base across diverse end markets while offering localized expertise. We sell our products in more than 150
countries through a balanced distribution network consisting of our direct sales force and independent channel partners. In 2011, approximately 64% of our revenues were generated outside the United States.

Our Industry

Our planet faces a serious water challenge.
Less than 1% of the total water available on earth is fresh water, which is declining due to factors such as the draining of aquifers, increased pollution and climate change. In addition to this declining supply, demand is rising rapidly due to
population growth, industrial expansion, and increased agricultural development, with consumption estimated to double every 20 years. By 2025, over 30% of the world’s population is expected to live in areas without adequate water supply. Even
in developed countries with sufficient supply, existing infrastructure for water supply is relatively underfunded and aging. In the United States, degrading pipe systems leak one out of every six gallons of water, on average, on its way from a
treatment plant to the customer. These challenges are driving opportunities for growth in the global water industry, which we estimate to have a total market size of $500 billion.

The water industry supply chain is comprised of Equipment and Services companies, Design and Build service providers, and water utilities. Equipment and Service providers serve two distinct customer types. The
first, utilities, supplies water through an infrastructure network. Companies that operate on this side of the supply chain provide single, or sometimes combined, functions from equipment manufacturing and services to facility design (engineering,
procurement and construction, or “EPC” firms) to plant operations (utilities), as depicted below in Figure 1. The utility and EPC customers are looking for technology and application expertise from their Equipment and Services providers,
due to trends such as rising pollution, stricter regulations, and the increased outsourcing of process knowledge by utilities. The second customer type, the end users of water, comprises a wide array of entities, ranging from farms to power plants
to residential homes. These customers are predominately served through specialized distributors and original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”).













Figure 1:Water Industry Supply Chain, based upon Global Water Intelligence’s “Global Water Market 2011” and Management Estimates

Our business focuses on the beginning of the supply chain, by providing technology-intensive equipment and services. We sell our equipment and services via direct
and indirect channels that serve the needs of each customer type. On the utility side, we provide over 70% direct sales with strong application expertise, with the remaining amount going through distribution partners. To end users of water, we
provide over 85% of our sales through long-standing relationships with the world’s leading distributors, with the remainder going direct to customers. The total market opportunity for this Equipment and Services portion of the water industry
supply chain is estimated at $280 billion.

The Equipment and Services market addresses the key processes of the water industry, which is best
illustrated through the cycle of water, as depicted in Figure 2, below. We believe this industry has two distinct sectors within the cycle of water: Supply Infrastructure and Usage Applications. The key processes of this cycle begin when raw water
is extracted by pumps, which provide the necessary pressure and flow, to move, or Transport, this water from natural sources, such as lakes, oceans or aquifers, through pipes to a treatment facility. Treatment facilities can provide many forms of
treatment, such as filtration, disinfection and desalination, to remove solids, bacteria, and salt, respectively. A network of pipes and pumps again Transports this clean water to where it is needed, such as to crops for Irrigation, to power plants
to provide cooling in Industrial Water, or to an apartment building as drinking water in Residential and Commercial Building Services. After usage, the wastewater is collected by a separate network of pipes and pumps and transported to a wastewater
treatment facility, where processes such as digestion deactivate and reduce the volume of solids, and disinfection purifies effluent water. Once treated, analytical instruments Test the treated water to ensure regulatory requirements are met so that
it can be discharged back to the environment, thereby completing the cycle.













Figure 2:Cycle of Water

Our two operating segments are aligned with
each of the sectors in the cycle of water: Water Infrastructure serves the Supply Infrastructure sector, and Applied Water serves Usage Applications. Within the Supply Infrastructure sector, our pump systems Transport water from aquifers, lakes,
rivers and seas. From there, our filtration, UV and ozone systems provide Treatment, making the water fit for use. After consumption, our pump lift stations move the wastewater to treatment facilities where our mixers, biological treatment,
monitoring, and control systems provide the primary functions in the treatment process. Throughout each of these stages, our analytical systems Test and ensure water quality, allowing the water to be consumed and returned to nature. Our served
market size in this sector is approximately $16 billion.

In the Usage Applications sector, we participate in all major areas of water demand.
Irrigation is approximately 70% of all water usage globally. Examples of what we provide include: boosting systems for farming irrigation, pumps for dairy operations, and rainwater reuse systems for small scale crop and turf irrigation. Industrial
Water applications account for 20% of global consumption. Our pumps, heat exchangers, valves and controls provide cooling to power plants and manufacturing facilities, as well as circulation for food and beverage processing. The remaining 10% of
global water use resides in human and building consumption, where we deliver water boosting systems for drinking, heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) and fire protection systems to Residential and Commercial Building Services. Our
served market size in this sector is estimated at $14 billion.

Customers in the water industry vary by end market. Two end markets exist within the
Supply Infrastructure sector: public utility and industrial, representing 85% and 15% of the total equipment and services market, respectively. The public utility market comprises public, private and public-private institutions that handle water and
wastewater for mostly residential and commercial purposes. The industrial market involves the supply of water and removal of wastewater for industrial facilities. We view the main macro drivers of this sector to be water quality, the desire for
energy-efficient products, water scarcity and infrastructure needs, for both the







repair of aging systems in developed countries and new installations in developing countries. These markets tend to be less cyclical and are estimated to grow annually in the mid-single digits
through 2015, according to management estimates.

In the Usage Applications sector, end-use customers fall into four main markets: residential,
commercial, industrial and agricultural. Homeowners represent the end users in the residential market. Owners and managers of properties such as apartment buildings, retail stores, restaurants, hospitals, and hotels are examples of end users in the
commercial market. The industrial market is wide ranging, involving developers and managers of facilities operated by electrical power generators, chemical manufacturers, machine shops, clothing manufacturers, beverage production and dispensing
firms and car washes. The agricultural market end users are owners and operators of businesses such as crop and livestock farms, aquaculture, golf courses, and other turf applications. We believe population growth and urbanization are the two
primary macro drivers of these markets, as these trends drive the need for housing, food, community services and retail goods within growing city centers. Water reuse and conservation are driving the need for new technologies. Annual total market
growth in these industrial, commercial, residential, and agricultural markets is estimated to be in the low- to mid-single digits through 2015, according to management estimates.

In recent years, we have expanded our capabilities in Treatment, the cleaning of water and wastewater, and Test, the measurement of
water characteristics such as quality. Both of these application areas, Treatment and Test, reside within the Water Infrastructure segment.

Water
Infrastructure

Water Infrastructure involves the process that collects water from a source and distributes it to users, and then returns the
wastewater responsibly to the environment. Water Infrastructure serves three basic closely-linked applications: Transport, Treatment and Test of water and wastewater for two types of customers: public utilities and industrial facilities.

Transport

The Transport application
includes all of the equipment and services involved in the safe and efficient movement of water from sources, such as oceans, lakes, rivers and ground water, to treatment facilities, and then to users. It also includes the movement of wastewater
from the point of use to a treatment facility and then back into the environment. We serve the higher-value equipment markets, such as water and wastewater submersible pumps, monitoring controls, and application solutions; we do not serve the market
for lower-value equipment such as pipes and fittings. We believe our business is the largest player in this served market based on management estimates. With operations on six continents, we also have the world’s largest dewatering rental
fleet, serviced with our Flygt and Godwin brands. In our Water Infrastructure Segment, Transport accounted for approximately 73% of our consolidated revenue in 2011 and 74% of our consolidated revenue in 2010.







Flygt — Flygt is the world’s premier manufacturer of submersible pumps, mixers, and aeration equipment for
use in environments such as water and wastewater treatment, raw water supply, abrasive or contaminated industrial processes, mining and crop irrigation. The Flygt brand was founded in 1901 in Lindås, Sweden and developed the world’s first
submersible close-coupled motor-driven pump. Flygt products have leading non-clogging capabilities and innovative N-technology, which provide customers with highly sustainable efficiencies and lowest total cost of ownership. Flygt products have
applications in various markets, including wastewater lift stations, water and wastewater treatment facilities, pressurized sewage systems, oil and gas, steel, mining and leisure markets. Customers include public utility wastewater and clean water

the Clari-DAF system is used to clarify raw water to remove contaminants such as turbidity, algae, color, iron/ manganese, organics, and taste and odor compounds. In public utility wastewater treatment plants, the ClariVAC system is used in final
clarifiers to remove the sludge solids. For those areas where nitrogen and phosphorus nutrient removal is required, we provide elimi-NITE systems which convert the filters to become biologically active so that the effluent meets the mandated nitrate
and phosphorus levels. In desalination systems, Leopold Clari-DAF systems and Filterworx systems are provided to remove contaminants that will harm reverse osmosis membranes, so that salt can be removed from the seawater to make it potable. Primary
customers are public utility water and wastewater systems, as well as desalination plant facilities.

Test

Analytical instrumentation is used across most industries to ensure regulatory requirements are met. Growth in this market is primarily driven by increasing
regulation of water and wastewater in North America, Europe and Asia. Largely through our 2010 acquisition of Nova Analytics, our served market is predominately focused on water and the environment for quality levels throughout the water
infrastructure loop. Analytical systems are applied in three primary ways: in the field, in a facility laboratory, or real time, online monitoring in a treatment facility process. We believe we have a leading position in this served market based on
management estimates. In our Water Infrastructure Segment, Test accounted for approximately 9% of our consolidated net sales in 2011 and 6% of our consolidated net sales in 2010.

WTW — In wastewater treatment facilities, WTW-branded systems monitor parameters such as dissolved oxygen, pH, and turbidity throughout the water process to ensure regulatory standards are met before water is
discharged back into the environment. Founded in 1945 as a major brand in Europe, WTW has particularly strong market penetration in the environmental, water and wastewater segments. WTW holds leading market positions in both field and on-line

Distribution, Training and End Use

Water Infrastructure provides more than 70% of its sales through direct channels with remaining sales through indirect channels and service capabilities. Both public utility and industrial facility customers
increasingly require our teams’ global but locally proficient expertise to use our equipment in their specific applications. Several trends are increasing the need for this application expertise: (i) the increase in type and amount of
contaminants in water supply, (ii) increasing environmental regulations, (iii) the need to increase system efficiencies due to rising energy costs, and (iv) the retirement of a largely aging water industry workforce not systematically
replaced at utilities.

In the Applied Water segment, many end-use areas are widely different, so specialized distribution partners are often preferred.
Our commercial teams have built long-standing relationships around our brands in many of these industries through which we can continue to leverage new product and service applications. Revenue opportunities are balanced between OEM and after-market
customers. Our products in the Applied Water segment are sold through our global direct sales and world-class indirect channels with more than 85% of revenue going through indirect channels. We have long-standing relationships with the leading
independent distributors in the markets we serve, and we provide incentives to distributors, such as specialized training programs, to exclusively sell our products.

Aftermarket Parts and Service

We have more than 120 service centers around the world which employ
approximately 600 service employees to provide aftermarket parts and services to our customers. During their lifecycle, installed products require maintenance, repair services and parts due to the harsh environments in which they operate.

In addition, depending on the type of product, median lifecycles range from 5 years to over 50 years, at which time they must be replaced.
Many of our products are precisely selected and applied within a larger network of equipment driving a strong preference by customers and installers to replace them with the same exact brand and model when they reach the end of their lifecycle. This
dynamic establishes a large recurring revenue stream for our business.

Supply and Seasonality

We have a global manufacturing footprint, with production facilities in Europe, North America, Latin America, and Asia. In addition, we maintain a global network of
service centers providing after-market customer care. Service centers offer an array of integrated service solutions for the industry including: preventive monitoring, contract maintenance, emergency field service, engineered upgrades, inventory
management, and overhauls for pumps and other rotating equipment.

We offer a wide range of highly engineered products. We primarily employ
configure-to-order capabilities to maximize manufacturing and logistics efficiencies by producing high volumes of basic product configurations. When we provide a configure-to-order solution, we configure a standard product to our customers’
specifications. To a lesser extent, we provide engineer-to-order products to meet the customization requirements of our customers. This process requires that we apply our technical expertise and production capabilities to provide a non-standard
solution to the customer.

Our inventory management and distribution practices seek to minimize inventory holding periods by taking delivery of the
inventory and manufacturing immediately prior to the sale or distribution of products to our







customers. All of our businesses require various parts and raw materials, the availability and prices of which may fluctuate. Parts and raw materials commonly used in our products include motors,
fabricated parts, castings, bearings, seals, nickel, copper, aluminum, and plastics. While we may recover some cost increases through operational improvements, we are still exposed to some pricing risk. We attempt to control costs through
fixed-priced contracts with suppliers and various other programs, such as our global strategic sourcing initiative.

Our business relies on third-party
suppliers, contract manufacturing and commodity markets to secure raw materials, parts and components used in our products. We typically acquire materials and components through a combination of blanket and scheduled purchase orders to support our
materials requirements. For most of our products, we have existing alternate sources of supply, or such sources are readily available.

We may
experience price volatility or supply constraints for materials that are not available from multiple sources. From time to time, we acquire certain inventory in anticipation of supply constraints or enter into longer-term pricing commitments with
vendors to improve the priority, price and availability of supply. There have been no raw material shortages that have had a significant adverse impact on our business as a whole.

Customers

Our business is not dependent on any single customer or a few customers, the loss of which would
have a material adverse effect on the respective market or on us as a whole. No individual customer accounted for more than 10% of our consolidated 2011 revenue.

Backlog

Delivery schedules vary from customer to customer based upon their requirements. Typically, large
projects require longer lead production cycles and delays can occur from time to time. Total backlog was $651 million at December 31, 2011 and $620 million at December 31, 2010. We anticipate that in excess of 80% of the backlog at
December 31, 2011 will be recognized as revenue during 2012.

Competition

Given the highly fragmented nature of the water industry, Water Infrastructure competes with a large number of businesses. Competition in the water transport and treatment technologies markets focuses on product
performance, application expertise, design, quality, delivery, and price. In the sale of products and services, we benefit from our large installed base of pumps and complementary products, which require maintenance, repair and replacement parts due
to the nature of the products and the conditions under which they operate. Timeliness of delivery, quality and the proximity of service centers are important customer considerations when selecting a provider for after-market products and services as
well as equipment rentals. In geographic regions where we are locally positioned to provide a quick response, customers have historically relied on us, rather than our competitors, for after-market products relating to our highly engineered and
customized solutions.

Competition in the Applied Water segment focuses on brand names, application expertise, product delivery and performance,
quality, and price. We compete by offering a wide variety of innovative and high quality products, coupled with world-class application expertise. We believe our distribution through well-established channels and our reputation for quality
significantly enhance our market position. Our ability to deliver innovative product offerings has allowed us to compete effectively, to cultivate and maintain customer relationships and to serve and to expand into many niche and new markets.

Research and Development

Research and
development (“R&D”) is a key element of our engineering culture and is generally focused on the design and development of products and application know-how that anticipate customer needs and emerging trends. Our engineers are involved
in new product development and improvement of existing products. Our businesses invest substantial resources for R&D. We anticipate we will continue to develop and invest in our R&D capabilities to promote a steady flow of innovative,
high-quality and reliable products and applications to further strengthen our position in the markets we serve. We invested $100 million, $74 million, and $63 million for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively, towards
R&D.







We have over 600 engineering and research employees in more than 40 technology centers around the world. R&D
activities are initially conducted in our technology centers, located in conjunction with some of our major manufacturing facilities to ensure an efficient development process. We have established a wastewater Center of Excellence in Stockholm,
Sweden, with over 100 research, development and engineering employees. We have launched Centers of Excellence in India and China, where we are accelerating the customization of our application expertise to local needs. In the scale-up process, our
R&D activities are conducted at our piloting and testing facilities or at strategic customer sites. These piloting and testing facilities enable us to serve our strategic markets in each region of the world.

We generally seek patent protection for those inventions and improvements likely to be incorporated into our products or where proprietary rights will improve our
competitive position. We believe that our patents and applications are important for maintaining the competitive differentiation of our products and improving our return on research and development investments. While we own, control or license a
significant number of patents, trade secrets, confidential information, trademarks, trade names, copyrights, and other intellectual property rights which, in the aggregate, are of material importance to our business, management believes that our
business, as a whole, as well as each of our core business segments, is not materially dependent on any one intellectual property right or related group of such rights.

Patents, patent applications, and license agreements expire or terminate over time by operation of law, in accordance with their terms or otherwise. As the portfolio of our patents, patent applications, and license
agreements has evolved over time, we do not expect the expiration of any specific patent to have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

Environmental Matters and Regulation

Our manufacturing operations worldwide are subject to many requirements
under environmental laws. In the United States, the Environmental Protection Agency and similar state agencies administer laws and regulations concerning air emissions, water discharges, waste disposal, environmental remediation, and other aspects
of environmental protection. Such environmental laws and regulations in the United States include, for example, the Federal Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the Resource, Conservation and Recovery Act, and the Comprehensive Environmental
Response, Compensation and Liability Act. Environmental requirements significantly affect our operations. We have established an internal program to address compliance with applicable environmental requirements and, as a result, management believes
that we are in substantial compliance with current environmental regulations.

While environmental laws and regulations are subject to change, such
changes can be difficult to predict reliably and the timing of potential changes is uncertain. Management does not believe, based on current circumstances, that compliance costs pursuant to such regulations will have a material adverse effect on our
financial position, results of operations or cash flows. However, the effect of future legislative or regulatory changes could be material to our financial condition or results of operations.

Accruals for environmental matters are recorded on a site-by-site basis when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated, based on current law and
existing technologies. It can be difficult to estimate reliably the final costs of investigation and remediation due to various factors. Our accrued liabilities for these environmental matters represent the best estimates related to the
investigation and remediation of environmental media such as water, soil, soil vapor, air and structures, as well as related legal fees based upon the facts and circumstances as currently known to us. These estimates, and related accruals, are
reviewed quarterly and updated for progress of investigation and remediation efforts and changes in facts and legal circumstances. Liabilities for these environmental expenditures are recorded on an undiscounted basis. We do not anticipate these
liabilities will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated and combined financial position, results of operations or cash flows. We cannot make assurances that other sites, or new details about sites known to us, that could give rise to
environmental liabilities with such material adverse effects on us will not be identified in the future. At December 31, 2011, we had estimated and accrued $15 million related to environmental matters.
