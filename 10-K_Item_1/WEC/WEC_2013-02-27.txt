ITEM 1.BUSINESS





INTRODUCTION



Wisconsin Energy Corporation was incorporated in the state of Wisconsin in 1981 and became a diversified holding company in 1986. We maintain our principal executive offices in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Unless qualified by their context when used in this document, the terms Wisconsin Energy, the Company, our, us or we refer to the holding company and all of its subsidiaries.



We conduct our operations primarily in two reportable segments: a utility energy segment and a non-utility energy segment. Our primary subsidiaries are Wisconsin Electric Power Company (Wisconsin Electric), Wisconsin Gas LLC (Wisconsin Gas) and W.E. Power, LLC (We Power).



Utility Energy Segment:Our utility energy segment consists of Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Gas, operating together under the trade name of "We Energies." We Energies serves approximately1,125,700electric customers in Wisconsin and the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. We Energies serves approximately1,074,000gas customers in Wisconsin and approximately460steam customers in metropolitan Milwaukee, Wisconsin.



Non-Utility Energy Segment:Our non-utility energy segment consists primarily of We Power, which owns and leases to Wisconsin Electric generation plants constructed as part of our PTF strategy. All four of the plants constructed as part of Power the Future (PTF) have been placed in service. Port Washington Generating Station Unit 1 (PWGS 1) and Port Washington Generating Station Unit 2 (PWGS 2) are being leased to Wisconsin Electric under long-term leases that run for 25 years. Oak Creek expansion Unit 1 (OC 1) and Oak Creek expansion Unit 2 (OC 2) are being leased to Wisconsin Electric under long-term leases that run for 30 years.

Our annual and periodical filings with the SEC are available, free of charge, through our Internet website www.wisconsinenergy.com. These documents are available as soon as reasonably practicable after such materials are filed (or furnished) with the SEC.







UTILITY ENERGY SEGMENT





ELECTRIC UTILITY OPERATIONS



Our electric utility operations consist of the electric operations of Wisconsin Electric. Wisconsin Electric, which is the largest electric utility in the state of Wisconsin, generates and distributes electric energy in a territory that includes southeastern (including the metropolitan Milwaukee area), east central and northern Wisconsin and the Upper Peninsula of Michigan.



Wisconsin Electric participates in the MISO Energy Markets. The competitiveness of our generation offered in the MISO Energy Markets affects how our generating units are dispatched and how we buy and sell power. For further information, see Factors Affecting Results, Liquidity and Capital Resources in Item 7.



Electric Sales



Our electric energy sales to all classes of customers totaled approximately30.3 millionMWh during2012and approximately31.3 millionMWh during2011. We had approximately1,125,700electric customers as ofDecember 31, 2012and1,122,500electric customers as ofDecember 31, 2011.



Wisconsin Electric is authorized to provide retail electric service in designated territories in the state of Wisconsin, as established by indeterminate permits, Certificates of Public Convenience and Necessity (CPCNs) or boundary agreements with other utilities, and in certain territories in the state of Michigan pursuant to franchises granted by municipalities. Wisconsin Electric also sells wholesale electric power within the MISO Energy Markets.

ITEM 1.     BUSINESS - (Cont'd)2012 Form 10-K



Electric Sales Growth:Our service territory experienced flat sales in 2012 as positive customer growth was offset by reduced use per customer. Our weather normalized 2012 retail electric sales, excluding our two largest customers (two iron ore mines) and two large industrial customers that switched to self-generation, were almost equal to our normalized 2011 electric sales. Assuming continuing improvement in the economy over the five-year forecast horizon, we presently anticipate that total retail electric kWh sales and the associated peak electric demand will grow at annual rates of 0.5% to 1.0% over the next five years (excluding sales to the two iron ore mines). These estimates assume normal weather.



Sales to Large Electric Retail Customers:We provide electric utility service to a diversified base of customers in such industries as mining, paper, foundry, food products and machinery production, as well as to large retail chains.



Our largest retail electric customers are two iron ore mines located in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. The combined electric energy sales to the two mines accounted for 6.6% and 7.1% of our total electric utility energy sales during2012and2011, respectively. The mines have notified us that they expect production at one of the mines to be reduced in 2013.



Sales to Wholesale Customers:During2012, we sold wholesale electric energy to one municipally owned system, two rural cooperatives and two municipal joint action agencies located in the states of Wisconsin and Michigan. Our wholesale electric energy sales were also made to 16 other public utilities and power marketers throughout the region under rates approved by FERC. Wholesale sales accounted for approximately10.6%of our total electric energy sales and6.2%of total electric operating revenues during2012, compared with13.1%of total electric energy sales and7.0%of total electric operating revenues during2011.



Electric System Reliability Matters:Our electric sales are impacted by seasonal factors and varying weather conditions. We sell more electricity during the summer months because of the residential cooling load. The Public Service Commission of Wisconsin (PSCW) has planning reserve requirements consistent with the MISO calculated planning reserve margin. The Michigan Public Service Commission (MPSC) has not yet established guidelines in this area. In accordance with the MISO calculated planning reserve margin requirements, we had adequate capacity to meet all of our firm electric load obligations during2012and expect to have adequate capacity to meet all of our firm obligations during2013. For additional information, see Factors Affecting Results, Liquidity and Capital Resources in Item 7.



Competition



The regulated energy industry continues to experience significant structural changes. Increased competition in the retail and wholesale markets may result from restructuring efforts. It is uncertain when, if ever, retail access might be implemented in Wisconsin. Michigan has adopted retail choice which allows customers to remain with their regulated utility at regulated rates or choose an alternative electric supplier to provide power supply service. We continue providing distribution and customer service functions regardless of the customer's power supplier. Although competition and customer switching to alternative suppliers in our service territories in Michigan has been limited, the additional competitive pressures resulting from retail access could lead to a loss of customers.



Electric Supply



Our electric supply strategy is to provide our customers with energy from plants using a diverse fuel mix that is expected to maintain a stable, reliable and affordable supply of electricity. We supply a significant amount of electricity to our customers from power plants that we own. We supplement our internally generated power supply with long-term power purchase agreements, including the Point Beach Nuclear Power Plant (Point Beach) power purchase agreement discussed later in this report, and through spot purchases in the MISO Energy Markets.

Historically, coal has been purchased under long-term contracts, which helped with price stability. Coal and associated transportation services have continued to see volatility in pricing due to increased domestic and world-wide demand for coal and the impacts of diesel costs which are incorporated into fuel surcharges on rail transportation.



Natural gas costs have been volatile. We have a PSCW-approved hedging program to help manage our natural gas price risk. This hedging program is generally implemented on a 36-month forward-looking basis. Proceeds related to the natural gas hedging program are reflected in the average costs of natural gas and purchased power shown

above.



Coal-Fired Generation



Coal Supply:We diversify the coal supply for our power plants by purchasing coal from mines in Wyoming, Pennsylvania and Montana, as well as from various other states. During2013, 90% of our projected coal requirements of 10.7 million tons are under contracts which are not tied to2013market pricing fluctuations. At the end of2012, our coal-fired generation consisted of six operating plants with a dependable capability of approximately3,828MW.



The annual tonnage amounts contracted for2013through2015are as follows:



YearAnnual Tonnage(Thousands)20139,58620145,75320154,000



Coal Deliveries:All of our2013coal requirements are expected to be delivered by Wisconsin Electric-owned or leased unit trains. The unit trains will transport coal for the Oak Creek and Pleasant Prairie Power Plants from Wyoming mines, and transport coal for the Oak Creek expansion units from Pennsylvania and Wyoming. Coal from a Montana mine is also transported via rail to Lake Michigan transfer docks and delivered by lake vessel to the Milwaukee harbor for Milwaukee-based power plants. Montana and Wyoming coal for the Presque Isle Power Plant is transported via rail to Superior, Wisconsin, placed in dock storage and reloaded into lake vessels for plant delivery.



Certain of our coal transportation contracts contain fuel cost adjustments that are tied to changes in diesel fuel and crude oil prices. Currently, diesel fuel contracts are not actively traded; therefore, we use financial heating oil contracts to mitigate risk related to diesel fuel prices. We have a PSCW-approved hedging program that allows us to hedge up to 75% of our potential risks related to fuel surcharge exposure. The costs of this program are included in our fuel and purchased power costs.



Edgewater Generating Unit 5:On March 1, 2011, we sold our 25% interest in Edgewater Generating Unit 5 to Wisconsin Power and Light Company, a subsidiary of Alliant Energy Corp. (WPL), for our net book value, including working capital, of approximately $38 million.



Wolverine Joint Ownership Agreement:In November 2012, we entered into a joint ownership agreement with Wolverine Power Supply Cooperative, Inc. (Wolverine) regarding the Presque Isle Power Plant (PIPP), whereby Wolverine will pay for the installation of environmental controls at the plant and will receive a minority ownership interest in the plant in return. We will continue to operate the plant. The transaction and the environmental controls to be installed will require approvals from various state and federal agencies, including the PSCW, the MPSC, the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality and the FERC.



Environmental Matters:For information regarding emission restrictions, especially as they relate to coal-fired generating facilities, see Factors Affecting Results, Liquidity and Capital Resources -- Environmental Matters in Item 7.



Natural Gas-Fired Generation



Our natural gas-fired generation consists of four operating plants with a dependable capability of approximately 1,872 MW as ofDecember 31, 2012.



We purchase natural gas for these plants on the spot market from gas marketers, utilities and producers and we arrange for transportation of the natural gas to our plants. We have firm and interruptible transportation, balancing and storage agreements intended to support the plants' variable usage.





13Wisconsin Energy Corporation



ITEM 1.     BUSINESS - (Cont'd)2012 Form 10-K



We have a PSCW-approved hedging program that allows us to hedge up to 65% of our estimated gas usage for electric generation in order to help manage our natural gas price risk. The costs of this program are included in our fuel and purchased power costs.



Oil-Fired Generation



Fuel oil is used for the combustion turbines at the Germantown Power Plant units 1-4, boiler ignition and flame stabilization at the Presque Isle Power Plant, and diesel engines at the Pleasant Prairie Power Plant and Valley Power Plant (VAPP). Our oil-fired generation had a dependable capability of approximately 180 MW as ofDecember 31, 2012. Our natural gas-fired peaking units have the ability to burn oil if natural gas is not available due to delivery constraints. Fuel oil requirements are purchased under agreements with suppliers.



Renewable Generation



Hydroelectric:Wisconsin Electric's hydroelectric generating system consists of 13 operating plants with a total installed capacity of approximately 88 MW and a dependable capability of approximately 40 MW as ofDecember 31, 2012. Of these plants, 12 plants (86 MW of installed capacity) have long-term licenses from FERC. The other plant, with an installed generating capacity of approximately 2 MW, is operated under a permit granted by another federal agency.



Wind:We purchased Montfort Wind Energy Center (Montfort) from NextEra Energy Resources on December 21, 2012 for $27 million. We now have four wind sites, consisting of 200 turbines with an installed capacity of 338 MW and a dependable capability of 67 MW.



Biomass:We are constructing a biomass-fueled power plant at Domtar Corporation's Rothschild, Wisconsin paper mill site. Wood waste and wood shavings will be used to produce approximately 50 MW of renewable electricity and will also support Domtar's sustainable papermaking operations. Construction commenced in June 2011. We currently expect to invest between $245 million and $255 million, excluding Allowance for Funds Used During Construction (AFUDC), in the plant. We are targeting completion of the facility by the end of 2013.



Power Purchase Commitments



We enter into short and long-term power purchase commitments to meet a portion of our anticipated electric energy supply needs. The following table identifies our power purchase commitments as ofDecember 31, 2012with unaffiliated parties for the next five years:



YearMW20131,26720141,26720151,26720161,26720171,267



The above commitments include approximately 1,030 MW per year related to the Point Beach long-term power purchase agreement. Under this agreement, we pay a predetermined price per MWh for energy delivered according to a schedule included in the agreement. The balance of these power purchase commitments is a tolling arrangement whereby we are responsible for the procurement, delivery and the cost of natural gas fuel related to a specific unit identified in the contract.



Electric Transmission and Energy Markets



American Transmission Company:ATC is a regional transmission company that owns, maintains, monitors and operates electric transmission systems in Wisconsin, Michigan and Illinois. ATC is expected to provide comparable service to all customers, including Wisconsin Electric, and to support effective competition in energy markets without favoring any market participant. ATC is regulated by FERC for all rate terms and conditions of service and is



14Wisconsin Energy Corporation



ITEM 1.     BUSINESS - (Cont'd)2012 Form 10-K



a transmission-owning member of MISO. MISO maintains operational control of ATC's transmission system, and Wisconsin Electric is a non-transmission owning member and customer of MISO. We owned approximately26.2%of ATC as ofDecember 31, 2012and2011. For additional information, see Note O -- Related Parties in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.



In April 2011, ATC and Duke Energy announced the creation of a joint venture, Duke-American Transmission Company, that will build, own and operate new electric transmission infrastructure in North America to address increasing demand for affordable, reliable transmission capacity.



MISO:In connection with its status as a FERC approved Regional Transmission Organization (RTO), MISO developed bid-based energy markets, which were implemented on April 1, 2005. In January 2009, MISO commenced the Energy and Operating Reserves Markets, which includes the bid-based energy markets and the ancillary services market. For further information on MISO and the MISO Energy Markets, see Factors Affecting Results, Liquidity and Capital Resources -- Industry Restructuring and Competition - Electric Transmission and Energy Markets in Item 7.

GAS UTILITY OPERATIONS



Our gas utility operations consist of Wisconsin Gas and the gas operations of Wisconsin Electric, both operating under the trade name of "We Energies." We are authorized to provide retail gas distribution service in designated territories in the state of Wisconsin, as established by indeterminate permits, CPCNs, or boundary agreements with other utilities. We also transport customer-owned gas. We are the largest natural gas distribution utility in Wisconsin and we operate throughout the state, including the City of Milwaukee, west and south of the City of Milwaukee, the Appleton area and large areas of both central and western Wisconsin.



Gas Deliveries



Our gas utility business is highly seasonal due to the heating requirements of residential and commercial customers, and annual gas sales are impacted by the variability of winter temperatures.



Total gas therms delivered, including customer-owned transported gas, were approximately2,222.0 milliontherms during2012, a3.2%increase compared with2011. As ofDecember 31, 2012, we were transporting gas for approximately1,600customers who purchased gas directly from other suppliers. Transported gas accounted for approximately51.3%of the total volumes delivered during2012,41.8%during2011and43.5%during2010. We had approximately1,074,000and1,068,200gas customers as ofDecember 31, 2012and2011, respectively. Our peak daily send-out during2012was 1,583,041 Dth on January 19,2012.



Sales to Large Gas Customers:We provide gas utility service to a diversified base of industrial customers who are largely within our electric service territory. Major industries served include the paper, food products and fabricated metal products industries. Fuel used for Wisconsin Electric's electric generation represents our largest transportation customer. Gas therms delivered to Wisconsin Electric for electric generation represents 17.2%, 8.3% and 10.3% of the total volumes delivered during 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively.



Gas Deliveries Growth:We currently forecast total retail therm deliveries (excluding natural gas deliveries for generation) to stay flat over the five-year period ending December 31, 2017 as new customer additions are expected to be offset by a reduction in the average use per customer. This forecast reflects a current year weather normalized sales level and normal weather.



Western Gas Lateral:We are projecting the need for additional capacity for our natural gas distribution network in the western part of Wisconsin to address reliability and meet customer demand. We anticipate seeking approval to construct a new natural gas lateral from the PSCW in 2013. The anticipated cost of the initial phase of this project is approximately $150 million to $170 million.



Competition



Competition in varying degrees exists between natural gas and other forms of energy available to consumers. A number of our large commercial and industrial customers are dual-fuel customers that are equipped to switch between natural gas and alternate fuels. We are allowed to offer lower-priced gas sales and transportation services to dual-fuel customers. Under gas transportation agreements, customers purchase gas directly from gas marketers and arrange with interstate pipelines and us to have the gas transported to their facilities. We earn substantially the same margin (difference between revenue and cost of gas) whether we sell and transport gas to customers or only transport their gas.



Our ability to maintain our share of the industrial dual-fuel market depends on our success and the success of third-party gas marketers in obtaining long-term and short-term supplies of natural gas at competitive prices compared to other sources and in arranging or facilitating competitively-priced transportation service for those customers that desire to buy their own gas supplies.



Federal and state regulators continue to implement policies to bring more competition to the gas industry. While the gas utility distribution function is expected to remain a highly regulated, monopoly function, the sale of the natural gas commodity and related services are expected to remain subject to competition from third parties. It remains uncertain if and when the current economic disincentives for small customers to choose an alternative gas commodity supplier may be removed such that we begin to face competition for the sale of gas to our smaller firm customers.



17Wisconsin Energy Corporation





ITEM 1.     BUSINESS - (Cont'd)2012 Form 10-K



Gas Supply, Pipeline Capacity and Storage



We have been able to meet our contractual obligations with both our suppliers and our customers.



Pipeline Capacity and Storage:The interstate pipelines serving Wisconsin originate in major gas producing areas of North America: the Oklahoma and Texas basins, the Gulf of Mexico, western Canada and the Rocky Mountains. We have contracted for long-term firm capacity from a number of these sources. This strategy reflects management's belief that overall supply security is enhanced by geographic diversification of the supply portfolio.



Due to the daily and seasonal variations in gas usage in Wisconsin, we have also contracted for substantial underground storage capacity, primarily in Michigan. We target storage levels at approximately 35% of forecasted winter demand. Storage capacity, along with our gas purchase contracts, enables us to manage significant changes in daily demand and to optimize our overall gas supply and capacity costs. We generally inject gas into storage during the spring and summer months when demand is lower and withdraw it in the winter months. As a result, we can contract for less long-line pipeline capacity during periods of peak usage than would otherwise be necessary and can purchase gas on a more uniform daily basis from suppliers year-round. Each of these capabilities enables us to reduce our overall costs.



We hold firm daily transportation and storage capacity entitlements from pipelines and other service providers under long-term contracts.



Term Gas Supply:We have contracts for firm supplies with terms in excess of 30 days with suppliers for gas acquired in the Chicago, Illinois market hub and in the producing areas discussed above. The pricing of the term contracts is based upon first of the month indices. Combined with our storage capability, management believes that the volume of gas under contract is sufficient to meet our forecasted firm peak-day demand.



Secondary Market Transactions:Capacity release is a mechanism by which pipeline long-line and storage capacity and gas supplies under contract can be resold in the secondary market. Local distribution companies, like Wisconsin Gas and Wisconsin Electric, must contract for capacity and supply sufficient to meet the firm peak-day demand of their customers. Peak or near peak demand days generally occur only a few times each year. Capacity release facilitates higher utilization of contracted capacity and supply during those times when the full contracted capacity and supply are not needed by the utility, helping to mitigate the fixed costs associated with maintaining peak levels of capacity and gas supply. Through pre-arranged agreements and day-to-day electronic bulletin board postings, interested parties can purchase this excess capacity and supply. The proceeds from these transactions are passed through to rate payers, subject to the Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Gas approved Gas Cost Recovery Mechanisms (GCRMs). During2012, we continued to participate in the capacity release market. See Factors Affecting Results, Liquidity and Capital Resources -- Utility Rates and Regulatory Matters in Item 7 for information on the GCRMs.



Spot Market Gas Supply:We expect to continue to make gas purchases in the 30-day spot market as price and other circumstances dictate. We have supply relationships with a number of sellers from whom we purchase spot gas.



Hedging Gas Supply Prices:We have PSCW approval to hedge (i) up to 60% of planned winter and (ii) up to 30% planned summer flowing gas supply using a mix of New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) based natural gas options and natural gas future contracts. Those approvals allow both Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Gas to pass 100% of the hedging costs (premiums and brokerage fees) and proceeds (gains and losses) to rate payers through their respective GCRMs. Hedge targets (volumes) are provided annually to the PSCW as part of each company's three-year gas supply plan and risk management filing.



To the extent that opportunities develop and  physical supply operating plans are supportive, we also have PSCW approval to utilize NYMEX based natural gas derivatives to capture favorable forward market price differentials. That approval provides for 100% of the related proceeds to accrue to our GCRMs.

OTHER UTILITY OPERATIONS



Steam Utility Operations:Our steam utility generates, distributes and sells steam supplied by our VAPP and Milwaukee County Power Plant. We operate a district steam system in downtown Milwaukee and the near south side of Milwaukee. Steam is supplied to this system from VAPP, a coal-fired cogeneration facility. We also operate the steam production and distribution facilities of the Milwaukee County Power Plant located on the Milwaukee County Grounds in Wauwatosa, Wisconsin.

REGULATION



Wisconsin Energy Corporation



Wisconsin Energy is a holding company, but is exempt from the requirements of the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 2005 (PUHCA 2005).



Non-Utility Asset Cap:Pursuant to the non-utility asset cap provisions of Wisconsin's public utility holding company law, the sum of certain assets of all non-utility affiliates in a holding company system may not exceed 25% of the assets of all public utility affiliates. However, among other items, the law exempts energy-related assets, including the generating plants constructed by We Power as part of our PTF strategy and assets used for providing environmental engineering services and for processing waste materials, from being counted against the asset cap provided that they are employed in qualifying businesses. As a result of these exemptions, our non-utility assets are significantly below the non-utility asset cap as ofDecember 31, 2012.



Utility Energy Segment



Wisconsin Electric is a holding company because of its ownership interest in ATC, but is exempt from the requirements of PUHCA 2005.



Wisconsin Electric is subject to the Federal Power Act and the corresponding regulations developed by certain federal agencies. The Energy Policy Act amended the Federal Power Act in 2005 to, among other things, make electric utility industry consolidation more feasible, authorize FERC to review proposed mergers and the acquisition of generation facilities, change the FERC regulatory scheme applicable to qualifying cogeneration facilities and modify certain other aspects of energy regulations and Federal tax policies applicable to Wisconsin Electric. Additionally, the Energy Policy Act created an Electric Reliability Organization to be overseen by FERC, which established mandatory electric reliability standards and which has the authority to levy monetary sanctions for failure to comply with these standards.



Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Gas are subject to the regulation of the PSCW as to retail electric, gas and steam rates in the state of Wisconsin, standards of service, issuance of securities, construction of certain new facilities, transactions with affiliates, billing practices and various other matters.

Public Benefits and Renewable Portfolio Standard



2005 Wisconsin Act 141 (Act 141) established a goal that 10% of electricity consumed in Wisconsin be generated by renewable resources by December 31, 2015. Under Act 141, we must meet certain minimum requirements for renewable energy generation. For the years 2010 through 2014, we must increase our percentage of total retail energy sales provided by renewable sources (renewable energy percentage) by at least two percentage points from our baseline renewable percentage of 2.27% to a level of 4.27%. Act 141 defines "baseline renewable percentage" as the average of an energy provider's renewable energy percentage for 2001, 2002 and 2003. As ofDecember 31, 2012, we are in compliance with the Wisconsin renewable energy percentage of 4.27%. Act 141 further requires that for the year 2015 and beyond, the renewable energy percentage must increase at least six percentage points above the baseline to a level of 8.27%. In addition, under this Act, 1.2% of utilities' annual operating revenues were required to be used to fund energy conservation programs in 2012. The funding required by Act 141 for 2013 is also 1.2% of annual operating revenues.



Public Act 295 enacted in Michigan requires 10% of the state's energy to come from renewables by 2015 and energy optimization (efficiency) targets up to 1% annually by 2015. Public Act 295 specifically calls for current recovery of costs incurred to meet the standards and provides for ongoing review and revision to assure the measures taken are cost-effective.



For additional information on Act 141 and current renewable projects, see Factors Affecting Results, Liquidity and Capital Resources -- Utility Rates and Regulatory Matters - Renewables, Efficiency and Conservation and Utility Rates and Regulatory Matters - Renewable Energy Portfolio in Item 7.



Non-Utility Energy Segment



We Power was formed to design, construct, own and lease the new generating capacity in our PTF strategy. We Power owns the interests in the companies that constructed this new generating capacity (collectively, the We Power project companies). These facilities are being leased on a long-term basis to Wisconsin Electric. We Power received determinations from FERC that upon the transfer of the facilities by lease to Wisconsin Electric, the We Power project companies are not deemed public utilities under the Federal Power Act and thus are not subject to FERC's jurisdiction.



Environmental permits necessary for operating the facilities are the responsibility of the operating entity, Wisconsin Electric.

ITEM 1.     BUSINESS - (Cont'd)2012 Form 10-K



ENVIRONMENTAL COMPLIANCE



Our operations are subject to extensive environmental regulations by state and federal environmental agencies governing air and water quality, hazardous and solid waste management, environmental remediation and management of natural resources. Costs associated with complying with these requirements are significant. Additional future environmental statutes and regulations or revisions to existing laws, including for example, additional regulation of greenhouse gas emissions, coal combustion products, air emissions or wastewater discharges, could significantly increase these environmental compliance costs.



Anticipated expenditures for environmental compliance and remediation issues for the next three years are included in estimated capital expenditures described in Liquidity and Capital Resources in Item 7. For discussion of additional environmental issues, see Environmental Matters in Item 3. For further information concerning air and water quality standards and rulemaking initiated by the EPA, including estimated costs of compliance, see Factors Affecting Results, Liquidity and Capital Resources -- Environmental Matters in Item 7. For a discussion of matters related to certain solid waste and coal combustion product landfills, manufactured gas plant sites and air quality, see Note P -- Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.



Compliance with federal, state and local environmental protection requirements resulted in capital expenditures by Wisconsin Electric of approximately $64.1 million in2012compared with $120.3 million in2011. Expenditures incurred during2012and2011primarily included costs associated with the installation of pollution abatement facilities at Wisconsin Electric's power plants. These expenditures are expected to be approximately $22 million during2013, reflecting the addition of control equipment for Nitrogen Oxide (NOx), Sulfur Dioxide (SO2) and other pollutants needed to comply with various rules promulgated by the EPA and the Consent Decree entered into with the EPA in 2003. Operation, maintenance and depreciation expenses for fly ash removal equipment and other environmental protection systems were approximately $82.6 million and $79.0 million during2012and2011, respectively.



Coal Combustion Product Fills and Landfills



We currently have a program of beneficial utilization for substantially all of our coal combustion products, including fly ash, bottom ash and gypsum, which minimizes the need for disposal in specially-designed landfills. Some early designed and constructed coal combustion product landfills, which we used prior to developing this program, may allow the release of low levels of constituents resulting in the need for various levels of remediation. Where we have become aware of these conditions, efforts have been made to define the nature and extent of any release, and work has been performed to address these conditions. In addition, fill areas for coal ash were used prior to the introduction of landfill regulations. Sites currently undergoing review include the following:



Oak Creek Site Landfills:Groundwater impacts identified near the sites, located in the Village of Caledonia and the City of Oak Creek, Wisconsin, prompted Wisconsin Electric to begin investigation in 2009 for the source of impacts found in monitoring wells on the site and surrounding area. Our study indicates that the groundwater impacts may be naturally occurring or are from other sources based on groundwater flow direction and increasing concentrations of elements deeper in the ground. The WDNR began sampling work in 2011 to identify the source of the groundwater impacts and issued its report on January 24, 2013. The WDNR study found that the data was inconclusive as to the source causing the groundwater impacts. We reviewed the WDNR report and provided technical comments on February 18, 2013 further supporting our position that regional ground water impacts are not a result of coal ash management activities at the Oak Creek site.



See Item 3 Legal Proceedings -- Environmental Matters for a discussion of the bluff collapse at our Oak Creek Power Plant.







OTHER





Research and Development:We had immaterial research and development expenditures in the last three years, primarily for improvement of service and abatement of air and water pollution by our electric utility operations. Research and development activities include work done by employees, consultants and contractors, plus sponsorship of research by industry associations.
