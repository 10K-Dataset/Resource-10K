UTILITY ENERGY SEGMENT



ELECTRIC UTILITY OPERATIONS

Our electric utility operations consist of the electric operations of Wisconsin Electric and Edison Sault.  Wisconsin Electric, which is the largest electric utility in the State of Wisconsin, generates and distributes electric energy in a territory in southeastern (including the metropolitan Milwaukee area), east central and northern Wisconsin and in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan.  Edison Sault generates and distributes electric energy in a territory in the eastern Upper Peninsula of Michigan.

Wisconsin Electric and Edison Sault participate in the MISO Energy Markets.  The competitiveness of our generation offered in the MISO Energy Markets affects how our generating units are dispatched and how we buy and sell power.  For further information, see Factors Affecting Results, Liquidity and Capital Resources in Item 7.








Electric Sales

Our electric energy sales to all classes of customers, excluding intercompany sales between Edison Sault and Wisconsin Electric, totaled approximately 29.2 million MWh during 2009 and approximately 31.9 million MWh during 2008.  We had approximately 1,140,400 electric customers as of December 31, 2009 and 1,137,800 electric customers as of December 31, 2008.

Wisconsin Electric:

Edison Sault:

In October 2009, we entered into an agreement to sell Edison Sault to Cloverland Electric Cooperative for approximately $61.5 million.  We will retain the membership interest in ATC currently held by Edison Sault.  The sale is contingent upon certain conditions, including the approval by regulatory bodies.  If the conditions are satisfied, we expect the sale to be completed in 2010.

Electric Sales Growth:

Sales to Large Electric Retail Customers:

Our largest retail electric customers are two iron ore mines located in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan.  The combined electric energy sales to the two mines accounted for 5.2% and 6.5% of our total electric utility energy sales during 2009 and 2008, respectively.  Effective January 1, 2008, the mines became eligible to receive electric service from Wisconsin Electric in accordance with tariffs approved by the MPSC.  Prior to this, Wisconsin Electric had special negotiated power-sales contracts with these mines.

Electric System Reliability Matters:








Electric Supply

Our electric supply strategy is to provide our customers with a diverse fuel mix that is expected to maintain a stable, reliable and affordable supply of electricity.  We supply a significant amount of electricity to our customers from power plants that we own.  We supplement our internally generated power supply with long-term power purchase agreements, including the Point Beach power purchase agreement discussed later in this report, and through spot purchases in the MISO Energy Markets.

Our installed capacity by fuel type as of December 31 is shown below:

Bechtel is targeting the commercial operation of OC 2 by the end of August 2010, and our share of this unit's dependable capability will also be 515 MW.(b)Beginning in 2007, nuclear generation decreased due to the sale of Point Beach and purchased power increased as a result of the entry into the associated power purchase agreement with the buyer.

Our average fuel and purchased power costs per MWh by fuel type for the years ended December 31 are shown below:

200920082007Coal$  25.03$  22.95$  20.52NuclearN/AN/A$    5.83Natural Gas - Combined Cycle$  51.67$  69.65$  61.27Natural Gas/Oil - Peaking Units$121.18$160.25$112.49Purchased Power$  41.90$  46.21$  45.19

Historically, the fuel costs for coal have been under long-term contracts, which helped with price stability.  Coal and associated transportation services have seen greater volatility in pricing than typically experienced in these markets due to changes in the domestic and world-wide demand for coal and the impacts of diesel costs which are incorporated into fuel surcharges on rail transportation.

Natural gas costs have been volatile.  We have a PSCW-approved hedging program to help manage our natural gas price risk.  This hedging program is generally implemented on a 36-month forward-looking basis.  Proceeds related to the natural gas hedging program are reflected in the 2009, 2008 and 2007 average costs of natural gas and purchased power shown above.

Coal-Fired Generation

Coal Supply:



Following is a summary of the annual tonnage amounts for our principal long-term coal contracts by the month and year in which the contracts expire:










ContractExpiration DateAnnual Tonnage(Thousands)Dec. 201011,765Dec. 20119,480Dec. 20125,000

Coal Deliveries:

Certain of our coal transportation contracts contain fuel cost adjustments that are tied to changes in a diesel fuel price index.  Currently, diesel fuel contracts are not actively traded; therefore, we are using financial heating oil contracts to mitigate risk.  The PSCW has approved a program that allows us to hedge up to 75% of our potential fuel for electric generation in order to help manage our risk of higher delivered cost of coal.  The costs of this program are included in our fuel and purchased power costs.

During the fourth quarter of 2009, we reached a contingent agreement to sell our 25% interest in Edgewater Generating Unit 5 to WPL, which will become binding if we are unable to reach an agreement with a third party to sell our interest.  We are continuing to negotiate with a third party to sell our interest in this unit.  The completion of any sale will be subject to approval by the PSCW.



Environmental Matters:

Natural Gas-Fired Generation

Our natural gas-fired generation consists of five operating plants with a dependable capability of approximately 1,983 MW at December 31, 2009.  We added PWGS 1 and PWGS 2, both natural gas-fired units with a dependable capability of 545 MW each, in July 2005 and May 2008, respectively.

We purchase natural gas for these plants on the spot market from gas marketers, utilities and producers and we arrange for transportation of the natural gas to our plants.  We have firm and interruptible transportation, balancing and storage agreements intended to support the plants' variable usage.

The PSCW has approved a program that allows us to hedge up to 75% of our estimated gas usage for electric generation in order to help manage our natural gas price risk.  The costs of this program are included in our fuel and purchased power costs.

Oil-Fired Generation

Fuel oil is used for the combustion turbines at the Germantown Power Plant units 1-4, boiler ignition and flame stabilization at the Presque Isle Power Plant, and diesel engines at the Pleasant Prairie Power Plant, Valley Power Plant and at the Manistique facility at Edison Sault.  Our oil-fired generation had a dependable capability of approximately 262 MW as of December 31, 2009.  Our natural gas-fired peaking units have the ability to burn oil if natural gas is not available due to delivery constraints.  Fuel oil requirements are purchased under agreements with suppliers.








Renewable Generation

Hydroelectric:

Hydroelectric generation is also purchased by Edison Sault under contract from the United States Army Corps of Engineers' hydroelectric generating plant located within the Soo Locks complex on the St. Mary's River in Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan.  This 17 MW contract has tenure to November 1, 2040 and cannot be terminated by the United States government prior to November 1, 2030.

Wind:

CPCN.  We currently expect to install up to 90 wind turbines with generating capacity of up to approximately 207 MW, subject to turbine selection and the final site configuration.  We expect 2012 to be the first full year of operation.

Biomass:

Nuclear Generation

Point Beach:



A long-term power purchase agreement with the buyer became effective upon closing of the sale.  Pursuant to this agreement, Wisconsin Electric is purchasing all of the energy produced by Point Beach.  The power purchase agreement extends through 2030 for Unit 1 and 2033 for Unit 2.  Based on the agreement, we will be paying the buyer a predetermined price per MWh for energy delivered.  For additional information on the sale of Point Beach, see Note D -- Asset Sales, Divestitures and Discontinued Operations in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 and Nuclear Operations under Factors Affecting Results, Liquidity and Capital Resources in Item 7.

Used Nuclear Fuel Storage & Disposal:








Power Purchase Commitments

We enter into short and long-term power purchase commitments to meet a portion of our anticipated electric energy supply needs.  The following table identifies our power purchase commitments as of December 31, 2009 with unaffiliated parties for the next five years:

YearMW UnderPower Purchase Commitments20101,59920111,59920121,44020131,26920141,269

Approximately 1,030 MW per year relates to the Point Beach long-term power purchase agreement.  Under this agreement, we pay a predetermined price per MWh for energy delivered according to a schedule included in the agreement.  The balance of these power purchase commitments are tolling arrangements whereby we are responsible for the procurement, delivery and the cost of natural gas fuel related to specific units identified in the contracts.Electric Transmission and Energy MarketsAmerican Transmission Company

:

ATC owns, maintains, monitors and operates electric transmission systems in Wisconsin, Michigan and Illinois.  ATC's sole business is to provide reliable, economic electric transmission service to all customers in a fair and equitable manner.  ATC is expected to provide comparable service to all customers, including Wisconsin Electric and Edison Sault, and to support effective competition in energy markets without favoring any market participant.  ATC is regulated by FERC for all rate terms and conditions of service and is a transmission-owning member of MISO.  MISO maintains operational control of ATC's transmission system, and Wisconsin Electric and Edison Sault are non-transmission owning members and customers of MISO.

We owned approximately 26.2% of ATC as of December 31, 2009 and 2008.

MISO:In connection with its status as a FERC approved RTO, MISO developed bid-based energy markets, which were implemented on April 1, 2005.  In January 2009, MISO commenced the Energy and Operating Reserves Markets, which includes the bid-based energy markets and a new ancillary services market.  For further information on MISO and the MISO Energy Markets, see Factors Affecting Results, Liquidity and Capital Resources -- Industry Restructuring and Competition - Electric Transmission and Energy Markets in Item 7.Electric Hedging Programs:We purchase some of the electricity needed to satisfy our current sales obligations in the MISO Energy Markets.  Due to volatility in the price of market-based energy, we face potential financial exposure.  We have PSCW approval to hedge up to 75% of a future month's predicted electricity need.  This plan seeks to manage market price risk, as well as reduce price risks related to forced outages.16Electric Utility Operating StatisticsThe following table shows certain electric utility operating statistics from 2005 to 2009 for electric operating revenues, MWh sales and customer data:

GAS UTILITY OPERATIONS

Our gas utility operations consist of Wisconsin Gas and the gas operations of Wisconsin Electric.  Both companies are authorized to provide retail gas distribution service in designated territories in the State of Wisconsin, as established by indeterminate permits, CPCNs, or boundary agreements with other utilities.  The two companies also transport customer-owned gas.  Wisconsin Gas, the largest natural gas distribution utility in Wisconsin, operates throughout the state, including the City of Milwaukee.Wisconsin Electric's gas utility operates in three distinct service areas: west and south of the City of Milwaukee, the Appleton area and areas within Iron and Vilas Counties, Wisconsin.








Gas Deliveries

Our gas utility business is highly seasonal due to the heating requirements of residential and commercial customers.  Annual gas sales are also impacted by the variability of winter temperatures.

Total gas therms delivered, including customer-owned transported gas, were approximately 2,183.9 million therms during 2009, a 4.0% decrease compared with 2008.  At December 31, 2009, we were transporting gas for approximately 1,400 customers who purchased gas directly from other suppliers.  Transported gas accounted for approximately 40.4% of the total volumes delivered during 2009, 39.8% during 2008 and 42.0% during 2007.  We had approximately 1,060,200 and 1,056,400 gas customers at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively.  Our peak daily send-out during 2009 was 1,788,742 Dth on January 15, 2009.

Sales to Large Gas Customers:

Gas Deliveries Growth:

Competition

Competition in varying degrees exists between natural gas and other forms of energy available to consumers.  A number of our large commercial and industrial customers are dual-fuel customers that are equipped to switch between natural gas and alternate fuels.  We are allowed to offer lower-priced gas sales and transportation services to dual-fuel customers.  Under gas transportation agreements, customers purchase gas directly from gas marketers and arrange with interstate pipelines and us to have the gas transported to their facilities.  We earn substantially the same margin (difference between revenue and cost of gas) whether we sell and transport gas to customers or only transport their gas.

Our ability to maintain our share of the industrial dual-fuel market depends on our success and the success of third-party gas marketers in obtaining long-term and short-term supplies of natural gas at competitive prices compared to other sources and in arranging or facilitating competitively-priced transportation service for those customers that desire to buy their own gas supplies.

Federal and state regulators continue to implement policies to bring more competition to the gas industry.  While the gas utility distribution function is expected to remain a highly regulated, monopoly function, the sale of the natural gas commodity and related services are expected to remain subject to competition from third parties.  It remains uncertain if and when the current economic disincentives for small customers to choose an alternative gas commodity supplier may be removed such that we begin to face competition for the sale of gas to our smaller firm customers.

Gas Supply, Pipeline Capacity and Storage

We have been able to meet our contractual obligations with both our suppliers and our customers despite periods of severe cold in recent heating seasons.

Pipeline Capacity and Storage:

Due to the daily and seasonal variations in gas usage in Wisconsin, we have also contracted for substantial underground storage capacity, primarily in Michigan.  Storage capacity, along with our gas purchase contracts, enables us to manage significant changes in daily demand and to optimize our overall gas supply and capacity costs.  We generally inject gas into storage during the spring and summer months when demand is lower and withdraw it in the winter months.  As a result, we can contract for less long-line pipeline capacity during periods of peak usage than would otherwise be








necessary, and can purchase gas on a more uniform daily basis from suppliers year-round.  Each of these capabilities enables us to reduce our overall costs.

We hold firm daily transportation and storage capacity entitlements from pipelines and other service providers under long-term contracts.

Term Gas Supply:

Secondary Market Transactions:

Spot Market Gas Supply:

Hedging Gas Supply Prices:



To the extent that opportunities develop and our physical supply operating plans will support them, we also have PSCW approval to utilize NYMEX based natural gas derivatives to capture favorable forward market price differentials.  That approval provides for 100% of the related proceeds to accrue to our GCRMs.

OTHER UTILITY OPERATIONSSteam Utility Operations:Wisconsin Electric's steam utility generates, distributes and sells steam supplied by its Valley and Milwaukee County Power Plants.  Wisconsin Electric operates a district steam system in downtown Milwaukee and the near south side of Milwaukee.  Steam is supplied to this system from Wisconsin Electric's Valley Power Plant, a coal-fired cogeneration facility.  Wisconsin Electric also operates the steam production and distribution facilities of the Milwaukee County Power Plant located on the Milwaukee County Grounds in Wauwatosa, Wisconsin.

Annual sales of steam fluctuate from year to year based upon system growth and variations in weather conditions.  During 2009, the steam utility had $39.1 million of operating revenues from the sale of 2,932 million pounds of steam compared with $40.3 million of operating revenues from the sale of 3,081 million pounds of steam








during 2008.  As of December 31, 2009 and 2008, steam was used by approximately 465 customers, respectively, for processing, space heating, domestic hot water and humidification.

NON-UTILITY ENERGY SEGMENT

Our non-utility energy segment is involved primarily in the design and construction of new generating capacity under our PTF strategy.  As of December 31, 2009, our PTF assets represented virtually all of our non-utility energy segment assets.

During 2000, we performed a comprehensive review of our existing portfolio of businesses and began implementing a strategy of divesting many of our non-utility energy segment businesses.  Since 2000, we have sold our interest in many of our non-utility energy assets with proceeds from these sales totaling approximately $631.8 million.

We Power

We Power, through wholly owned subsidiaries, has designed and is constructing approximately 2,320 MW of new generation in Wisconsin, which is the key component of our PTF strategy.  This new generation consists of approximately 1,230 MW of new generating capacity from OC 1 and OC 2, and 1,090 MW of generating capacity related to PWGS 1 and PWGS 2.  PWGS 1 and PWGS 2 were placed in service in July 2005 and May 2008, respectively.  In November 2005, two unaffiliated entities collectively purchased an ownership interest of approximately 17%, or 200 MW, in OC 1 and OC 2.  Similar to the generating capacity at PWGS 1 and PWGS 2, We Power will own the remaining 1,030 MW of generating capacity currently being constructed and will lease this capacity to Wisconsin Electric.  As of December 31, 2009, we had approximately $1.8 billion of CWIP related to the construction of OC 1 and OC 2.  OC 1 was placed into service on February 2, 2010.  Bechtel is targeting the commercial operation of 
OC 2 by the end of August 2010.  For further information about our PTF strategy, see Factors Affecting Results, Liquidity and Capital Resources -- Power the Future in Item 7.

Total flow of water to Edison Sault's hydroelectric generating plant is under the control of the International Joint Commission, created by the Boundary Water Treaty of 1909 between the United States and Great Britain, now represented by Canada.  The operations of Wisconsin Electric, Wisconsin Gas and Edison Sault are also subject to regulations, where applicable, of the EPA, the WDNR, the MDEQ and the Michigan Department of Natural Resources.

Public Benefits and Renewable Portfolio Standard

The Task Force's report also includes an increased renewable portfolio standard.  Under the Task Force's recommendations, the renewable portfolio standard would increase to 10% by 2013, 20% by 2020 and 25% by 2025.

In December 2009, legislation covering the Task Force recommendations was introduced in the Wisconsin legislature.  We are working within the context of the Task Force to provide comments where we believe the proposed legislation deviates from the Task Force recommendations.

Public Act 295 enacted in Michigan calls for the implementation of a renewable portfolio standard by 2015 and energy optimization (efficiency) targets up to 1% annually by 2015.  Public Act 295 specifically calls for current recovery of costs incurred to meet the standards and provides for ongoing review and revision to assure the measures taken are cost-effective.

Non-Utility Energy Segment

We Power was formed to design, construct, own and lease the new generating capacity in our PTF strategy.  We Power owns the interests in the companies constructing this new generating capacity (collectively, the We Power project companies).  When complete, these facilities will be leased on a long-term basis to Wisconsin Electric.  We Power has received determinations from FERC that upon the transfer of the facilities by lease to Wisconsin Electric, the We Power project companies will not be deemed public utilities under the Federal Power Act and thus will not be subject to FERC's jurisdiction.

The Energy Policy Act and corresponding rules developed by FERC required us to seek FERC authorization to allow Wisconsin Electric to lease OC 1, OC 2 and PWGS 2 from We Power.  We received this authorization from FERC in December 2006.  We were not required to request similar approval for the PWGS 1 lease between We Power and Wisconsin Electric as this unit was in service prior to the enactment of the Energy Policy Act.

In addition, for a short period prior to the transfer of each generation unit to Wisconsin Electric, We Power will be engaged in the sale of test power, a FERC jurisdictional transaction.  We Power received approval from FERC for the sale of test power to Wisconsin Electric from PWGS 1, PWGS 2 and OC 1 and for the transfer of any FERC jurisdictional facilities at Port Washington to Wisconsin Electric and/or ATC.  We Power submitted its application seeking approval from FERC to sell test power from OC 2 in January 2010.  Environmental permits necessary for operating the facilities are the responsibility of the operating entity, Wisconsin Electric.

ENVIRONMENTAL COMPLIANCE

Our operations are subject to extensive environmental regulations by state and federal environmental agencies governing air and water quality, hazardous and solid waste management, environmental remediation, and management of natural resources.   Costs associated with complying with these requirements are significant.  Additional future environmental statutes and regulations or revisions to existing laws, including for example, additional regulation of greenhouse gas emissions, coal ash, air emissions or wastewater discharges, could significantly increase these environmental compliance costs.

Expenditures for environmental compliance and remediation issues are included in anticipated capital expenditures described in Liquidity and Capital Resources in Item 7.  For discussion of additional environmental issues, see Environmental Matters in Item 3.  For further information concerning air and water quality standards and rulemaking initiated by the EPA, including estimated costs of compliance, see Factors Affecting Results, Liquidity and Capital Resources -- Environmental Matters in Item 7.  For a discussion of matters related to certain solid waste and coal-ash landfills, manufactured gas plant sites and air quality, see Note S -- Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.

Compliance with federal, state and local environmental protection requirements resulted in capital expenditures by Wisconsin Electric of approximately $188 million in 2009 compared with $135 million in 2008.  Expenditures incurred during 2008 and 2009 primarily included costs associated with the installation of pollution abatement facilities at Wisconsin Electric's power plants.  These expenditures are expected to approximate $300 million during 2010, reflecting NOx, SO2and other pollution control equipment needed to comply with various rules promulgated by the EPA.  Operation, maintenance and depreciation expenses for fly ash removal equipment and other environmental protection systems were approximately $66.7 million and $67.2 million during 2009 and 2008, respectively.

Coal-Ash Landfills

We currently have a successful program of beneficial utilization for substantially all of our coal combustion products, including fly ash, bottom ash and synthetic gypsum, which avoids the need for disposal in specially-designed landfills.  Some early designed and constructed coal-ash landfills, which we used prior to developing this program, may allow the release of low levels of constituents resulting in the need for various levels of remediation.  Where we have become aware of these conditions, efforts have been made to define the nature and extent of any release, and work has been performed to address these conditions.  Sites currently undergoing remediation include the following:
