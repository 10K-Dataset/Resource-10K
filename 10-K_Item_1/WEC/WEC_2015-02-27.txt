Our annual and periodical filings with the SEC are available, free of charge, through our Internet website www.wisconsinenergy.com. These documents are available as soon as reasonably practicable after such materials are filed (or furnished) with the SEC.







UTILITY ENERGY SEGMENT





ELECTRIC UTILITY OPERATIONS



Our electric utility operations consist of the electric operations of Wisconsin Electric. Wisconsin Electric, which is the largest electric utility in the state of Wisconsin, generates and distributes electric energy in a territory that includes southeastern (including the metropolitan Milwaukee area), east central and northern Wisconsin and the Upper Peninsula of Michigan.



Wisconsin Electric participates in the Midcontinent Independent System Operator (MISO) Energy Markets. The competitiveness of our generation offered in the MISO Energy Markets affects how our generating units are dispatched and how we buy and sell power. For further information, see Factors Affecting Results, Liquidity and Capital Resources in Item 7.

ITEM 1.     BUSINESS - (Cont'd)2014 Form 10-K



Electric Sales



Our electric energy deliveries, which include supply and distribution sales to our retail and wholesale customers and distribution sales to those customers who switched to an alternative electric supplier, totaled approximately35.1 millionMWh during2014and approximately33.0 millionMWh during2013. We had approximately1,133,600electric customers as ofDecember 31, 2014and1,128,300electric customers as ofDecember 31, 2013.



Wisconsin Electric is authorized to provide retail electric service in designated territories in the state of Wisconsin, as established by indeterminate permits, Certificates of Public Convenience and Necessity (CPCNs) or boundary agreements with other utilities, and in certain territories in the state of Michigan pursuant to franchises granted by municipalities. Wisconsin Electric also sells wholesale electric power within the MISO Energy Markets.



Electric Sales Growth:Our service territory experienced steady retail sales in 2014 after accounting for changes associated with customers switching to alternative electric suppliers. Assuming continuing improvement in the economy over the five-year forecast horizon, we presently anticipate that total retail electric kWh sales and the associated peak electric demand will grow at a compound annual rate of about 0.5% over the next five years.These estimates assume normal weather.



Sales to Large Electric Retail Customers:We provide electric utility service to a diversified base of customers in such industries as paper, foundry, food products and machinery production, as well as to large retail chains.



Prior to September 2013, our largest retail electric customers were two iron ore mines located in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. The mines were served on an interruptible tariff rate and switched to an alternative electric supplier effective September 1, 2013. The combined electric energy sales to the two mines accounted for 3.7% and 6.6% of our total electric utility energy sales during 2013 and 2012, respectively. For additional information, see Factors Affecting Results, Liquidity and Capital  Resources -- Industry Restructuring and Competition in Item 7.



Effective February 1, 2015, the two mines returned as retail customers. We expect to defer the net revenue from those sales and apply these amounts for the benefit of Wisconsin retail electric customers in future rate proceedings. Michigan state law allows the mines to switch to an alternative electric supplier after sufficient notice.



Sales to Wholesale Customers:During2014, we sold wholesale electric power to two rural cooperatives, and two municipal joint action agencies located in the states of Wisconsin and Michigan. Our wholesale electric energy sales were also made to one other public utility in the region under rates approved by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC). Wholesale sales accounted for approximately5.7%of our total electric energy sales and3.9%of total electric operating revenues during2014, compared with6.1%of total electric energy sales and4.3%of total electric operating revenues during2013.



Sales for Resale:During2014, the majority of our sales for resale were sold to one Regional Transmission Organization (RTO), at market rates based on availability of our generation and RTO demand. Sales for resale accounted for approximately19.9%of our total electric energy sales and7.8%of total electric operating revenues during2014, compared with13.6%of total electric energy sales and4.3%of total electric operating revenues during2013.



Electric System Reliability Matters:Our electric sales are impacted by seasonal factors and varying weather conditions. We sell more electricity during the summer months because of the residential cooling load. The Public Service Commission of Wisconsin (PSCW) has planning reserve requirements consistent with the MISO calculated planning reserve margin. The Michigan Public Service Commission (MPSC) has not yet established guidelines in this area. In accordance with the MISO calculated planning reserve margin requirements, we had adequate capacity to meet MISO calculated planning reserve margin during2014and expect to have adequate capacity to meet the planning reserve margin requirements during2015. For additional information, see Factors Affecting Results, Liquidity and Capital Resources in Item 7.



Competition



Retail electric customers in Wisconsin currently do not have the ability to choose their electric supplier. It is uncertain when, if ever, retail access might be implemented in Wisconsin. However, Wisconsin Electric attempts to attract new customers into our service territory to increase sales in order to allocate the recovery of our costs



11Wisconsin Energy Corporation



ITEM 1.     BUSINESS - (Cont'd)2014 Form 10-K



among a larger customer base. The regulated energy industry continues to experience significant structural changes, which could eventually lead to increased competition in Wisconsin.



Michigan has adopted retail choice which allows customers to remain with their regulated utility at regulated rates or choose an alternative electric supplier to provide power supply service. We continue providing distribution and customer service functions regardless of the customer's power supplier. See Factors Affecting Results, Liquidity and Capital Resources - Industry Restructuring and Competition - Restructuring in Michigan, for a discussion of the impact of customers switching to an alternative electric supplier in Michigan on our electric sales.



We compete with other utilities for sales to municipalities and cooperatives. We also compete with other utilities and marketers in the wholesale electric business. Our wholesale sales are impacted by availability, wholesale electric prices, market conditions and fuel costs.



Electric Supply



Our electric supply strategy is to provide our customers with energy from plants using a diverse fuel mix that is expected to maintain a stable, reliable and affordable supply of electricity. We supply a significant amount of electricity to our customers from power plants that we own. We supplement our internally generated power supply with long-term power purchase agreements, including the Point Beach Nuclear Power Plant (Point Beach) power purchase agreement discussed later in this report and through spot purchases in the MISO Energy Markets.



Our dependable capability by fuel type as of December 31 is shown below:

Historically, coal has been purchased under long-term contracts, which helped with price stability. Coal and associated transportation services have continued to see volatility in pricing due to changing domestic and world-wide demand for coal and the impacts of diesel costs which are incorporated into fuel surcharges on rail transportation.



We have a PSCW-approved hedging program to help manage our natural gas price risk. This hedging program is generally implemented on a 36-month forward-looking basis. Proceeds related to the natural gas hedging program are reflected in the average costs of natural gas and purchased power shown above.



Coal-Fired Generation



Coal Supply:We diversify the coal supply for our power plants by purchasing coal from mines in Wyoming and Montana, as well as from various other states. During2015, 87% of our projected coal requirements of 12.5 million tons are under contracts which are not tied to2015market pricing fluctuations. At the end of2014, our coal-fired generation consisted of six operating plants with a dependable capability of approximately3,707MW.



The annual tonnage amounts contracted for2015through2017are as follows:



YearAnnual Tonnage(Thousands)201510,84320165,88720173,417



Coal Deliveries:Approximately 100% of our2015coal requirements are expected to be delivered by Wisconsin Electric-owned or leased unit trains. The unit trains will transport coal for the Oak Creek and Pleasant Prairie Power Plants from Wyoming mines, and transport coal for the Oak Creek expansion units from Pennsylvania and Wyoming. Montana and Wyoming coal for the Presque Isle Power Plant (PIPP) is transported via rail to Superior, Wisconsin, placed in dock storage and reloaded into lake vessels for plant delivery. Existing coal inventory will be drawn down to fuel Valley Power Plant (VAPP) until its conversion to natural gas is complete, which is scheduled to



13Wisconsin Energy Corporation



ITEM 1.     BUSINESS - (Cont'd)2014 Form 10-K



occur in 2015. Milwaukee County Power Plant will be fueled with coal currently stored at a dock in the Port of Milwaukee, and additional small volume purchases will be shipped to that location.



Certain of our coal transportation contracts contain fuel cost adjustments that are tied to changes in diesel fuel and crude oil prices. Currently, diesel fuel contracts are not actively traded; therefore, we use financial heating oil contracts to mitigate risk related to diesel fuel prices. We have a PSCW-approved hedging program that allows us to hedge up to 75% of our potential risks related to fuel surcharge exposure. The costs of this program are included in our fuel and purchased power costs.



Environmental Matters:For information regarding emission restrictions, especially as they relate to coal-fired generating facilities, see Factors Affecting Results, Liquidity and Capital Resources -- Environmental Matters in Item 7.



Natural Gas-Fired Generation



Our natural gas-fired generation consists of five operating plants with a dependable capability of approximately 1,982 MW as ofDecember 31, 2014.



We purchase natural gas for these plants on the spot market from gas marketers, utilities and producers and we arrange for transportation of the natural gas to our plants. We have firm and interruptible transportation, as well as balancing and storage agreements intended to support the plants' variable usage.



We have a program that allows us to hedge up to 65% of our estimated gas usage for electric generation in order to help manage our natural gas price risk. The costs of this program are included in our fuel and purchased power costs.



Oil-Fired Generation



Fuel oil is used for the combustion turbines at the Germantown Power Plant units 1-4, boiler ignition and flame stabilization at PIPP, and diesel engines at the Pleasant Prairie Power Plant and VAPP. Our oil-fired generation had a dependable capability of approximately 180 MW as ofDecember 31, 2014. Our natural gas-fired peaking units have the ability to burn oil if natural gas is not available due to delivery constraints. Fuel oil requirements are purchased under agreements with suppliers.



Renewable Generation



Hydroelectric:Wisconsin Electric's hydroelectric generating system consists of 13 operating plants with a total installed capacity of approximately 88 MW and a dependable capability of approximately 39 MW as ofDecember 31, 2014. Of these plants, 12 plants (86 MW of installed capacity) have long-term licenses from FERC. The other plant, with an installed generating capacity of approximately 2 MW, is operated under a permit granted by another federal agency.



Wind:We have four wind sites, consisting of 200 turbines with an installed capacity of 338 MW and a dependable capability of 66 MW.



Biomass:We constructed a biomass-fueled power plant at Domtar Corporation's Rothschild, Wisconsin paper mill site that went into commercial operation in November 2013. Wood waste and wood shavings are used to produce a dependable capability of approximately 50 MW of electric power as well as steam to support Domtar's papermaking operations.

Power Purchase Commitments



We enter into short and long-term power purchase commitments to meet a portion of our anticipated electric energy supply needs. The following table identifies our power purchase commitments as ofDecember 31, 2014with unaffiliated parties for the next five years:



YearMW20151,26720161,26720171,26720181,26720191,267



The above commitments include approximately 1,030 MW per year related to the Point Beach long-term power purchase agreement. The balance of these purchased power commitments is an arrangement where we buy power at a price determined monthly based on a formula tied to the gas price index.



Electric Transmission and Energy Markets



American Transmission Company:ATC is a regional transmission company that owns, maintains, monitors and operates electric transmission systems in Wisconsin, Michigan, Illinois and Minnesota. ATC is expected to provide comparable service to all customers, including Wisconsin Electric, and to support effective competition in energy markets without favoring any market participant. ATC is regulated by FERC for all rate terms and conditions of service and is a transmission-owning member of MISO. MISO maintains operational control of ATC's transmission system, and Wisconsin Electric is a non-transmission owning member and customer of MISO. We owned approximately26.2%of ATC as ofDecember 31, 2014and2013. For additional information, see Note P -- Related Parties in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.



In April 2011, ATC and Duke Energy announced the creation of a joint venture, Duke-American Transmission Company, that will build, own and operate new electric transmission infrastructure in North America to address increasing demand for affordable, reliable transmission capacity. In April 2013, DATC acquired a 72% interest in California's Path 15 transmission line. DATC continues to evaluate new projects and opportunities, along with participating in the competitive bidding process on projects it considers viable. These projects are located in the service territories of several different regional transmission organizations around the country.



MISO:In connection with its status as a FERC approved RTO, MISO developed and operates the Energy and Operating Reserves Markets, which includes its bid-based energy markets and ancillary services market. In 2013, MISO expanded its footprint to include entities in Mississippi, Arkansas, Texas and Missouri. This new region is referred to as MISO South. We are participants in the West region. These changes have not had a material impact on our allocation of MISO costs, and we do not expect them to have a material impact in the future. For further information on MISO and the MISO Energy Markets, see Factors Affecting Results, Liquidity and Capital Resources -- Industry Restructuring and Competition - Electric Transmission, Capacity and Energy Markets in Item 7.

GAS UTILITY OPERATIONS



Our gas utility operations consist of Wisconsin Gas and the gas operations of Wisconsin Electric, both operating under the trade name of "We Energies." We are authorized to provide retail gas distribution service in designated territories in the state of Wisconsin, as established by indeterminate permits, CPCNs, or boundary agreements with other utilities. We also transport customer-owned gas. We are the largest natural gas distribution utility in Wisconsin, and we operate throughout the state, including the City of Milwaukee, west and south of the City of Milwaukee, the Appleton area and large areas of both central and western Wisconsin.



Gas Deliveries



Our gas utility business is highly seasonal due to the heating requirements of residential and commercial customers, and annual gas sales are impacted by the variability of winter temperatures.



Total gas therms delivered, including customer-owned transported gas, were approximately2,570.7 milliontherms during2014, a5.2%increase compared with2013. As ofDecember 31, 2014, we were transporting gas for approximately1,800customers who purchased gas directly from other suppliers. Transported gas accounted for approximately42.3%of the total volumes delivered during2014,43.1%during2013and51.3%during2012. We had approximately1,089,000and1,079,800gas customers as ofDecember 31, 2014and2013, respectively. Our peak daily send-out during2014was 1,949,679 Dth on January 6,2014.



Sales to Large Gas Customers:We provide gas utility service to a diversified base of industrial customers who are largely within our electric service territory. Major industries served include paper, food products, chemicals and fabricated metal products. Fuel used for Wisconsin Electric's electric generation represents our largest transportation customer. Gas therms delivered to Wisconsin Electric for electric generation represents 9.3%, 10.4% and 17.2% of the total volumes delivered during 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.



Gas Deliveries Growth:We currently forecast total retail therm deliveries (excluding natural gas deliveries for generation) to grow at a compound annual rate of 0.5% over the five-year period ending December 31, 2019. This forecast reflects a current year weather normalized sales level and normal weather.



Western Gas Lateral:We are projecting the need for additional capacity for our natural gas distribution network in the western part of Wisconsin to address reliability and meet customer demand. We received PSCW approval to construct a new natural gas lateral on July 18, 2014. The anticipated cost of the initial phase of this project is approximately $175 million to $185 million, excluding Allowance for Funds Used During Construction (AFUDC). We are targeting completion of this phase of the project in late 2015.



Competition



Competition in varying degrees exists between natural gas and other forms of energy available to consumers. A number of our large commercial and industrial customers are dual-fuel customers that are equipped to switch between natural gas and alternate fuels. We are allowed to offer lower-priced gas sales and transportation services to dual-fuel customers. Under gas transportation agreements, customers purchase gas directly from gas marketers and arrange with interstate pipelines and us to have the gas transported to their facilities. We earn substantially the same margin (difference between revenue and cost of gas) whether we sell and transport gas to customers or only transport their gas.



Our ability to maintain our share of the industrial dual-fuel market depends on our success and the success of third-party gas marketers in obtaining long-term and short-term supplies of natural gas at competitive prices compared to other sources and in arranging or facilitating competitively-priced transportation service for those customers that desire to buy their own gas supplies.



Federal and state regulators continue to implement policies to bring more competition to the gas industry. While the gas utility distribution function is expected to remain a highly regulated, monopoly function, the sale of the natural gas commodity and related services are expected to remain subject to competition from third parties. It remains uncertain if and when the current economic disincentives for small firm customers to choose an alternative gas commodity supplier may be removed such that we begin to face competition for the sale of gas to those customers.

ITEM 1.     BUSINESS - (Cont'd)2014 Form 10-K



Gas Supply, Pipeline Capacity and Storage



We have been able to meet our contractual obligations with both our suppliers and our customers.



Pipeline Capacity and Storage:The interstate pipelines serving Wisconsin originate in major gas producing areas of North America: the Oklahoma and Texas basins, the Gulf of Mexico, western Canada and the Rocky Mountains. We have contracted for long-term firm capacity from a number of these sources. This strategy reflects management's belief that overall supply security is enhanced by geographic diversification of the supply portfolio.



Due to the daily and seasonal variations in gas usage in Wisconsin, we have also contracted for substantial underground storage capacity, primarily in Michigan. We target storage inventory levels at approximately 34% of forecasted winter demand; November through March is considered the winter season. Storage capacity, along with our gas purchase contracts, enables us to manage significant changes in daily demand and to optimize our overall gas supply and capacity costs. We generally inject gas into storage during the spring and summer months when demand is lower and withdraw it in the winter months. As a result, we can contract for less long-line pipeline capacity during periods of peak usage than would otherwise be necessary and can purchase gas on a more uniform daily basis from suppliers year-round. Each of these capabilities enables us to reduce our overall costs.



We hold daily transportation and storage capacity entitlements with interstate pipeline companies as well as other service providers under varied-length long-term contracts.



Term Gas Supply:We have contracts for firm supplies with terms in excess of 30 days with suppliers for gas acquired in the Chicago, Illinois market hub and in the producing areas discussed above. The pricing of the term contracts is based upon first of the month indices. Combined with our storage capability, management believes that the volume of gas under contract is sufficient to meet our forecasted firm peak-day and seasonal demand.



Secondary Market Transactions:Pipeline long-line and storage capacity and gas supplies under contract can be resold in secondary markets. Local distribution companies, like Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Gas, must contract for capacity and supply sufficient to meet the firm peak-day demand of their customers. Peak or near peak demand days generally occur only a few times each year. The secondary markets facilitate higher utilization of contracted capacity and supply during those times when the full contracted capacity and supply are not needed by the utility, helping to mitigate the fixed costs associated with maintaining peak levels of capacity and gas supply. Through pre-arranged agreements and day-to-day electronic bulletin board postings, interested parties can purchase this excess capacity and supply. The proceeds from these transactions are passed through to rate payers, subject to the Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Gas approved Gas Cost Recovery Mechanisms (GCRMs). During2014, we continued to participate in the secondary markets. See Factors Affecting Results, Liquidity and Capital Resources -- Utility Rates and Regulatory Matters in Item 7 for information on the GCRMs.



Spot Market Gas Supply:We expect to continue to make gas purchases in the 30-day spot market as price opportunity and other circumstances dictate. We have supply relationships with a number of sellers from whom we purchase spot gas.



Hedging Gas Supply Prices:We have PSCW approval to hedge (i) up to 60% of planned winter and (ii) up to 30% of planned summer flowing gas supply using a mix of New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) based natural gas options and natural gas future contracts. Those approvals allow both Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Gas to pass 100% of the hedging costs (premiums and brokerage fees) and proceeds (gains and losses) to rate payers through their respective GCRMs. Hedge targets (volumes) are provided annually to the PSCW as part of each company's three-year gas supply plan and risk management filing.



To the extent that opportunities develop and physical supply operating plans are supportive, we also have PSCW approval to utilize NYMEX based natural gas derivatives to capture favorable forward market price differentials. That approval provides for 100% of the related proceeds to accrue to our GCRMs.

REGULATION



Wisconsin Energy Corporation



Wisconsin Energy is a holding company, but is exempt from the requirements of the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 2005 (PUHCA 2005).



Non-Utility Asset Cap:Pursuant to the non-utility asset cap provisions of Wisconsin's public utility holding company law, the sum of certain assets of all non-utility affiliates in a holding company system may not exceed 25% of the assets of all public utility affiliates. However, among other items, the law exempts energy-related assets, including the generating plants constructed by We Power as part of our PTF strategy, from being counted against the asset cap provided that they are employed in qualifying businesses. As a result of these exemptions, our non-utility assets are significantly below the non-utility asset cap as ofDecember 31, 2014.



Utility Energy Segment



Wisconsin Electric is a holding company because of its ownership interest in ATC, but is exempt from the requirements of PUHCA 2005.



Wisconsin Electric is subject to the Federal Power Act and the corresponding regulations developed by certain federal agencies. The Energy Policy Act amended the Federal Power Act in 2005 to, among other things, make electric utility industry consolidation more feasible, authorize FERC to review proposed mergers and the acquisition of generation facilities, change the FERC regulatory scheme applicable to qualifying cogeneration facilities and modify certain other aspects of energy regulations and Federal tax policies applicable to Wisconsin Electric. Additionally, the Energy Policy Act created an Electric Reliability Organization to be overseen by FERC, which established mandatory electric reliability standards and which has the authority to levy monetary sanctions for failure to comply with these standards.



Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Gas are subject to the regulation of the PSCW as to retail electric, gas and steam rates in the state of Wisconsin, standards of service, issuance of securities, construction of certain new facilities, transactions with affiliates, billing practices and various other matters. Wisconsin Electric is also subject to the regulation of the PSCW as to certain levels of short-term debt obligations. Wisconsin Electric is subject to the regulation of the MPSC as to the various matters associated with retail electric service in the state of Michigan, except as to the issuance of securities in the ordinary course of business, construction of certain new facilities, levels of short-term debt obligations and advance approval of transactions with affiliates in the ordinary course of business. Almost all of Wisconsin Electric's hydroelectric facilities are regulated by FERC. Wisconsin Electric is subject to the regulation of FERC with respect to wholesale power service, electric reliability requirements and accounting and with respect to our participation in the interstate natural gas pipeline capacity market.

Public Benefits and Renewable Portfolio Standard



2005 Wisconsin Act 141 (Act 141) established a goal that 10% of electricity consumed in Wisconsin be generated by renewable resources by December 31, 2015. Under Act 141, we must meet certain minimum requirements for renewable energy generation. For the years 2010 through 2014, we were required to increase our percentage of total retail energy sales provided by renewable sources (renewable energy percentage) by at least two percentage points from our baseline renewable percentage of 2.27%. As ofDecember 31, 2014, we are in compliance with the Wisconsin renewable energy percentage of 4.27%. Act 141 further requires that for the year 2015 and beyond, the renewable energy percentage must increase at least six percentage points above the baseline to a level of 8.27%. We expect to be in compliance with this standard. In addition, under this Act, 1.2% of utilities' annual operating revenues were required to be used to fund energy conservation programs in 2014. The funding required by Act 141 for 2015 is also 1.2% of annual operating revenues.



Public Act 295 enacted in Michigan requires 10% of the state's energy to come from renewables by 2015 and energy optimization (efficiency) targets up to 1% annually by 2015. We are currently in compliance with this requirement. Public Act 295 specifically calls for current recovery of costs incurred to meet the standards and provides for ongoing review and revision to assure the measures taken are cost-effective.



For additional information on Act 141 and our renewable portfolio, see Factors Affecting Results, Liquidity and Capital Resources -- Utility Rates and Regulatory Matters - Renewables, Efficiency and Conservation in Item 7.



Non-Utility Energy Segment



We Power owns the interests in the companies that constructed the new generating capacity in our PTF strategy (collectively, the We Power project companies). These facilities are being leased on a long-term basis to Wisconsin Electric. We Power received determinations from FERC that upon the transfer of the facilities by lease to Wisconsin Electric, the We Power project companies are not deemed public utilities under the Federal Power Act and thus are not subject to FERC's jurisdiction.



Environmental permits necessary for operating the facilities are the responsibility of the operating entity, Wisconsin Electric.

ENVIRONMENTAL COMPLIANCE



Our operations are subject to extensive environmental regulations by state and federal environmental agencies governing air and water quality, hazardous and solid waste management, environmental remediation and management of natural resources. Costs associated with complying with these requirements are significant. Additional future environmental statutes and regulations or revisions to existing laws, including for example, additional regulation of greenhouse gas emissions, coal combustion products, air emissions or wastewater discharges, could significantly increase these environmental compliance costs.



Anticipated expenditures for environmental compliance and remediation issues for the next three years are included in estimated capital expenditures described in Liquidity and Capital Resources -- Capital Requirements in Item 7. For discussion of additional environmental issues, see Environmental Matters in Item 3. For further information concerning air and water quality standards and rulemaking initiated by the EPA, including estimated costs of compliance, see Factors Affecting Results, Liquidity and Capital Resources -- Environmental Matters in Item 7. For a discussion of matters related to certain solid waste and coal combustion product landfills, manufactured gas plant sites and air quality, see Note Q -- Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.



Compliance with federal, state and local environmental protection requirements resulted in capital expenditures by Wisconsin Electric of approximately $1.0 million in2014compared with $24.7 million in2013. Expenditures incurred during2014and2013primarily included costs associated with the installation of pollution abatement facilities at Wisconsin Electric's power plants. No future expenditures are currently anticipated. Operation, maintenance and depreciation expenses for fly ash removal equipment and other environmental protection systems were approximately $110.3 million and $92.9 million during2014and2013, respectively.



Coal Combustion Product Fills and Landfills



We currently have a program of beneficial utilization for substantially all of our coal combustion products, including fly ash, bottom ash and gypsum, which minimizes the need for disposal in specially-designed landfills. Some early designed and constructed coal combustion product landfills, which we used prior to developing this program, may allow the release of low levels of constituents resulting in the need for various levels of remediation. Where we have become aware of these conditions, efforts have been made to define the nature and extent of any release, and work has been performed to address these conditions. In addition, fill areas for coal ash were used prior to the introduction of landfill regulations. Sites currently undergoing review include the following:



Oak Creek Site Landfills:Groundwater near the sites, located in the Village of Caledonia and the City of Oak Creek, Wisconsin, was found to contain levels of molybdenum above the allowable limit prompting Wisconsin Electric to begin investigation in 2009 for the source of the molybdenum. Our study indicates that the groundwater impacts are naturally occurring or are from other sources based on groundwater flow direction and increasing concentrations of elements deeper in the ground. The WDNR began sampling work in 2011 to identify the source of the groundwater impacts and issued its report in 2013. The WDNR study found that the data was inconclusive as to the source causing the groundwater impacts. We reviewed the WDNR report and provided technical comments further supporting our position that regional ground water impacts are not a result of coal ash management activities at the Oak Creek site. The Wisconsin Department of Health Services has since increased the allowable limit for molybdenum in groundwater, and the WDNR sent a letter to residents with private wells that exceeded the earlier limit with information about the change. For additional information regarding molybdenum, see Factors Affecting Results, Liquidity and Capital Resources -- Environmental Matters -- Land Quality -- New Coal Combustion Products Regulation in Item 7.







OTHER





Research and Development:We had immaterial research and development expenditures in the last three years, primarily for improvement of service and abatement of air and water pollution by our electric utility operations. Research and development activities include work done by employees, consultants and contractors, plus sponsorship of research by industry associations.
