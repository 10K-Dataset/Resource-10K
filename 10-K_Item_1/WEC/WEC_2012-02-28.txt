UTILITY ENERGY SEGMENT





ELECTRIC UTILITY OPERATIONS



Our electric utility operations consist of the electric operations of Wisconsin Electric. Wisconsin Electric, which is the largest electric utility in the state of Wisconsin, generates and distributes electric energy in a territory that includes southeastern (including the metropolitan Milwaukee area), east central and northern Wisconsin and the Upper Peninsula of Michigan.



Wisconsin Electric participates in the MISO Energy Markets. The competitiveness of our generation offered in the MISO Energy Markets affects how our generating units are dispatched and how we buy and sell power. For further information, see Factors Affecting Results, Liquidity and Capital Resources in Item 7.



Electric Sales



Our electric energy sales to all classes of customers totaled approximately31.3 millionMWh during2011and approximately30.5 millionMWh during2010. We had approximately1,122,500electric customers as ofDecember 31, 2011and1,120,200electric customers as ofDecember 31, 2010.

ITEM 1.     BUSINESS - (Cont'd)2011 Form 10-K



Wisconsin Electric is authorized to provide retail electric service in designated territories in the state of Wisconsin, as established by indeterminate permits, Certificates of Public Convenience and Necessity (CPCNs) or boundary agreements with other utilities, and in certain territories in the state of Michigan pursuant to franchises granted by municipalities. Wisconsin Electric also sells wholesale electric power within the MISO Energy Markets.



Electric Sales Growth:Our service territory continued to experience growth in 2011 in sustained recovery from the significant economic recession that occurred during late 2008 and 2009. Our normalized 2011 retail electric sales, excluding our two largest customers, two iron ore mines, were approximately 0.4% higher than our normalized 2010 electric sales. As we look toward 2012 and beyond, we presently anticipate that total retail electric kWh sales of our utility energy segment and the associated peak electric demand will grow at annual rates of 0.5% to 1.0% over the next five years. These estimates assume normal weather and exclude the two iron ore mines.



Sales to Large Electric Retail Customers:We provide electric utility service to a diversified base of customers in such industries as mining, paper, foundry, food products and machinery production, as well as to large retail chains.



Our largest retail electric customers are two iron ore mines located in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. The combined electric energy sales to the two mines accounted for 7.1% and 6.9% of our total electric utility energy sales during2011and2010, respectively. The mines have notified us that they expect production at one of the mines to be reduced in 2012.



Sales to Wholesale Customers:During2011, we sold wholesale electric energy to one municipally owned system, two rural cooperatives and two municipal joint action agencies located in the states of Wisconsin and Michigan. Our wholesale electric energy sales were also made to 14 other public utilities and power marketers throughout the region under rates approved by FERC. Wholesale sales accounted for approximately13.1%of our total electric energy sales and7.0%of total electric operating revenues during2011, compared with10.2%of total electric energy sales and6.0%of total electric operating revenues during2010.



Electric System Reliability Matters:Our electric sales are impacted by seasonal factors and varying weather conditions. We sell more electricity during the summer months because of the residential cooling load. The Public Service Commission of Wisconsin (PSCW) has planning reserve requirements consistent with the MISO calculated planning reserve margin. The Michigan Public Service Commission (MPSC) has not yet established guidelines in this area. In accordance with the MISO calculated planning reserve margin requirements, we had adequate capacity to meet all of our firm electric load obligations during2011and expect to have adequate capacity to meet all of our firm obligations during2012. For additional information, see Factors Affecting Results, Liquidity and Capital Resources in Item 7.



Electric Supply



Our electric supply strategy is to provide our customers with energy from plants using a diverse fuel mix that is expected to maintain a stable, reliable and affordable supply of electricity. We supply a significant amount of electricity to our customers from power plants that we own. We supplement our internally generated power supply with long-term power purchase agreements, including the Point Beach Nuclear Power Plant (Point Beach) power purchase agreement discussed later in this report, and through spot purchases in the MISO Energy Markets.



Our installed capacity by fuel type as of December 31 is shown below:

(b)The increase in 2011 as compared to 2010 reflects the January 2011 in-service date of OC 2, partially offset by the March 2011 sale of our interest in Edgewater Generating Unit 5. The increase in 2010 as compared to 2009 reflects the February 2010 in-service date of OC 1. Our share of the dependable capability of OC 1 and OC 2 is528MW each.



(c)The dual-fueled facilities generally burn oil only if natural gas is not available due to constraints on the natural gas pipeline and/or at the local gas distribution company that delivers gas to the plants.



(d)Includes hydroelectric and wind generation. The increase in 2011 as compared to 2010 reflects the December 2011 in-service date of the Glacier Hills Wind Park. For purposes of measuring dependable capability, the 162 MW Glacier Hills Wind Park has a dependable capability of32MW and the 145 MW Blue Sky Green Field wind project has a dependable capability of29MW.



The table below indicates our sources of electric energy supply as a percentage of sales for the three years endedDecember 31, 2011, as well as an estimate for2012:

Historically, the fuel costs for coal have been under long-term contracts, which helped with price stability. Coal and associated transportation services have continued to see volatility in pricing due to increased domestic and world-wide demand for coal and the impacts of diesel costs which are incorporated into fuel surcharges on rail transportation.



Natural gas costs have been volatile. We have a PSCW-approved hedging program to help manage our natural gas price risk. This hedging program is generally implemented on a 36-month forward-looking basis. Proceeds related to the natural gas hedging program are reflected in the average costs of natural gas and purchased power shown above.



Coal-Fired Generation



Coal Supply:We diversify the coal supply for our power plants by purchasing coal from mines in Wyoming, Pennsylvania and Montana, as well as from various other states. During2012, 100% of our projected coal requirements of 9.7 million tons are under contracts which are not tied to2012market pricing fluctuations. At the end of2011, our coal-fired generation consisted of six operating plants with a dependable capability of approximately3,880MW.





12Wisconsin Energy Corporation



ITEM 1.     BUSINESS - (Cont'd)2011 Form 10-K



The annual tonnage amounts contracted for2012through2014are as follows:



YearAnnual Tonnage(Thousands)20129,86820136,20520143,270



Coal Deliveries:Approximately 100% of our2012coal requirements are expected to be delivered by Wisconsin Electric-owned or leased unit trains. The unit trains will transport coal for the Oak Creek and Pleasant Prairie Power Plants from Wyoming mines, and transport coal for the Oak Creek expansion units from Pennsylvania and West Virginia. Coal from a Montana mine is also transported via rail to Lake Michigan transfer docks and delivered by lake vessel to the Milwaukee harbor for Milwaukee-based power plants. Montana and Wyoming coal for the Presque Isle Power Plant is transported via rail to Superior, Wisconsin, placed in dock storage and reloaded into lake vessels for plant delivery.



Certain of our coal transportation contracts contain fuel cost adjustments that are tied to changes in diesel fuel and crude oil prices. Currently, diesel fuel contracts are not actively traded; therefore, we use financial heating oil contracts to mitigate risk related to diesel fuel prices. We have a PSCW-approved hedging program that allows us to hedge up to 75% of our potential risks related to fuel surcharge exposure. The costs of this program are included in our fuel and purchased power costs.



Edgewater Generating Unit 5:On March 1, 2011, we sold our 25% interest in Edgewater Generating Unit 5 to Wisconsin Power and Light Company, a subsidiary of Alliant Energy Corp. (WPL), for our net book value, including working capital, of approximately $38 million.



Environmental Matters:For information regarding emission restrictions, especially as they relate to coal-fired generating facilities, see Factors Affecting Results, Liquidity and Capital Resources -- Environmental Matters in Item 7.



Natural Gas-Fired Generation



Our natural gas-fired generation consists of four operating plants with a dependable capability of approximately 1,983 MW as ofDecember 31, 2011.



We purchase natural gas for these plants on the spot market from gas marketers, utilities and producers and we arrange for transportation of the natural gas to our plants. We have firm and interruptible transportation, balancing and storage agreements intended to support the plants' variable usage.



We have a PSCW-approved hedging program that allows us to hedge up to 65% of our estimated gas usage for electric generation in order to help manage our natural gas price risk. The costs of this program are included in our fuel and purchased power costs.



Oil-Fired Generation



Fuel oil is used for the combustion turbines at the Germantown Power Plant units 1-4, boiler ignition and flame stabilization at the Presque Isle Power Plant, and diesel engines at the Pleasant Prairie Power Plant and Valley Power Plant (VAPP). Our oil-fired generation had a dependable capability of approximately 257 MW as ofDecember 31, 2011. Our natural gas-fired peaking units have the ability to burn oil if natural gas is not available due to delivery constraints. Fuel oil requirements are purchased under agreements with suppliers.



Renewable Generation



Hydroelectric:Wisconsin Electric's hydroelectric generating system consists of 13 operating plants with a total installed capacity of approximately 88 MW and a dependable capability of approximately 57 MW as ofDecember 31, 2011. Of these 13 plants, 12 plants (86 MW of installed capacity) have long-term licenses from



13Wisconsin Energy Corporation



ITEM 1.     BUSINESS - (Cont'd)2011 Form 10-K



FERC. The thirteenth plant, with an installed generating capacity of approximately 2 MW, is operated under a permit granted by another agency of the federal government.



Wind:The Blue Sky Green Field wind farm project, which has 88 turbines with an installed capacity of 145 MW and a dependable capability of29MW, commenced commercial operation in May 2008. The Glacier Hills Wind Park, which has 90 turbines with an installed capacity of 162 MW and a dependable capability of32MW, commenced commercial operation in December 2011.



Biomass:We are constructing a biomass-fueled power plant at Domtar Corporation's Rothschild, Wisconsin paper mill site. Wood waste and wood shavings will be used to produce approximately 50 MW of renewable electricity and will also support Domtar's sustainable papermaking operations. Construction commenced on June 27, 2011. We currently expect to invest between $245 million and $255 million, excluding Allowance for Funds Used During Construction (AFUDC), in the plant and we expect the plant to be completed during the fall of 2013.



Power Purchase Commitments



We enter into short and long-term power purchase commitments to meet a portion of our anticipated electric energy supply needs. The following table identifies our power purchase commitments as ofDecember 31, 2011with unaffiliated parties for the next five years:



YearMW20121,44020131,26920141,26920151,26920161,269



The above commitments include approximately 1,030 MW per year related to the Point Beach long-term power purchase agreement. Under this agreement, we pay a predetermined price per MWh for energy delivered according to a schedule included in the agreement. The balance of these power purchase commitments are tolling arrangements whereby we are responsible for the procurement, delivery and the cost of natural gas fuel related to specific units identified in the contracts.



Electric Transmission and Energy Markets



American Transmission Company:ATC is a regional transmission company that owns, maintains, monitors and operates electric transmission systems in Wisconsin, Michigan and Illinois. ATC is expected to provide comparable service to all customers, including Wisconsin Electric, and to support effective competition in energy markets without favoring any market participant. ATC is regulated by FERC for all rate terms and conditions of service and is a transmission-owning member of MISO. MISO maintains operational control of ATC's transmission system, and Wisconsin Electric is a non-transmission owning member and customer of MISO. We owned approximately26.2%of ATC as ofDecember 31, 2011and2010. For additional information, see Note Q -- Related Parties in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.



In April 2011, ATC and Duke Energy announced the creation of a joint venture, Duke-American Transmission Company (DATC), that will build, own and operate new electric transmission infrastructure in North America to address increasing demand for affordable, reliable transmission capacity.



MISO:In connection with its status as a FERC approved Regional Transmission Organization (RTO), MISO developed bid-based energy markets, which were implemented on April 1, 2005. In January 2009, MISO commenced the Energy and Operating Reserves Markets, which includes the bid-based energy markets and the ancillary services market. For further information on MISO and the MISO Energy Markets, see Factors Affecting Results, Liquidity and Capital Resources -- Industry Restructuring and Competition - Electric Transmission and Energy Markets in Item 7.

GAS UTILITY OPERATIONS



Our gas utility operations consist of Wisconsin Gas and the gas operations of Wisconsin Electric, both operating under the trade name of "We Energies." We are authorized to provide retail gas distribution service in designated territories in the state of Wisconsin, as established by indeterminate permits, CPCNs, or boundary agreements with other utilities. We also transport customer-owned gas. We are the largest natural gas distribution utility in Wisconsin and we operate throughout the state, including the City of Milwaukee, west and south of the City of Milwaukee, the Appleton area and areas within Iron and Vilas Counties.



Gas Deliveries



Our gas utility business is highly seasonal due to the heating requirements of residential and commercial customers, and annual gas sales are impacted by the variability of winter temperatures.



Total gas therms delivered, including customer-owned transported gas, were approximately2,154.1 milliontherms during2011, a2.3%increase compared with2010. As ofDecember 31, 2011, we were transporting gas for approximately1,400customers who purchased gas directly from other suppliers. Transported gas accounted for approximately41.8%of the total volumes delivered during2011,43.5%during2010and40.4%during2009. We had approximately1,068,200and1,064,500gas customers as ofDecember 31, 2011and2010, respectively. Our peak daily send-out during2011was 1,545,577 Dth on February 9,2011.



Sales to Large Gas Customers:We provide gas utility service to a diversified base of industrial customers who are largely within our electric service territory. Major industries served include the paper, food products and fabricated metal products industries. Fuel used for Wisconsin Electric's electric generation represents our largest transportation customer.



Gas Deliveries Growth:We currently forecast total retail therm deliveries (excluding natural gas deliveries for generation) to stay flat over the five-year period ending December 31, 2016 as new customer additions are expected to be offset by a reduction in the average use per customer. This forecast reflects a current year normalized sales level and normal weather.



Competition



Competition in varying degrees exists between natural gas and other forms of energy available to consumers. A number of our large commercial and industrial customers are dual-fuel customers that are equipped to switch between natural gas and alternate fuels. We are allowed to offer lower-priced gas sales and transportation services to dual-fuel customers. Under gas transportation agreements, customers purchase gas directly from gas marketers and arrange with interstate pipelines and us to have the gas transported to their facilities. We earn substantially the same margin (difference between revenue and cost of gas) whether we sell and transport gas to customers or only transport their gas.



Our ability to maintain our share of the industrial dual-fuel market depends on our success and the success of third-party gas marketers in obtaining long-term and short-term supplies of natural gas at competitive prices compared to other sources and in arranging or facilitating competitively-priced transportation service for those customers that desire to buy their own gas supplies.



Federal and state regulators continue to implement policies to bring more competition to the gas industry. While the gas utility distribution function is expected to remain a highly regulated, monopoly function, the sale of the natural gas commodity and related services are expected to remain subject to competition from third parties. It remains uncertain if and when the current economic disincentives for small customers to choose an alternative gas commodity supplier may be removed such that we begin to face competition for the sale of gas to our smaller firm customers.



Gas Supply, Pipeline Capacity and Storage



We have been able to meet our contractual obligations with both our suppliers and our customers despite periods of severe cold in recent heating seasons.





16Wisconsin Energy Corporation





ITEM 1.     BUSINESS - (Cont'd)2011 Form 10-K



Pipeline Capacity and Storage:The interstate pipelines serving Wisconsin originate in major gas producing areas of North America: the Oklahoma and Texas basins, the Gulf of Mexico, western Canada and the Rocky Mountains. We have contracted for long-term firm capacity from a number of these sources. This strategy reflects management's belief that overall supply security is enhanced by geographic diversification of the supply portfolio.



Due to the daily and seasonal variations in gas usage in Wisconsin, we have also contracted for substantial underground storage capacity, primarily in Michigan. We target storage levels at approximately 35% of winter demand. Storage capacity, along with our gas purchase contracts, enables us to manage significant changes in daily demand and to optimize our overall gas supply and capacity costs. We generally inject gas into storage during the spring and summer months when demand is lower and withdraw it in the winter months. As a result, we can contract for less long-line pipeline capacity during periods of peak usage than would otherwise be necessary and can purchase gas on a more uniform daily basis from suppliers year-round. Each of these capabilities enables us to reduce our overall costs.



We hold firm daily transportation and storage capacity entitlements from pipelines and other service providers under long-term contracts.



Term Gas Supply:We have contracts for firm supplies with terms in excess of 30 days with suppliers for gas acquired in the Chicago, Illinois market hub and in the producing areas discussed above. The pricing of the term contracts is based upon first of the month indices. Combined with our storage capability, management believes that the volume of gas under contract is sufficient to meet our forecasted firm peak-day demand.



Secondary Market Transactions:Capacity release is a mechanism by which pipeline long-line and storage capacity and gas supplies under contract can be resold in the secondary market. Local distribution companies, like Wisconsin Gas and Wisconsin Electric, must contract for capacity and supply sufficient to meet the firm peak-day demand of their customers. Peak or near peak demand days generally occur only a few times each year. Capacity release facilitates higher utilization of contracted capacity and supply during those times when the full contracted capacity and supply are not needed by the utility, helping to mitigate the fixed costs associated with maintaining peak levels of capacity and gas supply. Through pre-arranged agreements and day-to-day electronic bulletin board postings, interested parties can purchase this excess capacity and supply. The proceeds from these transactions are passed through to rate payers, subject to the Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Gas approved Gas Cost Recovery Mechanisms (GCRMs). During2011, we continued to participate in the capacity release market. See Factors Affecting Results, Liquidity and Capital Resources -- Utility Rates and Regulatory Matters in Item 7 for information on the GCRMs.



Spot Market Gas Supply:We expect to continue to make gas purchases in the 30-day spot market as price and other circumstances dictate. We have supply relationships with a number of sellers from whom we purchase spot gas.



Hedging Gas Supply Prices:We have PSCW approval to hedge (i) up to 45% of planned flowing gas supply using New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) based natural gas options and (ii) up to 15% of planned flowing gas supply using NYMEX based natural gas future contracts. Those approvals allow both Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Gas to pass 100% of the hedging costs (premiums and brokerage fees) and proceeds (gains and losses) to rate payers through their respective GCRMs. Hedge targets (volumes) are provided annually to the PSCW as part of each company's three-year gas supply plan and risk management filing.



To the extent that opportunities develop and our physical supply operating plans will support them, we also have PSCW approval to utilize NYMEX based natural gas derivatives to capture favorable forward market price differentials. That approval provides for 100% of the related proceeds to accrue to our GCRMs.

We Power, through wholly owned subsidiaries, has designed and built approximately 2,320 MW of new generation in Wisconsin, which is being leased to Wisconsin Electric under long-term leases. This new generation consists of approximately 1,230 MW of new capacity from OC 1 and OC 2, and 1,090 MW of capacity from PWGS 1 and PWGS 2. PWGS 1 and PWGS 2 were placed in service in July 2005 and May 2008, respectively. OC 1 and OC 2 were placed in service in February 2010 and January 2011, respectively. In November 2005, two unaffiliated entities collectively purchased an ownership interest of approximately 17%, or 200 MW, in OC 1 and OC 2. Similar to the generating capacity at PWGS 1 and PWGS 2, We Power owns the remaining generating capacity at OC 1 and OC 2.

REGULATION



Wisconsin Energy Corporation



Wisconsin Energy is a holding company, but is exempt from the requirements of the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 2005 (PUHCA 2005).



Non-Utility Asset Cap:Pursuant to the non-utility asset cap provisions of Wisconsin's public utility holding company law, the sum of certain assets of all non-utility affiliates in a holding company system may not exceed 25% of the assets of all public utility affiliates. However, among other items, the law exempts energy-related assets, including the generating plants constructed by We Power as part of our PTF strategy and assets used for providing environmental engineering services and for processing waste materials, from being counted against the asset cap provided that they are employed in qualifying businesses. As a result of these exemptions, our non-utility assets are significantly below the non-utility asset cap as ofDecember 31, 2011.



Utility Energy Segment



Wisconsin Electric is a holding company because of its ownership interest in ATC, but is exempt from the requirements of PUHCA 2005.



Wisconsin Electric is subject to the Federal Power Act and the corresponding regulations developed by certain federal agencies. The Energy Policy Act amended the Federal Power Act in 2005 to, among other things, make electric utility industry consolidation more feasible, authorize FERC to review proposed mergers and the acquisition of generation facilities, change the FERC regulatory scheme applicable to qualifying cogeneration facilities and modify certain other aspects of energy regulations and Federal tax policies applicable to Wisconsin Electric. Additionally, the Energy Policy Act created an Electric Reliability Organization to be overseen by FERC, which established mandatory electric reliability standards and which has the authority to levy monetary sanctions for failure to comply with these standards.



Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Gas are subject to the regulation of the PSCW as to retail electric, gas and steam rates in the state of Wisconsin, standards of service, issuance of securities, construction of certain new facilities, transactions with affiliates, billing practices and various other matters. Wisconsin Electric is also subject to the regulation of the PSCW as to certain levels of short-term debt obligations. Wisconsin Electric is subject to the regulation of the MPSC as to the various matters associated with retail electric service in the state of Michigan, except as to the issuance of securities in the ordinary course of business, construction of certain new facilities, levels of short-term debt obligations and advance approval of transactions with affiliates in the ordinary course of business. Wisconsin Electric's hydroelectric facilities are regulated by FERC. Wisconsin Electric is subject to the regulation of FERC with respect to wholesale power service, electric reliability requirements and accounting and with respect to our participation in the interstate natural gas pipeline capacity market.

The operations of Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Gas are also subject to regulations, where applicable, of the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources (WDNR), the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality and the Michigan Department of Natural Resources.



Public Benefits and Renewable Portfolio Standard



Wisconsin Act 141 establishes a goal that 10% of all electricity consumed in Wisconsin be generated by renewable resources by December 31, 2015. Under this act, we must meet certain minimum requirements for renewable energy generation. For the years 2010 through 2014, we must increase our percentage of total retail energy sales provided by renewable sources (renewable energy percentage) by at least two percentage points from our baseline renewable percentage of 2.27% to a level of 4.27%. Act 141 defines "baseline renewable percentage" as the average of an energy provider's renewable energy percentage for 2001, 2002 and 2003. As ofDecember 31, 2011, we are in compliance with the Wisconsin renewable energy percentage of 4.27%. Act 141 further requires that for the year 2015 and beyond, the renewable energy percentage must increase at least six percentage points above the baseline to a level of 8.27%. In addition, under this Act, 1.5% of utilities' annual operating revenues were required to be used to fund energy conservation programs in 2011.  The funding required by Act 141 decreased to 1.2% of annual operating revenues in 2012.



Public Act 295 enacted in Michigan calls for the implementation of a renewable portfolio standard by 2015 and energy optimization (efficiency) targets up to 1% annually by 2015. Public Act 295 specifically calls for current recovery of costs incurred to meet the standards and provides for ongoing review and revision to assure the measures taken are cost-effective.



For additional information on Act 141 and current renewable projects, see Factors Affecting Results, Liquidity and Capital Resources -- Utility Rates and Regulatory Matters - Renewables, Efficiency and Conservation and Utility Rates and Regulatory Matters - Renewable Energy Portfolio in Item 7.



Non-Utility Energy Segment



We Power was formed to design, construct, own and lease the new generating capacity in our PTF strategy. We Power owns the interests in the companies that constructed this new generating capacity (collectively, the We Power project companies). These facilities are being leased on a long-term basis to Wisconsin Electric. We Power received determinations from FERC that upon the transfer of the facilities by lease to Wisconsin Electric, the We Power project companies are not deemed public utilities under the Federal Power Act and thus are not subject to FERC's jurisdiction.



Environmental permits necessary for operating the facilities are the responsibility of the operating entity, Wisconsin Electric.

ENVIRONMENTAL COMPLIANCE



Our operations are subject to extensive environmental regulations by state and federal environmental agencies governing air and water quality, hazardous and solid waste management, environmental remediation and management of natural resources. Costs associated with complying with these requirements are significant. Additional future environmental statutes and regulations or revisions to existing laws, including for example, additional regulation of greenhouse gas emissions, coal combustion products, air emissions or wastewater discharges, could significantly increase these environmental compliance costs.



Expenditures for environmental compliance and remediation issues are included in anticipated capital expenditures described in Liquidity and Capital Resources in Item 7. For discussion of additional environmental issues, see Environmental Matters in Item 3. For further information concerning air and water quality standards and rulemaking initiated by the EPA, including estimated costs of compliance, see Factors Affecting Results, Liquidity and Capital Resources -- Environmental Matters in Item 7. For a discussion of matters related to certain solid waste and coal combustion product landfills, manufactured gas plant sites and air quality, see Note R -- Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.



Compliance with federal, state and local environmental protection requirements resulted in capital expenditures by Wisconsin Electric of approximately $120.3 million in2011compared with $215.5 million in2010. Expenditures incurred during2011and2010primarily included costs associated with the installation of pollution abatement facilities at Wisconsin Electric's power plants. These expenditures are expected to be approximately$71.0 millionduring2012, reflecting the addition of Nitrogen Oxide (NOx), Sulfur Dioxide (SO2) and other pollution control equipment needed to comply with various rules promulgated by the EPA. Operation, maintenance and depreciation expenses for fly ash removal equipment and other environmental protection systems were approximately $79.0 million and $76.2 million during2011and2010, respectively.



Coal Combustion Product Fills and Landfills



We currently have a program of beneficial utilization for substantially all of our coal combustion products, including fly ash, bottom ash and gypsum, which minimizes the need for disposal in specially-designed landfills. Some early designed and constructed coal combustion product landfills, which we used prior to developing this program, may allow the release of low levels of constituents resulting in the need for various levels of remediation. Where we have become aware of these conditions, efforts have been made to define the nature and extent of any release, and work has been performed to address these conditions. In addition, fill areas for coal ash were used prior to the introduction of landfill regulations. Sites currently undergoing review include the following:



Oak Creek Site Landfills:Groundwater impacts identified near the sites, located in the Village of Caledonia and the City of Oak Creek, Wisconsin, prompted Wisconsin Electric to begin investigation in 2009 for the source of impacts found in monitoring wells on the site and surrounding area. Preliminary results indicate that the groundwater impacts may be naturally occurring or are from other sources based on groundwater flow direction and increasing concentrations of elements deeper in the ground. The WDNR began sampling work in 2011 to identify the source of the impacts.



See Item 3 Legal Proceedings -- Environmental Matters for a discussion of the bluff collapse at our Oak Creek Power Plant.







OTHER





Research and Development:We had immaterial research and development expenditures in the last three years, primarily for improvement of service and abatement of air and water pollution by our electric utility operations. Research and development activities include work done by employees, consultants and contractors, plus sponsorship of research by industry associations.
