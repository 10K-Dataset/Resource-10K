UTILITY ENERGY SEGMENT



ELECTRIC UTILITY OPERATIONS

Our electric utility operations consist of the electric operations of Wisconsin Electric.  Wisconsin Electric, which is the largest electric utility in the state of Wisconsin, generates and distributes electric energy in a territory that includes southeastern (including the metropolitan Milwaukee area), east central and northern Wisconsin and the Upper Peninsula of Michigan.

Wisconsin Electric participates in the MISO Energy Markets.  The competitiveness of our generation offered in the MISO Energy Markets affects how our generating units are dispatched and how we buy and sell power.  For further information, see Factors Affecting Results, Liquidity and Capital Resources in Item 7.










Electric Sales

Our electric energy sales to all classes of customers totaled approximately 30.5 million MWh during 2010 and approximately 28.9 million MWh during 2009.  We had approximately 1,120,200 electric customers as of December 31, 2010 and 1,117,400 electric customers as of December 31, 2009.

Wisconsin Electric is authorized to provide retail electric service in designated territories in the state of Wisconsin, as established by indeterminate permits, Certificates of Public Convenience and Necessity (CPCNs) or boundary agreements with other utilities, and in certain territories in the state of Michigan pursuant to franchises granted by municipalities.  Wisconsin Electric also sells wholesale electric power within the MISO Energy Markets.

Electric Sales Growth:

Sales to Large Electric Retail Customers:

Our largest retail electric customers are two iron ore mines located in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan.  The combined electric energy sales to the two mines accounted for 6.9% and 5.3% of our total electric utility energy sales during 2010 and 2009, respectively.

Electric Supply

Our electric supply strategy is to provide our customers with a diverse fuel mix that is expected to maintain a stable, reliable and affordable supply of electricity.  We supply a significant amount of electricity to our customers from power plants that we own.  We supplement our internally generated power supply with long-term power purchase agreements, including the Point Beach Nuclear Power Plant (Point Beach) power purchase agreement discussed later in this report, and through spot purchases in the MISO Energy Markets.








Our installed capacity by fuel type as of December 31 is shown below:

Historically, the fuel costs for coal have been under long-term contracts, which helped with price stability.  Coal and associated transportation services have seen greater volatility in pricing than previously experienced in these markets due to changes in the domestic and world-wide demand for coal and the impacts of diesel costs which are incorporated into fuel surcharges on rail transportation.

Natural gas costs have been volatile.  We had a PSCW-approved hedging program to help manage our natural gas price risk, which expired on December 31, 2010.  We have requested PSCW approval to continue this hedging program.  This hedging program is generally implemented on a 36-month forward-looking basis.  Proceeds related to the natural gas hedging program are reflected in the average costs of natural gas and purchased power shown above.

Coal Deliveries:

Certain of our coal transportation contracts contain fuel cost adjustments that are tied to changes in a diesel fuel price index.  Currently, diesel fuel contracts are not actively traded; therefore, we are using financial heating oil contracts to mitigate risk.  We had a PSCW-approved hedging program that allowed us to hedge up to 75% of our potential fuel for electric generation in order to help manage our risk of higher delivered cost of coal.  This hedging program expired on December 31, 2010.  We have requested PSCW approval to continue this program.  The costs of this program are included in our fuel and purchased power costs.

Natural Gas-Fired Generation

Our natural gas-fired generation consists of four operating plants with a dependable capability of approximately 1,983 MW as of December 31, 2010.  We added PWGS 1 and PWGS 2, both natural gas-fired units with a dependable capability of 545 MW each, in July 2005 and May 2008, respectively.










We purchase natural gas for these plants on the spot market from gas marketers, utilities and producers and we arrange for transportation of the natural gas to our plants.  We have firm and interruptible transportation, balancing and storage agreements intended to support the plants' variable usage.

We had a PSCW-approved hedging program that allowed us to hedge up to 75% of our estimated gas usage for electric generation in order to help manage our natural gas price risk.  This hedging program expired on December 31, 2010.  We have requested PSCW approval to continue this program.  The costs of this program are included in our fuel and purchased power costs.

Oil-Fired Generation

Fuel oil is used for the combustion turbines at the Germantown Power Plant units 1-4, boiler ignition and flame stabilization at the Presque Isle Power Plant, and diesel engines at the Pleasant Prairie Power Plant and Valley Power Plant.  Our oil-fired generation had a dependable capability of approximately 257 MW as of December 31, 2010.  Our natural gas-fired peaking units have the ability to burn oil if natural gas is not available due to delivery constraints.  Fuel oil requirements are purchased under agreements with suppliers.

Power Purchase Commitments

We enter into short and long-term power purchase commitments to meet a portion of our anticipated electric energy supply needs.  The following table identifies our power purchase commitments as of December 31, 2010 with unaffiliated parties for the next five years:

YearMW UnderPower Purchase Commitments20111,59920121,44020131,26920141,26920151,269










Approximately 1,030 MW per year relates to the Point Beach long-term power purchase agreement.  Under this agreement, we pay a predetermined price per MWh for energy delivered according to a schedule included in the agreement.  The balance of these power purchase commitments are tolling arrangements whereby we are responsible for the procurement, delivery and the cost of natural gas fuel related to specific units identified in the contracts.

GAS UTILITY OPERATIONS

Our gas utility operations consist of Wisconsin Gas and the gas operations of Wisconsin Electric, both operating under the trade name of "We Energies."  We are authorized to provide retail gas distribution service in designated territories in the state of Wisconsin, as established by indeterminate permits, CPCNs, or boundary agreements with other utilities.  We also transport customer-owned gas.  We are the largest natural gas distribution utility in Wisconsin and we operate throughout the state, including the City of Milwaukee, west and south of the City of Milwaukee, the Appleton area and areas within Iron and Vilas Counties.










Gas Deliveries

Our gas utility business is highly seasonal due to the heating requirements of residential and commercial customers.  Annual gas sales are also impacted by the variability of winter temperatures.

Total gas therms delivered, including customer-owned transported gas, were approximately 2,105.1 million therms during 2010, a 3.6% decrease compared with 2009.  As of December 31, 2010, we were transporting gas for approximately 1,400 customers who purchased gas directly from other suppliers.  Transported gas accounted for approximately 43.5% of the total volumes delivered during 2010, 40.4% during 2009 and 39.8% during 2008.  We had approximately 1,064,500 and 1,060,200 gas customers as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.  Our peak daily send-out during 2010 was 1,514,789 Dth on January 28, 2010.

Sales to Large Gas Customers:

Gas Deliveries Growth:

Competition

Competition in varying degrees exists between natural gas and other forms of energy available to consumers.  A number of our large commercial and industrial customers are dual-fuel customers that are equipped to switch between natural gas and alternate fuels.  We are allowed to offer lower-priced gas sales and transportation services to dual-fuel customers.  Under gas transportation agreements, customers purchase gas directly from gas marketers and arrange with interstate pipelines and us to have the gas transported to their facilities.  We earn substantially the same margin (difference between revenue and cost of gas) whether we sell and transport gas to customers or only transport their gas.

Our ability to maintain our share of the industrial dual-fuel market depends on our success and the success of third-party gas marketers in obtaining long-term and short-term supplies of natural gas at competitive prices compared to other sources and in arranging or facilitating competitively-priced transportation service for those customers that desire to buy their own gas supplies.

Federal and state regulators continue to implement policies to bring more competition to the gas industry.  While the gas utility distribution function is expected to remain a highly regulated, monopoly function, the sale of the natural gas commodity and related services are expected to remain subject to competition from third parties.  It remains uncertain if and when the current economic disincentives for small customers to choose an alternative gas commodity supplier may be removed such that we begin to face competition for the sale of gas to our smaller firm customers.

Gas Supply, Pipeline Capacity and Storage

We have been able to meet our contractual obligations with both our suppliers and our customers despite periods of severe cold in recent heating seasons.

Pipeline Capacity and Storage:










Due to the daily and seasonal variations in gas usage in Wisconsin, we have also contracted for substantial underground storage capacity, primarily in Michigan.  Storage capacity, along with our gas purchase contracts, enables us to manage significant changes in daily demand and to optimize our overall gas supply and capacity costs.  We generally inject gas into storage during the spring and summer months when demand is lower and withdraw it in the winter months.  As a result, we can contract for less long-line pipeline capacity during periods of peak usage than would otherwise be necessary and can purchase gas on a more uniform daily basis from suppliers year-round.  Each of these capabilities enables us to reduce our overall costs.

We hold firm daily transportation and storage capacity entitlements from pipelines and other service providers under long-term contracts.

Term Gas Supply:

Secondary Market Transactions:

Spot Market Gas Supply:

Hedging Gas Supply Prices:



To the extent that opportunities develop and our physical supply operating plans will support them, we also have PSCW approval to utilize NYMEX based natural gas derivatives to capture favorable forward market price differentials.  That approval provides for 100% of the related proceeds to accrue to our GCRMs.

OTHER UTILITY OPERATIONS

Steam Utility Operations:

Annual sales of steam fluctuate from year to year based upon system growth and variations in weather conditions.  During 2010, the steam utility had $38.8 million of operating revenues from the sale of 2,740 million pounds of steam compared with $39.1 million of operating revenues from the sale of 2,932 million pounds of steam during 2009.  As of December 31, 2010 and 2009, steam was used by approximately 460 customers and 465 customers, respectively, for processing, space heating, domestic hot water and humidification.








UTILITY RATE MATTERS

See Factors Affecting Results, Liquidity and Capital Resources -- Utility Rates and Regulatory Matters in Item 7.



NON-UTILITY ENERGY SEGMENT

Our non-utility energy segment consists primarily of generating plants constructed as part of our PTF initiative.  As of December 31, 2010, our PTF assets represented virtually all of our non-utility energy segment assets.

We Power

We Power, through wholly owned subsidiaries, has designed and built approximately 2,320 MW of new generation in Wisconsin, which is being leased to Wisconsin Electric under long-term leases.  This new generation consists of approximately 1,230 MW of new capacity from OC 1 and OC 2, and 1,090 MW of capacity from PWGS 1 and PWGS 2.  PWGS 1 and PWGS 2 were placed in service in July 2005 and May 2008, respectively.  OC 1 was placed in service in February 2010 and OC 2 was placed in service on January 12, 2011.  In November 2005, two unaffiliated entities collectively purchased an ownership interest of approximately 17%, or 200 MW, in OC 1 and OC 2.  Similar to the generating capacity at PWGS 1 and PWGS 2, We Power owns the remaining 1,030 MW of generating capacity at OC 1 and OC 2.  For further information about our PTF strategy, see Factors Affecting Results, Liquidity and Capital Resources -- Power the Future in Item 7.

Wisvest LLC

Wisvest was originally formed to develop, own and operate electric generating facilities and to invest in other energy-related entities.  As a result of the change in corporate strategy to focus on our PTF strategy, Wisvest has discontinued its development activity.  As of December 31, 2010, Wisvest's sole operating asset and investment is Wisvest Thermal Energy Services, which provides chilled water services to the Milwaukee Regional Medical Center.

REGULATION

Wisconsin Energy Corporation

Wisconsin Energy is a holding company, but is exempt from the requirements of the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 2005 (PUHCA 2005).



Non-Utility Asset Cap:








Utility Energy Segment

Wisconsin Electric is a holding company by reason of its ownership interest in ATC, but is exempt from the requirements of PUHCA 2005.

Wisconsin Electric is subject to the Energy Policy Act and the corresponding regulations developed by certain federal agencies.  The Energy Policy Act, among other things, made electric utility industry consolidation more feasible, authorized FERC to review proposed mergers and the acquisition of generation facilities, changed the FERC regulatory scheme applicable to qualifying cogeneration facilities and modified certain other aspects of energy regulations and Federal tax policies applicable to Wisconsin Electric.  Additionally, the Energy Policy Act created an Electric Reliability Organization to be overseen by FERC, which established mandatory electric reliability standards and which has the authority to levy monetary sanctions for failure to comply with these standards.

Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Gas are subject to the regulation of the PSCW as to retail electric, gas and steam rates in the state of Wisconsin, standards of service, issuance of securities, construction of certain new facilities, transactions with affiliates, billing practices and various other matters.  Wisconsin Electric is subject to the regulation of the PSCW as to certain levels of short-term debt obligations.  Wisconsin Electric is subject to the regulation of the MPSC as to the various matters associated with retail electric service in the state of Michigan, except as to the issuance of securities in the ordinary course of business, construction of certain new facilities, levels of short-term debt obligations and advance approval of transactions with affiliates in the ordinary course of business.  Wisconsin Electric's hydroelectric facilities are regulated by FERC.  Wisconsin Electric is subject to the regulation of FERC with respect to wholesale power service, electric reliability requirements and accounting and with respect to our participation in the interstate natural gas pipeline capacity market.

The operations of Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Gas are also subject to regulations, where applicable, of the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources (WDNR), the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality and the Michigan Department of Natural Resources.

Public Benefits and Renewable Portfolio Standard

Wisconsin Act 141 establishes a goal that 10% of all electricity consumed in Wisconsin be generated by renewable resources by December 31, 2015.  Under this act, we must meet certain minimum requirements for renewable energy generation.  For the years 2010 through 2014, we must increase our percentage of total retail energy sales provided by renewable sources (renewable energy percentage) by at least two percentage points from our baseline renewable percentage of 2.27% to a level of 4.27%.  Act 141 defines "baseline renewable percentage" as the average of an energy provider's renewable energy percentage for 2001, 2002 and 2003.  As of December 31, 2010, our renewable energy percentage is at 4.27%.  Act 141 further requires that for the year 2015 and beyond, the renewable21energy percentage must increase at least six percentage points above the baseline to a level of 8.27%.  In addition, under this Act, 1.2% of utilities' annual operating revenues were required to be used to fund energy conservation programs through 2010.  The funding required by Act 141 increased to 1.5% of annual operating revenues in 2011 and is scheduled to increase to 1.9% in 2012.

Public Act 295 enacted in Michigan calls for the implementation of a renewable portfolio standard by 2015 and energy optimization (efficiency) targets up to 1% annually by 2015.  Public Act 295 specifically calls for current recovery of costs incurred to meet the standards and provides for ongoing review and revision to assure the measures taken are cost-effective.

For additional information on Act 141 and current renewable projects, see Factors Affecting Results, Liquidity and Capital Resources -- Utility Rates and Regulatory Matters - Renewables, Efficiency and Conservation and Utility Rates and Regulatory Matters - Renewable Energy Portfolio in Item 7.

Non-Utility Energy Segment

We Power was formed to design, construct, own and lease the new generating capacity in our PTF strategy.  We Power owns the interests in the companies constructing this new generating capacity (collectively, the We Power project companies).  These facilities are being leased on a long-term basis to Wisconsin Electric.  We Power has received determinations from FERC that upon the transfer of the facilities by lease to Wisconsin Electric, the We Power project companies will not be deemed public utilities under the Federal Power Act and thus will not be subject to FERC's jurisdiction.

Environmental permits necessary for operating the facilities are the responsibility of the operating entity, Wisconsin Electric.



ENVIRONMENTAL COMPLIANCE

Our operations are subject to extensive environmental regulations by state and federal environmental agencies governing air and water quality, hazardous and solid waste management, environmental remediation, and management of natural resources.  Costs associated with complying with these requirements are significant.  Additional future environmental statutes and regulations or revisions to existing laws, including for example, additional regulation of greenhouse gas emissions, coal combustion products, air emissions or wastewater discharges, could significantly increase these environmental compliance costs.

Expenditures for environmental compliance and remediation issues are included in anticipated capital expenditures described in Liquidity and Capital Resources in Item 7.  For discussion of additional environmental issues, see Environmental Matters in Item 3.  For further information concerning air and water quality standards and rulemaking initiated by the EPA, including estimated costs of compliance, see Factors Affecting Results, Liquidity and Capital Resources -- Environmental Matters in Item 7.  For a discussion of matters related to certain solid waste and coal combustion product landfills, manufactured gas plant sites and air quality, see Note R -- Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.

Compliance with federal, state and local environmental protection requirements resulted in capital expenditures by Wisconsin Electric of approximately $215.5 million in 2010 compared with $187.8 million in 2009.  Expenditures incurred during 2010 and 2009 primarily included costs associated with the installation of pollution abatement facilities at Wisconsin Electric's power plants.  These expenditures are expected to be approximately $158.6 million during 2011, reflecting Nitrogen Oxide (NOx), Sulfur Dioxide (SO2) and other pollution control equipment needed to comply with various rules promulgated by the EPA.  Operation, maintenance and depreciation expenses for fly ash removal equipment and other environmental protection systems were approximately $76.2 million and $66.7 million during 2010 and 2009, respectively.








Coal Combustion Product Landfills

We currently have a program of beneficial utilization for substantially all of our coal combustion products, including fly ash, bottom ash and gypsum, which minimizes the need for disposal in specially-designed landfills.  Some early designed and constructed coal combustion product landfills, which we used prior to developing this program, may allow the release of low levels of constituents resulting in the need for various levels of remediation.  Where we have become aware of these conditions, efforts have been made to define the nature and extent of any release, and work has been performed to address these conditions.  Sites currently undergoing remediation include the following:
