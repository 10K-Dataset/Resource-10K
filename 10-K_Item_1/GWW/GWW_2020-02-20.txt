Item 1: Business

The Company

W.W. Grainger, Inc., incorporated in the State of Illinois in 1928, is a broad line, business-to-business distributor of maintenance, repair and operating (MRO) products and services with operations primarily in North America, Japan and Europe. In this report, the words “Grainger” or “Company” mean W.W. Grainger, Inc. and its subsidiaries, except where the context makes it clear that the reference is only to W.W. Grainger, Inc. itself and not its subsidiaries.

Strategy

In the large and fragmented MRO industry, Grainger’s strategy is to relentlessly expand its leadership position (i.e., supply chain infrastructure, broad in-stock product offering and deep customer relationships) by being the go-to partner for customers who build and run safe, sustainable, and productive operations. To execute this strategy, the Company competes with two business models: high-touch solutions and endless assortment. Grainger’s high-touch solutions businesses serve customers with complex needs primarily in North America and Europe. The endless assortment businesses are focused on customers with less-complex needs and includes Zoro Tools, Inc. (Zoro) in the United States (U.S.) and MonotaRO Co., Ltd. (MonotaRO) in Japan. Competing with these two models allows Grainger to leverage its scale and advantaged supply chain to meet the changing needs of its customers. The following provides a high-level view of each model:














MRO Industry

The estimated market where Grainger has operations is large with an estimated size of more than $290 billion and is concentrated in North America, Japan and Europe. These large core markets have high gross domestic product per capita, advanced infrastructures and competition is highly fragmented. Grainger estimates to have 4% share within these markets with opportunity and a track record for growth.



Grainger’s two reportable segments are the U.S. and Canada, and are further described below.  Other businesses include the endless assortment businesses, Zoro and MonotaRO, and smaller international businesses primarily in Europe and Mexico. For further segment and financial information, see “Item 7: Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements (Financial Statements).
