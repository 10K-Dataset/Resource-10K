OVERVIEW

Citigroup’s history dates back to the founding of the City

Bank of New York in 1812.

Citigroup is a global diversified financial services holding company whose businesses provide consumers, corporations, governments and institutions with a broad, yet focused, range of financial products and services, including consumer banking and credit, corporate and investment banking, securities brokerage, trade and securities services and wealth management. Citi has approximately 200 million customer accounts and does business in more than 160 countries and jurisdictions.

At December 31,


, Citi had approximately 204,000 full-time employees, compared to approximately 209,000 full-time employees at December 31,

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION

AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

As described further throughout this Executive Summary, Citi made steady progress in 2018 toward improving its profitability and returns, despite a more challenging revenue environment, particularly in certain market-sensitive businesses and given macroeconomic uncertainties. During 2018, Citi reported 3% underlying revenue growth in

Global Consumer Banking (GCB)

and

Institutional Clients Group (ICG)

, excluding the impact of gains on sale in 2018 and 2017 (see “Citigroup” below). Citi had solid revenue growth across treasury and trade solutions, private bank, securities services, equity markets and corporate lending in

ICG

, partially offset by weakness in fixed income as well as softness in equity and debt underwriting. Citi reported revenue growth in all regions in

GCB

, reflecting continued loan and overall deposit growth, partially offset by the near-term impact of weak market sentiment on

Asia

wealth management revenues, as well as the impact from partnership renewal terms that went into effect in 2018 in Citi-branded cards in

North America GCB.

Citi demonstrated strong expense discipline, resulting in a 1% decrease in expenses, as well as positive operating leverage, even as Citi continued to make ongoing investments. Citi’s positive operating leverage, combined with continued credit discipline, resulted in an improvement in pretax earnings. Citi also generated continued loan and deposit growth during the year.

Moreover, Citi continued to return capital to its shareholders. In 2018, Citi returned $18.4 billion in the form of common stock repurchases and dividends. Citi repurchased over 200 million shares during the last year, resulting in an 8% reduction in outstanding common shares. While Citi made continued progress in returning capital to shareholders, each of Citi’s key regulatory capital metrics remained strong (see “Capital” below).

Going into 2019, while global economic growth has continued and the underlying macroeconomic environment remains largely positive, there continue to be various economic, political and other risks and uncertainties that could create a more volatile operating environment and impact Citi’s businesses and future results. For a more detailed discussion of the risks and uncertainties that could impact Citi’s businesses, results of operations and financial condition during 2019, see each respective business’s results of operations, “Risk Factors” and “Managing Global Risk” below. Despite these risks and uncertainties, Citi intends to continue to build on the progress made during 2018 with a focus on further optimizing its performance to benefit shareholders, while remaining flexible and adapting to market and economic conditions as they develop.

2018 Summary Results

Citigroup

Citigroup reported net income of $18.0 billion, or $6.68 per share, compared to a net loss of $6.8 billion, or $2.98 per share, in the prior year. Results in 2017 included a one-time,

non-cash charge of $22.6 billion, related to the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (Tax Reform), which impacted the tax line within

Corporate/Other

, as well as the tax lines in

North America GCB

and

ICG

. Results in 2018 included a one-time benefit of $94 million, due to the finalization of the provisional component of the impact based on Citi’s analysis as well as additional guidance received from the U.S. Treasury Department related to Tax Reform, which impacted the tax line within

Corporate/Other

(for additional information, see “Significant Accounting Policies and Estimates—Income Taxes” below)

.

Excluding the one-time impact of Tax Reform in both the current and prior year, Citigroup net income of $18.0 billion increased 14% compared to the prior year, reflecting a lower effective tax rate, higher revenues and lower expenses, partially offset by higher cost of credit. On this basis, earnings per share increased 25%, due to growth in net income and the 8% reduction in average shares outstanding, driven by the common stock repurchases. (Citi’s results of operations excluding the impact of Tax Reform are non-GAAP financial measures. Citi believes the presentation of its results of operations excluding the one-time impact of Tax Reform in both the current and prior year provides a meaningful depiction for investors of the underlying fundamentals of its businesses.)

Citigroup revenues of $72.9 billion in 2018 increased 1%, as 3% growth in

GCB

and 1% growth in

ICG

were largely offset by a 33% decrease in

Corporate/Other

, primarily due to the continued wind-down of legacy assets. Results in 2017 included a one-time gain (approximately $580 million) on the sale of a fixed income analytics business in

ICG

,

and results in 2018 included a one-time gain (approximately $250 million) on the sale of an asset management business in

Latin America GCB.

Excluding the gains on sale in both periods, aggregate revenues in

ICG

and

GCB

grew 3% from the prior year.

Citigroup’s end-of-period loans increased 3% to $684 billion versus the prior year. Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation into U.S. dollars for reporting purposes (FX translation), Citigroup’s end-of-period loans grew 4%, as 8% growth in

ICG

and 3% growth in

GCB

were partially offset by the continued wind-down of legacy assets in

Corporate/Other

. (Citi’s results of operations excluding the impact of gains on sales and FX translation are non-GAAP financial measures. Citi believes the presentation of its results of operations excluding the impact of gains on sales and FX translation provides a meaningful depiction for investors of the underlying fundamentals of its businesses.)

Citigroup’s end-of-period deposits increased 6% to $1.0 trillion versus the prior year. Excluding the impact of FX translation, Citigroup’s deposits were up 7%, primarily reflecting a 10% increase in

ICG

and a 1% increase in

GCB

.

Expenses

Citigroup operating expenses of $41.8 billion decreased 1% versus the prior year, as efficiency savings and the wind-down of legacy assets more than offset the impact of higher volume-


related expenses and ongoing investments. Operating expenses in both

ICG

and

GCB

were up 3%, while

Corporate/Other

operating expenses declined 40%, all versus the prior year.

Cost of Credit

Citi’s total provisions for credit losses and for benefits and claims of $7.6 billion increased 2% from the prior year, driven by higher net loan loss reserve builds and higher net credit losses. The net loan loss reserve build of $354 million compared to a net loan loss reserve build of $266 million in the prior year. The increase largely reflected a modest net loan loss reserve build in

ICG

,

compared to a net loan loss reserve release in the prior year, partially offset by lower net loan loss reserve builds in

North America GCB

.

Net credit losses of $7.1 billion increased 1% versus the prior year. Consumer net credit losses increased 4% to

$6.9 billion, largely reflecting volume growth and seasoning in the

North America

cards portfolios, partially offset by the continued wind-down of legacy assets in

Corporate/Other

. Corporate net credit losses decreased 55% to $169 million, primarily reflecting the impact of an episodic charge-off incurred in the prior year.

For additional information on Citi’s consumer and corporate credit costs and allowance for loan losses, see each respective business’s results of operations and “Credit Risk” below.

Capital

Citigroup’s Common Equity Tier 1 Capital and Tier 1 Capital ratios were 11.9% and 13.5% as of December 31, 2018, respectively, compared to 12.4% and 14.1% as of December 31, 2017, both based on the Basel III Standardized Approach for determining risk-weighted assets. The decline in regulatory capital largely reflected the return of capital to common shareholders, partially offset by earnings growth. Citigroup’s Supplementary Leverage ratio as of December 31, 2018 was 6.4%, compared to 6.7% as of December 31, 2017. For additional information on Citi’s capital ratios and related components, see “Capital Resources” below.

Global Consumer Banking

GCB

net income of $5.8 billion increased 49%. Excluding the one-time impact of Tax Reform in the prior year,

GCB

net income increased 25%, driven primarily by a lower effective tax rate and higher revenues, partially offset by higher expenses. Operating expenses were $18.6 billion, up 3%, as higher volume-related expenses and continued investments were partially offset by efficiency savings.

GCB

revenues of $33.8 billion increased 3% versus the prior year, driven by growth across all regions.

North America GCB

revenues increased 1% to $20.5 billion, driven by higher revenues across all businesses. Citi-branded cards revenues of $8.6 billion were up 1% versus the prior year, as growth in interest-earning balances was largely offset by the previously disclosed impact of partnership renewal terms. Citi retail services revenues of $6.6 billion increased 3% versus the prior year, primarily reflecting organic loan growth and the benefit of the L.L.Bean portfolio acquisition, partially offset by higher partner payments. Retail banking revenues increased 1% from

the prior year to $5.3 billion. Excluding mortgage revenues, retail banking revenues of $4.8 billion were up 6% from the prior year, driven by continued growth in deposit margins, partially offset by lower deposit volumes.

North America GCB

average deposits of $180 billion decreased a net 2% year-over-year, primarily driven by a reduction in money market balances, as clients transferred money to investments.

North America GCB

average retail loans of $56 billion grew 1% from the prior year. Assets under management of $60 billion were largely unchanged from the prior year, as 5% underlying growth was offset by the impact of market movements, due to the equity market sell-off at the end of 2018. Average Citi-branded card loans of $88 billion increased 4%, while Citi-branded card purchase sales of $344 billion increased 8% versus the prior year. Average Citi retail services loans of $48 billion increased 6% versus the prior year, while Citi retail services purchase sales of $87 billion were up 7%.

.

Excluding the gain on sale,

Latin America GCB

revenues increased 8%,

driven by growth in loans and deposits as well as improved deposit spreads.

Asia GCB

revenues increased 2% versus the prior year, as continued growth in deposit, cards and insurance revenues was largely offset by lower investment revenues due to weak market sentiment. For additional information on the results of operations of

Institutional Clients Group

ICG

net income of $12.2 billion

increased 35%. Excluding the one-time impact of Tax Reform in the prior year,

ICG

net income increased 11%, driven by a lower effective tax rate and higher revenues, partially offset by higher operating expenses and higher cost of credit.

ICG

operating expenses increased 3% to $21.0 billion, as higher compensation costs, volume-related expenses and continued investments were partially offset by efficiency savings.

ICG

including the impact of the gain on sale in the prior year. Excluding the gain on sale in the prior year, revenues increased 3%, primarily driven by a 6% increase in

Banking


revenues, as

Markets and securities services

revenues were largely unchanged versus the prior year. The increase in

Banking

revenues included the impact of $45 million of gains on loan hedges within corporate lending, compared to losses of $133 million in the prior year.

Banking

revenues of $19.9 billion (excluding the impact of gains (losses) on loan hedges within corporate lending) increased 5%, driven by solid growth in treasury and trade solutions, private bank and corporate lending, partially offset by lower revenues in investment banking. Investment banking revenues of $5.0 billion decreased 7% versus the prior year, as growth in advisory was more than offset by a decline in both debt and equity underwriting, largely reflecting lower market activity. Advisory revenues increased 16% to $1.3 billion, equity underwriting revenues decreased 12% to $991 million and debt underwriting revenues decreased 13% to $2.7 billion, all versus the prior year.

Treasury and trade solutions revenues of $9.3 billion increased 8% versus the prior year, reflecting volume growth and improved deposit spreads, with solid growth across net interest and fee income. Private bank revenues increased 9% to $3.4 billion from the prior year, driven by growth in investments, as well as improved deposit spreads. Corporate lending revenues increased 26% to $2.3 billion. Excluding the impact of gains (losses) on loan hedges, corporate lending revenues increased 15% versus the prior year, primarily driven by loan growth and lower hedging costs.

Markets and securities services

revenues of $17.0 billion decreased 3% from the prior year. Excluding the gain on sale in the prior year,

Markets and securities services

revenues were largely unchanged from the prior year, as a decline in fixed income markets revenues was offset by an increase in both equity markets and securities services revenues. Fixed income markets revenues of $11.6 billion decreased 6% from the prior year, driven by lower revenues in both rates and currencies and spread products, reflecting the more challenging environment. Equity markets revenues of $3.4 billion increased 19% from the prior year (14% excluding an episodic loss in derivatives in the prior year), driven by growth in derivatives and prime finance as well as higher investor client revenue, partially offset by a modest decline in cash equities. Securities services revenues of $2.6 billion increased 11%, driven by growth in client volumes and higher interest revenue. For additional information on the results of operations of

ICG

net income was $107 million in 2018, compared to a net loss of $19.7 billion in the prior year. Excluding the one-time impact of Tax Reform in both periods,

Corporate/Other

net income declined 92% to $13 million, largely reflecting lower revenues, partially offset by lower operating expenses and lower cost of credit. Operating expenses of $2.3 billion declined 40% from the prior year, largely reflecting the wind-down of legacy assets, lower infrastructure costs and lower legal expenses.

Corporate/Other

vs.


Net income

increased 68%, largely reflecting the impact of the $750 million one-time, non-cash charge recorded in the tax line due to the impact of Tax Reform in 2017 (for additional information, see “Significant Accounting Policies and Significant Estimates—Income Taxes” below). Excluding the one-time impact of Tax Reform, net income increased 22%, driven primarily by a lower effective tax rate due to Tax Reform, higher revenues and lower cost of credit, partially offset by higher expenses.

Revenues

increased 1%, driven by higher revenues across all businesses.

Retail banking revenues increased 1%. Excluding mortgage revenues (decline of 27%), retail banking revenues were up 6%, driven by continued growth in deposit margins, partially offset by lower deposit volumes. Average deposits decreased 2% year-over-year, primarily driven by a reduction in money market balances, as clients transferred money to investments. Assets under management were largely unchanged from the prior year as 5% underlying growth was offset by the impact of market movements, due to the equity market sell-off at the end of 2018. The decline in mortgage revenues was driven by lower origination activity and higher cost of funds, reflecting the higher interest rate environment.

Cards revenues increased 1%. In Citi-branded cards, revenues increased 1%, as growth in interest-earning balances, driven by maturity of recent vintages and strength in loan balance retention, was largely offset by the impact of previously disclosed partnership terms that went into effect in 2018. Citi sold its Hilton portfolio in the first quarter of 2018, which resulted in a gain of approximately $150 million. This gain was offset by the loss of operating revenue in the portfolio in 2018. Average loans increased 4% and purchase sales increased 8%.

Citi retail services revenues increased 3%, primarily reflecting organic loan growth and the benefit of the L.L.Bean portfolio acquisition in June 2018, partially offset by higher partner payments. Average loans increased 6% and purchase sales increased 7%.

Expenses

increased 4%, as volume growth and ongoing investments were partially offset by efficiency savings.

Provisions

decreased 3% from the prior year, driven by a lower net loan loss reserve build, partially offset by higher net credit losses. The net loan loss reserve build was $438 million in 2018, primarily reflecting volume growth and seasoning in both cards portfolios. This compares to a build of $873 million in the prior year, which included $300 million related to an increase in net flow rates in later delinquency buckets in Citi retail services and a slight increase in delinquencies for the Citi-branded cards portfolio.

Net credit losses increased 6% to $5.1 billion, driven by higher net credit losses in both Citi-branded cards (up 6% to $2.6 billion) and Citi retail services (up 9% to $2.4 billion). The increase in the cards net credit losses primarily reflected volume growth and seasoning in both portfolios.

For additional information on

North America GCB

’s retail banking, including commercial banking, and its Citi-branded cards and Citi retail services portfolios, see “Credit Risk—Consumer Credit” below.

As part of its Citi retail services business, Citi issues co-brand and private label credit card products with Sears. As previously disclosed, in October 2018, Sears filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection and in connection with the filing Sears has closed, or announced plans to close, additional stores. On February 11, 2019, after bankruptcy court approval, ESL Investments, Inc. purchased substantially all of Sears’ assets on a going concern basis, including its credit card program agreement with Citi. The impact to Citi retail services, from reduced new account acquisitions or lower purchase sales, will depend in part on the magnitude and timing of additional Sears store closures and continued customer attrition. Citi does not currently expect that the sale of Sears to ESL will have an immediate or ongoing material impact on Citi’s consolidated results. For additional information on the potential impact from a deterioration in or failure to maintain Citi’s co-branding and private label credit card relationships, see “Risk Factors—Strategic Risks” below.


vs.


Net income

decreased 39% largely due to the one-time impact of Tax Reform. Excluding the one-time impact of Tax Reform, net income decreased 15%, due to higher cost of credit and higher expenses, partially offset by higher revenues.

Revenues

increased 3%, driven by higher revenues across all businesses.

Retail banking revenues increased 1%. Excluding mortgage revenues (down 32%), retail banking revenues were up 9%, driven by growth in checking deposits, loans (average loans up 3%) and assets under management (up 14%) and increased commercial banking activity, as well as a benefit from higher interest rates.

Cards revenues increased 3%. In Citi-branded cards, revenues increased 5%, primarily reflecting the acquisition of the Costco portfolio, as well as modest growth in interest-earning balances, partially offset by the continued run-off of non-core portfolios and the higher cost to fund growth in transactor and promotional balances.

Citi retail services revenues increased 1%, as loan growth was partially offset by the impact of the renewal and extension of certain partnerships within the portfolio, as well as the absence of gains on sales of two cards portfolios in 2016.

Expenses

increased 2%, driven by the addition of the Costco portfolio, higher volume-related expenses and investments as well as remediation costs related to a CARD Act matter, partially offset by efficiency savings.

Provisions

increased 24%, driven by higher net credit losses and a higher net loan loss reserve build.

Net credit losses increased 22%, largely driven by higher net credit losses in both cards portfolios, primarily reflecting volume growth and seasoning, as well as the impact of acquiring the Costco portfolio.

The net loan loss reserve build was $873 million, compared to a build of $659 million in the prior year, driven by volume growth and seasoning in both cards portfolios, as well as the increase in net flow rates in later delinquency buckets, primarily in Citi retail services.


LATIN AMERICA GCB

Latin America GCB

provides traditional retail banking, including commercial banking, and its Citi-branded card products to retail customers and small to mid-size businesses in Mexico through Citibanamex, one of Mexico’s largest banks.

At December 31,


,

Latin America GCB

had 1,463 retail branches in Mexico, with approximately 29.4 million retail banking customer accounts, $19.7 billion in retail banking loans and $27.7 billion in deposits. In addition, the business had approximately 5.6 million Citi-branded card accounts with $5.7 billion in outstanding loan balances.

The discussion of the results of operations for Latin America GCB below excludes the impact of FX translation for all periods presented. Presentations of the results of operations, excluding the impact of FX translation, are non-GAAP financial measures. For a reconciliation of certain of these metrics to the reported results, see the table above.


vs.


Net income

increased 58% to $928 million, reflecting higher revenues and a lower effective tax rate as a result of Tax Reform, partially offset by higher expenses and cost of credit.

Revenues

increased 13%, including the gain on sale of an asset management business (approximately $250 million). Excluding the gain on sale, revenues

were up 8%, driven by increases in both retail banking and cards.

Retail banking revenues increased 14%. Excluding the gain on sale, retail banking revenues increased 7%, driven by continued growth across commercial loans and deposits, as well as improved deposit spreads due to higher interest rates. Average loans grew 3%, and average deposits grew 6%, while assets under management declined 5%, primarily driven by market performance during the second half of 2018. Cards revenues increased 9%, due to continued volume growth, reflecting higher purchase sales (up 11%) and full-rate revolving loans. Average cards loans grew 6%.

Expenses

increased 8%, driven by volume growth, ongoing investment spending and higher repositioning charges, partially offset by efficiency savings.

INSTITUTIONAL CLIENTS GROUP

Institutional Clients Group (ICG)

includes

Banking

and

Markets and securities services

(for additional information on these businesses, see “Citigroup Segments” above).

ICG

provides corporate, institutional, public sector and high-net-worth clients around the world with a full range of wholesale banking products and services, including fixed income and equity sales and trading, foreign exchange, prime brokerage, derivative services, equity and fixed income research, corporate lending, investment banking and advisory services, private banking, cash management, trade finance and securities services.

ICG

transacts with clients in both cash instruments and derivatives, including fixed income, foreign currency, equity and commodity products.

ICG

revenue is generated primarily from fees and spreads associated with these activities.

ICG

earns fee income for assisting clients with transactional services and clearing and providing brokerage and investment banking services and other such activities. Such fees are recognized at the point in time when Citigroup’s performance under the terms of a contractual arrangement is completed, which is typically at the trade/execution date or closing of a transaction. Revenue generated from these activities is recorded in

Commissions and fees

and

Investment banking

. Revenue is also generated from assets under custody and administration, which is recognized as/when the associated promised service is satisfied, which normally occurs at the point in time the service is requested by the customer and provided by Citi. Revenue generated from these activities is primarily recorded in

Administration and other fiduciary fees

. For additional information on these various types of revenues, see Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

In addition, as a market maker,

ICG

facilitates transactions, including holding product inventory to meet client demand, and earns the differential between the price at which it buys and sells the products. These price differentials and the unrealized gains and losses on the inventory are recorded in

Principal transactions

(for additional information on

Principal transactions

revenue, see Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements).

Other

primarily includes mark-to-market gains and losses on certain credit derivatives, realized gains and losses on available-for-sale (AFS) debt securities, gains and losses on equity securities not held in trading accounts and other non-recurring gains and losses. Interest income earned on assets held, less interest paid on long- and short-term debt and to customers on deposits, is recorded as

Net interest revenue

.

The amount and types of

Markets

revenues are impacted by a variety of interrelated factors, including market liquidity; changes in market variables such as interest rates, foreign exchange rates, equity prices, commodity prices and credit spreads, as well as their implied volatilities; investor confidence and other macroeconomic conditions. Assuming all other market conditions do not change, increases in client activity levels or bid/offer spreads generally result in increases in revenues. However, changes in market conditions can significantly impact client activity levels, bid/offer spreads and the fair value of product inventory. For example, a decrease in

market liquidity may increase bid/offer spreads, decrease client activity levels and widen credit spreads on product inventory positions.

ICG

’s management of the

Markets

businesses involves daily monitoring and evaluation of the above factors at the trading desk as well as the country level.

ICG

does not separately track the impact on total

Markets

revenues of the volume of transactions, bid/offer spreads, fair value changes of product inventory positions and economic hedges because, as noted above, these components are interrelated and are not deemed useful or necessary individually to manage the

level.

In the

Markets

businesses, client revenues are those revenues directly attributable to client transactions at the time of inception, including commissions, interest or fees earned. Client revenues do not include the results of client facilitation activities (e.g., holding product inventory in anticipation of client demand) or the results of certain economic hedging activities.

Revenue Details—Excluding Gains (Losses) on Loan Hedges

(1)

Credit derivatives are used to economically hedge a portion of the corporate loan portfolio that includes both accrual loans and loans at fair value. Gains (losses) on loan hedges includes the mark-to-market on the credit derivatives and the mark-to-market on the loans in the portfolio that are at fair value. The fixed premium costs of these hedges are netted against the corporate lending revenues to reflect the cost of credit protection. Citigroup’s results of operations excluding the impact of gains (losses) on loan hedges are non-GAAP financial measures.

OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS

Citigroup enters into various types of off-balance sheet arrangements in the ordinary course of business. Citi’s involvement in these arrangements can take many different forms, including without limitation:

•

purchasing or retaining residual and other interests in unconsolidated special purpose entities, such as mortgage-backed and other asset-backed securitization entities;

•

holding senior and subordinated debt, interests in limited and general partnerships and equity interests in other unconsolidated special purpose entities;

•

providing guarantees, indemnifications, loan commitments, letters of credit and representations and warranties; and

•

entering into operating leases for property and equipment.

Citi enters into these arrangements for a variety of business purposes. For example, securitization arrangements offer investors access to specific cash flows and risks created through the securitization process. Securitization arrangements also assist Citi and its customers in monetizing their financial assets and securing financing at more favorable rates than Citi or the customers could otherwise obtain.

The table below shows where a discussion of Citi’s various off-balance sheet arrangements may be found in this Form 10-K. In addition, see Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

CAPITAL RESOURCES

Overview

Capital is used principally to support assets in Citi’s businesses and to absorb credit, market and operational losses. Citi primarily generates capital through earnings from its operating businesses. Citi may augment its capital through issuances of common stock, noncumulative perpetual preferred stock and equity issued through awards under employee benefit plans, among other issuances. Further, Citi’s capital levels may also be affected by changes in accounting and regulatory standards, as well as U.S. corporate tax laws and the impact of future events on Citi’s business results, such as changes in interest and foreign exchange rates, as well as business and asset dispositions.

During 2018, Citi returned a total of $18.4 billion of capital to common shareholders in the form of share repurchases (approximately 212 million common shares) and dividends.

Capital Management

Citi’s capital management framework is designed to ensure that Citigroup and its principal subsidiaries maintain sufficient capital consistent with each entity’s respective risk profile, management targets and all applicable regulatory standards and guidelines. Citi assesses its capital adequacy against a series of internal quantitative capital goals, designed to evaluate its capital levels in expected and stressed economic environments. Underlying these internal quantitative capital goals are strategic capital considerations, centered on preserving and building financial strength. The Citigroup Capital Committee, with oversight from the Risk Management Committee of Citigroup’s Board of Directors, has responsibility for Citi’s aggregate capital structure, including the capital assessment and planning process, which is integrated into Citi’s capital plan. Balance sheet management, including oversight of capital adequacy, for Citigroup’s subsidiaries is governed by each entity’s Asset and Liability Committee, where applicable.

Based on Citigroup’s current regulatory capital requirements, as well as consideration of potential future changes to the U.S. Basel III rules, management currently believes that a targeted Common Equity Tier 1 Capital ratio of approximately 11.5% represents the amount necessary to prudently operate and invest in Citi’s franchise, including when considering future growth plans, capital return projections and other factors that may impact Citi’s businesses. However, management may revise Citigroup’s targeted Common Equity Tier 1 Capital ratio in response to changing regulatory capital requirements as well as other relevant factors.

For additional information regarding Citi’s capital planning and stress testing exercises, see “Stress Testing Component of Capital Planning” below.

Current Regulatory Capital Standards

Citi is subject to regulatory capital standards issued by the Federal Reserve Board, which constitute the U.S. Basel III rules. These rules establish an integrated capital adequacy framework, encompassing both risk-based capital ratios and leverage ratios.

Risk-Based Capital Ratios

The U.S. Basel III rules set forth the composition of regulatory capital (including the application of regulatory capital adjustments and deductions), as well as two comprehensive methodologies (a Standardized Approach and Advanced Approaches) for measuring total risk-weighted assets. Total risk-weighted assets under the Advanced Approaches, which are primarily models based, include credit, market, and operational risk-weighted assets. The Standardized Approach generally applies prescribed supervisory risk weights to broad categories of credit risk exposures. As a result, credit risk-weighted assets calculated under the Advanced Approaches are more risk sensitive than those calculated under the Standardized Approach. Market risk-weighted assets are currently calculated on a generally consistent basis under both approaches. The Standardized Approach excludes operational risk-weighted assets.

The U.S. Basel III rules establish stated minimum Common Equity Tier 1 Capital, Tier 1 Capital and Total Capital ratios for substantially all U.S. banking organizations, including Citi and Citibank, N.A. (Citibank). Moreover, these rules provide for both a fixed 2.5% Capital Conservation Buffer and, for Advanced Approaches banking organizations, such as Citi and Citibank, a discretionary Countercyclical Capital Buffer. These capital buffers would be available to absorb losses in advance of any potential impairment of regulatory capital below the stated minimum risk-based capital ratio requirements. Any breach of the buffers to absorb losses during periods of financial or economic stress would result in restrictions on earnings distributions (e.g., dividends, equity repurchases, and discretionary executive bonuses), with the degree of such restrictions based upon the extent to which the buffers are breached. The Federal Reserve Board last voted to affirm the Countercyclical Capital Buffer amount at the current level of 0% in December 2017.

Further, the U.S. Basel III rules implement the “capital floor provision” of the so-called “Collins Amendment” of the Dodd-Frank Act, which requires Advanced Approaches

banking organizations to calculate each of the three risk-based capital ratios (Common Equity Tier 1 Capital, Tier 1 Capital, and Total Capital) under both the U.S. Basel III Standardized Approach and the Advanced Approaches and comply with the lower of each of the resulting risk-based capital ratios.


GSIB Surcharge

The Federal Reserve Board imposes a risk-based capital surcharge upon U.S. bank holding companies that are identified as global systemically important bank holding companies (GSIBs), including Citi. The GSIB surcharge augments the Capital Conservation Buffer and, if invoked, any Countercyclical Capital Buffer.

Under the Federal Reserve Board’s rule, identification of a GSIB is based on the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision’s (Basel Committee) GSIB methodology, which primarily looks to five equally weighted broad categories of systemic importance: (i) size, (ii) interconnectedness, (iii) cross-jurisdictional activity, (iv) substitutability and (v) complexity. With the exception of size, each of the other categories is composed of multiple indicators, also of equal weight, and amounting to 12 indicators in total.

A U.S. bank holding company that is designated a GSIB is required, on an annual basis, to calculate a surcharge using two methods and is subject to the higher of the resulting two surcharges. The first method (“method 1”) is based on the Basel Committee’s GSIB methodology described above. Under the second method (“method 2”), the substitutability category is replaced with a quantitative measure intended to assess a GSIB’s reliance on short-term wholesale funding. In addition, method 1 incorporates relative measures of systemic importance across certain global banking organizations and a year-end spot foreign exchange rate, whereas method 2 uses fixed measures of systemic importance and application of an average foreign exchange rate over a three-year period. The GSIB surcharges calculated under both method 1 and method 2 are based on measures of systemic importance from the year immediately preceding that in which the GSIB surcharge calculations are being performed (e.g., the method 1 and method 2 GSIB surcharges to be calculated by December 31, 2019 will be based on 2018 systemic indicator data). Generally, Citi’s surcharge determined under method 2 will result in a higher surcharge than its surcharge determined under method 1.

Should a GSIB’s systemic importance change year-over-year such that it becomes subject to a higher surcharge, the higher surcharge would not become effective for a full year (e.g., a higher surcharge calculated by December 31, 2019 would not become effective until January 1, 2021). However, if a GSIB’s systemic importance changes such that the GSIB would be subject to a lower surcharge, the GSIB would be subject to the lower surcharge beginning with the next calendar year (e.g., a lower surcharge calculated by December 31, 2019 would become effective January 1, 2020).

The following table sets forth Citi’s GSIB surcharge as determined under method 1 and method 2 for


and


:

Citi’s GSIB surcharge effective for both


and


was 3.0%, as derived under the higher method 2 result. Citi’s GSIB surcharge effective for 2019 will remain unchanged at 3.0%, as derived under the higher method 2 result. Citi expects that its method 2 GSIB surcharge will continue to remain higher than its method 1 GSIB surcharge and, as such, Citi’s GSIB surcharge effective for 2020 will not exceed 3.0%, and Citi’s GSIB surcharge effective for 2021 is not expected to exceed 3.0%.

Transition Provisions

Generally, the U.S. Basel III rules contain several differing, largely multi-year transition provisions, with various “phase-ins” and “phase-outs.” Moreover, the GSIB surcharge, Capital Conservation Buffer, and any Countercyclical Capital Buffer (currently 0%) commenced phase-in on January 1, 2016, becoming fully effective on January 1, 2019. However, with the exception of the non-grandfathered trust preferred securities, which do not fully phase-out of Tier 2 Capital until January 1, 2022, and the capital buffers and GSIB surcharge, which do not fully phase-in until January 1, 2019, all other transition provisions have occurred and were entirely reflected in Citi’s regulatory capital ratios beginning January 1, 2018. Accordingly, commencing with 2018, Citi is presenting a single set of regulatory capital components and ratios, reflecting current regulatory capital standards in effect throughout 2018. Citi previously disclosed its Basel III risk-based capital and leverage ratios and related components reflecting Basel III transition arrangements with respect to regulatory capital adjustments and deductions, as well as full implementation, in Citi’s 2017 Annual Report on Form 10-K; however, beginning January 1, 2018, that distinction is no longer relevant.

The following chart sets forth the transitional progression from January 1, 2017 to full implementation by January 1, 2019 of the regulatory capital components comprising the effective minimum risk-based capital ratios.


Basel III Transition Arrangements: Minimum Risk-Based Capital Ratios

For additional information regarding the transition arrangements under the U.S. Basel III rules, including Citigroup’s and Citibank’s capital resources reflecting Basel III transition arrangements as of December 31, 2017, see “Capital Resources—Current Regulatory Capital Standards” in Citigroup’s 2017 Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Tier 1 Leverage Ratio

Under the U.S. Basel III rules, Citi is also required to maintain a minimum Tier 1 Leverage ratio of 4.0%. The Tier 1 Leverage ratio, a non-risk-based measure of capital adequacy, is defined as Tier 1 Capital as a percentage of quarterly adjusted average total assets less amounts deducted from Tier 1 Capital.

Supplementary Leverage Ratio

Citi is also required to calculate a Supplementary Leverage ratio, which differs from the Tier 1 Leverage ratio by also including certain off-balance sheet exposures within the denominator of the ratio (Total Leverage Exposure). The Supplementary Leverage ratio represents end of period Tier 1 Capital to Total Leverage Exposure, with the latter defined as the sum of the daily average of on-balance sheet assets for the quarter and the average of certain off-balance sheet exposures calculated as of the last day of each month in the quarter, less applicable Tier 1 Capital deductions. Effective January 1,

2018, Advanced Approaches banking organizations are required to maintain a stated minimum Supplementary Leverage ratio of 3.0%.

Further, U.S. GSIBs, including Citi, are subject to enhanced Supplementary Leverage ratio standards. The enhanced Supplementary Leverage ratio standards establish a 2.0% leverage buffer in addition to the stated 3.0% minimum Supplementary Leverage ratio requirement, for a total effective minimum Supplementary Leverage ratio requirement of 5.0%. Effective January 1, 2018, if a U.S. GSIB fails to exceed the 2.0% buffer, it will be subject to increasingly onerous restrictions (depending upon the extent of the shortfall) regarding capital distributions and discretionary executive bonus payments.


Prompt Corrective Action Framework

In general, the Prompt Corrective Action (PCA) regulations direct the U.S. banking agencies to enforce increasingly strict limitations on the activities of insured depository institutions that fail to meet certain regulatory capital thresholds. The PCA framework contains five categories of capital adequacy as measured by risk-based capital and leverage ratios: (i) “well capitalized,” (ii) “adequately capitalized,” (iii) undercapitalized,” (iv) “significantly undercapitalized,” and (v) “critically undercapitalized.”

Accordingly, an insured depository institution, such as Citibank, must maintain minimum Common Equity Tier 1 Capital, Tier 1 Capital, Total Capital, and Tier 1 Leverage ratios of 6.5%, 8.0%, 10.0% and 5.0%, respectively, to be considered “well capitalized.” Additionally, insured depository institution subsidiaries of U.S. GSIBs, including Citibank, must maintain a minimum Supplementary Leverage ratio of 6.0%, effective January 1, 2018, to be considered “well capitalized.”

Stress Testing Component of Capital Planning

Citi is subject to an annual assessment by the Federal Reserve Board as to whether Citigroup has effective capital planning processes as well as sufficient regulatory capital to absorb losses during stressful economic and financial conditions, while also meeting obligations to creditors and counterparties and continuing to serve as a credit intermediary. This annual assessment includes two related programs:

•

The Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) evaluates Citi’s capital adequacy, capital adequacy process, and its planned capital distributions, such as dividend payments and common stock repurchases. As part of CCAR, the Federal Reserve Board assesses whether Citi has sufficient capital to continue operations throughout times of economic and financial market stress and whether Citi has robust, forward-looking capital planning processes that account for its unique risks. The Federal Reserve Board may object to Citi’s annual capital plan based on either quantitative or qualitative grounds. If the Federal Reserve Board objects to Citi’s annual capital plan, Citi may not undertake any capital distribution unless the Federal Reserve Board indicates in writing that it does not object to the distribution.

•

Dodd-Frank Act Stress Testing (DFAST) is a forward-looking quantitative evaluation of the impact of stressful economic and financial market conditions on Citi’s regulatory capital. This program serves to inform the Federal Reserve Board and the general public as to how Citi’s regulatory capital ratios might change using a hypothetical set of adverse economic conditions as designed by the Federal Reserve Board. In addition to the annual supervisory stress test conducted by the Federal Reserve Board, Citi is required to conduct annual company-run stress tests under the same adverse economic conditions designed by the Federal Reserve Board, as well as conduct a mid-cycle stress test under company-developed scenarios.

Both CCAR and DFAST include an estimate of projected revenues, losses, reserves, pro forma regulatory capital ratios, and any other additional capital measures deemed relevant by Citi. Projections are required over a nine-quarter planning horizon under three supervisory scenarios (baseline, adverse and severely adverse conditions). All risk-based capital ratios reflect application of the Standardized Approach framework under the U.S. Basel III rules. Moreover, the Federal Reserve Board has deferred the use of the Advanced Approaches framework indefinitely.

For additional information regarding CCAR, see “Risk Factors—Strategic Risks” below. For additional information on potential changes to the stress testing component of capital planning and assessment process applicable to Citi, see “Regulatory Capital Standards Developments” below.

In addition, Citibank is required to conduct the annual Dodd-Frank Act Stress Test. The annual stress test consists of a forward-looking quantitative evaluation of the impact of stressful economic and financial market conditions under

several scenarios on Citibank’s regulatory capital. This program serves to inform the Office of the Comptroller of

the Currency as to how Citibank’s regulatory capital ratios might change during a hypothetical set of adverse economic

conditions and to ultimately evaluate the reliability of Citibank’s capital planning process.

Citigroup’s Capital Resources

Citi is required to maintain stated minimum Common Equity Tier 1 Capital, Tier 1 Capital and Total Capital ratios of 4.5%, 6.0% and 8.0%, respectively.

Citi’s effective minimum Common Equity Tier 1 Capital, Tier 1 Capital and Total Capital ratios during 2018, inclusive of the 75% phase-in of both the 2.5% Capital Conservation Buffer and the 3.0% GSIB surcharge (all of which is to be composed of Common Equity Tier 1 Capital), are 8.625%, 10.125% and 12.125%, respectively. Citi’s effective minimum Common Equity Tier 1 Capital, Tier 1 Capital and Total Capital ratios during 2017, inclusive of the 50% phase-in of both the 2.5% Capital Conservation Buffer and the 3.0% GSIB surcharge (all of which is to be composed of Common Equity Tier 1 Capital), were 7.25%, 8.75% and 10.75%, respectively.

Citi’s effective minimum Common Equity Tier 1 Capital, Tier 1 Capital and Total Capital ratio requirements during 2019, inclusive of the 2.5% Capital Conservation Buffer and the Countercyclical Capital Buffer at its current level of 0%, as well as a 3.0% GSIB surcharge, will be 10.0%, 11.5% and 13.5%, respectively.

Furthermore, to be “well capitalized” under current federal bank regulatory agency definitions, a bank holding company must have a Tier 1 Capital ratio of at least 6.0%, a Total Capital ratio of at least 10.0%, and not be subject to a Federal Reserve Board directive to maintain higher capital levels.

Under the U.S. Basel III rules, Citi must comply with a 4.0% minimum Tier 1 Leverage ratio requirement. Effective January 1, 2018, Citi must also comply with an effective 5.0% minimum Supplementary Leverage ratio requirement.


The following tables set forth the capital tiers, total risk-weighted assets and underlying risk components, risk-based capital ratios, quarterly adjusted average total assets, Total Leverage Exposure and leverage ratios for Citi as of December 31,


and


.

Citigroup Capital Components and Ratios

(1)

As of December 31,


and 2017, Citi’s reportable Common Equity Tier 1 Capital and Tier 1 Capital ratios were the lower derived under the Basel III Standardized Approach, whereas the reportable Total Capital ratio was the lower derived under the Basel III Advanced Approaches framework.

(2)

Citi’s risk-based capital and leverage ratios and related components as of December 31, 2017 are non-GAAP financial measures, which reflect full implementation of regulatory capital adjustments and deductions prior to the effective date of January 1, 2018. Citi believes these ratios and the related components provide useful information to investors and others by measuring Citi’s progress in prior periods against currently effective regulatory capital standards.

(3)

Tier 1 Leverage ratio denominator.

(4)

Supplementary Leverage ratio denominator.

Common Equity Tier 1 Capital Ratio

Citi’s Common Equity Tier 1 Capital ratio was 11.9% at December 31, 2018, compared to 11.7% at September 30, 2018 and 12.4% at December 31, 2017. The quarter-over-quarter increase was primarily due to net income of $4.3 billion as well as decreases in risk-weighted assets, partially offset by the return of $5.8 billion of capital to common shareholders. Citi’s Common Equity Tier 1 Capital ratio declined from year-end 2017 primarily due to a reduction in Common Equity Tier 1 Capital resulting from the return of $18.4 billion capital to common shareholders, an increase in risk-weighted assets, and adverse net movements in AOCI, partially offset by net income of $18.0 billion in 2018.


Components of Citigroup Capital

(1)

Issuance costs of $168 million and $184 million related to noncumulative perpetual preferred stock outstanding at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, are excluded from common stockholders’ equity and netted against such preferred stock in accordance with Federal Reserve Board regulatory reporting requirements, which differ from those under U.S. GAAP.

(2)

Common Equity Tier 1 Capital is adjusted for accumulated net unrealized gains (losses) on cash flow hedges included in AOCI that relate to the hedging of items not recognized at fair value on the balance sheet.

(3)

The cumulative impact of changes in Citigroup’s own creditworthiness in valuing liabilities for which the fair value option has been elected, and own-credit valuation adjustments on derivatives, are excluded from Common Equity Tier 1 Capital, in accordance with the U.S. Basel III rules.

(4)

Includes goodwill “embedded” in the valuation of significant common stock investments in unconsolidated financial institutions.

Footnotes continue on the following page.


(5)

Of Citi’s $22.9 billion of net DTAs at December 31, 2018, $11.9 billion was includable in Common Equity Tier 1 Capital pursuant to the U.S. Basel III rules, while $11.0 billion was excluded. Excluded from Citi’s Common Equity Tier 1 Capital as of December 31, 2018 was $12.0 billion of net DTAs arising from net operating loss, foreign tax credit and general business credit carry-forwards, which was reduced by $1.0 billion of net DTLs primarily associated with goodwill and certain other intangible assets. Separately, under the U.S. Basel III rules, goodwill and these other intangible assets are deducted net of associated DTLs in arriving at Common Equity Tier 1 Capital. DTAs arising from net operating loss, foreign tax credit and general business credit carry-forwards are required to be entirely deducted from Common Equity Tier 1 Capital under the U.S. Basel III rules. Commencing on December 31, 2017, Citi’s DTAs arising from temporary differences were less than the 10% limitation under the U.S. Basel III rules and therefore not subject to deduction from Common Equity Tier 1 Capital, but are subject to risk-weighting at 250%.

(6)

Represents Citigroup Capital XIII trust preferred securities, which are permanently grandfathered as Tier 1 Capital under the U.S. Basel III rules.

(7)

Banking entities are required to be in compliance with the Volcker Rule of the Dodd-Frank Act which prohibits conducting certain proprietary investment activities and limits their ownership of, and relationships with, covered funds. Accordingly, Citi is required by the Volcker Rule to deduct from Tier 1 Capital all permitted ownership interests in covered funds.

(8)

50% of the minimum regulatory capital requirements of insurance underwriting subsidiaries must be deducted from each of Tier 1 Capital and Tier 2 Capital.

(9)

Represents the amount of non-grandfathered trust preferred securities eligible for inclusion in Tier 2 Capital under the U.S. Basel III rules, which will be fully phased-out of Tier 2 Capital by January 1, 2022.

(10)

Under the Standardized Approach, the allowance for credit losses is eligible for inclusion in Tier 2 Capital up to 1.25% of credit risk-weighted assets, with any excess allowance for credit losses being deducted in arriving at credit risk-weighted assets, which differs from the Advanced Approaches framework, in which eligible credit reserves that exceed expected credit losses are eligible for inclusion in Tier 2 Capital to the extent the excess reserves do not exceed 0.6% of credit risk-weighted assets. The total amount of eligible credit reserves in excess of expected credit losses that were eligible for inclusion in Tier 2 Capital, subject to limitation, under the Advanced Approaches framework was $1.4 billion and $1.5 billion at December 31,


and


, respectively.


Citigroup Capital Rollforward


Citigroup Risk-Weighted Assets Rollforward (Basel III Standardized Approach)

(1)

General credit risk exposures include cash and balances due from depository institutions, securities, and loans and leases. General credit risk exposures increased during the 12 months ended December 31, 2018 mainly driven by growth in corporate loans.

(2)

Repo-style transactions include repurchase and reverse repurchase transactions as well as securities borrowing and securities lending transactions.

(3)

Securitization exposures increased during the three and 12 months ended December 31, 2018 due to increased exposures from new deals.

(4)

OTC derivatives decreased during the three months ended December 31, 2018 due to a decrease in notional amounts for bilateral trades. OTC derivatives increased during the 12 months ended December 31, 2018, primarily due to notional increases.

(5)

Other exposures include cleared transactions, unsettled transactions, and other assets. Other exposures increased during the 12 months ended December 31, 2018 primarily due to increases in various other assets subject to risk-weighting at 100% and additional DTAs arising from temporary differences, which are subject to risk-weighting at 250%.

(6)

Off-balance sheet exposures decreased during the three and 12 months ended December 31, 2018, primarily due to a reduction in loan commitments.

(7)

Risk levels decreased during the three months ended December 31, 2018 primarily due to a decrease in positions subject to incremental risk charges. Risk levels increased during the 12 months ended December 31, 2018 primarily due to changes in exposure levels subject to Value at Risk and Stressed Value at Risk.

(8)

Risk-weighted assets decreased during the 12 months ended December 31, 2018 primarily due to changes in model inputs regarding volatility and the correlation between market risk factors, as well as methodology changes for standard specific risk charges.


Citigroup Risk-Weighted Assets Rollforward (Basel III Advanced Approaches)

(1)

Retail exposures increased during the three months ended December 31, 2018, primarily due to seasonal spending for qualifying revolving (cards) exposures. Retail exposures decreased during the 12 months ended December 31, 2018, primarily due to residential mortgage loan sales and repayments.

(2)

Wholesale exposures decreased during the three months ended December 31, 2018, primarily due to decreases in loan commitments.

(3)

Repo-style transactions include repurchase and reverse repurchase transactions as well as securities borrowing and securities lending transactions.

(4)

Securitization exposures increased during the three and 12 months ended December 31, 2018, due to increased exposures from new deals.

(5)

OTC derivatives decreased during the three and 12 months ended December 31, 2018, primarily due to decreases in potential future exposure and fair value.

(6)

Other exposures include cleared transactions, unsettled transactions, assets other than those reportable in specific exposure categories and non-material portfolios.

(7)

Supervisory 6% multiplier does not apply to derivatives CVA.

(8)

Risk levels decreased during the three months ended December 31, 2018, primarily due to a decrease in positions subject to incremental risk charges. Risk levels increased during the 12 months ended December 31, 2018 primarily due to changes in exposure levels subject to Value at Risk and Stressed Value at Risk.

(9)

Risk-weighted assets decreased during the 12 months ended December 31, 2018 primarily due to changes in model inputs regarding volatility and the correlation between market risk factors, as well as methodology changes for standard specific risk charges.

(10)

Operational risk-weighted assets decreased during the three months and 12 months ended December 31, 2018 primarily due to changes in operational loss severity and frequency.

Total risk-weighted assets under the Basel III Standardized Approach increased from year-end


due to higher credit risk-weighted assets, slightly offset by a decrease in market risk-weighted assets. The increase in credit risk-weighted assets was primarily due to changes in OTC derivative trade activity, repo-style transactions, growth in corporate loans, securitization exposures and other exposures, partially offset by a decrease in loan commitments.

Total risk-weighted assets under the Basel III Advanced Approaches decreased from year-end 2017 driven by lower operational and credit, as well as market risk-weighted assets. The decrease in operational risk-weighted assets was primarily due to changes in operational loss severity and frequency. The decrease in credit risk-weighted assets was primarily due to a decline in retail exposures driven by a reduction in residential mortgage loan sales and repayments, and changes in OTC derivative trade activity, partially offset by increases in repo-style transactions, securitization exposures and other exposures.

Market risk-weighted assets decreased under both the Basel III Standardized Approach and Basel III Advanced Approaches primarily due to changes in model inputs regarding volatility and the correlation between market risk factors, as well as methodology changes for standard specific risk charges, partially offset by increases in positions subject to Value at Risk and Stressed Value at Risk.


Supplementary Leverage Ratio

Citigroup’s Supplementary Leverage ratio was 6.4% for the fourth quarter of 2018, compared to 6.5% for the third quarter of 2018 and 6.7% for the fourth quarter of 2017. The decline in the ratio quarter-over-quarter was principally driven by a reduction in Tier 1 Capital resulting from the return of $5.8 billion of capital to common shareholders, partially offset by net income of $4.3 billion. The decline in the ratio from the fourth quarter of 2017 was largely attributable to a reduction in Tier 1 Capital resulting from the return of $18.4 billion of capital to common shareholders, adverse net movements in AOCI, as well as an increase in Total Leverage Exposure primarily due to growth in average on-balance sheet assets, partially offset by net income of $18.0 billion.

The following table sets forth Citi’s Supplementary Leverage ratio and related components as of December 31,


and


.

Represents the average of certain off-balance sheet exposures calculated as of the last day of each month in the quarter.

(3)

Under the U.S. Basel III rules, banking organizations are required to include in TLE the effective notional amount of sold credit derivatives, with netting of exposures permitted if certain conditions are met.

(4)

Repo-style transactions include repurchase or reverse repurchase transactions and securities borrowing or securities lending transactions.


Capital Resources of Citigroup’s Subsidiary U.S.

Depository Institutions

Citigroup’s subsidiary U.S. depository institutions are also subject to regulatory capital standards issued by their respective primary federal bank regulatory agencies, which are similar to the standards of the Federal Reserve Board.

During 2018, Citi’s primary subsidiary U.S. depository institution, Citibank, N.A. (Citibank), is subject to effective minimum Common Equity Tier 1 Capital, Tier 1 Capital and Total Capital ratios, inclusive of the 75% phase-in of the 2.5% Capital Conservation Buffer, of 6.375%, 7.875% and 9.875%, respectively. Citibank’s effective minimum Common Equity Tier 1 Capital, Tier 1 Capital and Total Capital ratios during

2017, inclusive of the 50% phase-in of the 2.5% Capital Conservation Buffer, were 5.75%, 7.25% and 9.25%, respectively. Citibank is required to maintain stated minimum Common Equity Tier 1 Capital, Tier 1 Capital and Total Capital ratios of 4.5%, 6.0% and 8.0%, respectively.

The following tables set forth the capital tiers, total risk-weighted assets and underlying risk components, risk-based capital ratios, quarterly adjusted average total assets, Total Leverage Exposure and leverage ratios for Citibank, Citi’s primary subsidiary U.S. depository institution, as of December 31,


and


.

Citibank Capital Components and Ratios

(1)

Under the Advanced Approaches framework eligible credit reserves that exceed expected credit losses are eligible for inclusion in Tier 2 Capital to the extent the excess reserves do not exceed 0.6% of credit risk-weighted assets, which differs from the Standardized Approach in which the allowance for credit losses is eligible for inclusion in Tier 2 Capital up to 1.25% of credit risk-weighted assets, with any excess allowance for credit losses being deducted in arriving at credit risk-weighted assets.

(2)

Citibank’s risk-based capital and leverage ratios and related components as of December 31, 2017 are non-GAAP financial measures, which reflect full implementation of regulatory capital adjustments and deductions prior to the effective date of January 1, 2018. Citi believes these ratios and the related components provide useful information to investors and others by measuring Citi’s progress in prior periods against currently effective regulatory capital standards.

(3)

As of December 31, 2018, Citibank’s reportable Common Equity Tier 1 Capital, Tier 1 Capital and Total Capital ratios were the lower derived under the Basel III Standardized Approach. As of December 31, 2017, Citibank’s reportable Common Equity Tier 1 Capital and Tier 1 Capital ratios were the lower derived under the Basel III Standardized Approach, whereas the reportable Total Capital ratio was the lower derived under the Basel III Advanced Approaches framework.

(4)

Citibank must maintain minimum Common Equity Tier 1 Capital, Tier 1 Capital, Total Capital and Tier 1 Leverage ratios of 6.5%, 8.0%, 10.0% and 5.0%, respectively, to be considered “well capitalized” under the revised Prompt Corrective Action (PCA) regulations applicable to insured depository institutions as established by the U.S. Basel III rules. Effective January 1, 2018, Citibank must also maintain a minimum Supplementary Leverage ratio of 6.0% to be considered “well capitalized.”

Impact of Changes on Citigroup and Citibank Capital Ratios

The following tables present the estimated sensitivity of Citigroup’s and Citibank’s capital ratios to changes of $100 million in Common Equity Tier 1 Capital, Tier 1 Capital and Total Capital (numerator), and changes of $1 billion in Advanced Approaches and Standardized Approach risk-weighted assets and quarterly adjusted average total assets, as well as Total Leverage Exposure (denominator), as of December 31,


. The information below is provided for the purpose of analyzing the impact that a change in Citigroup’s

or Citibank’s financial position or results of operations could have on these ratios. These sensitivities only consider a single change to either a component of regulatory capital, risk-weighted assets, quarterly adjusted average total assets or Total Leverage Exposure. Accordingly, an event that affects more than one factor may have a larger basis point impact than is reflected in these tables.

Impact of Changes on Citigroup and Citibank Leverage Ratios

Citigroup Broker-Dealer Subsidiaries

At December 31,


, Citigroup Global Markets Inc., a U.S. broker-dealer registered with the SEC that is an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Citigroup, had net capital, computed in accordance with the SEC’s net capital rule, of $8.2 billion, which exceeded the minimum requirement by $5.6 billion.

Moreover, Citigroup Global Markets Limited, a broker-dealer registered with the United Kingdom’s Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) that is also an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Citigroup, had total capital of $20.9 billion at December 31,


, which exceeded the PRA's minimum regulatory capital requirements.

In addition, certain of Citi’s other broker-dealer

subsidiaries are subject to regulation in the countries in which they do business, including requirements to maintain specified levels of net capital or its equivalent. Citigroup’s other broker-dealer subsidiaries were in compliance with their capital requirements at December 31,


.


Regulatory Capital Standards Developments

The U.S. banking agencies and the Basel Committee issued numerous proposed and final rules on a variety of topics in 2018, as well as early 2019. In the U.S., the most significant proposals would introduce stress buffer requirements, as well as a new methodology for calculating risk-weighted assets for derivative contracts. The Basel Committee, among other things, finalized revisions to the GSIB framework as well as the minimum capital requirements for market risk.

U.S. Banking Agencies

Regulatory Capital Treatment—Implementation and Transition of the Current Expected Credit Losses (CECL) Methodology

In February 2019, the U.S. banking agencies issued a final rule that provides banking organizations an optional phase-in over a three-year period of the “Day One” adverse regulatory capital effects resulting from adoption of the CECL methodology.

The rule is in recognition of the issuance by the Financial Accounting Standards Board of ASU No. 2016-13, “

Financial Instruments—Credit Losses,

” which will replace the current incurred loss methodology for recognizing credit losses with the CECL methodology. The ASU will be effective for Citi as of January 1, 2020, and will generally result in the earlier recognition of the provision for credit losses and related allowance for credit losses than current practice. For additional information regarding the CECL methodology, see “Future Application of Accounting Standards” below.

Citi and Citibank plan to elect the transition provisions provided by the rule, and will phase-in the “Day One” regulatory capital effects resulting from adoption of the CECL methodology over the three-year period beginning January 1, 2020.

Separately, in December 2018, the Federal Reserve Board issued a statement that it plans to maintain its current framework for calculating allowances on loans in the supervisory stress test for the 2020 and 2021 supervisory stress test cycles, and to evaluate appropriate future enhancements to this framework as best practices for implementing CECL are developed. However, banking organizations are required to incorporate CECL into their stress testing methodologies, data, and disclosure beginning in the cycle coinciding with their first full year of CECL adoption (2020 for Citi).

Stress Buffer Requirements

In April 2018, the Federal Reserve Board issued a proposal that is designed to more closely integrate the results of the quantitative assessment in CCAR with firms’ ongoing minimum capital requirements under the U.S. Basel III rules.

Specifically, the proposed rule would replace the existing Capital Conservation Buffer, currently fixed at 2.5% under the U.S. Basel III rules, with (i) a variable buffer known as the Stress Capital Buffer (as described below), plus (ii) for U.S. GSIBs, the GSIB’s then-current GSIB surcharge, plus (iii) the Countercyclical Capital Buffer, if any. These three

components would constitute the new Capital Conservation Buffer.

The Stress Capital Buffer (SCB) would be equal to the maximum decline in a bank holding company’s Common Equity Tier 1 Capital ratio under the severely adverse scenario of the supervisory stress test, plus planned common stock dividends for each of the fourth through seventh quarters of the planning horizon (expressed as a percentage of risk-weighted assets)—the so-called “dividend add-on.” The SCB would be subject to a floor of 2.5%.

In addition to the SCB, the proposed rule would establish a new Stress Leverage Buffer requirement above the stated minimum Tier 1 Leverage ratio requirement. The Stress Leverage Buffer would be equal to the maximum decline in a bank holding company’s Tier 1 Leverage ratio under the severely adverse scenario of the supervisory stress test, plus planned common stock dividends for each of the fourth through seventh quarters of the planning horizon (expressed as a percentage of quarterly adjusted average total assets).

Finally, the proposed rule would also modify certain assumptions currently required in supervisory stress tests, including continued capital distributions during the nine-quarter capital planning horizon and balance sheet growth assumptions.

Under the timeline for stress testing and CCAR cycles included within the proposed rule, the Federal Reserve Board would generally release its calculation of each bank holding company’s SCB and Stress Leverage Buffer by June 30 of each year.

A final rule has not yet been issued. In late 2018, senior staff at the Federal Reserve Board indicated publicly that the proposal would not take effect until 2020 at the earliest. It was also noted that the Federal Reserve Board plans to re-propose certain elements of the proposal to better balance the need to preserve the dynamism of stress testing while reducing unnecessary volatility. The potential re-proposal may also address certain other elements of the original proposal, such as the relative timing between stress testing results and the submission of a firm’s capital plan, the consequences of breaching a buffer, the role and calibration of the dividend add-on, and the necessity of the Stress Leverage Buffer.

Enhanced Supplementary Leverage Ratio and Total Loss-Absorbing Capacity (TLAC) Requirements

In April 2018, the Federal Reserve Board and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) jointly issued a proposal that would modify the enhanced Supplementary Leverage ratio standards applicable to U.S. GSIBs and their Federal Reserve Board or OCC-regulated insured depository institution subsidiaries.

The proposed rule would replace the currently fixed 2.0% leverage buffer requirement with a variable leverage buffer requirement equal to 50% of the U.S. GSIB’s currently applicable GSIB surcharge. Similarly, for the regulated insured depository institution subsidiaries of U.S. GSIBs, such as Citibank, the proposed rule would replace the currently fixed 6.0% threshold at which these subsidiaries are considered to be “well capitalized” under the PCA framework with a threshold set at the stated minimum requirement of


3.0% plus 50% of the GSIB surcharge applicable to the U.S. GSIB of which it is a subsidiary.

The proposed rule would also make corresponding modifications to certain of the Federal Reserve Board’s TLAC requirements applicable to U.S. GSIBs. Accordingly, under the proposed rule, each U.S. GSIB’s fixed 2.0% leverage-based TLAC buffer would be replaced with a buffer equal to 50% of the GSIB surcharge, and the leverage component of each U.S. GSIB’s Long-Term Debt (LTD) requirement would be revised to equal Total Leverage Exposure multiplied by 2.5% plus 50% of the U.S. GSIB’s applicable GSIB surcharge. For additional information about TLAC, see “Managing Global Risk—Liquidity Risk—Long-Term Debt—Total Loss-Absorbing Capacity (TLAC)” below.

If adopted as proposed, and assuming that Citi maintains a method 2 GSIB surcharge of 3.0%, Citi’s effective minimum Supplementary Leverage ratio requirement would be reduced to 4.5%, compared to the current 5.0%. Citibank’s effective minimum Supplementary Leverage ratio to be determined “well capitalized” under the PCA framework would similarly be reduced to 4.5%, compared to the current 6.0%. Citi’s leverage-based TLAC buffer would decrease from 2.0% to 1.5%, which would reduce Citi’s effective minimum leverage-based TLAC requirement from 9.5% to 9.0%. Additionally, the leverage component of Citi’s long-term debt requirement would decrease from 4.5% to 4.0%.

The Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act, which was signed into law in 2018, directs the U.S. banking agencies to amend the U.S. Basel III rules to exclude certain custody-related deposits from the definition of Total Leverage Exposure for custody banks. The U.S. banking agencies have not yet issued a notice of proposed rulemaking in response to this particular provision of the Act, and it is currently unclear how this may impact or interact with their proposed rulemaking from April 2018.

Standardized Approach for Counterparty Credit Risk

In December 2018, the U.S. banking agencies issued a proposal to introduce the Standardized Approach for Counterparty Credit Risk (SA-CCR) in the U.S. SA-CCR would replace the Current Exposure Method (CEM), which is the current methodology used to calculate risk-weighted assets for all derivative contracts under the Standardized Approach, as well as risk-weighted assets for derivative contracts under the Advanced Approaches in cases where internal models are not used. Additionally, SA-CCR would replace CEM in numerous other instances throughout the regulatory framework, including but not limited to the Supplementary Leverage Ratio, single counterparty credit limits, and legal lending limits.

Under SA-CCR, a banking organization would calculate the exposure amount of its derivative contracts at the netting set level. Multiple derivative contracts would generally be considered to be under the same netting set so long as each derivative contract is subject to the same qualifying master netting agreement. SA-CCR also introduces the concept of hedging sets, which would allow a banking organization to fully or partially net derivative contracts within the same netting set that share similar risk factors. Moreover, SA-CCR

incorporates updated supervisory factors and maturity factors to calculate the potential future exposure of a derivative contract, and provides for improved recognition of collateral. Under the proposal, the exposure amount of a netting set would be equal to an alpha factor of 1.4 multiplied by the sum of the replacement cost and potential future exposure of the netting set.

The effective date of the proposed rule is July 1, 2020; however, early adoption would be permitted. If adopted as proposed, Citi’s risk-weighted assets related to derivative contracts under the Standardized Approach are likely to increase. The ultimate impact on Citi, however, will depend upon the specific provisions of any final rule.

Stress Testing Requirements

The U.S. banking agencies have recently issued a number of proposals that would modify company-run stress testing requirements to conform with the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act. In October 2018, the Federal Reserve Board released a proposal that would eliminate the mid-cycle stress test requirement for all bank holding companies, including Citi, effective in the 2020 cycle (the proposal would maintain the requirement to conduct an annual company-run stress test). In January 2019, the Federal Reserve Board released a further proposal that would eliminate the hypothetical adverse scenario from company-run stress tests for bank holding companies, including Citi. Similarly, the Federal Reserve Board would no longer include an adverse scenario in its supervisory stress tests. (The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation released similar proposals in December 2018.) Company-run stress tests and supervisory stress tests would continue to include a severely adverse scenario. The proposals did not specify a proposed effective date for the elimination of the adverse scenario.

Basel Committee

Revised Assessment Framework for Global Systemically Important Banks

In July 2018, the Basel Committee issued a final standard which revised its framework for assessing the global systemic importance of banks, beginning with the 2021 assessment. (For a description of the Basel Committee’s GSIB methodology, so-called “method 1” under the U.S. Basel III rules, see “Current Regulatory Capital Standards—GSIB Surcharge” above.)

The final standard introduces a trading volume indicator within the substitutability/financial institution infrastructure category, accompanied by an equivalent reduction in the current weighting of the existing underwriting indicator. Among other revisions, the standard also expands the scope of consolidation to include exposures of insurance subsidiaries within the size, interconnectedness, and complexity categories.

If the Federal Reserve Board were to adopt the Basel Committee’s revisions with respect to the U.S. GSIB framework, Citi’s estimated method 1 GSIB surcharge would remain unchanged at 2.0%.


The Basel Committee indicated in the standard that it plans to complete another review of the GSIB framework by 2021, at which time it will consider alternative methodologies for the substitutability category, including the removal of the existing cap. Citi’s estimated method 1 GSIB surcharge may increase in the future, if the Federal Reserve Board were to adopt alternative methodologies for the substitutability category.

Revisions to the Minimum Capital Requirements for

Market Risk

In January 2019, the Basel Committee issued a final standard that revises the market risk capital framework—the so-called Fundamental Review of the Trading Book, or FRTB. The final rule revises the assessment process under the Advanced Approaches to determine whether a bank’s internal risk management models appropriately reflect the risks of individual trading desks, and clarifies the requirements for identification of risk factors that are eligible for internal modeling. In addition, the risk weights for general interest rate risk and foreign exchange risk under the Standardized Approach have been recalibrated.

If the U.S. banking agencies were to adopt the Basel Committee’s revised market risk framework unchanged, Citi believes its market risk-weighted assets could increase significantly. The ultimate impact on Citi, however, will depend upon the specific provisions of any final rule.

Leverage Ratio Treatment of Client Cleared Derivatives

In October 2018, the Basel Committee issued a consultative document seeking views as to whether a targeted and limited revision of the leverage ratio exposure measure was warranted with regard to the treatment of client cleared derivatives. In the U.S., the Basel Committee’s leverage ratio framework and leverage ratio exposure measure are most closely aligned with the Supplementary Leverage Ratio and Total Leverage Exposure, respectively. Under the Basel Committee’s leverage ratio framework, the leverage ratio exposure measure is generally not adjusted for physical or financial collateral, guarantees or other credit risk mitigation techniques, including initial margin received from clients. However, the Basel Committee consultative document proposes two alternative treatments for client cleared derivatives that would reduce the leverage ratio exposure measure, to varying degrees, in recognition of the beneficial effects of margin requirements and overcollateralization, as applicable.

One of the options under consideration would allow amounts of cash and non-cash initial margin that are received from the client to offset the potential future exposure of derivatives centrally cleared on the client’s behalf. Another option would amend the currently specified treatment of client cleared derivatives to align it with the measurement as determined per the Basel Committee’s standardized approach for measuring counterparty credit risk exposures, as used for risk-based capital requirements. This option would permit both cash and non-cash forms of initial margin and variation margin received from the client to offset replacement cost and potential future exposure for client cleared derivatives only.

If the U.S. agencies were to amend the Supplementary Leverage Ratio requirements in a manner similar to either of the options under consideration by the Basel Committee, Citi’s Supplementary Leverage Ratio would likely benefit modestly. However, the impact from and timing of any actions undertaken by the Basel Committee or the U.S. banking agencies in this regard remains uncertain.


Tangible Common Equity, Book Value Per Share, Tangible Book Value Per Share and Returns on Equity

Tangible common equity (TCE), as defined by Citi, represents common stockholders’ equity less goodwill and identifiable intangible assets (other than MSRs). Other companies may calculate TCE in a different manner. TCE, tangible book value (TBV) per share and return on average TCE are non-GAAP financial measures. Citi believes the presentation of TCE, TBV per share and return on average TCE provides alternate measures of capital strength and performance that are commonly used by investors and industry analysts.
