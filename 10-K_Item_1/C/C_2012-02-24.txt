Item 1. Business

OVERVIEW

Citigroup’s history dates back
to the founding of Citibank in 1812. Citigroup’s original corporate predecessor
was incorporated in 1988 under the laws of the State of Delaware. Following a
series of transactions over a number of years, Citigroup Inc. was formed in 1998
upon the merger of Citicorp and Travelers Group
Inc.

Citigroup is a global diversified financial services holding company
whose businesses provide consumers, corporations, governments and institutions
with a broad range of financial products and services. Citi has approximately
200 million customer accounts and does business in more than 160 countries and
jurisdictions.

Citigroup currently operates, for management reporting purposes, via two
primary business segments: Citicorp, consisting of Citi’s

Global Consumer Banking

businesses and

Institutional Clients Group

; and Citi Holdings, consisting of

Brokerage and Asset Management, Local Consumer
Lending

and

Special Asset Pool

. For a further description of the business
segments and the products and services they provide, see “Citigroup Segments”
below, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results
of Operations” and Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

compared to approximately 260,000 full-time employees at December 31,
2010.

Please see “Risk Factors” below for a discussion of

certain
risks and uncertainties that could materially impact

Citigroup’s financial
condition and results of operations.

Certain
reclassifications have been made to the prior periods’ financial statements to
conform to the current period’s presentation.


As described above,
Citigroup is managed pursuant to the following segments:

* Effective in the first quarter of 2012, Citi will transfer the
substantial majority of the retail partner cards business (approximately $45
billion of assets, including approximately $41 billion of loans) from Citi
Holdings –

Local Consumer
Lending

to Citicorp—

North America RCB

.

The following are the four
regions in which Citigroup operates. The regional results are fully reflected in
the segment results above.

Japan.


MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Market and Economic
Environment

During 2011,
Citigroup remained focused on executing its strategy of growth through
increasing the returns on and investments in its core businesses of
Citicorp—

Global Consumer
Banking

and

Institutional Clients Group

—while continuing to reduce the assets and
businesses within Citi Holdings in an economically rational manner. While Citi
continued to make progress in these areas during the year, its 2011 operating
results were impacted by the ongoing challenging operating environment,
particularly in the second half of the year, as macroeconomic concerns,
including in the U.S. and the Eurozone, weighed heavily on investor and
corporate confidence. Market activity was down globally, with a particular
impact on capital markets-related activities in the fourth quarter of 2011. This
affected Citigroup’s results of operations in many businesses, including not
only

Securities and
Banking

, but also the Securities
and Fund Services business in

Transaction Services

and
investment sales in

Global
Consumer Banking

. Citi believes
that the European sovereign debt crisis and its potential impact on the global
markets and growth will likely continue to create macro uncertainty and remain
an issue until the market, investors and Citi’s clients and customers believe
that a comprehensive resolution to the crisis is structured, and achievable.
Such uncertainty could have a continued negative impact on investor activity,
and thus on Citi’s activity levels and results of operations, in
2012.

Compounding this continuing macroeconomic uncertainty is the ongoing
uncertainty facing Citigroup and its businesses as a result of the numerous
regulatory initiatives underway, both in the U.S. and internationally. As of
December 31, 2011, regulatory changes in significant areas, such as Citi’s
future capital requirements and prudential standards, the proposed
implementation of the “Volcker Rule” and the proposed regulation of the
derivatives markets, were incomplete and significant rulemaking and
interpretation remained. See “Risk Factors—Regulatory Risks” below. The
continued uncertainty, including the potential costs, associated with the actual
implementation of these changes will continue to require significant attention
by Citi’s management. In addition, it is also not clear what the cumulative
impact of regulatory reform will be.

Summary Results

Citigroup

Citigroup reported net income of $11.1 billion and diluted EPS of $3.63
per share in 2011, compared to $10.6 billion and $3.54 per share, respectively,
in 2010. In 2011, results included a net positive impact of $1.8 billion from
credit valuation adjustments (CVA) on derivatives (excluding monolines), net of
hedges, and debt valuation adjustments (DVA) on Citigroup’s fair value option
debt, compared to a net negative impact of $(469) million in 2010. In addition,
Citi has adjusted its 2011 results of operations that were previously announced
on January 17, 2012 for an additional $209 million (after tax) charge. This
charge relates to the agreement in principle with the United States and state attorneys general announced on February 9, 2012 regarding
the settlement of a number of investigations into residential loan servicing and
origination litigation, as well as the resolution of related mortgage litigation
(see Notes 29, 30 and 32 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). Excluding
CVA/DVA, Citi’s net income declined $952 million, or 9%, to $9.9 billion in
2011, reflecting lower revenues and higher operating expenses as compared to
2010, partially offset by a significant decline in credit
costs.

Citi’s revenues of $78.4 billion were down $8.2 billion, or 10%, compared
to 2010. Excluding CVA/DVA, revenues of $76.5 billion were down $10.5 billion,
or 12%, as lower revenues in Citi Holdings and

Securities and Banking

more than offset growth in

Global Consumer Banking

and

Transaction Services

. Net
interest revenues decreased by $5.7 billion, or 11%, to $48.4 billion in 2011 as
compared to 2010, primarily due to continued declining loan balances and lower
interest-earning assets in Citi Holdings. Non-interest revenues, excluding
CVA/DVA, declined by $4.8 billion, or 15%, to $28.1 billion in 2011 as compared
to 2010, driven by lower revenues in Citi Holdings and

Securities and Banking

.

Because of Citi’s extensive global operations,
foreign exchange translation also impacts Citi’s results of operations as Citi
translates revenues, expenses, loan balances and other metrics from foreign
currencies to U.S. dollars in preparing its financial statements. During 2011,
the U.S. dollar generally depreciated versus local currencies in which Citi
operates. As a result, the impact of foreign exchange translation (as used
throughout this Form 10-K, FX translation) accounted for an approximately 1%
growth in Citi’s revenues and 2% growth in expenses, while contributing less
than 1% to Citi’s pretax net income for the year.


Expenses

Citigroup expenses were $50.9 billion in 2011, up
$3.6 billion, or 8%, compared to 2010. Over two-thirds of this increase resulted
from higher legal and related costs (approximately $1.5 billion) and higher
repositioning charges (approximately $200 million, including severance) as
compared to 2010, as well as the impact of FX translation (approximately $800
million). Excluding these items, expenses were up $1.0 billion, or 2%, compared
to the prior year.

Investment spending was $3.9 billion higher in
2011, of which roughly half was funded with efficiency savings, primarily in
operations and technology, labor reengineering and business support functions
(e.g., call centers and collections) of $1.9 billion. The $3.9 billion increase
in investment spending in 2011 included higher investments in

Global Consumer Banking

($1.6 billion, including incremental cards
marketing campaigns and new branch openings),

Securities and Banking

(approximately $800 million, including new hires
and technology investments) and

Transaction Services

(approximately $600 million, including new mandates and platform enhancements),
as well as additional firm-wide initiatives and investments to comply with
regulatory requirements. All other expense increases, including higher
volume-related costs in Citicorp, were more than offset by a decline in Citi
Holdings expenses. While Citi will continue some level of incremental investment
spending in its businesses going forward, Citi currently believes these
increases in investments will be self-funded through ongoing reengineering and
efficiency savings. Accordingly, Citi believes that the increased level of
investment spending incurred during the latter part of 2010 and 2011 was
largely completed by year end 2011.

Citicorp expenses were $39.6 billion in 2011, up $3.5 billion, or 10%,
compared to 2010. Over one-third of this increase resulted from higher legal and
related costs and higher repositioning charges (including severance) as compared
to 2010, as well as the impact of FX translation. The remainder of the increase
was primarily driven by investment spending (as described above), partially
offset by ongoing productivity savings and other expense reductions.

Citi Holdings expenses were $8.8 billion in 2011,
down $824 million, or 9%, principally due to the continued decline in assets,
partially offset by higher legal and related costs.

Credit
Costs

Credit trends for
Citigroup continued to improve in 2011, particularly for Citi’s

North America

Citi-branded and retail partner cards businesses,
as well as its

North
America

mortgage portfolios in
Citi Holdings, although the pace of improvement in these businesses slowed.
Citi’s total provisions for credit losses and for benefits and claims of $12.8
billion declined $13.2 billion, or 51%, from 2010. Net credit losses of $20.0
billion in 2011 were down $10.8 billion, or 35%, reflecting improvement in both
Consumer and Corporate credit trends. Consumer net credit losses declined $10.0
billion, or 35%, to $18.4 billion, driven by continued improvement in credit in

North America

Citi-branded cards and retail partner cards and

North America

real estate lending in Citi Holdings. Corporate
net credit losses decreased $810 million, or 33%, to $1.6 billion, as credit
quality continued to improve in the Corporate
portfolio.

The net release of allowance for loan losses and unfunded lending
commitments was $8.2 billion in 2011, compared to a net release of $5.8 billion
in 2010. Of the $8.2 billion net reserve release in 2011, $5.9 billion related
to Consumer and was mainly driven by

North America

Citi-branded
cards and retail partner cards. The $2.3 billion net Corporate reserve release
reflected continued improvement in Corporate credit trends, partially offset by
loan growth.

More than half of the net credit reserve release in 2011, or $4.8
billion, was attributable to Citi Holdings. The $3.5 billion net credit release
in Citicorp increased from $2.2 billion in the prior year, as a higher net
release in Citi-branded cards in

North America

was
partially offset by lower net releases in international

Regional Consumer Banking

and the Corporate portfolio, each driven by loan
growth.


Capital and Loan Loss
Reserve Positions

Citigroup’s capital and loan loss reserve positions remained strong at
year end 2011. Citigroup’s Tier 1 Capital ratio was 13.6% and the Tier 1 Common
ratio was 11.8%.

Citigroup’s total allowance for loan
losses was $30.1 billion at year end 2011, or 4.7% of total loans, down from
$40.7 billion, or 6.3% of total loans, at the end of the prior year. The decline
in the total allowance for loan losses reflected asset sales, lower non-accrual
loans, and overall continued improvement in the credit quality of Citi’s loan
portfolios. The Consumer allowance for loan losses was $27.2 billion, or 6.45%,
of total Consumer loans at year end 2011, compared to $35.4 billion, or 7.80%,
of total Consumer loans at year end 2010. See details of “Credit Loss
Experience—Allowance for Loan Losses” below for additional information on Citi’s
loan loss coverage ratios as of December 31,
2011.

Citigroup’s non-accrual loans of $11.2 billion at year end 2011 declined
42% from the prior year, and the allowance for loan losses represented 268% of
non-accrual loans.

Citicorp

Citicorp
net income of $14.4 billion in 2011 decreased by $269 million, or 2%, from the
prior year. Excluding CVA/DVA, Citicorp’s net income declined $1.6
billion, or 10.6%, to $13.4 billion in 2011, reflecting lower revenues and
higher operating expenses, partially offset by the significantly lower credit
costs.

Asia

and

Latin America

contributed
roughly half of Citicorp’s net income for the year.

Citicorp revenues were $64.6 billion, down $989
million, or 2%, from 2010. Excluding CVA/DVA, revenues of $62.8 billion were
down $3.1 billion, or 5%, as compared to 2010. Net interest revenues decreased
by $450 million, or 1%, to $38.1 billion, as lower revenues in

North America Regional Consumer
Banking

and

Securities and Banking

more than offset growth in

Latin America

and

Asia Regional Consumer Banking

and

Transaction
Services

. Non-interest revenues,
excluding CVA/DVA, declined by $2.7 billion, or 10%, to $24.7 billion in 2011 as
compared to 2010, driven by lower revenues in

Securities and Banking

.

Global Consumer Banking

revenues of $32.6 billion were up $211 million
year-over-year, as continued growth in

Asia

and

Latin America Regional Consumer
Banking

was partially offset by
lower revenues in

North America
Regional Consumer Banking

. The
2011 results in

Global Consumer
Banking

included continued
momentum in Citi’s international regions, as well as early signs of growth in
its

North America

business:

International

Regional Consumer Banking

revenues of $19.0 billion

were up 8% year-over-year (5% excluding the
  impact of FX translation).

International average loans were up
  15% and average deposits grew 11%

(11% and 8% excluding the impact of FX translation,
  respectively).

International card purchase sales grew
  19% (13% excluding the impact of

FX
  translation).

Asia

achieved positive operating leverage (with
  year-over-year revenue

growth in
  excess of expense growth) in the third and fourth quarters of

2011, and

Latin America

achieved
  positive operating leverage in the

fourth quarter.

North America Regional Consumer
  Banking

grew revenues,
  card

accounts and card loans
  sequentially in the second, third and fourth

quarters of 2011.

Securities and
Banking

revenues of $21.4
billion decreased 7% year-over-year. Excluding CVA/DVA (for details on

Securities and
Banking

CVA/DVA amounts, see
“

Institutional Clients
Group—Securities and Banking

”
below), revenues were $19.7 billion, down 16% from the prior year, due primarily
to the continued challenging macroeconomic environment, which resulted in lower
revenues across fixed income and equity markets as well as investment
banking.

Fixed income markets revenues, which
constituted over 50% of

Securities and
Banking

revenues in 2011, of $10.9
billion, excluding CVA/DVA, decreased 24% in 2011 as compared to 2010, driven
primarily by a decline in credit-related and securitized products and, to a
lesser extent, a decline in rates and currencies. Equity markets revenues of
$2.4 billion, excluding CVA/DVA, were down 35% year-over-year, mainly driven by
weak trading performance in equity derivatives as well as losses in equity
proprietary trading resulting from the wind down of this business, which was
complete as of December 31, 2011. Investment banking revenues of $3.3 billion
were down 14% in 2011 as compared to 2010, driven by lower market activity
levels across all products. Lending revenues of $1.8 billion were up $840
million, from $962 million in 2010, primarily due to net hedging gains of $73
million in 2011, as compared to net hedging losses of $711 million in 2010,
driven by spread tightening in Citi’s lending portfolio.

Transaction Services

revenues were $10.6 billion in 2011, up 5% from
the prior year, driven by growth in Treasury and Trade Solutions as well as
Securities and Fund Services. Revenues grew in 2011 in all international regions
as strong growth in business volumes was partially offset by continued spread
compression. Average deposits and other customer liabilities grew 9% in 2011,
while assets under custody remained relatively flat year over year.

Citicorp end of period loans increased 14% in 2011
to $465.4 billion, with 7% growth in Consumer loans and 24% growth in Corporate
loans.


Citi
Holdings

Citi Holdings’
net loss of $(2.6) billion in 2011 improved by $1.6 billion as compared to the
net loss in 2010. The improvement in 2011 reflected a significant decline in
credit costs and lower operating expenses, given the continued decline in
assets, partially offset by lower revenues.

While Citi Holdings’ impact on Citi has been declining, it will likely
continue to present a headwind for Citi’s overall performance due to, among
other factors, the lower percentage of interest-earning assets remaining in Citi
Holdings, the slower pace of asset reductions and the transfer of the
substantial majority of retail partner cards out of Citi Holdings into
Citicorp—

North America Regional
Consumer Banking

in the first
quarter of 2012. During the first quarter of 2012, Citi will republish its
historical segment reporting for Citicorp and Citi Holdings to reflect this
transfer in prior periods. The adjusted net loss in Citi Holdings for these
historical periods will be higher than previously reported, as the retail
partner cards business in

Local
Consumer Lending

was the primary
source of profitability in Citi Holdings.

Citi
Holdings’ revenues declined 33% to $12.9 billion from the prior year. Net
interest revenues decreased by $4.5 billion, or 30%, to $10.3 billion, primarily
due to the decline in assets, including lower interest-earning assets in the

Special Asset Pool

. Non-interest revenues declined by $1.9 billion,
or 42%, to $2.6 billion in 2011, driven by lower gains on asset sales and other
revenue marks as compared to 2010, as well as divestitures.

Citi Holdings’ assets declined $90 billion, or 25%, to $269 billion at
the end of 2011, although Citi believes the pace of asset wind-down in Citi
Holdings will decrease going forward. The decline during 2011 reflected nearly
$49 billion in asset sales and business dispositions, $35 billion in net run-off
and amortization and approximately $6 billion in net cost of credit and net
asset marks. As of December 31, 2011,

Local Consumer Lending

continued to represent the largest segment within Citi Holdings, with $201
billion of assets. Over half of

Local Consumer Lending

assets, or approximately $109 billion, were related to

North America

real estate lending. As of December 31, 2011,
there were approximately $10 billion of loan loss reserves allocated to

North America

real estate lending in Citi Holdings,
representing roughly 31 months of coincident net credit loss coverage.

At the end of 2011, Citi Holdings assets comprised
approximately 14% of total Citigroup GAAP assets and 25% of its risk-weighted
assets. The first quarter of 2012 transfer of the substantial majority of the
retail partner cards business (approximately $45 billion of assets, including
approximately $41 billion of loans) will result in Citi Holdings comprising
approximately 12% of total Citigroup GAAP assets and 21% of risk-weighted
assets.

As noted in the
      “Executive Summary” above, Citi has adjusted its 2011 results of
      operations that were previously announced on January 17, 2012 for an
      additional $209 million (after tax) charge. This charge relates to the
      agreement in principle with the United States and state
      attorneys general announced on February 9, 2012 regarding the settlement of a
      number of investigations into residential loan servicing and origination
      litigation, as well as the resolution of related mortgage litigation. The
      impact of these adjustments was a $275 million (pretax) increase in

Other operating expenses

, a $209 million (after-tax) reduction in

Net income

and a $0.06 (after-tax) reduction in

Diluted earnings per
      share

, for the full year of 2011. See
      Notes 29, 30 and 32 to the Consolidated Financial
      Statements.

(2)

On January 1, 2010,
      Citigroup adopted SFAS 166/167. Prior periods have not been restated as
      the standards were adopted prospectively. See Note 1 to the Consolidated
      Financial Statements.

(3)

On January 1, 2009,
      Citigroup adopted SFAS No. 160,

Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements

(now ASC 810-10-45-15,

Consolidation: Noncontrolling Interest in a
      Subsidiary

), and FSP EITF 03-6-1,
      “Determining Whether Instruments Granted in Share-Based Payment
      Transactions Are Participating Securities” (now ASC 260-10-45-59A,

Earnings Per Share: Participating Securities and the
      Two-Class Method

). All prior periods have
      been restated to conform to the current period’s
      presentation.

(4)

Discontinued operations
      for 2007 to 2009 reflect the sale of Nikko Cordial Securities to Sumitomo
      Mitsui Banking Corporation, the sale of Citigroup’s German retail banking
      operations to Crédit Mutuel, and the sale of CitiCapital’s equipment
      finance unit to General Electric. Discontinued operations for 2007 to 2010
      also include the operations and associated gain on sale of Citigroup’s
      Travelers Life & Annuity, substantially all of Citigroup’s
      international insurance business, and Citigroup’s Argentine pension
      business sold to MetLife Inc. Discontinued operations for the second half
      of 2010 also reflect the sale of The Student Loan Corporation and, for
      2011, primarily reflect the sale of the Egg Banking PLC credit card
      business. See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements.

(5)

The diluted EPS
      calculation for 2009 and 2008 utilizes basic shares and income allocated
      to unrestricted common stockholders (Basic) due to the negative income
      allocated to unrestricted common stockholders. Using diluted shares and
      income allocated to unrestricted common stockholders (Diluted) would
      result in anti-dilution.

(6)

All per share amounts
      and Citigroup shares outstanding for all periods reflect Citigroup’s
      1-for-10 reverse stock split, which was effective May 6,
2011.

(7)

The return on average
      common stockholders’ equity is calculated using net income less preferred
      stock dividends divided by average common stockholders’ equity. The return
      on average total Citigroup stockholders’ equity is calculated using net income
      divided by average Citigroup stockholders’ equity.

(8)

As defined by the
      banking regulators, the Tier 1 Common ratio represents Tier 1 Capital less
      qualifying perpetual preferred stock, qualifying noncontrolling interests
      in subsidiaries and qualifying mandatorily redeemable securities of
      subsidiary trusts divided by risk-weighted assets.

(9)

The Leverage ratio
      represents Tier 1 Capital divided by adjusted average total
    assets.

(10)

Dividends declared per
      common share as a percentage of net income per diluted share.

2011 vs. 2010

Net income

increased $1.9 billion as compared to the prior year, driven by higher
loan loss reserve releases and an improvement in net credit losses, partly
offset by lower revenues and higher expenses. Citi does not expect the same
level of loan loss reserve releases in

NA RCB

in 2012 as it
believes credit costs in the business have generally
stabilized.

Revenues

decreased 8%
mainly due to lower net interest margin and loan balances in the Citi-branded
cards business as well as lower mortgage-related revenues, primarily relating to
lower refinancing activity and lower margins as compared to the prior
year.


Net interest revenue

decreased 8%, driven primarily by lower cards net interest margin which
was negatively impacted by the look-back provision of The Credit Card
Accountability Responsibility and Disclosure Act (CARD Act). As previously
disclosed, the look-back provision of the CARD Act generally requires a review
to be done once every six months for card accounts where the annual percentage
rate (APR) has been increased since January 1, 2009 to assess whether changes in
credit risk, market conditions or other factors merit a future decline in the
APR. In addition, net interest margin for cards was negatively impacted by
higher promotional balances and lower total average loans. As a result, cards
net interest revenue as a percentage of average loans decreased to 9.48% from
10.28% in the prior year. Citi expects margin growth to remain under pressure
into 2012 given the continued investment spending in the business during 2012,
which largely began in the second half of 2011.

Non-interest revenue

decreased 9%, primarily due to
lower gains from the sale of mortgage loans as Citi held more loans on-balance
sheet. In addition, the decline in non-interest revenue reflected lower banking
fee income.

Expenses

increased 19%, primarily driven
by the higher investment spending in the business during the second half of
2011, particularly in cards marketing and technology, and increases in
litigation accruals related to the interchange litigation (see Note 29 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements).

Provisions

decreased
$5.5 billion, or 71%, primarily due to a loan loss reserve release of $2.7
billion in 2011, compared to a loan loss reserve release of $0.3 billion in
2010, and lower net credit losses in the Citi-branded cards portfolio. Cards net
credit losses were down $3.0 billion, or 39%, from 2010, and the net credit loss
ratio decreased 366 basis points to 6.36% for 2011. The decline in credit costs
was driven by improving credit conditions as well as continued stricter
underwriting criteria, which lowered the cards risk profile. As referenced
above, Citi believes the improvements in, and Citi’s resulting benefit from,
declining credit costs in NA RCB will likely slow into 2012.

2010 vs. 2009

Net income

declined by $139 million, or 18%, as compared to
the prior year, driven by higher credit costs due to Citi’s adoption of SFAS
166/167, partially offset by higher

revenues.

Revenues

increased
72% from the prior year, primarily due to the consolidation of securitized
credit card receivables pursuant to the adoption of SFAS 166/167 effective
January 1, 2010. On a comparable basis, revenues declined 3% from the prior
year, mainly due to lower volumes in Citi-branded cards as well as the net
impact of the CARD Act on cards revenues. This decrease was partially offset by
better mortgage-related revenues driven by higher refinancing
activity.

Net interest
revenue

was down 6% on a
comparable basis driven primarily by lower volumes in cards, with average
managed loans down 7% from the prior year, and in retail banking, where average
loans declined 11%. The decline in cards was driven by the stricter underwriting
criteria referenced above as well as the impact of CARD Act. The increase in
deposit volumes, up 3% from the prior year, was offset by lower spreads due to
the then-current interest rate environment.

Non-interest revenue

increased 6% on a comparable basis from the prior year mainly driven by
better servicing hedge results and higher gains on sale from the sale of
mortgage loans.

Expenses

increased 5% from the prior year, driven by the
impact of higher litigation accruals, primarily in the first quarter of 2010,
and higher marketing costs.

Provisions

increased $6.0 billion,
primarily due to the consolidation of securitized credit card receivables
pursuant to the adoption of SFAS 166/167. On a comparable basis, provisions
decreased $0.9 billion, or 11%, primarily due to a net loan loss reserve release
of $0.3 billion in 2010 compared to a $0.5 billion loan loss reserve build in
the prior year coupled with lower net credit losses in the cards portfolio. Also
on a comparable basis, the cards net credit loss ratio increased 61 basis points
to 10.02%, driven by lower average loans.

2011 vs. 2010

Net income

declined 14% as compared to the prior year as an improvement in net
credit losses was partially offset by lower revenues and higher expenses from
increased investment spending. During 2011, the U.S. dollar generally
depreciated versus local currencies. As a result, the impact of FX translation
accounted for an approximately 1% growth in revenues and expenses,
respectively.

Revenues

declined 2%
driven by the continued liquidation of higher yielding non-strategic customer
portfolios and a lower contribution from Akbank, Citi’s equity investment in
Turkey. The revenue decline was partly offset by the impact of FX translation
and improved underlying trends in the core lending portfolio, discussed
below.

Net interest revenue

declined 3% due to the continued
decline in the higher yielding non-strategic retail banking portfolio and spread
compression in the Citi-branded cards portfolio. Interest rate caps on credit
cards, particularly in Turkey and Poland, contributed to the lower spreads in
the cards portfolio.

Non-interest revenue

increased 1%, reflecting higher investment sales and cards fees, partly offset
by the lower contribution from Akbank. Underlying drivers continued to show
growth as investment sales grew 28% from the prior year and cards purchase sales
grew 14%.

Expenses

increased 9%, due to the impact of FX
translation, investment spending and higher transactional expenses, partly
offset by continued savings initiatives. Expenses could remain at elevated
levels in 2012 given continued investment spending.

Provisions

were 71% lower than the prior year driven by a reduction in net credit
losses. Net credit losses decreased 46%, reflecting the continued credit quality
improvement during the year, stricter underwriting criteria and the move to
lower risk products. Loan loss reserve releases were flat. Assuming the
underlying core portfolio continues to grow and season in 2012, Citi expects
credit costs to rise.


2010 vs. 2009

Net income

improved by $313 million, driven by the reduction in credit costs,
partly offset by lower revenues and higher expenses. During 2010, the U.S.
dollar generally appreciated versus local currencies. As a result, the impact of
FX translation accounted for an approximately 1% decline in revenues and
expenses, respectively.

Revenues

declined 3% driven by FX translation and the continued liquidation of
non-strategic customer portfolios.

Net interest revenue

was
5% lower due to the continued decline in the higher yielding non-strategic
retail banking portfolio. In 2010, Citi focused its lending strategy around
higher credit quality customers who tend to revolve less, meaning they have
lower average balances than customers previously had. While this led to lower credit
costs, it also negatively impacted

Net interest revenue

as customers
paid off their loans more quickly.

Non-interest revenue

increased 1%, reflecting higher investment sales and a higher
contribution from Citi’s equity investment in Akbank.

Expenses

increased 5%, due to account acquisition-focused investment spending and
volumes. As the average customer credit quality improved, Citi focused on volume
growth to compensate for the lower revenue. The expansion of the sales force in
2010 drove some of the expense increase as compared to 2009.

Provisions

decreased 75% from the prior year driven by reduction in net credit
losses and higher loan loss reserve releases. Net credit losses decreased 33%,
reflecting continued credit quality improvement and the move to lower risk
products.

2011 vs. 2010

Net income

declined 11% as lower loan loss reserve releases more than offset
increased operating margin. During 2011, the U.S. dollar generally depreciated
versus local currencies. As a result, FX translation contributed approximately
2% to the growth in each of revenues and
expenses.

Revenues

increased 9%
primarily due to higher volumes as well as the impact of FX translation.

Net interest revenue

increased 8% driven by the
continued growth in lending and deposit volumes, partially offset by continued
spread compression. The declining rate environment negatively impacted

Net interest
revenue

as interest revenue
declined at a faster pace than interest expense. Spread compression was also
driven by the continued move towards customers with a lower risk profile and
stricter underwriting criteria, especially in the branded cards portfolio.

Non-interest
revenue

increased 11%,
predominantly driven by an increase in banking fee income from credit card
purchase sales, which grew 22%.

Expenses

increased 11% due
to higher volumes and investment spending, including increased marketing and
customer acquisition costs as well as new branches. These increased expenses
were partially offset by continued savings initiatives. The increase in the
level of investment spending in the business was largely completed at the end of
2011.

Provisions

increased 49% reflecting lower loan loss reserve
releases in 2011 as compared to 2010. Towards the end of 2011, there was a build
in the loan loss reserves, primarily driven by increased volumes, particularly
in the personal loan portfolio in Mexico. Net credit losses declined 10%, driven
primarily by improvements in the Mexico cards portfolio. The cards net credit
loss ratio declined from 11.7% in 2010 to 8.8% in 2011, driven in part by the
continued move towards customers with a lower risk profile and stricter
underwriting criteria. Citi currently expects the Citi-branded cards net credit
loss ratio to stabilize in 2012 as new loans continue to season. Credit costs
will likely increase in line with portfolio growth.


2010 vs. 2009

Net income

increased $1.4 billion driven by lower credit costs as Citi released
reserves in 2010 as compared to reserve builds in 2009. During 2010, the U.S.
dollar generally appreciated versus local currencies. As a result, FX
translation contributed approximately 5% to the decline in both revenues and
expenses.

Revenues

increased 10%.

Net interest
revenue

increased 11% as higher
loan volumes, particularly in the retail bank, offset the effect of spread
compression. Spread compression was driven by the lower interest rates and move
towards the above referenced lower risk customer base.

Non-interest revenue

increased 8% due to higher banking fee income from
increased purchase sale activity and FX translation.

Expenses

increased 13% due to FX translation as well as higher volumes and
transaction-related expenses as economic conditions improved. The increase in
expenses was also due to increased investment spending, including new cards
acquisitions and new branches.

Provisions

decreased 61% primarily reflecting loan loss reserve releases of $823
million compared to a build of $463 million in the prior year as well as a $564
million improvement in net credit losses. The increase in loan loss reserve
releases and decrease in net credit losses primarily resulted from improved
credit conditions and portfolio quality in the Citi-branded cards portfolio,
primarily in Mexico, as well as the move to customers with a lower risk profile
and stricter underwriting criteria referenced above.

2011 vs. 2010

Net income

decreased 10%, driven by higher operating expenses, lower loan loss
reserve releases and a higher effective tax rate, partially offset by growth in
revenue. The higher effective tax rate was due to lower tax benefits (APB 23)
and a tax charge of $66 million due to a write-down in the value of deferred tax
assets due to a change in the tax law, each in Japan. During 2011, the U.S.
dollar generally depreciated versus local currencies. As a result, the impact of
FX translation accounted for an approximately 5% growth in revenues and
expenses.

Revenues

increased 8%, primarily driven by higher business volumes and the impact
of FX translation, partially offset by continued spread compression and $65
million of net charges relating to the repurchase of certain Lehman

structured notes (see Note 29
to the Consolidated Financial Statements).

Net interest revenue

increased 6%, as investment initiatives and
sustained economic growth in the region continued to drive higher lending and
deposit volumes. Spread compression continued to partly offset the benefit of
higher balances and continued to be driven by stricter underwriting criteria
resulting in a lowering of the risk profile for personal and other loans. Spread
compression will likely continue to have a negative impact on net interest
revenue in the near-term.

Non-interest revenue

increased 14%, primarily due to a 17% increase in Citi-branded cards purchase
sales and higher revenues from foreign exchange products, partially offset by a
12% decrease in investment sales, particularly in the second half of 2011, and
the net charges for the repurchase of certain Lehman structured
notes.


Expenses

increased 13% due to continued investment
spending, growth in business volumes, repositioning charges and higher legal and
related expenses, as well as the impact of FX translation, partially offset by
ongoing productivity savings. The increase in the level of incremental investment
spending in the business was largely completed at the end of
2011.

Provisions

increased 13%
as lower loan loss reserve releases were partially offset by lower net credit
losses. The increase in credit provisions reflected the increasing volumes in
the region, partially offset by continued credit quality improvement. India
remained a significant driver of the improvement in credit quality, as it
continued to de-risk elements of its legacy portfolio. Citi believes that
provisions could continue to increase as the portfolio continues to grow and
season.

2010 vs. 2009

Net income

increased 53%, driven by growth in revenue and a decrease in provisions,
partially offset by higher operating expenses and a higher effective tax rate.
During 2010, the U.S. dollar generally depreciated versus local currencies. As a
result, the impact of FX translation accounted for approximately 6% growth in
revenues, and 7% growth in expenses.

Revenues

increased 10%, driven by higher business volumes and the impact of FX
translation, partially offset by spread compression.

Net interest revenue

increased 6%, as investment initiatives and
sustained economic growth in the region drove higher lending and deposit
volumes, which were partly offset by the spread compression.

Non-interest revenue

increased 20%, primarily due to higher investment
sales and a 19% increase in Citi-branded cards purchase sales.

Expenses

increased 13%, due to growth in business volumes, investment spending
and the impact of FX translation.

Provisions

decreased 61%, mainly due to the net impact of a loan loss reserve
release of $287 million in 2010, compared to a $523 million loan loss reserve
build in 2009 and a 24% decline in net credit losses. The decrease in provisions
reflected continued credit quality improvement across the region, particularly
in India, partially offset by the increasing volumes in the
region.

2011 vs. 2010

S&B’s

results of operations for 2011 were significantly impacted by the
macroeconomic concerns during the year, including the overall pace of U.S.
economic recovery, the U.S. debt ceiling debate and subsequent downgrade of U.S.
sovereign credit, the ongoing sovereign debt crisis in Europe and general
continued concerns about the health of the global economy and financial markets.
These concerns led to heightened volatility as well as overall declines in
liquidity and market activity during the second half of the year as clients
reduced their activity and
risk.

Net income

of $4.9 billion
decreased 24%. Excluding CVA/DVA (see table below), net income decreased 43% as
declines in fixed income and equity markets revenues and investment banking
revenues, along with higher expenses, more than offset increases in lending and
private bank revenues.

Revenues

of $21.4 billion decreased 7% from the prior year. CVA/DVA increased by
$2.1 billion from the prior year, driven by the widening of Citi’s credit
spreads in 2011. Excluding CVA/DVA,

S&B

revenues decreased
16%, reflecting lower results in fixed income markets, equity markets and
investment banking, partially offset by increased revenues in lending and the
private bank.

Fixed income markets revenues, which constituted over 50% of

S&B

revenues in 2011, decreased 24% excluding
CVA/DVA. This was driven by lower results in securitized and credit products,
reflecting the challenging market environment and reduced customer risk appetite
and, to a lesser extent, rates and currencies.

Equity markets revenues decreased 35% excluding CVA/DVA, driven by declining revenues in equity proprietary trading (which Citi also refers to as equity principal
strategies) as positions in the business were wound down, a decline in equity derivatives revenues and, to a lesser extent, a decline in cash equities. The wind down of Citi’s equity proprietary trading was completed at
the end of 2011.

Investment banking revenues declined 14%, as the macroeconomic concerns
and market uncertainty drove lower volumes in debt and equity issuance.

Lending revenues increased 87%, mainly due to the absence of losses on
credit default swap hedges in the prior year (see the table below). Excluding
the impact of these hedging gains and losses, lending revenues increased 3%,
primarily due to growth in the Corporate loan portfolio. Private bank revenues
increased 6% excluding CVA/DVA, primarily due to higher loan and deposit
balances and improved customer pricing, partially offset by declines in
investment and capital markets-related products given the negative market
sentiment.

Expenses

increased 2%, primarily due to investment spending, which largely
occurred in the first half of the year, relating to new hires and technology
investments. The increase in expenses was also driven by higher repositioning
charges and the negative impact of FX translation (which contributed
approximately 2% to the expense growth), partially offset by productivity saves
and reduced incentive compensation due to business results. The increase in the
level of investment spending in S&B was largely completed at the end of
2011.

Provisions

increased by $140 million, primarily due to
builds in the allowance for unfunded lending commitments as a result of
portfolio growth and higher net credit losses.

2010 vs. 2009

Net income

of $6.4 billion decreased 30%. Excluding CVA/DVA, net income decreased
36%, as an increase in lending was more than offset by declines in fixed income
and equity trading activities, investment banking fees and higher
expenses.

Revenues

of $23.1 billion decreased 15% from the prior year, as performance in
the first half of 2009 was particularly strong due to higher fixed income
markets activity and client activity levels in investment banking. In addition,
2010 CVA/DVA increased $1.6 billion from the prior year, mainly due to a larger
narrowing of Citi’s spreads in 2009 compared 2010. Excluding CVA/DVA, revenues
decreased 19%, reflecting lower results in fixed income markets, equity markets
and investment banking, partially offset by increased revenues in
lending.

Fixed income markets revenues decreased 32% excluding CVA/DVA, primarily
reflecting lower results in rates and currencies, credit products and
securitized products due to the overall weaker market environment during
2010.

Equity markets revenues decreased 31% excluding CVA/DVA, driven by lower
trading revenues linked to the derivatives business and equity proprietary
trading.

Investment banking revenues declined 20%, reflecting lower levels of
market activity in debt and equity underwriting.

Lending revenues increased by $3.4 billion, mainly driven by a reduction
in losses on credit default swap hedges.

Expenses

increased 12%, or $1.6 billion, year over year. Excluding the 2010 U.K.
bonus tax impact and litigation reserve releases in the first half of 2010 and
2009, expenses increased 8%, or $1.1 billion, mainly as a result of higher
compensation, transaction costs and the negative impact of FX translation (which
contributed approximately 1% to the expense growth).

Provisions

decreased by $1.8 billion, to negative $24 million, mainly due to credit
reserve releases and lower net credit losses as the result of an improvement in
the credit environment during 2010.

2011 vs. 2010

Net income

decreased 7%, as higher expenses, driven by investment spending,
outpaced revenue growth. Year-over-year, the U.S. dollar generally depreciated
versus local currencies. As a result, the impact of FX translation accounted for
an approximately 1% growth in revenues and expenses,
respectively.

Revenues

grew 5%, driven primarily by international
growth, as improvement in fees and increased deposit balances more than offset
the continued spread compression, which will likely continue to be a challenge
in 2012. Treasury and Trade Solutions revenues increased 5%,
driven

primarily by growth in the  trade and commercial cards businesses and
increased deposits, partially offset  by the impact of the continued low rate environment. Overall, Securities and Fund
Services revenues increased 4% year-over-year, primarily due to growth in  transaction and settlement volumes, driven in part
by the increase in activity  resulting from market volatility, and new client mandates. During the fourth  quarter of 2011,
however, Securities and Fund Services experienced a 10% decline in revenues as compared to the prior year period, driven by
a significant decrease in settlement volumes reflecting the overall decline in capital  markets activity during the latter
part of 2011, spread compression and  the impact of FX translation.


Expenses

increased 15%
reflecting investment spending and higher business volumes, partially offset by
productivity savings. The increase in the level of investment spending in the
business was largely completed at the end of 2011.

Provisions

increased by $94 million, to $36 million, reflecting reserve builds in
2011 versus a net reserve release in the prior year.

Average
assets

grew 21%, driven by a 59% increase in trade assets as a result
of focused investment in the business.

Average deposits and other customer liability balances

grew 9% and included a favorable shift to
operating balances as the business continued to emphasize stable, lower cost
deposits as a way to mitigate spread compression.

2010 vs. 2009

Net income

decreased 3%, as expenses driven by investment spending outpaced revenue
growth. Year-over-year, the U.S. dollar generally depreciated versus local
currencies. As a result, the impact of FX translation accounted for
approximately 2% growth in revenues.

Revenues

grew 3%, despite the low interest rate environment. Treasury and Trade
Solutions revenues grew 2% as a result of increased customer liability balances
and growth in trade and fees, partially offset by the spread compression.
Securities and Fund Services revenues grew by 3% as higher volumes and balances
reflected the impact of sales and increased market activity.

Expenses

increased 9% reflecting investment spending and higher business
volumes.

Provisions

decreased $65 million, to a negative $58 million, as compared to the
prior year, reflecting credit reserve releases.

Average deposits and other customer liability
balances

grew 10%, driven
primarily by growth in emerging markets.


CITI HOLDINGS

Citi Holdings contains
businesses and portfolios of assets that Citigroup has determined are not
central to its core Citicorp businesses. Citi Holdings consists of the
following:

Brokerage and Asset
Management, Local Consumer Lending

and

Special Asset
Pool

.

Consistent with its strategy, Citi intends to continue to exit these
businesses and portfolios as quickly as practicable in an economically rational
manner. To date, the decrease in Citi Holdings assets has been primarily driven
by asset sales and business dispositions, as well as portfolio run-off and
pay-downs. Asset levels have also been impacted, and will continue to be
impacted, by charge-offs and revenue marks as and when appropriate.

As of December 31, 2011, Citi Holdings’ GAAP
assets were approximately $269 billion, a decrease of approximately $90 billion,
or 25%, from year end 2010, and $558 billion, or 67%, from the peak in the first
quarter of 2008. The decline in assets during 2011 reflected approximately $49
billion in asset sales and business dispositions, $35 billion in net run-off and
amortization, and $6 billion in net cost of credit and net asset marks. Citi
Holdings represented approximately 14% of Citi’s GAAP assets as of December 31,
2011, while Citi Holdings’ risk-weighted assets of approximately $245 billion at
December 31, 2011 represented approximately 25% of Citi’s risk-weighted assets
as of such date. As previously disclosed, Citi’s ability to continue to decrease
the assets in Citi Holdings through the methods discussed above, including sales
and dispositions, will not likely occur at the same pace or level as in the
past. See also the “Executive Summary” above and “Risk Factors—Business Risks”
below.

2011 vs. 2010

Net loss

increased 24% as lower revenues were only partly offset by lower
expenses.

Revenues

decreased by 54%,
driven by the 2010 sale of the Habitat and Colfondos businesses (including a $78
million pretax gain on sale related to the transactions in the first quarter of
2010) and lower revenues from the MSSB JV.

Expenses

decreased 26%,
also driven by divestitures, as well as lower legal and related
expenses.

Provisions

increased 55% due to the absence of the
prior-year reserve releases.

2010 vs. 2009

Net loss

was $0.2 billion in 2010, compared to

Net income

of $6.9 billion in 2009. The decrease was driven by the absence of the
gain on sale related to the MSSB JV transaction in 2009.

Revenues

decreased 96% versus the prior year driven by the absence of the $11.1
billion pretax gain on sale ($6.7 billion after tax) related to the MSSB JV
transaction in the second quarter of 2009 and a $320 million pretax gain on the
sale of the managed futures business to the MSSB JV in the third quarter of
2009. Excluding these gains, revenues decreased primarily due to the absence of
Smith Barney from May 2009 onwards as well as the absence of Nikko Asset
Management, partially offset by higher revenues from the MSSB JV and an
improvement in marks in the retail alternative investments business.

Expenses

decreased 70% from the prior year, mainly driven by the absence of Smith
Barney from May 2009 onwards, lower MSSB JV separation-related costs as compared
to the prior year and the absence of Nikko and Colfondos, partially offset by
higher legal settlements and reserves associated with Smith Barney.

Provisions

decreased 57%, mainly due to the absence of credit reserve builds in
2009.

Assets

decreased 10% versus the prior year, mostly driven
by the sales of the private equity business and the run-off of tailored loan
portfolios.


LOCAL CONSUMER
LENDING

As of December 31,
2011,

Local Consumer Lending
(LCL)

included a portion of
Citigroup’s

North America

mortgage business, retail partner
cards, CitiFinancial North America (consisting of the OneMain and CitiFinancial
Servicing businesses), remaining student loans, and other local Consumer finance
businesses globally (including Western European cards and retail banking and
Japan Consumer Finance). At December 31, 2011,

The

North America

assets consisted of residential mortgages
(residential first mortgages and home equity loans), retail partner card loans,
personal loans, commercial real estate, and other consumer loans and assets. As
referenced under “Citi Holdings” above, the substantial majority of the retail
partner cards business will be transferred to Citicorp—NA RCB, effective in the
first quarter of 2012.

As of December 31, 2011, approximately $108
billion of assets in

LCL

consisted of

North America

mortgages in Citi’s CitiMortgage and CitiFinancial
operations.

2011 vs. 2010

Net loss

decreased 43%, driven primarily by the improving credit environment,
including lower net credit losses and higher loan loss reserve releases, in both
retail partner cards and mortgages. The improvement in credit was partly offset
by lower revenues due to decreasing asset balances and sales.

Revenues

decreased 24%, driven primarily by the lower asset balances due to asset
sales, divestitures and run-offs, which also drove the 21% decline in

Net interest
revenue

.

Non-interest revenue

decreased 40% due to the impact of
divestitures.

Expenses

decreased
4%, driven by the lower volumes and divestitures, partly offset by higher legal
and regulatory expenses, including without limitation those relating to the United States and state attorneys general mortgage servicing discussions and
agreement in principle announced on February 9, 2012, reserves related to
potential PPI refunds (see “Payment Protection Insurance” below) and, to a
lesser extent, implementation costs associated with the OCC/Federal Reserve
Board consent orders entered into in April 2011.

Provisions

decreased
47%, driven by lower credit losses and higher loan loss reserve releases. Net
credit losses decreased 37%, primarily due to the credit improvements in retail
partner cards ($3.0 billion) and

North America

mortgages
($1.6 billion), although the pace of the decline in net credit losses in both
portfolios slowed. Loan loss reserve releases increased 62%, driven by higher
releases in retail partner cards and CitiFinancial North America due to better
credit quality and lower loan balances.

Assets

declined 20% from
the prior year, primarily driven by portfolio run-off and the impact of asset
sales and divestitures, including continued sales of student loans, auto loans
and delinquent mortgages (see “North America Consumer Mortgage Lending”
below).


2010 vs. 2009

Net loss

decreased 52%, driven primarily by the improving credit environment.
Decreases in revenues driven by lower gains on asset sales were mostly offset by
decreased expenses due to lower volumes and divestitures.

Revenues

decreased 11% from the prior year, driven primarily by portfolio run off,
divestitures and asset sales.

Net
interest revenue

increased 6% due
to the adoption of SFAS 166/167, partially offset by the impact of lower
balances due to portfolio run-off and asset sales.

Non-interest revenue

declined 58%, primarily due to the absence of the
$1.1 billion gain on the sale of Redecard in the first quarter of 2009 and a
higher mortgage repurchase reserve charge.

Expenses

decreased 19%,
primarily due to the impact of divestitures, lower volumes, re-engineering
actions and the absence of costs associated with the U.S. government
loss-sharing agreement, which was exited in the fourth quarter of 2009.

Provisions

decreased 38%, reflecting a net $1.8 billion loan loss reserve release in
2010 compared to a $5.8 billion build in 2009. Lower net credit losses across
most businesses were partially offset by the impact of the adoption of SFAS
166/167. On a comparable basis, net credit losses were lower year-over-year by
28%, driven by improvement in U.S. mortgages, international portfolios and
retail partner cards.

Assets

declined 21% from
the prior year, primarily driven by portfolio run-off, higher loan loss reserve
balances, and the impact of asset sales and divestitures, partially offset by an
increase of $41 billion resulting from the adoption of SFAS 166/167. Key
divestitures in 2010 included The Student Loan Corporation, Primerica, auto
loans, the Canadian Mastercard business and U.S. retail sales finance
portfolios.

Japan Consumer
Finance

Citi continues to
actively monitor a number of matters involving its Japan Consumer Finance
business, including customer defaults, refund claims and litigation, as well as
financial and legislative, regulatory, judicial and other political
developments, relating to the charging of gray zone interest. Gray zone interest
represents interest at rates that are legal but for which claims may not be
enforceable. In 2008, Citi decided to exit its Japan Consumer Finance business
and has been liquidating its portfolio and otherwise winding down the business
since such time. However, this business has incurred, and will continue to face,
net credit losses and refunds, due in part to legislative, regulatory and
judicial actions taken in recent years. These actions may also reduce credit
availability and increase potential claims and losses relating to gray zone
interest.

In September 2010, one of
Japan’s largest consumer finance companies (Takefuji) declared bankruptcy,
reflecting the financial distress that Japan’s top consumer finance lenders are
facing as they continue to deal with liabilities for gray zone interest refund
claims. The publicity relating to Takefuji’s bankruptcy resulted in a
significant increase in the number of refund claims during the latter part of
2010 and first half of 2011, although Citi observed a steady decline in such
claims during the remainder of 2011. During 2011,

LCL

recorded a net increase in its reserves related to customer refunds in
the Japan Consumer Finance business of approximately $120 million (pretax), in
addition to an increase of approximately $325 million (pretax) in 2010.

As evidenced by the events described above, the
trend in the type, number and amount of refund claims remains volatile, and the
potential full amount of losses and their impact on Citi is subject to
significant uncertainties and continues to be difficult to predict. In addition,
regulators in Japan have stated that they are considering legislation to
establish a framework for collective legal action proceedings. If such
legislation is passed and implemented, it could potentially introduce a more
accessible procedure for current and former customers to pursue refund claims
and other types of collective actions. Citi continues to monitor and evaluate
these developments and the potential impact to both currently and previously
outstanding loans in this business and its reserves related
thereto.


Payment Protection
Insurance

The alleged
mis-selling of payment protection insurance products (PPI) by financial
institutions in the UK, including Citi, has been, and continues to be, the
subject of intense review and focus by the UK regulators, particularly the
Financial Services Authority (FSA). PPI is designed to cover a customer’s loan
repayments in the event of certain events, such as long-term illness or
unemployment. The FSA has found certain problems, across the industry, with how
these products were sold, including customers not realizing that the cost of PPI
premiums was being added to their loan or PPI being unsuitable for the customer.
Prior to 2008, certain of Citi’s UK consumer finance businesses, primarily
CitiFinancial Europe plc and Egg Banking plc, engaged in the sale of PPI. While
Citi has sold a significant portion of these businesses, and the remaining
businesses are in the process of wind down, Citi generally retains the potential
liability relating to the sale of PPI by these businesses.

As a result of this regulatory focus and resulting
publicity, during 2010 and 2011, Citi observed an increase in customer
complaints relating to the sale of PPI. In addition, in 2011, the FSA required
all firms engaged in the sale of PPI in the UK, including Citi, to review their
historical sales processes for PPI, generally from January 2005 forward. In
addition, the FSA is requiring these firms to proactively contact any customers
who may have been mis-sold PPI after January 2005 and invite them to have their
individual sale reviewed. Redress, whether as a result of customer complaints or
Citi’s proactive contact with customers, generally involves the repayment of
premiums and the refund of all applicable contractual interest together with
compensatory interest of 8%.

As a result of these developments during 2011, Citi increased its
reserves related to potential PPI refunds by approximately $330 million ($230
million in

LCL

and $100 million in

Corporate/Other

for discontinued operations). Citi continues
discussions with the FSA regarding its proposed remediation process, and the
trend in the number of claims, the potential amount of refunds and the impact on
Citi remains volatile and is subject to significant uncertainty and lack of
predictability. This is particularly true with respect to the potential customer
response to any direct customer contact exercise. Citi continues to monitor and
evaluate the PPI remediation process and developments and its related
reserves.


SPECIAL ASSET
POOL

Special Asset Pool

portfolio of securities, loans and other assets that Citigroup intends to
continue to reduce over time through asset sales and portfolio run-off.

SAP

assets have declined by approximately $287
billion, or 88%, from peak levels in 2007, reflecting cumulative write-downs,
asset sales and portfolio run-off.

2011 vs. 2010

Net income

decreased 50%, driven by the decrease in revenues due to lower asset
balances, partially offset by lower expenses and improved
credit.

Revenues

decreased 81%,
driven by the overall decline in

Net interest revenue

during the year, as interest-earning assets declined and thus represent a
smaller portion of

SAP

.

Net interest revenue

was a negative $405 million in 2011 and Citi
expects to incur continued negative carrying costs in

SAP

going forward as the non-interest-earning assets of

SAP

, which require funding, now represent the larger portion of the total
asset pool.

Non-interest revenue

decreased by 42% due to lower
gains on asset sales and the absence of positive marks from the prior year, such
as on subprime exposures.

Expenses

decreased 49%, driven by lower volume and asset levels, as well as lower
legal and related costs.

Provisions

decreased $1.1
billion as credit conditions continued to improve during the year. The decline
of $1.1 billion was driven by a $945 million decrease in net credit losses and
an increase in loan loss reserve releases to $1.9 billion in 2011 from a release
of $1.7 billion in 2010.

Assets

declined 49%,
primarily driven by sales and amortization and prepayments. Asset sales of $29
billion for 2011 generated pretax gains of approximately $0.5
billion.

2010 vs. 2009

Net income

increased $6.4 billion from a net loss of $5.4 billion in 2009. The
increase was driven by higher gains on asset sales and improved revenue marks,
as well as improved credit.

Revenues

increased $6.1
billion, primarily due to the improvement of revenue marks in 2010. Aggregate
marks were negative $2.6 billion in 2009 as compared to positive marks of $3.4
billion in 2010. 2010 revenues included positive marks of $2.0 billion related
to subprime-related direct exposure, a positive $0.5 billion CVA/DVA related to
monoline insurers, and $0.4 billion on private equity positions. These positive
marks were partially offset by negative revenues of $0.5 billion on Alt-A
mortgages and $0.4 billion on commercial real estate.

Expenses

decreased 37%, mainly driven by the absence of the U.S. government
loss-sharing agreement exited in the fourth quarter of 2009, lower compensation,
and lower transaction expenses.

Provisions

decreased 95%
as credit conditions improved. The decline in credit costs was driven by a
decrease in net credit losses of $3.4 billion and a higher release of loan loss
reserves and unfunded lending commitments of $1.4 billion.

Assets

declined 41%, primarily driven by sales and amortization and
prepayments. Asset sales of $39 billion for 2010 generated pretax gains of
approximately $1.3 billion.


CORPORATE/OTHER

Corporate/Other includes
global staff functions (including finance, risk, human resources, legal and
compliance) and other corporate expense, global operations and technology,
unallocated Corporate Treasury and Corporate items and discontinued operations.
At December 31, 2011, this segment had approximately $286 billion of assets, or
15% of Citigroup’s total assets, consisting primarily of Citi’s liquidity
portfolio.

2011 vs. 2010

Net loss

of $732 million reflected a decline of $886 million compared to

Net income

of $154 million in 2010. The decline was primarily
due to the decrease in revenues coupled with the increase in expenses, as well
as the absence of the net gain on the sale of Nikko Cordial Securities and the
related benefit for income taxes recorded in discontinued operations in 2010.
This was partially offset by the absence of the net loss on the sale of The
Student Loan Corporation in 2010 and a net gain on the sale of the Egg Banking
plc credit card business in 2011, each recorded in discontinued operations in
the respective year.

Revenues

decreased $868 million, primarily driven by lower investment yields in
Treasury and lower gains on sales of AFS securities, partially offset by gains
on hedging activities and the gain on the sale of a portion of Citi’s holdings
in the Housing Development Finance Corp. (HDFC) in the second quarter of 2011
(approximately $200 million pretax).

Expenses

increased $906
million, due to higher legal and related costs and continued investment
spending, primarily in technology.

2010 vs. 2009

Net loss

decreased $8.0 billion, primarily due to the increase in revenues and the
absence of prior-year losses related to Nikko Cordial, partially offset by the
increase in expenses and the net loss on the sale of The Student Loan
Corporation.

Revenues

increased $12.3 billion, primarily due to the
absence of the loss on debt extinguishment related to the repayment of TARP and
the exit from the loss-sharing agreement with the U.S. government, each in the
fourth quarter of 2009. Revenues also increased due to gains on sales of AFS
securities, benefits from lower short-term interest rates and other improved
Treasury results in 2010. These increases were partially offset by the absence
of the pretax gain related to Citi’s public and private exchange offers in
2009.

Expenses

increased $577 million, primarily due to various
legal and related expenses as well as other non-compensation
expenses.

ASSETS

Cash and Deposits with
Banks

Cash and deposits
with banks

is comprised of both

Cash and due from
banks

and

Deposits with banks. Cash and due from
banks

includes (i) cash on
hand at Citi’s domestic and overseas offices, and (ii) non-interest-bearing
balances due from banks, including non-interest-bearing demand deposit accounts
with correspondent banks, central banks (such as the Federal Reserve Bank), and
other banks or depository institutions for normal operating purposes.

Deposits with
banks

includes interest-bearing
balances, demand deposits and time deposits held in or due from banks (including
correspondent banks, central banks and other banks or depository institutions)
maintained for, among other things, normal operating and regulatory reserve
requirement purposes.

During 2011,

Cash and deposits with banks

decreased $6 billion, or 3%, driven by a $7
billion, or 4%, decrease in

Deposits with banks

offset
by a $1 billion, or 3%, increase in

Cash and due from banks

.
These changes resulted from Citi’s normal operations during the year.

Federal Funds Sold and Securities
Borrowed or Purchased Under Agreements to Resell (Reverse
Repos)

Federal funds sold
consist of unsecured advances of excess balances in reserve accounts held at the
Federal Reserve Banks to third parties. During 2010 and 2011, Citi’s federal
funds sold were not significant. Reverse repos and securities borrowing
transactions increased by $29 billion, or 12%, during 2011, compared to 2010.
The majority of this increase was due to additional secured lending
to clients.

For further information
regarding these Consolidated Balance Sheet categories, see Notes 1 and 12 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements.

Trading Account
Assets

Trading account
assets

includes debt and
marketable equity securities, derivatives in a net receivable position, residual
interests in securitizations and physical commodities inventory. In addition,
certain assets that Citigroup has elected to carry at fair value, such as
certain loans and purchase guarantees, are also included in

Trading account assets

.

During 2011,

Trading
account assets

decreased $25
billion, or 8%, primarily due to decreases in corporate bonds ($14 billion, or
28%), foreign government securities ($9 billion, or 10%), equity securities ($4
billion, or 11%) and U.S. Treasury and federal agency securities ($4 billion, or
18%), partially offset by a $12 billion, or 24%, increase in derivative assets.
A significant portion of the decline in Citi’s

Trading account assets

occurred in the second half of 2011 as the
economic uncertainty that largely began in the third quarter of 2011 continued
into the fourth quarter.  Citi reduced its rates trading
in the G10, particularly in Europe, given the market environment in the region,
and credit trading and securitized markets also declined due to reduced client
volume and less market liquidity.

Average

Trading account
assets

were $270 billion in 2011,
compared to $280 billion in 2010.

For further information on Citi’s

Trading account assets

,
see Notes 1 and 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.


Investments

Investments

consists of debt and equity securities that are available-for-sale, debt
securities that are held-to-maturity, non-marketable equity securities that are
carried at fair value, and non-marketable equity securities carried at cost.
Debt securities include bonds, notes and redeemable preferred stock, as well as
certain mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities and other structured notes.
Marketable and non-marketable equity securities carried at fair value include
common and nonredeemable preferred stock. Non-marketable equity securities
carried at cost primarily include equity shares issued by the Federal Reserve
Bank and the Federal Home Loan Banks that Citigroup is required to
hold.

During 2011,

Investments

decreased by
$25 billion, or 8%, primarily due to a $9 billion, or 3%, decrease in
available-for-sale securities (predominantly U.S. Treasury and federal agency
securities), and a $18 billion decrease in held-to-maturity securities
(predominately mortgage-backed and Corporate securities) that included the
$12.7 billion of assets in the

Special Asset Pool

that
were reclassified and transferred to

Trading account assets

in the first quarter of
2011. The majority of the remaining decrease was largely due to a combined
reduction in U.S. Treasury and federal agency securities and foreign government
securities, which was partially offset by an increase in U.S. government agency
mortgage-backed securities, as Citi began to modestly reallocate its portfolio
into higher-yielding assets.

For further information regarding

Investments

, see Notes 1
and 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Loans

Loans

represent the largest asset category of Citi’s balance sheet. Citi’s
total loans (as discussed throughout this section, net of unearned income) were
$647 billion at December 31, 2011, compared to $649 billion at December 31,
2010. Excluding the impact of FX translation, loans increased 1% year over year.
At year end 2011, Consumer and Corporate loans represented 65% and 35%,
respectively, of Citi’s total loans.

In Citicorp, loans have increased for six consecutive quarters as of
December 31, 2011, and were up 23% to $465 billion at year end 2011, as compared
to $379 billion at the second quarter of 2010. Citicorp Corporate loans
increased 24% year over year, and Citicorp Consumer loans were up 7% year over
year. Corporate loan growth was driven by

Transaction Services

(37% growth), particularly from increased
trade finance lending in

Asia

,

Latin America

and Europe,
as well as growth in the

Securities and Banking

Corporate loan book (20%
growth), with increased borrowing generally across all client segments and
geographies. Consumer loan growth was driven by

Regional Consumer Banking

, as loans increased 7% year over year, led by

Asia

and

Latin America

. The growth
in

Regional Consumer Banking

loans reflected the economic
growth in these regions, as well as the result of Citi’s investment spending in
these areas, which drove growth in both cards and retail loans.

North America

Consumer loans increased 6%, driven by retail
loans as the cards market continued to adapt to the CARD Act and other
regulatory changes. In contrast, Citi Holdings loans declined 25% year over
year, due to the continued run-off and asset sales in the portfolio.

During 2011, average loans of $644 billion yielded
an average rate of 7.8%, compared to $686 billion and 8.0%, respectively, in the
prior year.

For further information on
Citi’s loan portfolios, see generally “Managing Global Risk—Credit Risk” below
and Notes 1 and 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Other Assets

consists of

Brokerage receivables, Goodwill,
Intangibles

and

Mortgage servicing rights

in addition to

Other assets

(including, among other items, loans
held-for-sale, deferred tax assets, equity-method investments, interest and fees
receivable, premises and equipment, certain end-user derivatives in a net
receivable position, repossessed assets and other receivables).

During 2011,

Other assets

decreased $22 billion, or 9%, primarily due to a
$3 billion decrease in

Brokerage
receivables

, a $2 billion
decrease in

Mortgage servicing
rights

, a $1 billion decrease in

Intangible assets

, a $1 billion decrease in

Goodwill

and a $15 billion decrease in

Deposits

represent customer funds that are payable on demand or upon maturity.
For a discussion of Citi’s deposits, see “Capital Resources and
Liquidity—Funding and Liquidity” below.

Federal Funds Purchased and Securities
Loaned or Sold Under Agreements To Repurchase (Repos)

Federal funds purchased consist of unsecured
advances of excess balances in reserve accounts held at the Federal Reserve
Banks from third parties. During 2010 and 2011, Citi’s federal funds purchased
were not significant.

For further information on Citi’s secured
financing transactions, including repos and securities lending transactions, see
“Capital Resources and Liquidity—Funding and Liquidity” below. See also Notes 1
and 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on
these balance sheet categories.

Trading Account
Liabilities

Trading account
liabilities

includes securities
sold, not yet purchased (short positions), and derivatives in a net payable
position, as well as certain liabilities that Citigroup has elected to carry at
fair value.

During 2011,

Trading account liabilities

decreased by $3 billion, or 2%, primarily due to
a $3 billion, or 6%, decrease in derivative liabilities. In 2011, average

Trading account
liabilities

were $86 billion,
compared to $80 billion in 2010.

For further information on Citi’s

Trading account liabilities

, see Notes 1 and 14 to the Consolidated Financial

liabilities

consists of

Brokerage payables

and

Other liabilities

(including, among other items, accrued expenses and other payables, deferred tax
liabilities, certain end-user derivatives in a net payable position, and
reserves for legal claims, taxes, restructuring, unfunded lending commitments,
and other matters).

During 2011,

Other
liabilities

increased $2 billion,
or 2%, primarily due to a $5 billion increase in

Brokerage payables

, offset by a $4 billion decrease in

Other liabilities

.

The supplemental information
      presented in the table above reflects Citigroup’s consolidated GAAP
      balance sheet by reporting segment as of December 31, 2011. The respective
      segment information depicts the assets and liabilities managed by each
      segment as of such date. While this presentation is not defined by GAAP,
      Citi believes that these non-GAAP financial measures enhance investors’
      understanding of the balance sheet components managed by the underlying
      business segments, as well as the beneficial inter-relationship of the
      asset and liability dynamics of the balance sheet components among Citi’s
      business segments.


CAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY

CAPITAL RESOURCES

Overview

Citi generates capital through earnings from its
operating businesses. Citi may augment its capital through issuances of common
stock, perpetual preferred stock and equity issued through awards under employee
benefit plans, among other issuances. Citi has also augmented its regulatory
capital through the issuance of subordinated debt underlying trust preferred
securities, although the treatment of such instruments as regulatory capital
will be phased out under Basel III and The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and
Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (see “Regulatory Capital Standards”
and “Risk Factors—Regulatory Risks” below). Further, the impact of future events
on Citi’s business results, such as corporate and asset dispositions, as well as
changes in regulatory and accounting standards, may also affect Citi’s capital
levels.

Capital is used primarily to support assets in Citi’s businesses and to
absorb market, credit or operational losses. Capital may be used for other
purposes, such as to pay dividends or repurchase common stock. However, Citi’s
ability to pay regular quarterly cash dividends of more than $0.01 per share, or
to redeem or repurchase equity securities or trust preferred securities, is
currently restricted (which restriction may be waived) due to Citi’s agreements
with certain U.S. government entities, generally for so long as the U.S.
government continues to hold any Citi trust preferred securities acquired in
connection with the exchange offers consummated in 2009. (See “Risk
Factors—Business Risks” below.)

Citigroup’s capital management framework is designed to ensure that
Citigroup and its principal subsidiaries maintain sufficient capital consistent
with Citi’s risk profile and all applicable regulatory standards and guidelines,
as well as external rating agency considerations. Senior management is
responsible for the capital and liquidity management process mainly through
Citigroup’s Finance and Asset and Liability Committee (FinALCO), with oversight
from the Risk Management and Finance Committee of Citigroup’s Board of
Directors. Among other things, FinALCO’s responsibilities include: determining
the financial structure of Citigroup and its principal subsidiaries; ensuring
that Citigroup and its regulated entities are adequately capitalized in
consultation with its regulators; determining appropriate asset levels and
return hurdles for Citigroup and individual businesses; reviewing the funding
and capital markets plan for Citigroup; and setting and monitoring corporate and
bank liquidity levels and the impact of currency translation on non-U.S.
capital. Asset and liability committees are also established globally and for
each region, country and/or major line of business.

Capital Ratios

Citigroup is subject to the risk-based capital
guidelines issued by the Federal Reserve Board. Historically, capital adequacy
has been measured, in part, based on two risk-based capital ratios, the Tier 1
Capital and Total Capital (Tier 1 Capital + Tier 2 Capital) ratios. Tier 1
Capital consists of the sum of “core capital elements,” such as qualifying
common stockholders’ equity, as

adjusted,  qualifying noncontrolling interests,
and qualifying trust preferred securities,  principally reduced by goodwill, other disallowed intangible assets, and
disallowed deferred tax assets. Total Capital also includes “supplementary” Tier  2 Capital elements, such as
qualifying subordinated debt and a limited portion  of the allowance for credit losses. Both measures of capital adequacy are
stated  as a percentage of risk-weighted assets.

In
2009, the U.S. banking regulators developed a new measure of capital  termed “Tier 1 Common,” which is defined
as Tier 1 Capital less non-common  elements, including qualifying perpetual preferred stock, qualifying
noncontrolling interests, and qualifying trust preferred securities. For more  detail on all of these capital metrics, see
“Components of Capital Under  Regulatory Guidelines” below.

Citigroup’s
risk-weighted assets are principally derived from application  of the risk-based capital guidelines related to
the measurement of credit risk.  Pursuant to these guidelines, on-balance-sheet assets and the credit equivalent  amount
of certain off-balance-sheet exposures (such as financial guarantees,  unfunded lending commitments, letters of credit
and derivatives) are assigned to  one of several prescribed risk-weight categories based upon the perceived credit
risk associated with the obligor or, if relevant, the guarantor, the nature of  the collateral, or external credit
ratings. Risk-weighted assets also  incorporate a measure for market risk on covered trading account positions and  all
foreign exchange and commodity positions whether or not carried in the  trading account. Excluded from risk-weighted assets
are any assets, such as  goodwill and deferred tax assets, to the extent required to be deducted from  regulatory capital.
See “Components of Capital Under Regulatory Guidelines”  below.

Citigroup
is also subject to a  Leverage ratio requirement, a non-risk-based measure of capital adequacy, which  is defined as Tier 1
Capital as a percentage of quarterly adjusted average total  assets.

To
be “well capitalized” under  current federal bank regulatory agency definitions, a bank holding company must
have a Tier 1 Capital ratio of at least 6%, a Total Capital ratio of at least  10%, and not be subject to a Federal
Reserve Board directive to maintain higher capital levels. In addition, the Federal Reserve Board expects bank holding companies
to maintain a minimum  Leverage ratio of 3% or 4%, depending on factors specified in its regulations. The
following table sets forth Citigroup’s regulatory capital ratios as of December 31, 2011 and December 31,
2010:

      authorized repurchase programs. No material repurchases were made in
      2011.

Tangible Common Equity and Tangible
Book Value

Per Share

Tangible common equity (TCE), as defined by Citigroup, represents common
equity less goodwill, intangible assets (other than mortgage servicing rights
(MSRs)), and related net deferred tax assets. Other companies may calculate TCE
in a manner different from that of Citigroup. Citi’s TCE was $145.4 billion at
December 31, 2011 and $129.4 billion at December 31,
2010.

The
TCE ratio (TCE divided by risk-weighted assets) was 14.9% at December 31, 2011
and 13.2% at December 31, 2010.

TCE and tangible book value per share, as
well as related ratios, are capital adequacy metrics used and relied upon by
investors and industry analysts; however, they are non-GAAP financial measures
for SEC purposes. A reconciliation of Citigroup’s total stockholders’ equity to
TCE, and book value per share to tangible book value per share, as of December
31, 2011 and December 31, 2010, follows:

ratios to changes of $100 million in Tier 1 Common Capital, Tier 1 Capital or
Total Capital (numerator), or changes of $1 billion in risk-weighted assets or
adjusted average total assets (denominator), based on financial information as
of December 31, 2011. This information is provided for the purpose of analyzing
the impact that a change in Citigroup’s or Citibank, N.A.’s financial position
or results of operations could have on these ratios. These sensitivities only
consider a single change to either a component of capital, risk-weighted assets
or adjusted average total assets. Accordingly, an event that affects more than
one factor may have a larger basis point impact than is reflected in this
table.

Broker-Dealer
Subsidiaries

At December 31,
2011, Citigroup Global Markets Inc., a broker-dealer registered with the SEC
that is an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Citigroup, had net capital,
computed in accordance with the SEC’s net capital rule, of $7.8 billion, which
exceeded the minimum requirement by $7.0
billion.

In addition, certain of Citi’s other broker-dealer subsidiaries are
subject to regulation in the countries in which they do business, including
requirements to maintain specified levels of net capital or its equivalent.
Citigroup’s broker-dealer subsidiaries were in compliance with their capital
requirements at December 31, 2011.


Regulatory Capital Standards

The prospective regulatory
capital standards for financial institutions, both in the U.S. and
internationally, continue to be subject to ongoing debate, extensive rulemaking
activity and substantial uncertainty. See “Risk Factors—Regulatory Risks”
below.

Basel II and II.5.

In
November 2005, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (Basel Committee)
published a new set of risk-based capital standards (Basel II) that permits
banking organizations to leverage internal risk models used to measure credit
and operational risks to derive risk-weighted assets. In November 2007, the U.S.
banking agencies adopted these standards for large, internationally active U.S.
banking organizations, including Citi. As adopted, the standards require Citi to
comply with the most advanced Basel II approaches for calculating risk-weighted
assets for credit and operational risks. The U.S. Basel II implementation
timetable originally consisted of a parallel calculation period under the
current regulatory capital regime (Basel I), followed by a three-year
transitional “floor” period, during which Basel II risk-based capital
requirements could not fall below certain floors based on application of the
Basel I rules. Citi began parallel Basel I and Basel II reporting to the U.S.
banking agencies on April 1, 2010.

In June 2011, the U.S. banking agencies adopted final regulations to
implement the “capital floor” provision of the so-called “Collins Amendment” of
The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010
(Dodd-Frank Act). These regulations eliminated the three-year transitional floor
period in favor of a permanent floor based on the generally applicable
risk-based capital rules (currently Basel I). Pursuant to these regulations, a
banking organization that has formally implemented Basel II must calculate its
risk-based capital requirements under both Basel I and Basel II, compare the two
results, and then use the lower of the resulting capital ratios for purposes of
determining compliance with its minimum Tier 1 Capital and Total Capital
requirements. As of December 31, 2011 neither Citi nor any other U.S. banking
organization had received approval from the U.S. banking agencies to formally
implement Basel II. Accordingly, the timing of Citi’s Basel II implementation
remains subject to uncertainty.

Apart from the Basel II rules regarding credit and operational risks, in
June 2010, the Basel Committee agreed on certain revisions to the market risk
capital framework (Basel II.5) that would also result in additional capital
requirements. In January 2011, the U.S. banking agencies issued a proposal to
amend the market risk capital rules to implement certain revisions approved by
the Basel Committee. However, the U.S. banking agencies’ proposal excluded the
methodologies adopted by the Basel Committee for calculating capital
requirements on certain debt and securitization positions covered by the market
risk capital rules, as such methodologies include reliance on external credit
ratings, which is prohibited by the Dodd-Frank Act (see below).

Basel III and Global
Systemically Important Banks (G-SIBs)

Basel III.

As an outgrowth of the financial crisis, in December 2010, the Basel
Committee issued final rules to strengthen existing capital requirements (Basel
III). The U.S. banking agencies are required to finalize, by December 2012, the
rules to be applied by U.S. banking organizations commencing on January 1, 2013.
While expected to be substantially the same as those of the Basel Committee as
described below, as of December 31, 2011, the U.S. banking agencies had yet to
issue the proposed U.S. version of the Basel III rules.

Under Basel III, when fully phased in on January
1, 2019, Citi would be required to maintain minimum risk-based capital ratios
(exclusive of a G-SIB capital surcharge) as follows:

Tier 1 Common

Tier 1 Capital

Total Capital

Stated minimum ratio

4.5

%

6.0

%

8.0

%

Plus: Capital
      conservation

buffer requirement

2.5

2.5

Effective minimum ratio

(without G-SIB
      surcharge)

7.0

%

8.5

%

10.5

%

While banking organizations would be
permitted to draw on the 2.5% capital conservation buffer to absorb losses
during periods of financial or economic stress, restrictions on earnings
distributions (e.g., dividends, equity repurchases, and discretionary
compensation) would result, with the degree of such restrictions greater based
upon the extent to which the buffer is utilized. Moreover, subject to national
discretion by the respective bank supervisory or regulatory authorities (i.e.,
for Citi, the U.S. banking agencies), a countercyclical capital buffer ranging
from 0% to 2.5%, consisting of only Tier 1 Common Capital, could also be imposed
on banking organizations when it is deemed that excess aggregate credit growth
is resulting in a build-up of systemic risk in a given country. This
countercyclical capital buffer, when in effect, would serve as an additional
buffer supplementing the capital conservation buffer.

Under Basel III, Tier 1 Common Capital will be
required to be measured after applying generally all regulatory adjustments
(including applicable deductions). The impact of these regulatory adjustments on
Tier 1 Common Capital would be phased in incrementally at 20% annually beginning
on January 1, 2014, with full implementation by January 1, 2018. During the
transition period, the portion of the regulatory adjustments (including
applicable deductions) not applied against Tier 1 Common Capital would continue
to be subject to existing national treatments.

Further, under Basel III, certain capital
instruments will no longer qualify as non-common components of Tier 1 Capital
(e.g., trust preferred securities and cumulative perpetual preferred stock) or
Tier 2 Capital. These instruments will be subject to a 10% per year phase-out
over 10 years beginning on January 1, 2013, except for certain limited
grandfathering. This phase-out period will be substantially shorter in the U.S.
as a result of the Collins Amendment of the Dodd-Frank Act, which will generally
require a phase-out of these securities over a three-year period also beginning
on January 1, 2013. In addition, the Basel Committee has subsequently issued
supplementary minimum requirements to those contained in Basel
III,


which must be met or exceeded
in order to ensure that qualifying non-common Tier 1 or Tier 2 Capital
instruments fully absorb losses at the point of a banking organization’s
non-viability before taxpayers are exposed to loss. These requirements must be
reflected within the terms of the capital instruments unless, subject to certain
conditions, they are implemented through the governing jurisdiction’s legal
framework.

Although Citi, like other U.S. banking organizations, is currently
subject to a supplementary, non-risk-based measure of leverage for capital
adequacy purposes (see “Capital Ratios” above), Basel III establishes a more
constrained Leverage ratio requirement. Initially, during a four-year parallel
run test period beginning on January 1, 2013, Citi, like other U.S. banking
organizations, will be required to maintain a minimum 3% Tier 1 Capital Leverage
ratio. Disclosure of such ratio, and its components, will start on January 1,
2015. Depending upon the results of the parallel run test period, there could be
subsequent adjustments to the definition and calibration of the Leverage ratio,
which is to be finalized in 2017 and become a formal requirement by January 1,
2018.

Global Systemically
Important Banks (G-SIBs).

In
November 2011, the Basel Committee finalized rules which set forth measures for
G-SIBs, including the methodology for assessing global systemic importance, the
related additional loss absorbency capital requirements (surcharges), and the
phase-in period regarding such requirements.

Under the final rules, the methodology for
assessing G-SIBs is to be based primarily on quantitative measurement indicators
comprising five equally weighted broad categories: size, cross-jurisdictional
activity, interconnectedness, substitutability/financial institution
infrastructure, and complexity. G-SIBs will be subject to a progressive minimum
additional Tier 1 Common Capital surcharge (over and above the Basel III minimum
capital ratio requirements) ranging initially across four buckets from 1% to
2.5% of risk-weighted assets, depending upon the systemic importance of each
individual banking organization. Further, a potential minimum additional 1% Tier
1 Common Capital requirement could also be imposed in the future on the largest
G-SIBs that are deemed to have increased their global systemic importance
(resulting in a total minimum additional Tier 1 Common Capital surcharge of
3.5%). Citi expects to be a G-SIB under the Basel Committee’s rules, although
the extent of its initial additional capital surcharge remains
uncertain.

The minimum additional Tier 1
Common Capital surcharge for G-SIBs will be phased-in, as an extension of and in
parallel with the Basel III capital conservation buffer and any countercyclical
capital buffer, commencing on January 1, 2016 and becoming fully effective on
January 1, 2019.

Accordingly, based on Citi’s current understanding, under Basel III, on a
fully phased-in basis, the effective minimum Tier 1 Common ratio requirement for
those banking organizations initially deemed to be the most global systemically
important, which will likely include Citi, will be at least 9.5% (consisting of
the aggregate of the 4.5% stated minimum Tier 1 Common ratio requirement, the
2.5% capital conservation buffer, and the maximum 2.5% G-SIB capital surcharge).
However, as referenced above, these capital surcharge measures have not yet been
proposed by the U.S. banking agencies, although they have indicated they intend
to adopt implementing rules in 2014.

Dodd-Frank Act

In addition to the
Collins Amendment, the Dodd-Frank Act contains other significant regulatory
capital-related provisions that have not yet been fully implemented by the U.S.
banking agencies.

Alternative Creditworthiness Standards.

In December 2011, the U.S banking agencies
proposed to further amend and supplement the market risk capital rules beyond
the January 2011 proposed modifications discussed above. The December 2011
proposals are intended to implement the provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act
requiring that all federal agencies remove references to, and reliance on,
credit ratings in their regulations, and replace these references with
appropriate alternative standards for evaluating creditworthiness. Under the
December 2011 proposal, the U.S. banking agencies set forth alternative
methodologies to external credit ratings which are to be used to assess capital
requirements on certain debt as well as securitization positions subject to the
market risk capital rules. The U.S. banking agencies have also indicated they
intend to propose similar revisions to the Basel I and Basel II rules to
eliminate the use of external credit ratings to determine the risk weights
applicable to securitization and certain corporate exposures under these
regulations.

Enhanced Prudential
Regulatory Capital Requirements.

As mandated by the Dodd-Frank Act, in January 2012, the Federal Reserve Board
issued a proposal designed to strengthen regulation and supervision of those
financial institutions deemed to be systemically important and posing risk to
market-wide financial stability, which would include Citi. The proposal
incorporates a wide range of enhanced prudential standards, including those
related to risk-based capital requirements and leverage limits.

The Federal Reserve Board has already implemented
the first phase of the proposal’s enhanced capital requirements through the
adoption of its capital plan rule in December 2011. As a result, Citi, like
other covered bank holding companies, is required to develop annual capital
plans, conduct stress tests, and maintain adequate capital, including a Tier 1
Common ratio in excess of 5% (under both expected and stressed conditions) in
order to engage in capital distributions such as dividends or share repurchases
(see “Risk Factors—Business Risks” below). The second phase of the enhanced
capital requirements, as set forth in the January 2012 proposal, would involve a
subsequent Federal Reserve Board proposal regarding the establishment of a
quantitative risk-based capital surcharge for covered financial institutions or
a subset thereof, to be consistent with the provisions of the Basel Committee’s
final G-SIB surcharge rules.


FUNDING AND LIQUIDITY

Overview

Citi’s funding and liquidity objectives generally
are to maintain liquidity to fund its existing asset base as well as grow its
core businesses in Citicorp, while at the same time maintain sufficient excess
liquidity, structured appropriately, so that it can operate under a wide variety
of market conditions, including market disruptions for both short- and long-term
periods. Citigroup’s primary liquidity objectives are established by entity, and
in aggregate, across three major categories:

(i)

the
      non-bank, which is largely composed of the parent holding company
      (Citigroup) and Citi’s broker-dealer subsidiaries (collectively referred
      to in this section as “non-bank”);

(ii)

Citi’s
      significant bank entities, such as Citibank, N.A.; and

(iii)

other
      entities.

At an
aggregate level, Citigroup’s goal is to ensure that there is sufficient funding
in amount and tenor to ensure that aggregate liquidity resources are available
for these entities. The liquidity framework requires that entities
be

self-sufficient or net
providers of liquidity, including in conditions established under their
designated stress tests, and have excess cash capital.

Citi’s primary
sources of funding include (i) deposits via Citi’s bank subsidiaries, which
continue to be Citi’s most stable and lowest cost source of long-term funding,
(ii) long-term debt (including long-term collateralized financings) issued at
the non-bank level and certain bank subsidiaries, and (iii) stockholders’
equity. These sources are supplemented by short-term borrowings, primarily in
the form of secured financing transactions (securities loaned or sold under
agreements to repurchase, or repos), and commercial paper at the non-bank
level.

As referenced above, Citigroup
works to ensure that the structural tenor of these funding sources is
sufficiently long in relation to the tenor of its asset base. The key goal of
Citi’s asset-liability management is to ensure that there is excess tenor in the
liability structure so as to provide excess liquidity to fund the assets. The
excess liquidity resulting from a longer-term tenor profile can effectively
offset potential decreases in liquidity that may occur under stress. This excess
funding is held in the form of aggregate liquidity resources, as described
below.

As
set forth in the table above, Citigroup’s aggregate liquidity resources totaled
$405.5 billion at December 31, 2011, compared with $426.8 billion at December
31, 2010. These amounts are as of period-end and may increase or decrease
intra-period in the ordinary course of business. During the quarter ended
December 31, 2011, the intra-quarter amounts did not fluctuate materially from
the quarter-end amounts noted above.

At December 31, 2011, Citigroup’s non-bank aggregate liquidity resources
totaled $98.4 billion, compared with $94.5 billion at December 31, 2010. This
amount included unencumbered liquid securities and cash held in Citi’s U.S. and
non-U.S. broker-dealer entities.

Citigroup’s significant bank entities had approximately $200.2 billion of
aggregate liquidity resources as of December 31, 2011. This amount included
$70.7 billion of cash on deposit with major central banks (including the U.S.
Federal Reserve Bank, European Central Bank, Bank of England, Swiss National
Bank, Bank of Japan, the Monetary Authority of Singapore and the Hong Kong
Monetary Authority), compared with $77.4 billion at

December 31, 2010. The
significant bank entities’ liquidity resources also included unencumbered highly
liquid government and government-backed securities. These securities are
available-for-sale or secured funding through private markets or by pledging to
the major central banks. The liquidity value of these liquid securities was
$129.5 billion at December 31, 2011, compared with $145.3 billion at December
31, 2010. As shown in the table above, overall, liquidity at Citi’s significant
bank entities was down at December 31, 2011, as compared to December 31, 2010,
as Citi deployed some of its excess bank liquidity into loan growth within
Citicorp (see “Balance Sheet Review” above) and paid down long-term bank
debt.

Citi estimates that its other
entities and subsidiaries held approximately $106.9 billion in aggregate
liquidity resources as of December 31, 2011. This included $27.6 billion of cash
on deposit with major central banks and $79.3 billion of unencumbered liquid
securities. Including these amounts, Citi’s aggregate liquidity resources as of
December 31, 2011 were approximately $405.5 billion.


Further, Citi’s summary of aggregate liquidity resources above does not
include additional potential liquidity in the form of Citigroup’s borrowing
capacity at the U.S. Federal Reserve Bank discount window and from the various
Federal Home Loan Banks (FHLB), which is maintained by pledged collateral to all
such banks. Citi also maintains additional liquidity available in the form of
diversified high grade non-government securities.

In general, Citigroup can freely fund legal
entities within its bank vehicles. In addition, Citigroup’s bank subsidiaries,
including Citibank, N.A., can lend to the Citigroup parent and broker-dealer
entities in accordance with Section 23A of the Federal Reserve Act. As of
December 31, 2011, the amount available for lending to these non-bank entities
under Section 23A was approximately $20.4 billion, provided the funds are
collateralized appropriately.

Deposits

Citi continued to focus on maintaining a
geographically diverse retail and corporate deposits base that stood at $866
billion at December 31, 2011, as compared with $845 billion at December 31,
2010. The $21 billion increase in deposits year-over-year was largely due to
higher deposit volumes in

Global
Consumer Banking

and

Transaction
Services

. These increases were
partially offset by a decrease in deposits in Citi Holdings year-over-year,
while deposits in

Securities and
Banking

were relatively flat.
Compared to the prior quarter, deposits increased in

Global Consumer Banking, Securities and
Banking

and

Transaction Services

. Citi grew deposits year-over-year in all regions
as customers continued a “flight to quality” given the market environment,
including increases in Europe and

North America

in the
fourth quarter of 2011. As of December 31, 2011, approximately 60% of Citi’s
deposits were located outside of the United States.

Deposits can be interest-bearing or
non-interest-bearing. Citi had $866 billion of deposits at December 31, 2011; of
those, $177 billion were non-interest-bearing, compared to $133 billion at
December 31, 2010. The remainder, or $689 billion, was interest-bearing,
compared to $712 billion at December 31, 2010.

While Citi’s deposits have grown year over year,
Citi’s overall cost of funds on deposits decreased, reflecting the low rate
environment as well as Citi’s ability to lower price points that widens its
margins given the high levels of customer liquidity while still remaining
competitive. Citi’s average rate on total deposits was 0.96% at December 31,
2011, compared with 0.99% at December 31, 2010. Excluding the impact of the
higher FDIC assessment effective beginning in the second quarter of 2011 and
deposit insurance, the average rate on Citi’s total deposits was 0.80% at
December 31, 2011, compared with 0.86% at December 31, 2010. As interest rates
rise, however, Citi expects to see pressure on these rates.

In addition, the composition of Citi’s
deposits shifted significantly year-over-year. Specifically, time deposits,
where rates are fixed for the term of the deposit and have generally lower
margins, became a smaller proportion of the deposit base, whereas operating
accounts became a larger proportion of deposits. As defined by Citigroup,
operating accounts consist of accounts such as checking and savings accounts for
individuals, as well as cash management accounts for corporations, and, in
Citi’s experience, provide wider margins and exhibit retentive behavior. During
2011, operating account deposits grew across most of Citi’s deposit-taking
businesses, including retail, the private bank and

Transaction Services

. Operating accounts represented 75% of Citicorp’s
deposit base as of December 31, 2011, compared to 70% as of December 31, 2010
and 63% at December 31, 2009.

Long-Term Debt

Long-term debt (generally defined as original
maturities of one year or more) is an important funding source, primarily for
the non-bank entities, because of its multi-year maturity structure. The
weighted average maturities of structural long-term debt (as defined in note 1
to the long-term debt issuances and maturities table below), issued by
Citigroup, CFI, CGMHI and Citibank, N.A., excluding trust preferred securities,
was approximately 7.1 years at December 31, 2011, compared to approximately 6.2
years as of December 31, 2010. At December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010,
overall long-term debt outstanding for Citigroup was as follows:

      are reflected in the table above.

Includes long-term
      debt related to consolidated variable interest entities (VIEs) of
      approximately $50.5 billion and $69.7 billion, respectively, at December
      31, 2011 and December 31, 2010. The majority of these VIEs relate to the
      Citibank Credit Card Master Trust and the Citibank OMNI Master
      Trust.

(3)

Of this amount,
      approximately $38.0 billion maturing in 2012 is guaranteed by the FDIC
      under the Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program
  (TLGP).

As
set forth in the table above, Citi’s overall long-term debt has decreased by
approximately $58 billion year-over-year. In the non-bank, the year-over-year
decrease was primarily due to TLGP run-off. In the bank entities,
the decrease also included TLGP run-off, FHLB reductions, and the maturing of
credit card securitization debt, particularly as Citi has grown its overall
deposit base. Citi currently expects a continued decline in its overall
long-term debt over 2012, particularly within its bank entities.
Given its liquidity resources as of December 31, 2011, Citi may
consider opportunities to repurchase its long-term debt, pursuant to open market
purchases, tender offers or other means.

Long-term debt issuances for all
      periods in the table above reflect Citi’s structural long-term debt
      issuances. Structural long-term debt is a non-GAAP measure. Citi defines
      structural long-term debt as its long-term debt (original maturities of
      one year or more), excluding certain structured notes, such as
      equity-linked and credit-linked notes, with early redemption features
      effective within one year. Citigroup believes that the structural
      long-term debt measure provides useful information to its investors as it
      excludes long-term debt that could in fact be redeemed by the holders
      thereof within one year. Long-term debt maturities for all periods reflect
      the total amount of senior and subordinated long-term debt and trust
      preferred securities.

During 2011 and 2010, Citi issued a total of $7.5
      billion of senior debt pursuant to the remarketing of the trust preferred
      securities held by ADIA.

Includes $0.5 billion of
      long-term FHLB issuance in the first quarter of 2011 and $5.5 billion in

As
set forth in the table above, Citi currently estimates its long-term debt
maturing during 2012 to be $60.6 billion (which excludes maturities relating to
local country, securitizations and FHLB), of which $38.0 billion is TLGP that
Citi does not expect to refinance. Given the current status of its liquidity
resources and continued asset reductions in Citi Holdings, Citi currently
expects to refinance approximately $15 billion to $20 billion of long-term debt
during 2012. However, Citi continually reviews its funding and liquidity needs
and may adjust its expected issuances due to market conditions, including the
continued uncertainty resulting from certain European market concerns, among
other factors.

Secured Financing Transactions and
Short-Term Borrowings

As
referenced above, Citi supplements its primary sources of funding with
short-term borrowings (generally defined as original maturities of less than one
year). Short-term borrowings generally include (i) secured financing (securities
loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase, or repos) and (ii) short-term
borrowings consisting of commercial paper and borrowings from the FHLB and other
market participants. The following table contains the year-end, average and
maximum month-end amounts for the following respective short-term borrowings
categories at the end of each of the three prior fiscal
years.

Secured Financing
Transactions

Secured financing
is primarily conducted through Citi’s broker-dealer subsidiaries to facilitate
customer matched-book activity and to efficiently fund a portion of the trading
inventory. As of December 31, 2011, secured financing was $198 billion and
averaged approximately $220 billion during the year. Secured financing at
December 31, 2011 increased year over year by approximately $9 billion from $190
billion at December 31, 2010.

Commercial
Paper

At December 31, 2011 and
December 31, 2010, commercial paper outstanding for Citigroup’s non-bank
entities and significant bank entities, respectively, was as follows:

19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on
Citigroup’s outstanding long-term debt and short-term borrowings.

Liquidity Risk
Management

Liquidity risk is
the risk of a financial institution’s inability to meet its obligations in a
timely manner. Management of liquidity risk at Citi is the responsibility of the
Citigroup Treasurer with oversight from senior management through Citi’s Finance
and Asset and Liability Committee (FinALCO). For additional information on FinALCO
and Citi’s liquidity management, see “Capital Resources – Overview”
above.

Citigroup operates under a centralized treasury model where the overall
balance sheet is managed by Citigroup Treasury through Global Franchise
Treasurers and Regional Treasurers. Day-to-day liquidity and funding are managed
by treasurers at the country and business level and are monitored by Citigroup
Treasury and independent risk management.

Liquidity Measures and Stress
Testing

Citi uses multiple
measures in monitoring its liquidity, including liquidity ratios, stress testing
and liquidity limits, each as described below.

Liquidity
Measures

In broad terms, the
structural liquidity ratio, defined as the sum of deposits, long-term debt and
stockholders’ equity as a percentage of total assets, measures whether Citi’s
asset base is funded by sufficiently long-dated liabilities. Citi’s structural
liquidity ratio was 73% at December 31, 2011 and 73% at December 31,
2010.

Internally, Citi also
utilizes cash capital to measure and monitor its ability to fund the
structurally illiquid portion of the balance sheet, on a specific
product-by-product basis. While cash capital is a methodology generally used by
financial institutions to provide a maturity structure matching assets and
liabilities, there is a lack of standardization in this area and specific
product-by-product assumptions vary by firm. Cash capital measures the amount of
long-term funding—core deposits, long-term debt and equity—available to fund
illiquid assets. Illiquid assets generally include loans (net of securitization
adjustments), securities haircuts and other assets (i.e., goodwill, intangibles
and fixed assets). As of December 31, 2011, based on Citi’s internal measures,
both the non-bank and the aggregate bank subsidiaries had excess cash
capital.

As part of Basel III, the
Basel Committee proposed two new liquidity measurements (for an additional
discussion of Basel III, see “Capital Resources—Regulatory Capital Standards”
above). Specifically, as proposed, the Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) is
designed to ensure banking organizations maintain an adequate level of
unencumbered cash and high quality unencumbered assets that can be converted
into cash to meet liquidity needs. The LCR must be at least 100%, and is
proposed to be effective beginning January 1, 2015. While the U.S. regulators
have not yet provided final rules or guidance with respect to the LCR, based on
its current understanding of the LCR requirements, Citi believes it is in
compliance with the LCR as of December 31, 2011.

In addition to the LCR, the Basel Committee
proposed a Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR) designed to promote the medium- and
long-term funding of assets and activities over a one-year time horizon. It is
Citi’s understanding, however, that this proposed metric is under review by the
Basel Committee and may be further revised.

Moreover, in January 2012, the Federal Reserve
Board proposed rules to implement the enhanced prudential standards for
systemically important financial institutions, as required by the Dodd-Frank
Act. The proposed rules include new requirements for liquidity management and
corporate governance related thereto. Citi continues to review these proposed
rules and any potential impact they may have on its liquidity management
practices.


Stress
Testing

Liquidity stress
testing is performed for each of Citi’s major entities, operating subsidiaries
and/or countries. Stress testing and scenario analyses are intended to quantify
the potential impact of a liquidity event on the balance sheet and liquidity
position, and to identify viable funding alternatives that can be utilized.
These scenarios include assumptions about significant changes in key funding
sources, market triggers (such as credit ratings), potential uses of funding and
political and economic conditions in certain countries. These conditions include
standard and stressed market conditions as well as firm-specific
events.

A
wide range of liquidity stress tests are important for monitoring purposes. Some
span liquidity events over a full year, some may cover an intense stress period
of one month, and still other time frames may be appropriate. These potential
liquidity events are useful to ascertain potential mismatches between liquidity
sources and uses over a variety of horizons

(overnight, one week, two
weeks, one month, three months, one year), and liquidity limits are set
accordingly. To monitor the liquidity of a unit, those stress tests and
potential mismatches may be calculated with varying frequencies, with several
important tests performed daily.

Given the range of potential stresses, Citi
maintains a series of contingency funding plans on a consolidated basis as well
as for individual entities. These plans specify a wide range of readily
available actions that are available in a variety of adverse market conditions,
or idiosyncratic disruptions.

Credit Ratings

Citigroup’s ability to access the capital markets
and other sources of funds, as well as the cost of these funds and its ability
to maintain certain deposits, is partially dependent on its credit ratings. See
also “Risk Factors—Market and Economic Risks” below. The table below indicates
the ratings for Citigroup, Citibank, N.A. and Citigroup Global Markets Inc. (a
broker-dealer subsidiary of Citi) as of December 31, 2011.

Recent Rating
Changes

On September 21, 2011,
Moody’s concluded its review of government support assumptions for Citi and
certain peers and upgraded Citi’s unsupported “Baseline Credit Assessment”
rating and affirmed Citi’s long-term debt ratings at both the Citibank and
Citigroup levels. At the same time, however, Moody’s changed the short-term
rating of Citigroup (the parent holding company) to ‘P-2’ from ‘P-1’. On
November 29, 2011, following its global review of the banking industry under
S&P’s revised bank criteria, S&P downgraded the issuer credit rating for
Citigroup Inc. to ‘A-/A-2’ from ‘A/A-1’, and Citibank, N.A. to ‘A/A-1’ from
‘A+/A-1’. These ratings continue to receive two notches of uplift, reflecting
S&P’s view that the U.S. government is supportive to Citi. On December 15,
2011, Fitch announced revised ratings resulting from its review of government
support assumptions for 17 U.S. banks. The resolution of this review resulted in
a revision to the issuer credit ratings of Citigroup and Citibank, N.A. from
‘A+’ to ‘A’ and the short-term issuer rating from ‘F1+’ to
‘F1’.

The
above mentioned rating changes did not have a material impact on Citi’s funding
profile. Furthermore, forecasts of potential funding loss under various stress
scenarios, including the above mentioned rating downgrades, did not
occur.

Potential Impact of Ratings
Downgrades

Ratings downgrades
by Fitch, Moody’s or S&P could have material impacts on funding and
liquidity in the form of cash obligations, reduced funding capacity and
collateral triggers.

Most recently, on February 15, 2012, Moody’s announced a review of 17
banks and securities firms with global capital markets operations, including
Citi, for possible downgrade during the first half of 2012. Moody’s stated this
review was to assess adverse market trends, which it believes are weakening the
credit profiles of many rated banks globally. It is not certain what the results
of this review will be, or if Citigroup or Citibank, N.A. will be
impacted.


Because of the current credit ratings of
Citigroup, a one-notch downgrade of its senior debt/long-term rating may or may not impact Citigroup’s commercial
paper/short-term rating by one notch. As of December 31, 2011, Citi estimates that a one-notch downgrade of the senior
debt/long-term rating of Citigroup could result in loss of funding due to derivative triggers and additional margin
requirements of $1.3 billion and a one-notch downgrade by Fitch of Citigroup’s commercial paper/short-term rating could
result in the assumed loss of unsecured commercial paper of $6.4 billion. Other funding sources, such as secured financing
transactions and other margin requirements, for which there are no explicit triggers, could also be adversely
affected.

Citi
currently believes that a more severe ratings downgrade scenario, such as a two-notch downgrade of the senior debt/long-term
rating of Citigroup, could result in an additional $0.9 billion in funding requirements in the form of cash obligations
and collateral as of December 31, 2011. Other funding sources, such as secured financing transactions and other margin requirements, for which there are no explicit triggers, could also be adversely affected.

As
set forth under “Aggregate Liquidity Resources” above, the aggregate liquidity resources of
Citigroup’s non-bank entities stood at approximately $98.4 billion as of December 31, 2011, in part as a contingency for
such an event, and a broad range of mitigating actions are currently included in Citigroup’s detailed contingency
funding plans. These mitigating factors include, but are not limited to, accessing surplus funding capacity from existing
clients, tailoring levels of secured lending, adjusting the size of select trading books, and collateralized borrowings from
significant bank subsidiaries.

Further, as of December 31, 2011, a
one-notch downgrade of the senior  debt/long-term ratings of Citibank, N.A. could result in an approximate $2.4  billion
funding requirement in the form of collateral and cash obligations.  Because of the current credit ratings of Citibank, N.A.,
a one-notch downgrade  of its senior debt/long-term rating is unlikely to have any impact on its  commercial
paper/short-term rating. However, a two-notch downgrade by Moody’s could have an  adverse impact on Citibank,
N.A.’s commercial paper/short-term rating. A  two-notch downgrade by Moody’s could result in additional funding
requirements in the form of cash obligations and collateral estimated at $0.8 billion as of December 31,  2011. As of
December 31, 2011, Citibank, N.A. had liquidity commitments of $27.9 billion to asset-backed commercial paper conduits, which
could also be impacted by a two-notch downgrade by Moody’s, including $14.9 billion of commitments to consolidated conduits,
and $13.0 billion of commitments to unconsolidated conduits as referenced in Note 22 to  the Consolidated Financial
Statements. Additionally, Citibank, N.A. had $11.2 billion of funding programs related to the municipals markets that could
be impacted by such a downgrade, of which $10.8 billion is principally reflected as commitments within Note 28 to  the
Consolidated Financial Statements.

Citi’s
significant bank entities and other entities, including Citibank, N.A., had aggregate liquidity resources of
approximately $307.1 billion at December 31, 2011, in part as a contingency for such an event and also have detailed
contingency funding plans that encompass a broad range of mitigating actions. These mitigating actions include, but are not
limited to, selling or financing highly liquid government securities, tailoring levels of secured lending, repricing or
reducing certain commitments to commercial paper conduits, exercising reimbursement agreements for the municipal programs
mentioned above, adjusting the size of select trading books, reducing loan originations and renewals, raising additional
deposits, or borrowing from the FHLB or other central banks. Citi believes these mitigating actions could substantially
reduce the funding and liquidity risk of such a downgrade.


OFF-BALANCE-SHEET
ARRANGEMENTS

Citigroup enters
into various types of off-balance-sheet arrangements in the ordinary course of
business. Citi’s involvement in these arrangements can take many different
forms, including without limitation:

purchasing or retaining residual and
  other interests in special purpose

entities, such as credit card receivables and mortgage-backed and
  other

asset-backed securitization
  entities;

holding senior and subordinated debt,
  interests in limited and general

partnerships and equity interests in other unconsolidated entities;
  and

providing guarantees,
  indemnifications, loan commitments, letters of credit and representations and
  warranties.

Citi
enters into these arrangements for a variety of business purposes. These
securitization entities offer investors access to specific cash flows and risks
created through the securitization process. The securitization arrangements also
assist Citi and Citi’s customers in monetizing their financial assets at more
favorable rates than Citi or the customers could otherwise
obtain.

The table below
presents a discussion of Citi’s various off-balance-sheet arrangements may be
found in this Form 10-K. In addition, see “Significant Accounting Policies and
Significant Estimates – Securitizations” below, as well as Notes 1, 22 and 28 to
the Consolidated Financial Statements.

CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS

The following table includes
information on Citigroup’s contractual obligations, as specified and aggregated
pursuant to SEC requirements.

Purchase obligations consist of those obligations to purchase goods or
services that are enforceable and legally binding on Citi. For presentation
purposes, purchase obligations are included in the table below through the
termination date of the respective agreements, even if the contract is
renewable. Many of the purchase agreements for goods or services include clauses
that would allow Citigroup to cancel the agreement with specified notice;
however, that impact is not included in the table below (unless Citigroup has
already notified the counterparty of its intention to terminate the
agreement).

Other liabilities

reflected on Citigroup’s Consolidated Balance Sheet include obligations for
goods and services that have already been received, uncertain tax positions and
other liabilities that have been incurred and will ultimately be paid in cash.

Excluded from the following table are obligations that are generally
short-term in nature, including deposits and securities sold under agreements to
repurchase, or repos (see “Capital Resources and Liquidity

—

Funding and Liquidity” above for a discussion of these obligations). The
table also excludes certain insurance and investment contracts subject to
mortality and morbidity risks or without defined maturities, such that the
timing of payments and withdrawals is uncertain. The liabilities related to
these insurance and investment contracts are included as
