MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION

AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

As described further throughout this Executive Summary, Citi’s 2019 results reflected steady progress toward improving its profitability and returns, despite an uncertain revenue environment, as strong client engagement drove balanced growth across businesses and geographies:

•

Citi had solid underlying revenue growth in every region in

Global Consumer Banking

(

GCB)

, excluding the impact of foreign currency translation into U.S. dollars for reporting purposes (FX translation), as well as pretax gains on sale in 2018 of approximately $150 million on the Hilton portfolio in

North America GCB

and approximately $250 million on an asset management business in

Latin America GCB

.

•

Citi had balanced performance across the

Institutional Clients Group (ICG)

, with solid results in fixed income markets, treasury and trade solutions, investment banking and the private bank, while equity markets revenues were negatively impacted by a challenging environment.

•

Citi demonstrated strong expense discipline, resulting in expenses that were largely unchanged from the prior year, as well as positive operating leverage, even as Citi continued to make investments in the franchise. Citi’s positive operating leverage and continued credit discipline resulted in an improvement in pretax earnings.

•

Citi reported broad-based loan and deposit growth across

GCB

and

ICG

.

•

Citi returned $22.3 billion of capital to its shareholders in the form of common stock repurchases and dividends; Citi repurchased approximately 264 million common shares, contributing to a 9% reduction in average outstanding common shares from the prior year.

•

Despite continued progress in capital returns to shareholders, Citi’s key regulatory capital metrics remained strong.

While global growth has continued and the underlying macroeconomic environment remains largely positive, economic forecasts for 2020 have been lowered and various economic, political and other risks and uncertainties could create a more volatile operating environment and impact Citi’s businesses and future results. For a discussion of risks and uncertainties that could impact Citi’s businesses, results of operations and financial condition during 2020, see each respective business’s results of operations, “Risk Factors” and “Managing Global Risk” below. Despite these risks and uncertainties, Citi intends to continue to build on the progress made during 2019 with a focus on further optimizing its performance to benefit shareholders, while remaining flexible and adapting to market and economic conditions as they develop.

2019 Results Summary

Citigroup

Citigroup reported net income of $19.4 billion, or $8.04 per share, compared to net income of $18.0 billion, or $6.68 per share, in the prior year. Net income increased 8%, primarily driven by a lower effective tax rate and higher revenues, partially offset by higher cost of credit, while expenses were largely unchanged. Earnings per share increased 20%, driven by higher net income and the 9% reduction in average shares outstanding due to the common stock repurchases. Results in 2019 included a net tax benefit of approximately $0.35 per share related to discrete tax items, including an approximate $0.6 billion benefit from reductions in Citi’s valuation allowance related to its deferred tax assets, primarily recorded in

Corporate/Other

(see “Significant Accounting Policies and Significant Estimates—Income Taxes” below).

Citigroup revenues of $74.3 billion increased 2%, or 4% excluding the impact of FX translation and the gains on sale in the prior year (see “Executive Summary” above), reflecting higher revenues across

GCB

and

ICG

, partially offset by lower revenues in

Corporate/Other

.

Citigroup’s end-of-period loans increased 2% to $699 billion. Excluding the impact of FX translation, Citigroup end-of-period loans also grew 2%, as 3% aggregate growth in

GCB

and

ICG

was partially offset by the continued wind-down of legacy assets in

Corporate/Other

. Citigroup’s end-of-period deposits increased 6% to $1.1 trillion. Excluding the impact of FX translation, Citigroup’s end-of-period deposits also grew 6%, primarily driven by 7% growth in

GCB

and 6% growth in

ICG

, excluding the impact of FX translation. (Citi’s results of operations excluding the gains on sale as well as the impact of FX translation are non-GAAP financial measures. Citi believes the presentation of its results of operations excluding the impact of FX translation and gains on sale provides a meaningful depiction for investors of the underlying fundamentals of its businesses.)

Expenses

Citigroup operating expenses of $42.0 billion were largely unchanged, as efficiency savings and the wind-down of legacy assets offset volume-driven growth and continued investments in the franchise. Operating expenses in

GCB

and

Corporate/Other

were down 1% and 5%, respectively, while

ICG

operating expenses increased 2%.

Cost of Credit

Citi’s total provisions for credit losses and for benefits and claims of $8.4 billion increased 11%. The increase was primarily driven by higher net credit losses in both Citi-branded cards and Citi retail services in

North America GCB

,

as well as higher overall cost of credit in

ICG

.

Net credit losses of $7.8 billion increased 9%. Consumer net credit losses of $7.4 billion increased 7%, primarily reflecting volume growth and seasoning in the

North America

cards portfolios. Corporate net credit losses increased to $392


million from $205 million in the prior year, reflecting a normalization in credit trends.

For additional information on Citi’s consumer and corporate credit costs and allowance for loan losses, see each respective business’s results of operations and “Credit Risk” below.

Capital

Citigroup’s Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) Capital ratio was 11.8% as of December 31, 2019, compared to 11.9% as of December 31, 2018, based on the Basel III Standardized Approach for determining risk-weighted assets. The decline in the ratio primarily reflected the return of capital to common shareholders, partially offset by net income and a reduction in risk-weighted assets. Citigroup’s Supplementary Leverage ratio as of December 31, 2019 was 6.2%, compared to 6.4% as of December 31, 2018. For additional information on Citi’s capital ratios and related components, see “Capital Resources” below.

Global Consumer Banking

GCB

net income of $5.7 billion increased 7%. Excluding the impact of FX translation, net income increased 8%, driven by higher revenues, partially offset by higher cost of credit.

GCB

operating expenses of $17.6 billion decreased 1%. Excluding the impact of FX translation, expenses were largely unchanged, as efficiency savings offset continued investments in the franchise and volume-driven growth.

GCB

revenues of $33.0 billion increased 2%. Excluding the impact of FX translation and the gains on sale in both

North America GCB

and

Latin America GCB

in the prior year, revenues increased 4%, driven by growth in all three regions.

North America GCB

revenues of $20.4 billion increased 3%, and 4% excluding the gain on sale in the prior year, primarily driven by growth in Citi-branded cards and Citi retail services, partially offset by lower retail banking revenues. In

North America GCB

,

Citi-branded cards revenues of $9.2 billion increased 6%, and 8% excluding the gain on sale in the prior year, primarily reflecting volume growth and spread expansion. Citi retail services

revenues of $6.7 billion increased 2%, primarily driven by organic loan growth and the full-year benefit of the L.L.Bean acquisition. Retail banking revenues of $4.5 billion decreased 2%, as the benefit of stronger deposit volumes was more than offset by lower deposit spreads.

North America GCB

average deposits of $153 billion increased 3%, average retail banking loans of $49 billion increased 3% and assets under management of $72 billion grew 20% (including the benefit of market movements). Average Citi-branded card loans of $90 billion increased 3%, while Citi-branded card purchase sales of $368 billion increased 7%. Average Citi retail services loans of $50 billion increased 3%, while Citi retail services purchase sales of $88 billion increased 2%. For additional information on the results of operations of

North America GCB

” below.

International

GCB

revenues (consisting of

Latin America GCB

and

Asia GCB

(which includes the results of operations in certain

EMEA

countries)), of $12.6 billion increased 1%.

Excluding the impact of FX translation and the gain on sale in

Latin America GCB

in the prior year, international

GCB

revenues increased 4%. On this basis,

Latin America GCB

revenues increased 4%, primarily driven by an increase in cards revenues and improved deposit spreads.

Asia GCB

revenues increased 4%, primarily reflecting higher deposit, investment and cards revenues. For additional information on the results of operations of

Latin America GCB

and

Asia GCB

in 2019, including the impact of FX translation,

see “

Global Consumer Banking—Latin America GCB

” and “

” below.

Year-over-year, excluding the impact of FX translation, international

GCB

average deposits of $124 billion increased 5%, average retail banking loans of $71 billion increased 4%, assets under management of $104 billion increased 16%(including the benefit of market movements), average card loans of $25 billion increased 3% and card purchase sales of $108 billion increased 6%.

Institutional Clients Group

ICG

net income of $12.9 billion

increased 3%, primarily driven by higher revenues and a lower effective tax rate, partially offset by higher expenses and cost of credit.

ICG

operating expenses increased 2% to $22.2 billion, primarily driven by higher compensation costs, investments and volume-driven growth, partially offset by efficiency savings.

ICG

revenues of $39.3 billion increased 3%, reflecting a 1% increase in

Banking

revenues and a 5% increase in

Markets and securities services

revenues. The increase in

Banking

revenues included the impact of $432 million of losses on loan hedges within corporate lending, compared to gains of $45 million in the prior year.

Banking

revenues of $21.9 billion (excluding the impact of gains (losses) on loan hedges within corporate lending) increased 3%, driven by solid growth in treasury and trade solutions, investment banking and the private bank. Investment banking revenues of $5.2 billion increased 4%, as strength in debt underwriting was partially offset by lower revenues in both equity underwriting and advisory. Advisory revenues decreased 3% to $1.3 billion, equity underwriting revenues decreased 2% to $973 million and debt underwriting revenues increased 10% to $3.0 billion.

Treasury and trade solutions revenues of $10.3 billion increased 4%, and 6% excluding the impact of FX translation, reflecting strong client engagement and volume growth, partially offset by the impact of lower interest rates. Private bank revenues of $3.5 billion increased 2%, driven by higher lending and deposit volumes as well as higher investment activity, partially offset by spread compression. Corporate lending revenues declined 16% to $2.5 billion. Excluding the impact of gains (losses) on loan hedges, corporate lending revenues were largely unchanged, as growth in the commercial loan portfolio was offset by lower volumes in the rest of the portfolio.

Markets and securities services

revenues of $17.8 billion increased 5%, including a pretax gain of approximately $350 million on Citi’s investment in Tradeweb in the second quarter of 2019, recorded in fixed income markets.

Fixed income markets revenues of $12.9 billion increased 10%, reflecting


growth across rates and currencies as well as spread products, including the Tradeweb gain. Equity markets revenues of $2.9 billion decreased 15%, primarily driven by lower revenues across cash equities, derivatives and prime finance. Securities services revenues of $2.6 billion were largely unchanged, but increased 4% excluding the impact of FX translation, reflecting higher net interest revenue due to higher deposits and higher interest rates, particularly in emerging markets, as well as higher client volumes.

ICG

in 2019, see “

Institutional Clients Group

” below.

Corporate/Other

Corporate/Other

net income was $801 million, compared to $186 million in the prior year, primarily reflecting the benefit of discrete tax items. Operating expenses of $2.2 billion decreased 5%, as the continued wind-down of legacy assets more than offset higher infrastructure costs.

vs.


Net income

increased 4%, as higher revenues and lower expenses were partially offset by higher cost of credit.

Revenues

increased 3%. Excluding the impact of the $150 million gain on the Hilton portfolio sale in the prior year, revenues increased 4%, reflecting higher revenues in Citi-branded cards and Citi retail services, partially offset by lower retail banking revenues.

Retail banking revenues decreased 2%, as the benefit of stronger deposit volumes was more than offset by lower deposit spreads. Average deposits increased 3%. Assets under management increased 20%, including the benefit of market movements. Citi expects that retail banking revenues will likely be impacted by the lower interest rate environment in the near term.

Cards revenues increased 4% (5% excluding the Hilton gain). In Citi-branded cards, revenues increased 6% (8% excluding the Hilton gain), primarily driven by volume growth and spread expansion. Average loans increased 3% and purchase sales increased 7%.

Citi retail services revenues increased 2%, primarily driven by organic loan growth and the full-year benefit of the L.L.Bean portfolio acquisition. Average loans increased 3% and purchase sales increased 2%.

Expenses

decreased 1%, as efficiency savings more than offset ongoing investments and higher volume-related expenses.

Provisions

increased 9%, primarily driven by higher net credit losses. Net credit losses increased 10%, driven by higher net credit losses in Citi-branded cards (up 10% to $2.9 billion) and Citi retail services (up 9% to $2.6 billion). The increase in net credit losses reflected volume growth and seasoning in both cards portfolios. The net loan loss reserve build increased 2%, reflecting volume growth and seasoning in both cards portfolios.

Net income

increased 13%, primarily reflecting lower cost of credit, partially offset by lower revenues.

Revenues

decreased 1%, including a gain on sale (approximately $250 million) of an asset management business in the prior year. Excluding the gain on sale, revenues increased 4%, reflecting higher revenues in both retail banking and cards.

Retail banking revenues decreased 4%. Excluding the gain on sale, retail banking revenues increased 3%, as improved deposit spreads were partially offset by lower average loans (down 3%), reflecting the ongoing slowdown in overall economic growth and industry volumes in Mexico. Assets under management increased 13%, including the benefit of market movements, while average deposits were

largely unchanged, as clients transferred money to investments. Cards revenues increased 6%, primarily driven by continued volume growth, reflecting higher purchase sales (up 7%) and average loans (up 3%), as well as higher rates.

Expenses

were largely unchanged, as efficiency savings offset ongoing investment spending and volume-driven growth.

Provisions

decreased 13%, primarily driven by a modest net loan loss reserve release (compared to a net loan loss reserve build in the prior year) and lower net credit losses, reflecting lower volumes in retail banking.

Net income

increased 12%, primarily driven by higher revenues, partially offset by modestly higher cost of credit.

Revenues

Investment sales increased 8%, assets under management grew 17%, including the benefit of market movements, average deposits increased 6% and average loans increased 5%. Retail lending revenues declined 1%, as continued growth in personal loans was more than offset by lower mortgage revenues due to spread compression.

Expenses

were largely unchanged, as efficiency savings were offset by ongoing investment spending and volume-driven growth.

Provisions

increased 4%, as higher net credit losses reflecting volume growth and seasoning were partially offset by a lower net loan loss reserve build in the current year. Overall credit quality remained stable in the region.

INSTITUTIONAL CLIENTS GROUP

Institutional Clients Group (ICG)

includes

Banking

and

Markets and securities services

(for additional information on these businesses, see “Citigroup Segments” above).

ICG

provides corporate, institutional, public sector and high-net-worth clients around the world with a full range of wholesale banking products and services, including fixed income and equity sales and trading, foreign exchange, prime brokerage, derivative services, equity and fixed income research, corporate lending, investment banking and advisory services, private banking, cash management, trade finance and securities services.

ICG

transacts with clients in both cash instruments and derivatives, including fixed income, foreign currency, equity and commodity products.

ICG

revenue is generated primarily from fees and spreads associated with these activities.

ICG

earns fee income for assisting clients with transactional services and clearing and providing brokerage and investment banking services and other such activities. Such fees are recognized at the point in time when Citigroup’s performance under the terms of a contractual arrangement is completed, which is typically at the trade/execution date or closing of a transaction. Revenue generated from these activities is recorded in

Commissions and fees

and

Investment banking

. Revenue is also generated from assets under custody and administration, which is recognized as/when the associated promised service is satisfied, which normally occurs at the point in time the service is requested by the customer and provided by Citi. Revenue generated from these activities is primarily recorded in

Administration and other fiduciary fees

. For additional information on these various types of revenues, see Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

In addition, as a market maker,

ICG

facilitates transactions, including holding product inventory to meet client demand, and earns the differential between the price at which it buys and sells the products. These price differentials and the unrealized gains and losses on the inventory are recorded in

Principal transactions

. Mark-to-market gains and losses on certain credit derivatives (used to hedge the corporate loan portfolio) are also recorded in

Principal transactions

, (for additional information on

Principal transactions

revenue, see Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements).

Other

primarily includes realized gains and losses on available-for-sale (AFS) debt securities, gains and losses on equity securities not held in trading accounts and other non-recurring gains and losses. Interest income earned on assets held, less interest paid on long- and short-term debt and to customers on deposits, is recorded as

Net interest revenue

.

The amount and types of

Markets

revenues are impacted by a variety of interrelated factors, including market liquidity; changes in market variables such as interest rates, foreign exchange rates, equity prices, commodity prices and credit spreads, as well as their implied volatilities; investor confidence and other macroeconomic conditions. Assuming all other market conditions do not change, increases in client activity levels or bid/offer spreads generally result in increases in revenues. However, changes in market conditions can

significantly impact client activity levels, bid/offer spreads and the fair value of product inventory. For example, a decrease in market liquidity may increase bid/offer spreads, decrease client activity levels and widen credit spreads on product inventory positions.

Revenue Details

(1)

Credit derivatives are used to economically hedge a portion of the corporate loan portfolio that includes both accrual loans and loans at fair value. Gains (losses) on loan hedges include the mark-to-market on the credit derivatives and the mark-to-market on the loans in the portfolio that are at fair value. The fixed premium costs of these hedges are netted against the corporate lending revenues to reflect the cost of credit protection. Citigroup’s results of operations excluding the impact of gains (losses) on loan hedges are non-GAAP financial measures.

Non-interest revenues increased due to higher corporate and investor client activity as well as improved market activity, particularly in rates and spread products. The increase in non-interest revenues was partially offset by a decline in net interest revenues, reflecting a change in the mix of trading positions in support of client activity as well as higher funding costs, given the higher interest rate environment in the first half of the year.

Rates and currencies revenues increased 9%, primarily driven by higher G10 rates and currencies revenues in

North America

. The increase in revenues was driven by higher client activity as well as an improved trading environment, particularly in flow trading and financing products. This increase in revenues was partially offset by lower structured products revenues, reflecting a challenging trading environment.

•

Equity markets

revenues decreased 15%, driven by lower revenues across cash equities, equity derivatives and prime finance, particularly in

North America

and

Cash equities revenues decreased largely due to lower client volumes. Despite strong corporate and investor client activity, equity derivatives revenues decreased due to the impact of a less favorable trading environment, given lower market volatility, as well as a comparison to a strong prior year. The decline in prime finance revenues was primarily driven by lower client activity and lower financing balances. Non-interest revenues decreased, primarily driven by lower principal transaction and commissions and fee revenues, due to lower client activity and a less favorable trading environment, as well as a change in the mix of trading positions in support of client activity.

particularly in emerging markets, as well as higher client activity.

Expenses

increased 2%, as higher compensation, volume-related expenses and continued investments were partially offset by efficiency savings and a benefit from FX translation.

Provisions

increased $348 million, driven by an increase in net credit losses of $186 million, and an increase in the net loan loss reserve build of $162 million. Both the increase in net credit losses and the higher loan loss reserve build largely reflected a normalization of credit trends.

Net income

was $801 million, compared to net income of $186 million in the prior year. Net income was largely driven by an income tax benefit of $886 million, compared to an income tax benefit of $88 million in the prior year. The increase in the income tax benefit primarily reflected the reduction in the valuation allowance related to Citi’s deferred tax assets and a pretax loss in the current year (see “Significant Accounting Policies and Significant Estimates—Income Taxes” below).

The pretax loss was largely driven by lower revenues from legacy assets, partially offset by higher gains on investments. The pretax loss also reflected higher cost of credit, partially offset by lower expenses.

Revenues

decreased 8%, driven by the continued wind-down of legacy assets, partially offset by gains on investments.

Expenses

decreased 5%, as the continued wind-down of legacy assets was partially offset by higher infrastructure costs.

Provisions

increased $127 million to a net benefit of $75 million, primarily due to a lower net loan loss reserve release, partially offset by lower net credit losses.

Citi expects that

Corporate/Other

results will likely be impacted by ongoing investments in infrastructure and controls as well as lower interest rates and lower investment gains during 2020.


OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS

Citigroup enters into various types of off-balance sheet arrangements in the ordinary course of business. Citi’s involvement in these arrangements can take many different forms, including without limitation:

•

purchasing or retaining residual and other interests in unconsolidated special purpose entities, such as mortgage-backed and other asset-backed securitization entities;

•

holding senior and subordinated debt, interests in limited and general partnerships and equity interests in other unconsolidated special purpose entities; and

•

providing guarantees, indemnifications, loan commitments, letters of credit and representations and warranties.

Citi enters into these arrangements for a variety of business purposes. For example, securitization arrangements offer investors access to specific cash flows and risks created through the securitization process. Securitization arrangements also assist Citi and its customers in monetizing their financial assets and securing financing at more favorable rates than Citi or the customers could otherwise obtain.

CAPITAL RESOURCES

Overview

Capital is used principally to support assets in Citi’s businesses and to absorb credit, market and operational losses. Citi primarily generates capital through earnings from its operating businesses. Citi may augment its capital through issuances of common stock, noncumulative perpetual preferred stock and equity issued through awards under employee benefit plans, among other issuances. Further, Citi’s capital levels may also be affected by changes in accounting and regulatory standards, as well as U.S. corporate tax laws and the impact of future events on Citi’s business results, such as changes in interest and foreign exchange rates, as well as business and asset dispositions.

During 2019, Citi returned a total of $22.3 billion of capital to common shareholders in the form of share repurchases (approximately 264 million common shares) and dividends.

Capital Management

Citi’s capital management framework is designed to ensure that Citigroup and its principal subsidiaries maintain sufficient capital consistent with each entity’s respective risk profile, management targets and all applicable regulatory standards and guidelines. Citi assesses its capital adequacy against a series of internal quantitative capital goals, designed to evaluate its capital levels in expected and stressed economic environments. Underlying these internal quantitative capital goals are strategic capital considerations, centered on preserving and building financial strength. The Citigroup Capital Committee, with oversight from the Risk Management Committee of Citigroup’s Board of Directors, has responsibility for Citi’s aggregate capital structure, including the capital assessment and planning process, which is integrated into Citi’s capital plan. Balance sheet management, including oversight of capital adequacy, for Citigroup’s subsidiaries is governed by each entity’s Asset and Liability Committee, where applicable.

Based on Citigroup’s current regulatory capital requirements, as well as consideration of potential future changes to the U.S. Basel III rules, management currently believes that a targeted Common Equity Tier 1 Capital ratio of approximately 11.5% represents the amount necessary to prudently operate and invest in Citi’s franchise, including when considering future growth plans, capital return projections and other factors that may impact Citi’s businesses. However, management may revise Citigroup’s targeted Common Equity Tier 1 Capital ratio in response to changing regulatory capital requirements as well as other relevant factors.

For additional information regarding Citi’s capital planning and stress testing exercises, see “Stress Testing Component of Capital Planning” below.

Current Regulatory Capital Standards

Citi is subject to regulatory capital standards issued by the Federal Reserve Board, which constitute the U.S. Basel III rules. These rules establish an integrated capital adequacy framework, encompassing both risk-based capital ratios and leverage ratios.

Risk-Based Capital Ratios

The U.S. Basel III rules set forth the composition of regulatory capital (including the application of regulatory capital adjustments and deductions), as well as two comprehensive methodologies (a Standardized Approach and Advanced Approaches) for measuring total risk-weighted assets. Total risk-weighted assets under the Advanced Approaches, which are primarily models based, include credit, market and operational risk-weighted assets. The Standardized Approach generally applies prescribed supervisory risk weights to broad categories of credit risk exposures. As a result, credit risk-weighted assets calculated under the Advanced Approaches are more risk sensitive than those calculated under the Standardized Approach. Market risk-weighted assets are currently calculated on a generally consistent basis under both approaches. The Standardized Approach excludes operational risk-weighted assets.

The U.S. Basel III rules establish stated minimum Common Equity Tier 1 Capital, Tier 1 Capital and Total Capital ratios for substantially all U.S. banking organizations, including Citi and Citibank, N.A. (Citibank). Moreover, these rules provide for both a fixed 2.5% Capital Conservation Buffer and, for Advanced Approaches banking organizations, such as Citi and Citibank, a discretionary Countercyclical Capital Buffer. These capital buffers would be available to absorb losses in advance of any potential impairment of regulatory capital below the stated minimum risk-based capital ratio requirements. Any breach of the buffers to absorb losses during periods of financial or economic stress would result in restrictions on earnings distributions (e.g., dividends, equity repurchases and discretionary executive bonuses), with the degree of such restrictions based upon the extent to which the buffers are breached. The Federal Reserve Board last voted to affirm the Countercyclical Capital Buffer amount at the current level of 0% in March 2019.

Further, the U.S. Basel III rules implement the “capital floor provision” of the so-called “Collins Amendment” of the Dodd-Frank Act, which requires Advanced Approaches

banking organizations to calculate each of the three risk-based capital ratios (Common Equity Tier 1 Capital, Tier 1 Capital and Total Capital) under both the U.S. Basel III Standardized Approach and the Advanced Approaches and comply with the lower of each of the resulting risk-based capital ratios.


GSIB Surcharge

The Federal Reserve Board imposes a risk-based capital surcharge upon U.S. bank holding companies that are identified as global systemically important bank holding companies (GSIBs), including Citi. The GSIB surcharge augments the Capital Conservation Buffer and, if invoked, any Countercyclical Capital Buffer.

Under the Federal Reserve Board’s rule, identification of a GSIB is based on the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision’s (Basel Committee) GSIB methodology, which primarily looks to five equally weighted broad categories of systemic importance: (i) size, (ii) interconnectedness, (iii) cross-jurisdictional activity, (iv) substitutability and (v) complexity. With the exception of size, each of the categories is composed of multiple indicators of equal weight, amounting to 12 indicators in total.

A U.S. bank holding company that is designated a GSIB is required, on an annual basis, to calculate a surcharge using two methods and is subject to the higher of the resulting two surcharges. The first method (“method 1”) is based on the Basel Committee’s GSIB methodology described above. Under the second method (“method 2”), the substitutability category is replaced with a quantitative measure intended to assess a GSIB’s reliance on short-term wholesale funding. In addition, method 1 incorporates relative measures of systemic importance across certain global banking organizations and a year-end spot foreign exchange rate, whereas method 2 uses fixed measures of systemic importance and application of an average foreign exchange rate over a three-year period. The GSIB surcharges calculated under both method 1 and method 2 are based on measures of systemic importance from the year immediately preceding that in which the GSIB surcharge calculations are being performed (e.g., the method 1 and method 2 GSIB surcharges to be calculated by December 31, 2020 will be based on 2019 systemic indicator data). Generally, Citi’s surcharge determined under method 2 will result in a higher surcharge than its surcharge determined under method 1.

Should a GSIB’s systemic importance change year-over-year such that it becomes subject to a higher surcharge, the higher surcharge would not become effective for a full year (e.g., a higher surcharge calculated by December 31, 2020 would not become effective until January 1, 2022). However, if a GSIB’s systemic importance changes such that the GSIB would be subject to a lower surcharge, the GSIB would be subject to the lower surcharge beginning with the next calendar year (e.g., a lower surcharge calculated by December 31, 2020 would become effective January 1, 2021).

The following table sets forth Citi’s GSIB surcharge as determined under method 1 and method 2 for


and


:

Citi’s GSIB surcharge effective for both


and


was 3.0%, as derived under the higher method 2 result. Citi’s GSIB surcharge effective for 2020 will remain unchanged at 3.0%, as derived under the higher method 2 result. Citi expects that its method 2 GSIB surcharge will continue to remain higher than its method 1 GSIB surcharge. Citi’s GSIB surcharge effective for 2021 will not exceed 3.0%, and Citi’s GSIB surcharge effective for 2022 is not expected to exceed 3.0%.

Transition Provisions

Generally, the U.S. Basel III rules contain several differing, largely multi-year transition provisions, with various “phase-ins” and “phase-outs.” With the exception of the non-grandfathered trust preferred securities, which do not fully phase-out of Tier 2 Capital until January 1, 2022, all other transition provisions have occurred and were entirely reflected in Citi’s regulatory capital ratios beginning January 1, 2018. Moreover, the GSIB surcharge, Capital Conservation Buffer and any Countercyclical Capital Buffer (currently 0%) commenced phase-in on January 1, 2016, and became fully effective on January 1, 2019.

Tier 1 Leverage Ratio

Under the U.S. Basel III rules, Citi is also required to maintain a minimum Tier 1 Leverage ratio of 4.0%. The Tier 1 Leverage ratio, a non-risk-based measure of capital adequacy, is defined as Tier 1 Capital as a percentage of quarterly adjusted average total assets less amounts deducted from Tier 1 Capital.


Supplementary Leverage Ratio

Citi is also required to calculate a Supplementary Leverage ratio, which differs from the Tier 1 Leverage ratio by also including certain off-balance sheet exposures within the denominator of the ratio (Total Leverage Exposure). The Supplementary Leverage ratio represents end of period Tier 1 Capital to Total Leverage Exposure, with the latter defined as the sum of the daily average of on-balance sheet assets for the quarter and the average of certain off-balance sheet exposures calculated as of the last day of each month in the quarter, less applicable Tier 1 Capital deductions. Advanced Approaches banking organizations are required to maintain a stated minimum Supplementary Leverage ratio of 3.0%.

Further, U.S. GSIBs, including Citi, are subject to enhanced Supplementary Leverage ratio standards. The enhanced Supplementary Leverage ratio standards establish a 2.0% leverage buffer in addition to the stated 3.0% minimum Supplementary Leverage ratio requirement, for a total effective minimum Supplementary Leverage ratio requirement of 5.0%. If a U.S. GSIB fails to exceed the 5.0% effective minimum Supplementary Leverage ratio requirement, it will be subject to increasingly onerous restrictions (depending upon the extent of the shortfall) regarding capital distributions and discretionary executive bonus payments.

Prompt Corrective Action Framework

In general, the Prompt Corrective Action (PCA) regulations direct the U.S. banking agencies to enforce increasingly strict limitations on the activities of insured depository institutions that fail to meet certain regulatory capital thresholds. The PCA framework contains five categories of capital adequacy as measured by risk-based capital and leverage ratios: (i) “well capitalized,” (ii) “adequately capitalized,” (iii) “undercapitalized,” (iv) “significantly undercapitalized” and (v) “critically undercapitalized.”

Accordingly, an insured depository institution, such as Citibank, must maintain minimum Common Equity Tier 1 Capital, Tier 1 Capital, Total Capital and Tier 1 Leverage ratios of 6.5%, 8.0%, 10.0% and 5.0%, respectively, to be considered “well capitalized.” In addition, insured depository institution subsidiaries of U.S. GSIBs, including Citibank, must maintain a minimum Supplementary Leverage ratio of 6.0% to be considered “well capitalized.” Citibank was “well capitalized” as of December 31, 2019.

Stress Testing Component of Capital Planning

Citi is subject to an annual assessment by the Federal Reserve Board as to whether Citigroup has effective capital planning processes as well as sufficient regulatory capital to absorb losses during stressful economic and financial conditions, while also meeting obligations to creditors and counterparties and continuing to serve as a credit intermediary. This annual assessment includes two related programs: the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) and Dodd-Frank Act Stress Testing (DFAST).

For the largest and most complex firms, such as Citi, CCAR includes both a quantitative evaluation of a firm’s capital adequacy under stress and a qualitative evaluation of its abilities to determine its capital needs on a forward-looking

basis. As part of the CCAR process, the Federal Reserve Board evaluates Citi’s capital adequacy, capital adequacy process and its planned capital distributions, such as dividend payments and common stock repurchases. The Federal Reserve Board assesses whether Citi has sufficient capital to continue operations throughout times of economic and financial market stress and whether Citi has robust, forward-looking capital planning processes that account for its unique risks. The Federal Reserve Board may object to Citi’s annual capital plan based on quantitative grounds. If the Federal Reserve Board objects to Citi’s annual capital plan, Citi may not undertake any capital distribution unless the Federal Reserve Board indicates in writing that it does not object to the distribution.

Based on recent changes to the Federal Reserve Board’s Capital Plan Rule, the qualitative objection to a firm’s capital plan will no longer apply. However, all CCAR firms, including Citi, will continue to be subject to a rigorous evaluation of their capital planning process. Firms with weak practices may be subject to a deficient supervisory rating, and potentially an enforcement action, for failing to meet supervisory expectations. For additional information regarding CCAR, see “Risk Factors—Strategic Risks” below.

DFAST is a forward-looking quantitative evaluation of the impact of stressful economic and financial market conditions on Citi’s regulatory capital. This program serves to inform the Federal Reserve Board and the general public as to how Citi’s regulatory capital ratios might change using a hypothetical set of adverse economic conditions as designed by the Federal Reserve Board. In addition to the annual supervisory stress test conducted by the Federal Reserve Board, Citi is required to conduct annual company-run stress tests under the same adverse economic conditions designed by the Federal Reserve Board.

Both CCAR and DFAST include an estimate of projected revenues, losses, reserves, pro forma regulatory capital ratios, and any other additional capital measures deemed relevant by Citi. Projections are required over a nine-quarter planning horizon under two supervisory scenarios (baseline and severely adverse conditions). All risk-based capital ratios reflect application of the Standardized Approach framework under the U.S. Basel III rules. Moreover, the Federal Reserve Board has deferred the use of the Advanced Approaches framework indefinitely.

In addition, Citibank is required to conduct the annual Dodd-Frank Act Stress Test. The annual stress test consists of a forward-looking quantitative evaluation of the impact of stressful economic and financial market conditions under

several scenarios on Citibank’s regulatory capital. This program serves to inform the Office of the Comptroller of

the Currency as to how Citibank’s regulatory capital ratios might change during a hypothetical set of adverse economic

conditions and to ultimately evaluate the reliability of Citibank’s capital planning process.

For additional information on potential changes to the stress testing component of capital planning and assessment process applicable to Citi, see “Regulatory Capital Standards Developments” below.


Citigroup’s Capital Resources

Citi is required to maintain stated minimum Common Equity Tier 1 Capital, Tier 1 Capital and Total Capital ratios of 4.5%, 6.0% and 8.0%, respectively. Citi’s effective minimum capital requirements are presented in the table below.

Furthermore, to be “well capitalized” under current federal bank regulatory agency definitions, a bank holding company must have a Tier 1 Capital ratio of at least 6.0%, a Total Capital ratio of at least 10.0% and not be subject to a Federal Reserve Board directive to maintain higher capital levels.

The following tables set forth Citi’s capital components and ratios as of December 31,


, September 30, 2019 and December 31,


:

(1)

Citi’s effective minimum risk-based capital requirements during 2019 and 2018 are inclusive of the 100% and 75% phase-in, respectively, of both the 2.5% Capital Conservation Buffer and the 3.0% GSIB surcharge (all of which must be composed of Common Equity Tier 1 Capital).

(2)

Citi’s reportable Common Equity Tier 1 Capital and Tier 1 Capital ratios were the lower derived under the Basel III Standardized Approach, whereas the reportable Total Capital ratio was the lower derived under the Basel III Advanced Approaches framework for all periods presented.

(3)

Tier 1 Leverage ratio denominator. Represents quarterly average total assets less amounts deducted from Tier 1 Capital.

(4)

Supplementary Leverage ratio denominator.

Common Equity Tier 1 Capital Ratio

Citi’s Common Equity Tier 1 Capital ratio was 11.8% under the Basel III Standardized Approach at December 31, 2019, compared to 11.6% at September 30, 2019 and 11.9% at December 31, 2018. The quarter-over-quarter increase was primarily due to net income of $5.0 billion, a reduction in credit risk-weighted assets and beneficial net movements in

Accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI)

, partially offset by the return of $6.2 billion of capital to common shareholders. The decline year-over-year was primarily due to the return of $22.3 billion of capital to common shareholders, partially offset by net income of $19.4 billion in 2019, beneficial net movements in

AOCI

and a reduction in risk-weighted assets.


Components of Citigroup Capital

(1)

Issuance costs of $152 million and $168 million related to noncumulative perpetual preferred stock outstanding at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, are excluded from common stockholders’ equity and netted against such preferred stock in accordance with Federal Reserve Board regulatory reporting requirements, which differ from those under U.S. GAAP.

(2)

Common Equity Tier 1 Capital is adjusted for accumulated net unrealized gains (losses) on cash flow hedges included in

AOCI

that relate to the hedging of items not recognized at fair value on the balance sheet.

(3)

The cumulative impact of changes in Citigroup’s own creditworthiness in valuing liabilities for which the fair value option has been elected, and own-credit valuation adjustments on derivatives, are excluded from Common Equity Tier 1 Capital, in accordance with the U.S. Basel III rules.

(4)

Includes goodwill “embedded” in the valuation of significant common stock investments in unconsolidated financial institutions.

Footnotes continue on the following page.


(5)

Of Citi’s $23.1 billion of net DTAs at December 31, 2019, $12.4 billion was includable in Common Equity Tier 1 Capital pursuant to the U.S. Basel III rules, while $10.7 billion was excluded. Excluded from Citi’s Common Equity Tier 1 Capital as of December 31, 2019 was $12.4 billion of net DTAs arising from net operating loss, foreign tax credit and general business credit carry-forwards, which was reduced by $1.7 billion of net DTLs primarily associated with goodwill and certain other intangible assets. Separately, under the U.S. Basel III rules, goodwill and these other intangible assets are deducted net of associated DTLs in arriving at Common Equity Tier 1 Capital. DTAs arising from net operating loss, foreign tax credit and general business credit carry-forwards are required to be entirely deducted from Common Equity Tier 1 Capital under the U.S. Basel III rules. Citi’s DTAs arising from temporary differences are less than the 10% limitation under the U.S. Basel III rules and therefore not subject to deduction from Common Equity Tier 1 Capital, but are subject to risk-weighting at 250%.

(6)

Represents Citigroup Capital XIII trust preferred securities, which are permanently grandfathered as Tier 1 Capital under the U.S. Basel III rules.

(7)

Banking entities are required to be in compliance with the Volcker Rule of the Dodd-Frank Act, which prohibits conducting certain proprietary investment activities and limits their ownership of, and relationships with, covered funds. Accordingly, Citi is required by the Volcker Rule to deduct from Tier 1 Capital all permitted ownership interests in covered funds.

(8)

50% of the minimum regulatory capital requirements of insurance underwriting subsidiaries must be deducted from each of Tier 1 Capital and Tier 2 Capital.

(9)

Represents the amount of non-grandfathered trust preferred securities eligible for inclusion in Tier 2 Capital under the U.S. Basel III rules, which will be fully phased-out of Tier 2 Capital by January 1, 2022.

(10)

Under the Standardized Approach, the allowance for credit losses is eligible for inclusion in Tier 2 Capital up to 1.25% of credit risk-weighted assets, with any excess allowance for credit losses being deducted in arriving at credit risk-weighted assets, which differs from the Advanced Approaches framework, in which eligible credit reserves that exceed expected credit losses are eligible for inclusion in Tier 2 Capital to the extent that the excess reserves do not exceed 0.6% of credit risk-weighted assets. The total amount of eligible credit reserves in excess of expected credit losses that were eligible for inclusion in Tier 2 Capital, subject to limitation, under the Advanced Approaches framework was $1.5 billion and $1.4 billion at December 31,

Citigroup Capital Rollforward


Citigroup Risk-Weighted Assets Rollforward (Basel III Standardized Approach)

(1)

General credit risk exposures include cash and balances due from depository institutions, securities, and loans and leases. General credit risk exposures increased during the three and 12 months ended December 31, 2019, mainly driven by growth in commercial and retail loans and increases in investment securities.

(2)

Repo-style transactions include repurchase and reverse repurchase transactions as well as securities borrowing and securities lending transactions. Repo-style transactions decreased during the three and 12 months ended December 31, 2019, driven by volume reduction and matured deals.

(3)

Equity exposures increased during the three months ended December 31, 2019, primarily due to increased exposures from existing investments. Equity exposures increased during the 12 months ended December 31, 2019, primarily due to an increase in market value of investments and increased exposures from existing investments.

(4)

OTC derivatives decreased during the three and 12 months ended December 31, 2019, primarily due to decreases in notionals.

(5)

Other exposures include cleared transactions, unsettled transactions and other assets. Other exposures increased during the three months ended December 31, 2019, primarily due to increases in centrally cleared derivatives and various other assets. Other exposures increased during the 12 months ended December 31, 2019, primarily due to the recognition of right-of-use (ROU) assets in accordance with the adoption of ASU No. 2016-02,

Leases (Topic 842)

, effective January 1, 2019, as well as increases in centrally cleared derivatives and various other assets.

(6)

Off-balance sheet exposures decreased during the three months ended December 31, 2019, primarily due to a decrease in standby letters of credit. Off-balance sheet exposures decreased during the 12 months ended December 31, 2019, primarily due to decreases in standby letters of credit and loan commitments.

(7)

Risk levels decreased during the three months ended December 31, 2019, primarily due to a decrease in exposure levels subject to Stressed Value at Risk and Incremental Risk charges. Risk levels decreased during the 12 months ended December 31, 2019, primarily due to a decrease in exposure levels subject to Stressed Value at Risk.

As set forth in the table above, total risk-weighted assets under the Basel III Standardized Approach decreased from year-end 2018, due to decreases in market risk-weighted assets and credit risk-weighted assets. Market risk-weighted assets decreased from year-end 2018 primarily due to a net reduction in exposure levels. The decrease in credit risk-weighted assets was primarily due to decreases in standby letters of credit and loan commitments as well as volume reduction and matured deals in repo-style transactions and changes in OTC derivative trade activity, partially offset by increases in loan exposures, the recognition of right-of-use (ROU) assets in accordance with the adoption of ASU No. 2016-02,

Leases (Topic 842)

, effective January 1, 2019, and an increase in market value of investments.


Citigroup Risk-Weighted Assets Rollforward (Basel III Advanced Approaches)

(1)

Retail exposures increased during the three months ended December 31, 2019, primarily due to seasonal spending for qualifying revolving (cards) exposures. Retail exposures increased during the 12 months ended December 31, 2019, primarily due to increases in consumer loans, partially offset by decreases due to annual parameter updates.

(2)

Wholesale exposures decreased during the three months ended December 31, 2019, primarily due to decreases in commercial loans partially offset by increases in investment securities. Wholesale exposures decreased during the 12 months ended December 31, 2019, primarily due to annual model parameter updates reflecting Citi’s loss experience, partially offset by increases in commercial loans and investment securities.

(3)

Repo-style transactions include repurchase and reverse repurchase transactions as well as securities borrowing and securities lending transactions. Repo-style transactions decreased during the three and 12 months ended December 31, 2019, driven by volume reduction and matured deals.

(4)

Securitization exposures increased during the 12 months ended December 31, 2019, due to increased exposures from existing deals.

(5)

Equity exposures increased during the three months ended December 31, 2019, primarily due to increased exposures from existing investments. Equity exposures increased during the 12 months ended December 31, 2019, primarily due to an increase in market value of investments and increased exposures from existing investments.

(6)

OTC derivatives decreased during the three months ended December 31, 2019, primarily due to a reduction in notionals. OTC derivatives increased during the 12 months ended December 31, 2019, primarily due to approved model changes, partially offset by a reduction in notionals.

(7)

Derivatives CVA decreased during the three months ended December 31, 2019, primarily due to exposure decreases and changes in credit spreads. Derivatives CVA decreased during the 12 months ended December 31, 2019, primarily due to approved model changes, exposure decreases and changes in credit spreads.

(8)

Other exposures include cleared transactions, unsettled transactions, assets other than those reportable in specific exposure categories and non-material portfolios. Other exposures increased during the three months ended December 31, 2019, primarily due to increases in centrally cleared derivatives and various other assets. Other exposures increased during the 12 months ended December 31, 2019, primarily due to the recognition of ROU assets in accordance with the adoption of ASU No. 2016-02,

Leases (Topic 842)

, effective January 1, 2019, and increases in centrally cleared derivatives and various other assets.

(9)

Risk levels decreased during the three months ended December 31, 2019, primarily due to a decrease in exposure levels subject to Stressed Value at Risk and Incremental Risk charges. Risk levels decreased during the 12 months ended December 31, 2019, primarily due to a decrease in exposure levels subject to Stressed Value at Risk.

(10)

Operational risk-weighted assets decreased during the 12 months ended December 31, 2019, primarily due to changes in operational loss severity and frequency.

As set forth in the table above, total risk-weighted assets under the Basel III Advanced Approaches increased from year-end 2018 primarily due to an increase in credit risk-weighted assets, partially offset by decreases in market and operational risk-weighted assets. The increase in credit risk-weighted assets was primarily due to recognition of ROU assets in accordance with the adoption of ASU 2016-02, changes in OTC derivatives trade activities and increases in securitization exposures, loan exposures and equity exposures, partially offset by decreases in derivatives CVA and wholesale exposures mainly due to annual model parameter updates. Market risk-weighted assets decreased from year-end 2018, primarily due to a net reduction in exposure levels. The

decrease in operational risk-weighted assets was primarily due to changes in operational loss severity and frequency.


Supplementary Leverage Ratio

The following table sets forth Citi’s Supplementary Leverage ratio and related components as of December 31,


, September 30, 2019 and December 31,


:

(1)

Represents the daily average of on-balance sheet assets for the quarter.

(2)

Represents the average of certain off-balance sheet exposures calculated as of the last day of each month in the quarter.

(3)

Under the U.S. Basel III rules, banking organizations are required to include in Total Leverage Exposure the effective notional amount of sold credit derivatives, with netting of exposures permitted if certain conditions are met.

(4)

Repo-style transactions include repurchase or reverse repurchase transactions as well as securities borrowing or securities lending transactions.

As set forth in the table above, Citigroup’s Supplementary Leverage ratio was 6.2% at December 31,


, compared to 6.3% at September 30, 2019 and 6.4% at December 31, 2018. The quarter-over-quarter decrease was primarily driven by a reduction in Tier 1 Capital resulting from the return of $6.2 billion of capital to common shareholders and a preferred stock redemption, partially offset by net income and beneficial net movements in

AOCI

, as well as a decrease in average off-balance sheet exposures. The year-over-year decrease was primarily driven by a reduction in Tier 1 Capital resulting from the return of $22.3 billion of capital to common shareholders, as well as an increase in average on-balance sheet assets, partially offset by net income and beneficial net movements in

AOCI

, as well as a decrease in average off-balance sheet exposures.


Capital Resources of Citigroup’s Subsidiary U.S.

Depository Institutions

Citigroup’s subsidiary U.S. depository institutions are also subject to regulatory capital standards issued by their respective primary federal bank regulatory agencies, which are similar to the standards of the Federal Reserve Board.

The following tables set forth the capital components and ratios for Citibank, Citi’s primary subsidiary U.S. depository

institution, as of December 31,


, September 30, 2019 and December 31,


:

(1)

Citibank’s effective minimum risk-based capital requirements during 2019 and 2018 are inclusive of the 100% and 75% phase-in, respectively, of the 2.5% Capital Conservation Buffer (all of which must be composed of Common Equity Tier 1 Capital).

(2)

Under the Advanced Approaches framework, eligible credit reserves that exceed expected credit losses are eligible for inclusion in Tier 2 Capital to the extent that the excess reserves do not exceed 0.6% of credit risk-weighted assets, which differs from the Standardized Approach in which the allowance for credit losses is eligible for inclusion in Tier 2 Capital up to 1.25% of credit risk-weighted assets, with any excess allowance for credit losses being deducted in arriving at credit risk-weighted assets.

(3)

Citibank’s reportable Common Equity Tier 1 Capital, Tier 1 Capital and Total Capital ratios were the lower derived under the Basel III Standardized Approach for all periods presented.

(4)

Citibank must maintain minimum Common Equity Tier 1 Capital, Tier 1 Capital, Total Capital and Tier 1 Leverage ratios of 6.5%, 8.0%, 10.0% and 5.0%, respectively, to be considered “well capitalized” under the revised Prompt Corrective Action (PCA) regulations applicable to insured depository institutions as established by the U.S. Basel III rules. Citibank must also maintain a minimum Supplementary Leverage ratio of 6.0% to be considered “well capitalized.”

(5)

Tier 1 Leverage ratio denominator. Represents quarterly average total assets less amounts deducted from Tier 1 Capital.

(6)

Supplementary Leverage ratio denominator.

As indicated in the table above, Citibank’s capital ratios at December 31, 2019 were in excess of the stated and effective minimum requirements under the U.S. Basel III rules. In addition, Citibank was also “well capitalized” as of December 31, 2019.


Impact of Changes on Citigroup and Citibank Capital Ratios

The following tables present the estimated sensitivity of Citigroup’s and Citibank’s capital ratios to changes of $100 million in Common Equity Tier 1 Capital, Tier 1 Capital and Total Capital (numerator), and changes of $1 billion in Advanced Approaches and Standardized Approach risk-weighted assets and quarterly adjusted average total assets, as well as Total Leverage Exposure (denominator), as of December 31,


. This information is provided for the purpose of analyzing the impact that a change in Citigroup’s

or Citibank’s financial position or results of operations could have on these ratios. These sensitivities only consider a single change to either a component of capital, risk-weighted assets, quarterly adjusted average total assets or Total Leverage Exposure. Accordingly, an event that affects more than one factor may have a larger basis point impact than is reflected in these tables.

Citigroup Broker-Dealer Subsidiaries

At December 31,


, Citigroup Global Markets Inc., a U.S. broker-dealer registered with the SEC that is an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Citigroup, had net capital, computed in accordance with the SEC’s net capital rule, of $10.1 billion, which exceeded the minimum requirement by $6.9 billion.

Moreover, Citigroup Global Markets Limited, a broker-dealer registered with the United Kingdom’s Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) that is also an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Citigroup, had total capital of $21.4 billion at December 31,


, which exceeded the PRA's minimum regulatory capital requirements.

In addition, certain of Citi’s other broker-dealer

subsidiaries are subject to regulation in the countries in which they do business, including requirements to maintain specified levels of net capital or its equivalent. Citigroup’s other principal broker-dealer subsidiaries were in compliance with their regulatory capital requirements at December 31,


.


Total Loss-Absorbing Capacity (TLAC)

The table below details Citi’s eligible external TLAC and LTD amounts and ratios, and each effective minimum TLAC and long-term debt (LTD) ratio requirement, as well as the surplus amount in dollars in excess of each requirement.

As of December 31,


, Citi exceeded each of the minimum TLAC and LTD requirements, resulting in a $14 billion surplus above its binding TLAC requirement of LTD as a percentage of Total Leverage Exposure.

(1)

External TLAC includes method 1 GSIB surcharge of 2.0%.

(2)

LTD includes method 2 GSIB surcharge of 3.0%.

For additional information on Citi’s TLAC-related requirements, see “Liquidity Risk—Long-Term Debt—Total Loss-Absorbing Capacity (TLAC)” and “Risk Factors—Compliance, Conduct and Legal Risks” below.

Regulatory Capital Treatment—Implementation and Transition of the Current Expected Credit Losses (CECL) Methodology

In February 2019, the U.S. banking agencies issued a final rule that provides banking organizations an optional phase-in over a three-year period of the “Day One” adverse regulatory capital effects resulting from adoption of the CECL methodology.

The rule is in recognition of the issuance by the Financial Accounting Standards Board of ASU No. 2016-13,

Financial Instruments—Credit Losses (Topic 326).

The ASU introduces a new credit loss methodology, the CECL methodology, which requires earlier recognition of credit losses while also providing additional transparency about credit risk. The ASU was effective for Citi as of January 1, 2020. For additional information regarding Citi’s adoption of the CECL methodology, see Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Citi and Citibank have elected the transition provisions provided by the U.S. banking agencies’ rule. Accordingly, the “Day One” regulatory capital effects resulting from adoption of the CECL methodology commenced phase-in on January 1, 2020, and will be fully reflected in Citi’s regulatory capital as of January 1, 2023. Based on Citi’s regulatory capital position as of December 31, 2019, the estimated impact of adopting the CECL methodology would reduce Citi’s Common Equity Tier 1 Capital ratio under the Standardized Approach by approximately 25 basis points in total, or approximately 6

basis points per year on January 1 of each year over the transition period. The actual basis point impact of adopting CECL on Citi’s regulatory capital ratios may change, if Citi’s capital position changes over time.

The Federal Reserve Board has issued a statement that it plans to maintain its current framework for calculating allowances on loans in the supervisory stress test for the 2020 and 2021 supervisory stress test cycles, and to evaluate appropriate future enhancements to this framework as best practices for implementing CECL are developed. However, banking organizations are required to incorporate CECL into their stress testing methodologies, data and disclosure beginning in the cycle coinciding with their first full year of CECL adoption (2020 for Citi).

Regulatory Capital Standards Developments

The U.S. banking agencies and the Basel Committee issued numerous proposed and final rules on a variety of topics in 2019. In the U.S., the most significant rule finalized in 2019 relates to the calculation of risk-weighted assets for derivative contracts, while the Stress Capital Buffer proposal from 2018 has not yet been finalized. The Basel Committee, among other things, finalized revisions to the minimum capital requirements for market risk and proposed revisions to its credit valuation adjustment risk framework.

U.S. Banking Agencies

Standardized Approach for Counterparty Credit Risk

In November 2019, the U.S. banking agencies released a final rule to introduce the Standardized Approach for Counterparty Credit Risk (SA-CCR) in the U.S. SA-CCR will replace the Current Exposure Method (CEM), which is the current methodology used to calculate risk-weighted assets for all derivative contracts under the Standardized Approach, as well as risk-weighted assets for derivative contracts under the Advanced Approaches in cases where internal models are not used. In addition, SA-CCR would replace CEM in numerous other instances throughout the regulatory framework, including but not limited to the Supplementary Leverage Ratio, single counterparty credit limits and legal lending limits.

Under SA-CCR, a banking organization would calculate the exposure amount of its derivative contracts at the netting set level. Multiple derivative contracts would generally be considered to be under the same netting set as long as each derivative contract is subject to the same qualifying master netting agreement. SA-CCR also introduces the concept of hedging sets, which would allow a banking organization to fully or partially net derivative contracts within the same netting set that share similar risk factors. Moreover, SA-CCR incorporates updated supervisory and maturity factors to calculate the potential future exposure of a derivative contract, and provides for improved recognition of collateral. Under the proposal, the exposure amount of a netting set would be equal to an alpha factor of 1.4 multiplied by the sum of the replacement cost and potential future exposure of the netting set.


The mandatory compliance date of the final rule is January 1, 2022, with early adoption permitted beginning April 1, 2020. Citi’s SA-CCR implementation efforts are already underway. Citi is currently evaluating a decision on its intended implementation date for SA-CCR, including consideration of the impact of SA-CCR on both Citigroup’s and Citibank’s regulatory capital ratios.

Stress Capital Buffer

In April 2018, the Federal Reserve Board issued a proposal that is designed to more closely integrate the results of the quantitative assessment in CCAR with firms’ ongoing minimum capital requirements under the U.S. Basel III rules.

Specifically, the proposed rule would replace the existing Capital Conservation Buffer, currently fixed at 2.5% under the U.S. Basel III rules, with (i) a variable buffer known as the Stress Capital Buffer (as described below), plus (ii) for U.S. GSIBs, the GSIB’s then-current GSIB surcharge, plus (iii) the Countercyclical Capital Buffer, if any. These three components would constitute the new Capital Conservation Buffer under the Standardized Approach. The Stress Capital Buffer (SCB) would be based upon the maximum decline in a bank holding company’s Common Equity Tier 1 Capital ratio under the severely adverse scenario of the supervisory stress test. Under the April 2018 proposal, the SCB would be subject to a floor of 2.5%.

The proposed rule would also modify certain assumptions currently required in supervisory stress tests, including continued capital distributions during the nine-quarter capital planning horizon and balance sheet growth assumptions.

A final rule has not yet been issued. Senior staff at the Federal Reserve Board have indicated publicly that they plan to finalize certain components of the proposal for application in the 2020 CCAR cycle, and that they may re-propose certain other elements of the proposal to better balance the need to preserve the dynamism of stress testing while reducing unnecessary volatility, among other things. Senior staff at the Federal Reserve Board have also indicated publicly that they are considering two options in place of the “dividend add-on,” which was a component of the SCB under the April 2018 proposal: setting the Countercyclical Capital Buffer at a higher baseline level during normal times, or raising the floor of the SCB higher than 2.5%. The potential re-proposal may also address certain other elements of the original proposal, such as the relative timing between stress testing results and the submission of a firm’s capital plan, and the consequences of breaching a buffer.

TLAC Holdings

In April 2019, the U.S. banking agencies released a proposal that would create a new regulatory capital deduction applicable to Advanced Approaches banking organizations for certain investments in covered debt instruments issued by GSIBs. The proposed rule is intended to reduce systemic risk by creating an incentive for Advanced Approaches banking organizations to limit their exposure to GSIBs.

Under the U.S. Basel III rules, investments in the capital of unconsolidated financial institutions are subject to deduction to the extent that they exceed certain thresholds.

Under the proposed rule, an investment in a “covered debt instrument” would be treated as an investment in a Tier 2 capital instrument and, therefore, would be subject to deduction from the Advanced Approaches banking organization’s own Tier 2 Capital in accordance with the existing rules for investments in unconsolidated financial institutions. Covered debt instruments would include unsecured debt instruments that are “eligible debt securities” for purposes of the TLAC rule, or that are pari passu or subordinated to such securities, in addition to certain unsecured debt instruments issued by foreign GSIBs.

To support a deep and liquid market for covered debt instruments, the proposed rule provides an exception from the approach described above for covered debt instruments held for 30 days or less for market-making purposes, if the aggregate amount of such debt instruments does not exceed 5% of the banking organization’s Common Equity Tier 1 Capital.

The proposed rule does not specify a proposed effective date for the new regulatory capital deduction. If adopted as proposed, Citi does not expect the proposed rule to have a material impact on its regulatory capital.

Basel Committee

Revisions to the Minimum Capital Requirements for

Market Risk

In January 2019, the Basel Committee issued a final standard that revises the market risk capital framework—the so-called Fundamental Review of the Trading Book, or FRTB. The final rule revises the assessment process under the Advanced Approaches to determine whether a bank’s internal risk management models appropriately reflect the risks of individual trading desks, and clarifies the requirements for identification of risk factors that are eligible for internal modeling. In addition, the risk weights for general interest rate risk and foreign exchange risk under the Standardized Approach have been recalibrated.

If the U.S. banking agencies were to adopt the Basel Committee’s revised market risk framework unchanged, Citi believes its market risk-weighted assets could increase significantly. The ultimate impact on Citi, however, will depend upon the specific provisions of any final rule.

Leverage Ratio Treatment of Client-Cleared Derivatives

In June 2019, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision issued a final standard that revises its leverage ratio framework to align the leverage ratio measurement of client-cleared derivatives with the measurement as determined per the Basel Committee’s standardized approach for measuring counterparty credit risk exposures, as used for risk-based capital requirements. Under the Basel Committee’s leverage ratio framework, the leverage ratio exposure measure is generally not adjusted for physical or financial collateral, guarantees or other credit risk mitigation techniques, including initial margin received from clients. However, the final rule permits both cash and non-cash forms of initial margin and variation margin received from clients to mitigate replacement cost and potential future exposure for client-cleared


derivatives only. The Basel Committee stated in the rule that this revision balances the robustness of the leverage ratio as a non-risk-based safeguard against unsustainable sources of leverage with the policy objective of promoting central clearing of standardized derivative contracts.

In the U.S., the Basel Committee’s leverage ratio framework and leverage ratio exposure measure are most closely aligned with the Supplementary Leverage Ratio and Total Leverage Exposure, respectively. As part of the SA-CCR final rule discussed previously, the U.S. agencies amended the Supplementary Leverage Ratio requirements in a manner similar to the Basel Committee. This particular aspect of the U.S. SA-CCR final rule will likely benefit Citi’s Supplementary Leverage Ratio modestly upon implementation.

Credit Valuation Adjustment Risk—Targeted Revisions

In November 2019, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision issued a consultative document that proposes a targeted set of revisions to the credit valuation adjustment (CVA) risk framework previously finalized in December 2017. The revisions aim to align the revised CVA risk framework, in part, with the revised market risk capital framework that was finalized in January 2019. The Basel Committee also sought feedback on a possible adjustment to the overall calibration of capital requirements calculated under their CVA risk framework.

The U.S. agencies may consider revisions to the CVA risk framework under the U.S. Basel III rules in the future, based upon any revisions adopted by the Basel Committee.


Tangible Common Equity, Book Value Per Share, Tangible Book Value Per Share and Returns on Equity

Tangible common equity (TCE), as defined by Citi, represents common stockholders’ equity less goodwill and identifiable intangible assets (other than MSRs). Other companies may calculate TCE in a different manner. TCE, tangible book value (TBV) per share and return on average TCE are non-GAAP financial measures. Citi believes the presentation of TCE, TBV per share and return on average TCE provides alternate measures of capital strength and performance that are commonly used by investors and industry analysts.
