Item 1. Business

OVERVIEW

Citigroup’s history dates back to the
founding of Citibank in 1812. Citigroup’s original corporate predecessor was
incorporated in 1988 under the laws of the State of Delaware. Following a series
of transactions over a number of years, Citigroup Inc. was formed in 1998 upon
the merger of Citicorp and Travelers Group
Inc.

Citigroup is a
global diversified financial services holding company whose businesses provide
consumers, corporations, governments and institutions with a broad range of
financial products and services, including consumer banking and credit,
corporate and investment banking, securities brokerage, transaction services and
wealth management. Citi has approximately 200 million customer accounts and does
business in more than 160 countries and jurisdictions.

Citigroup
currently operates, for management reporting purposes, via two primary business
segments: Citicorp, consisting of Citi’s

Global Consumer Banking

businesses and

Institutional Clients Group

; and Citi Holdings, consisting of

Brokerage and Asset Management, Local Consumer Lending

and

Special Asset
Pool

. For a further description of the

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
FINANCIAL CONDITION AND

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Overview

2012—Ongoing Transformation of
Citigroup

During 2012, Citigroup
continued to build on the significant transformation of the Company that has
occurred over the last several years. Despite a challenging operating
environment (as discussed below), Citi’s 2012 results showed ongoing momentum in
most of its core businesses, as Citi continued to simplify its business model
and focus resources on its core Citicorp franchise while continuing to wind down
Citi Holdings as quickly as practicable in an economically rational manner. Citi
made steady progress toward the successful execution of its strategy, which is
to:

enhance its position as a leading global
  bank for both institutions and individuals, by building on its unique global
  network, deep emerging markets expertise, client relationships and product
  expertise;

position Citi to seize the opportunities
  provided by current trends (globalization, digitization and urbanization) for the benefit of clients;

further its commitment to responsible
  finance;

strengthen Citi’s performance—including
  gaining market share with clients, making Citi more efficient and productive,
  and building upon its history of innovation; and

wind down Citi Holdings as soon as
  practicable, in an economically rational manner.

With these goals
in mind, on December 5, 2012, Citi announced a number of repositioning efforts
to optimize its footprint, re-size and re-align certain businesses and improve
efficiencies, while at the same time maintaining its unique competitive
advantages. As a result of these repositioning efforts, in the fourth quarter of
2012, Citi recorded pretax repositioning charges of approximately $1 billion,
and expects to incur an additional $100 million of charges in the first half of
2013.

Continued Challenges in

Citi continued to face a
challenging operating environment during 2012, many aspects of which it expects
will continue into 2013. While showing some signs of improvement, the overall
economic environment—both in the U.S. and globally—remains largely uncertain,
and spread compression


continues to negatively impact the results of
operations of several of Citi’s businesses, particularly in the U.S. and Asia.
Citi also continues to face a significant number of regulatory changes and
uncertainties, including the timing and implementation of the final U.S.
regulatory capital standards. Further, Citi’s legal and related costs remain
elevated and likely volatile as it continues to work through “legacy” issues,
such as mortgage-related expenses, and operates in a heightened litigious and
regulatory environment. Finally, while Citi reduced the size of Citi Holdings by
approximately 31% during 2012, the remaining assets within Citi Holdings will
continue to have a negative impact on Citi’s overall results of operations in
2013, although this negative impact should continue to abate as the wind-down
continues. For a more detailed discussion of these and other risks that could
impact Citi’s businesses, results of operations and financial condition, see
“Risk Factors” below. As a result of these continuing challenges, Citi remains
highly focused on the areas within its control, including operational efficiency
and optimizing its core businesses in order to drive improved
returns.

____________________


As used throughout this
      report, spread compression refers to the reduction in net interest revenue
      as a percentage of loans or deposits, as applicable, as driven by either
      lower yields on interest-earning assets or higher costs to fund such
      assets (or a combination thereof).


2012 Summary
Results

Citigroup

For 2012, Citigroup reported net income of $7.5 billion and
diluted earnings per share of $2.44, compared to $11.1 billion and $3.63 per
share, respectively, for 2011. 2012 results included several significant
items:

a negative impact from the credit
  valuation adjustment on derivatives (counterparty and own-credit), net of
  hedges (CVA) and debt valuation adjustment on Citi’s fair value option debt
  (DVA), of pretax $(2.3) billion ($(1.4) billion after-tax) as Citi’s credit
  spreads tightened during the year, compared to a pretax impact of $1.8 billion
  ($1.1 billion after-tax) in 2011;

a net loss of $4.6 billion ($2.9 billion
  after-tax) related to the sale of minority investments, driven by the loss
  from Citi’s sale of a 14% interest, and other-than-temporary impairment on its
  remaining 35% interest, in the Morgan Stanley Smith Barney (MSSB) joint
  venture, versus a gain of $199 million ($128 million after-tax) in the prior
  year;


as mentioned above, $1.0 billion of
  repositioning charges in the fourth quarter of 2012 ($653 million after-tax)
  compared to $428 million ($275 million after-tax) in the fourth quarter of
  2011; and

a $582 million tax benefit in the third
  quarter of 2012 related to the resolution of certain tax audit
  items.

Excluding CVA/DVA, the impact of minority
investments, the repositioning charges in the fourth quarters of 2012 and 2011
and the tax benefit, net income was $11.9 billion, or $3.86 per diluted share,
in 2012, an increase of 18% compared to $10.1 billion, or $3.30 per diluted
share, reported in 2011, as higher revenues, lower core operating expenses and
lower net credit losses were partially offset by higher legal and related costs
and a lower net loan loss reserve release.


Citi’s revenues, net of interest expense,
were $70.2 billion in 2012, down 10% versus the prior year. Excluding CVA/DVA
and the impact of minority investments, revenues were $77.1 billion, up 1% from
2011, as revenues in Citicorp rose 5%, but were offset by a 40% decline in Citi
Holdings revenues compared to the prior year. Net interest revenues of $47.6
billion were 2% lower than the prior year, largely driven by the decline in loan
balances in

Local Consumer
Lending

in Citi Holdings as well as spread
compression in

North America

and

Asia Regional Consumer
Banking (RCB)

in Citicorp. Non-interest
revenues were $22.6 billion, down 25% from the prior year, driven by CVA/DVA and the loss on
MSSB in the third quarter of 2012. Excluding CVA/DVA and the impact of minority
investments, non-interest revenues were $29.5 billion, up 6% from the prior
year, principally driven by higher revenues in

Securities and Banking

and higher
mortgage revenues in

North America
RCB

, partially offset by lower revenues in
the

Special Asset Pool

within Citi Holdings.

Operating
Expenses

Citigroup expenses decreased
1% versus the prior year to $50.5 billion. In 2012, in addition to the
previously mentioned repositioning charges, Citi incurred elevated legal and
related costs of $2.8 billion compared to $2.2 billion in the prior year.
Excluding legal and related costs, repositioning charges for the fourth quarters
of 2012 and 2011, and the impact of foreign exchange translation into U.S.
dollars for reporting purposes (as used throughout this report, FX translation),
which lowered reported expenses by approximately $0.9 billion in 2012 as
compared to the prior year, operating expenses declined 1% to $46.6 billion
versus $47.3 billion in the prior year.

Citicorp’s expenses were $45.3 billion, up 2% from the prior
year, as efficiency savings were more than offset by higher legal and related
costs and repositioning charges. Citi Holdings expenses were down 19%
year-over-year to $5.3 billion, principally due to the continued decline in
assets.

____________________


As referenced above, in 2012, the sale of minority
      investments included a pretax loss of $4.7 billion ($2.9 billion
      after-tax) from the sale of a 14% interest and other-than-temporary
      impairment of the carrying value of Citi’s remaining 35% interest in MSSB
      recorded in Citi Holdings—

Brokerage
      and Asset Management

during the
      third quarter of 2012. In addition, Citi recorded a net pretax loss of
      $424 million ($274 million after-tax) from the partial sale of Citi’s
      minority interest in Akbank T.A.S. (Akbank) recorded in

Corporate/Other

during the second quarter of 2012. In the first quarter of 2012,
      Citi recorded a net pretax gain on minority investments of $477 million
      ($308 million after-tax), which included pretax gains of $1.1 billion and
      $542 million on the sales of Citi’s remaining stake in Housing Development
      Finance Corporation Ltd. (HDFC) and its stake in Shanghai Pudong
      Development Bank (SPDB), respectively, offset by a pretax impairment
      charge relating to Akbank of $1.2 billion, all within

Corporate/Other

. In 2011, Citi recorded a $199 million pretax gain ($128 million
      after-tax) from the partial sale of Citi’s minority interest in HDFC,
      recorded in

Corporate/Other

.


Presentation of Citi’s results excluding CVA/DVA,
      the impact of minority investments, the repositioning charges in the
      fourth quarters of 2012 and 2011 and the tax benefit, as applicable,
      represent non- GAAP financial measures. Citigroup believes the
      presentation of its results of operations excluding these impacts provides
      a more meaningful depiction of the underlying fundamentals of Citi’s
      businesses and enhances the comparison of results across
  periods.


Credit Costs

Citi’s total provisions for credit losses and for benefits and
claims of $11.7 billion declined 8% from the prior year. Net credit losses of
$14.6 billion were down 27% from 2011, largely reflecting improvements in

North America

cards and

Local Consumer Lending

and the

Special Asset Pool

within Citi
Holdings. Consumer net credit losses declined 22% to $14.4 billion reflecting
improvements in

North America

Citi-branded cards and Citi retail services in Citicorp and

Local Consumer Lending

within Citi Holdings. Corporate net credit losses decreased
86% year-over-year to $223 million, driven primarily by continued credit
improvement in both the

Special Asset
Pool

in Citi Holdings and

Securities and Banking

in
Citicorp.

The net
release of allowance for loan losses and unfunded lending commitments was $3.7
billion in 2012, 55% lower than 2011. Of the $3.7 billion net reserve release,
$2.1 billion was attributable to Citicorp compared to a $4.9 billion release in
the prior year. The decline in the Citicorp reserve release year-over-year
mostly reflected a lower reserve release in

North America

Citi-branded cards and
Citi retail services and

Securities and
Banking

. The $1.6 billion net reserve release
in Citi Holdings was down from $3.3 billion in the prior year, due primarily to
lower releases within the

Special Asset
Pool

, reflecting the decline in assets. Of
the $3.7 billion net reserve release, $3.6 billion related to Consumer, with the
remainder in Corporate.

Capital and Loan Loss Reserve
Positions

Citigroup’s Tier 1 Capital
and Tier 1 Common ratios were 14.1% and 12.7% as of December 31, 2012,
respectively, compared to 13.6% and 11.8% in the prior year. Citi’s estimated
Tier 1 Common ratio under Basel III was 8.7% at December 31, 2012, up slightly
from an estimated 8.6% at September 30,
2012.


Citigroup’s total allowance for loan losses was $25.5 billion at year
end, or 3.9% of total loans, compared to $30.1 billion, or 4.7%, at the end of
the prior year. The decline in the total allowance for loan losses reflected the
continued wind-down of Citi Holdings and overall continued improvement in the
credit quality of Citi’s loan portfolios.

The Consumer allowance for loan losses was $22.7
billion, or 5.6% of total Consumer loans, at year end, compared to $27.2
billion, or 6.5% of total loans, at December 31, 2011. Total non-accrual assets
increased 3% to $12.0 billion as compared to December 31, 2011. Corporate
non-accrual loans declined 28% to $2.3 billion, reflecting continued credit
improvement. Consumer non-accrual loans increased $1.4 billion, or 17%, to $9.2
billion versus the prior year. The increase in Consumer non-accrual loans
predominantly reflected the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC)
guidance issued in the third quarter of 2012 regarding the treatment of mortgage
loans where the borrower has gone through Chapter 7 bankruptcy, which added $1.5
billion to Consumer non-accrual loans (of which approximately $1.3 billion were
current).

Citicorp


Citicorp net income decreased 8% from the prior year to $14.1 billion.
The decrease largely reflected the impact of CVA/DVA and higher legal and
related costs and repositioning charges, partially offset by lower provisions
for income taxes. CVA/DVA, recorded in

Securities and Banking,

was $(2.5)
billion in 2012, compared to $1.7 billion in the prior year. Within Citicorp,
repositioning charges were $951 million ($604 million after-tax) in the fourth
quarter 2012, versus $368 million ($237 million after-tax) in the prior year
period. Excluding CVA/DVA, the impact of minority investments, the repositioning
charges in the fourth quarters of 2012 and 2011, and the tax benefit in the third
quarter of 2012, Citicorp net income increased 9% from the prior year to $15.6
billion, primarily driven by growth in revenues and lower net credit losses
partially offset by lower loan loss reserve releases and higher
taxes.

Citicorp revenues, net of interest
expense, were $71 billion in 2012, down 1% versus the prior year. Excluding
CVA/DVA and the impact of minority investments, Citicorp revenues were $73.4
billion in 2012, 5% higher than 2011.

Global

revenues of $40.2 billion

billion. International

RCB

year-over-year to $19.1 billion. Excluding the impact of FX
translation,


international

RCB

revenues increased 5% year-over-year.

Securities and Banking

revenues were $19.7 billion in 2012, down 8%
year-over-year

. Securities and
Banking

revenues, excluding CVA/DVA, were
$22.2 billion, or 13%, higher than the prior year.

Transaction Services

revenues were
$10.9 billion, up 3% from the prior year, but up 5% excluding the impact of FX
translation.

Corporate/Other

revenues, excluding the impact of minority investments,
declined 80% from the prior year mainly reflecting the absence of hedging
gains.

In

North
America RCB

, the revenue growth
year-over-year was driven by higher mortgage revenues, partially offset by lower
revenues in Citi-branded cards and Citi retail services, mostly driven by lower
average card loans.

North America
RCB

average deposits of $154 billion grew 6%
year-over-year and average retail loans of $41 billion grew 19%. Average card
loans of $109 billion declined 3%, driven by increased payment rates resulting
from consumer deleveraging, and card purchase sales of $232 billion were roughly
flat. Citi retail services revenues were also negatively impacted by improving
credit trends, which increased contractual partner payments.

In

Securities and Banking,

fixed income markets revenues of $14.0
billion, excluding CVA/DVA,


increased 28% from the prior year, reflecting higher
revenues in rates and currencies and credit-related and securitized products.
Equity markets revenues of $2.4 billion in 2012, excluding CVA/DVA, increased 1%
driven by improved derivatives performance as well as the absence in the current
year of proprietary trading losses, partially offset by lower cash equity volumes.

Investment banking revenues rose 10% from the prior year to $3.6 billion,
principally driven by higher revenues in debt underwriting and advisory
activities, partially offset by lower equity underwriting revenues. Lending
revenues of $997 million were down 45% from the prior year, reflecting $698
million in losses on hedges related to accrual loans as credit spreads tightened
during 2012 (compared to a $519 million gain in the prior year as spreads
widened). Excluding the mark-to-market impact of loan hedges related to accrual
loans, lending revenues rose 31% year-over-year to $1.7 billion reflecting
growth in the Corporate loan portfolio and improved spreads in most regions.
Private Bank revenues of $2.3 billion increased 8% from the prior year,
excluding CVA/DVA, driven primarily by growth in

North America

lending and
deposits.

In

Transaction Services,

the increase in

revenues year-over-year, excluding
the impact of FX translation, was driven by growth in

Treasury and Trade Solutions,

which
was partially offset by a decline in

Securities and Fund Services

.
Excluding the impact of FX translation,

Treasury and Trade Solutions

revenues
were up 8%, driven by growth in trade as end-of-period trade loans grew 23%,
partially offset by ongoing spread compression given the low interest rate
environment.

Securities and Fund
Services

revenues were down 2%, excluding the
impact of FX translation, mostly reflecting lower market volumes as well as
spread compression on deposits.

Citicorp end-of-period loans increased 7% year-over-year to
$540 billion, with 3% growth in Consumer loans, primarily in

Latin America,

and 11%
growth in Corporate loans.

Citi
Holdings


Citi Holdings net
loss was $6.6 billion compared to a net loss of $4.2 billion in 2011. The
increase in the net loss was driven by the $4.7 billion pretax ($2.9 billion
after-tax) loss on MSSB described above. In addition, Citi Holdings results
included $77 million in repositioning charges in the fourth quarter of 2012,
compared to $60 million in the fourth quarter of 2011. Excluding the loss on
MSSB, CVA/DVA


and the repositioning charges in the fourth quarters
of 2012 and 2011, Citi Holdings net loss decreased to $3.7 billion compared to a
net loss of $4.2 billion in the prior year, as revenue declines and lower loan
loss reserve releases were more than offset by lower operating expenses and
lower net credit losses. These improved results in 2012 reflected the continued
decline in Citi Holdings assets.

Citi Holdings revenues decreased to $(833) million from $6.3
billion in the prior year. Excluding CVA/DVA and the loss on MSSB, Citi Holdings
revenues were $3.7 billion in 2012 compared to $6.2 billion in the prior year.

Special Asset Pool

revenues, excluding CVA/DVA, were $(657) million in 2012, compared to
$473 million in the prior year, largely due to lower non-interest revenue
resulting from lower gains on asset sales.

Local Consumer Lending

revenues of
$4.4 billion declined 20% from the prior year primarily due to the 24% decline
in average assets.

Brokerage and Asset
Management

revenues, excluding the loss on
MSSB, were $(15) million, compared to $282 million in the prior year, mostly
reflecting higher funding costs. Net interest revenues declined 30%
year-over-year to $2.6 billion, largely driven by continued declining loan
balances in

Local Consumer
Lending

. Non-interest revenues, excluding the
loss on MSSB and CVA/DVA, were $1.1 billion versus $2.5 billion in the prior
year, principally reflecting lower gains on asset sales within the

Special Asset Pool

.

As noted
above, Citi Holdings assets declined 31% year-over-year to $156 billion as of
the end of 2012. Also at the end of 2012, Citi Holdings assets comprised
approximately 8% of total Citigroup GAAP assets and 15% of risk-weighted assets
(as defined under current regulatory guidelines).

Local Consumer Lending

continued to
represent the largest segment within Citi Holdings, with $126 billion of assets
as of the end of 2012, of which approximately 73% consisted of mortgages in

North America

real estate lending.

2012 vs. 2011

Net income

increased 18%, mainly driven by higher mortgage revenues and a $2.3
billion decrease in net credit losses, partially offset by a $1.8 billion
reduction in loan loss reserve
releases.

Revenues

increased 5%, driven by a
38% increase in non-interest revenues from higher gains on sale of mortgages,
partly offset by a 2% decline in net interest revenues. The higher gains on sale
of mortgages were driven by high volumes of mortgage refinancing activity, due
largely to the U.S. government’s Home Affordable Refinance Program (HARP), as
well as higher margins resulting from the shift to retail as compared to
third-party origination channels. Assuming the continued low interest rate
environment, Citi believes the higher mortgage refinancing volumes could
continue into the first half of 2013. Excluding mortgages, revenue from the
retail banking business was essentially flat, as volume growth and improved mix
in the deposit and lending portfolios was offset by significant spread
compression. Citi expects spread compression to continue to negatively impact
revenues during 2013.

Cards
revenues declined 4%. In Citi-branded cards, both average loans and net interest
revenue declined year-over-year, reflecting continued increased payment rates
resulting from consumer deleveraging and the impact of the look-back provisions
of The Credit Card Accountability Responsibility and Disclosure Act (CARD
Act).


Citi expects the look-back provisions of the CARD Act will
likely have a diminishing impact on the results of operations of its cards
businesses during 2013. In Citi retail services, net interest revenues improved
slightly but were offset by declining non-interest revenues, driven by improving
credit and the resulting impact on contractual partner payments. Citi expects
cards revenues could continue to be negatively impacted by higher payment rates
for consumers, reflecting ongoing economic uncertainty and deleveraging as well
as Citi’s shift to higher credit quality borrowers.

As
part of its U.S. Citi-branded cards business, Citibank, N.A. issues a co-branded
credit card product with American Airlines, the Citi/AAdvantage card. AMR
Corporation and certain of its subsidiaries, including American Airlines, Inc.,
filed voluntary petitions for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the U.S.
Bankruptcy Code in November 2011. On February 14, 2013, AMR Corporation and US
Airways Group, Inc. announced that the boards of directors of both companies had
approved a merger agreement under which the companies would be combined. For
additional information, see “Risk Factors—Business and Operational Risks”
below.

Expenses

increased 3%, primarily due to increased mortgage origination
costs resulting from the higher retail channel mortgage volumes and $100 million
of repositioning charges in the fourth quarter of 2012, partially offset by
lower expenses in cards. Expenses continued to be impacted by elevated legal and
related costs.

Provisions

decreased 14%, due to lower
net credit losses in the cards portfolio partly offset by continued lower loan
loss reserve releases ($2.4 billion in 2012 compared to $4.2 billion in 2011).
Assuming no downturn in the U.S. economic environment, Citi believes credit
trends have largely stabilized in the cards portfolios.

2011 vs.

Net income

increased $3.1 billion, driven by higher loan loss reserve
releases and an improvement in net credit losses, partly offset by lower
revenues and higher expenses.

Revenues

decreased 7% due to a
decrease in net interest and non-interest revenues. Net interest revenue
decreased 5%, driven primarily by lower cards net interest revenue, which was
negatively impacted by the look-back provision of the CARD Act. In addition, net
interest revenue for cards was negatively impacted by higher promotional
balances and lower total average loans. Non-interest revenue decreased 16%,
primarily due to lower gains from the sale of mortgage loans, as margins
declined and Citi held more loans on-balance sheet, and declining revenues
driven by improving credit and the resulting impact on contractual partner
payments in Citi retail services. In addition, the decline in non-interest
revenue reflected lower retail banking fee income.

Expenses

increased 15%, primarily
driven by higher investment spending in the business during the second half of
2011, particularly in cards marketing and technology, and increases in
litigation accruals related to the interchange fees litigation (see Note 28 to
the Consolidated Financial Statements).

Provisions

decreased 66%, primarily
due to a loan loss reserve release of $4.2 billion in 2011, compared to a loan
loss reserve release of $1.3 billion in 2010, and lower net credit losses in the
cards portfolios (cards net credit losses declined $5.0 billion, or 38%, from
2010).

____________________


The CARD Act requires a review once every six
      months for card accounts where the annual percentage rate (APR) has been
      increased since January 1, 2009 to assess whether changes in credit risk,
      market conditions or other factors merit a future decline in the
      APR.

The discussion of the results of
operations for

EMEA RCB

below excludes the impact of FX translation for all periods
presented. Presentation of the results of operations, excluding the impact of FX
translation, are non-GAAP financial measures. Citi believes the presentation of

EMEA RCB

’s
results excluding the impact of FX translation is a more meaningful depiction of
the underlying fundamentals of the business. For a reconciliation of certain of
these metrics to the reported results, see the table above.

2012 vs. 2011

The net loss of $22 million compared to net income of $84
million in 2011 was mainly due to higher operating expenses and lower loan loss
reserve releases, partially offset by higher
revenues.

Revenues

increased 2%, with growth
across the major products, including strong growth in Russia. Year-over-year,
cards purchase sales increased 12%, investment sales increased 15% and retail
loan volume increased 17%. Revenue growth year-over-year was partly offset by
the absence of Akbank, Citi’s equity investment in Turkey, which was moved
to

Corporate/Other

in the first quarter of 2012. Net interest revenue increased 17%, driven
by the absence of Akbank investment funding costs and growth in average deposits
of 5%, average retail loans of 16% and average cards loans of 6%, partially
offset by spread compression. Interest rate caps on credit cards, particularly
in Turkey and Poland, the continued liquidation of a higher yielding
non-strategic retail banking portfolio and the continued low interest rate
environment were the main contributors to the lower spreads. Citi expects spread
compression to continue to negatively impact revenues in this business during
2013. Non-interest revenue decreased 20%, mainly reflecting the absence of
Akbank.

Expenses

grew 12%,
primarily due to the $57 million of fourth quarter of 2012 repositioning charges
in Turkey, Romania and Pakistan and the impact of continued investment spending
on new internal operating platforms during the year.

Provisions

increased $43 million due
to lower loan loss reserve releases, partially offset by lower net credit losses
across most countries. Net credit losses continued to decline, decreasing 36%
due to the ongoing improvement in credit quality and the move toward lower-risk
customers. Citi believes that net credit losses in

EMEA RCB

have largely stabilized and
assuming the underlying core portfolio continues to grow in 2013, credit costs
could begin to rise.

2011 vs.  2010

Net
income

decreased 1%, as an improvement in credit costs was offset by  higher
expenses from increased investment spending and lower revenues.

Revenues

decreased 1%, driven by the  liquidation of higher yielding non-strategic customer portfolios and a lower  contribution from
Akbank. Net interest revenue declined 1% due to the decline in  the higher yielding non-strategic retail banking portfolio
and spread  compression in the Citi-branded cards portfolio. Interest rate caps on credit  cards, particularly in Turkey and
Poland, contributed to the lower spreads in  the cards portfolio. Non-interest revenue decreased 2%, mainly reflecting the
lower contribution from Akbank. Despite the negative impacts to revenues  described above, underlying businesses showed
growth, with investment sales up  28% from the prior year and cards purchase sales up 15%.

Expenses

increased 7% due to the  impact of account acquisition, focused investment spending and higher  transactional expenses,
partly offset by continued savings initiatives.

Provisions

decreased
70%, driven by a  reduction in net credit losses. Net credit losses decreased 46%, reflecting the  continued credit quality
improvement during the year, stricter underwriting  criteria and the move to lower-risk products.

For a reconciliation of certain of these metrics to the reported results, see
the table above.

2012 vs. 2011

Net income

was flat to the prior year as higher revenues were offset by higher
credit costs and repositioning charges.

Revenues

increased 9%, primarily due to strong revenue growth in Mexico and
higher volumes, mostly related to personal loans and credit cards. However,
continued regulatory pressure involving foreign exchange controls and related
measures in Argentina and Venezuela is expected to negatively impact revenues in
the near term. Net interest revenue increased 10% due to increased volumes,
partially offset by continued spread compression. Citi expects spread
compression to continue to negatively impact revenues in this business during
2013. Non-interest revenue increased 7%, primarily due to increased business
volumes in the private pension fund and insurance businesses.

Expenses

increased 6%, primarily due to $131 million of repositioning charges in
the fourth quarter of 2012, higher volume-driven expenses and increased legal
and related costs.

Provisions

increased 39%,
primarily due to increased loan loss reserve builds driven by underlying
business volume growth, primarily in Mexico and Colombia. In addition, net
credit losses increased in the retail portfolios, primarily in Mexico,
reflecting volume growth. Citi believes that net credit losses in

Latin America

will likely continue to trend higher as various
loan portfolios continue to mature.

2011 vs. 2010

Net income

declined 14% as higher revenues were more than offset by higher expenses
and higher credit costs.

Revenues

increased 7%
primarily due to higher volumes. Net interest revenue increased 6% driven by the
continued growth in lending and deposit volumes, partially offset by spread
compression driven in part by the continued move toward customers with a lower
risk profile and stricter underwriting criteria, especially in the Citi-branded
cards portfolio. Non-interest revenue increased 8%, primarily driven by an
increase in banking fee income from credit card purchase sales.

Expenses

increased 10% due to higher volumes and investment spending, including
increased marketing and customer acquisition costs as well as new branches,
partially offset by continued savings initiatives. The increase in the level of
investment spending in the business was largely completed at the end of
2011.

Provisions

increased 43%, reflecting lower loan loss reserve
releases. Net credit losses declined 13%, driven primarily by improvements in
the Mexico cards portfolio due to the move toward customers with a lower-risk
profile and stricter underwriting criteria.

Not meaningful


The discussion of the
results of operations for

Asia
RCB

below excludes the impact of
FX translation for all periods presented. Presentation of the results of
operations, excluding the impact of FX translation, are non-GAAP financial
measures. Citi believes the presentation of

Asia RCB

’s results excluding the impact of FX translation is a more meaningful
depiction of the underlying fundamentals of the business. For a reconciliation
of certain of these metrics to the reported results, see the table
above.

2012 vs. 2011

Net income

decreased
4% primarily due to higher expenses.

Revenues

were
flat year-over-year. Net interest revenue  decreased 3%, as the benefit of higher loan and deposit balances was offset by
spread compression, mainly in retail lending. Spread compression continued to  reflect improvements in the customer risk
profile, stricter underwriting  criteria and certain regulatory changes in Korea where, as previously disclosed,  policy
actions, including rate caps and other initiatives, have been implemented  to slow the growth of consumer credit in that
market, thus impacting volume  growth, lending rates and fees. Spread compression is expected to continue to  have a negative
impact on net interest revenue as regulatory pressure and low  interest rates persist. Non-interest revenue increased 6%,
reflecting growth in  Citi-branded cards purchase sales, partially offset by a decrease in revenue  from foreign exchange
products. Despite the continued spread compression and  regulatory changes
in the region, the underlying business metrics continued to  grow, with average retail loans up 6% and average card loans up
2%.

Expenses

increased 4%, primarily due to approximately $78 million of  repositioning charges in the fourth quarter of 2012, largely in
Korea, and  increased investment spending, including China cards and branches, higher  volume-driven expenses and increased
regulatory costs.

Provisions

decreased
1%, reflecting continued overall credit quality improvement.  Net credit losses continued to improve, declining 3% due to the
ongoing  improvement in credit quality. Citi believes that net credit losses in

Asia
RCB

will largely remain stable, with increases  largely in line with portfolio
growth.

2011 vs. 2010

Net income

decreased 12%, driven by higher operating expenses, lower loan loss
reserve releases and a higher effective tax rate, partially offset by higher
revenue. The higher effective tax rate was due to lower tax benefits Accounting
Principles Bulletin (APB) 23 and a tax charge of $66 million due to a write-down
in the value of deferred tax assets due to a change in the tax law, each in
Japan.

Revenues

increased 4%,
primarily driven by higher business volumes, partially offset by continued
spread compression and $65 million of net charges relating to the repurchase of
certain Lehman structured notes. Net interest revenue increased 1%, as
investment initiatives and economic growth in the region drove higher lending
and deposit volumes. Spread compression continued to partly offset the benefit
of higher balances and continued to be driven by stricter underwriting criteria,
resulting in a lowering of the risk profile for personal and other loans.
Non-interest revenue increased 10%, primarily due to a 9% increase in
Citi-branded cards purchase sales and higher revenues from foreign exchange
products, partially offset by a 16% decrease in investment sales,
particularly in the second half of 2011, and the net charges for the repurchase
of certain Lehman structured notes.

Expenses

increased
8%, due to investment spending, growth in business volumes, repositioning
charges and higher legal and related costs, partially offset by ongoing
productivity savings.

Provisions

increased 5% as
lower loan loss reserve releases were partially offset by lower net credit
losses. The increase in provisions reflected increasing volumes in the region,
partially offset by continued credit quality improvement. India was a
significant driver of the improvement in credit quality, as it continued to
de-risk elements of its legacy portfolio.

2012 vs. 2011

Net income

decreased 10%. Excluding $2.5 billion of negative CVA/DVA (see table
below), net income increased 56%, primarily driven by a 13% increase in
revenues.

Revenues

decreased 8%,
driven by the negative CVA/DVA and mark-to-market losses on hedges related to
accrual loans. Excluding CVA/DVA:

Revenues increased 13%, reflecting
  higher revenues in most major

S&B

businesses.
  Overall, Citi gained wallet share during 2012 in most

major products and regions, while maintaining
  what it believes to be a

disciplined risk appetite for the market
  environment.

Fixed income markets revenues
  increased 28%, reflecting strong

performance in rates and currencies and higher revenues in
  credit-related

and securitized
  products. These results reflected an improved market

environment and more balanced trading flows,
  particularly in the

second half of
  2012. Rates and currencies performance reflected strong

client and trading results in G-10 FX, G-10
  rates and Citi’s local markets

franchise. Credit products, securitized markets and municipals
  products

experienced improved
  trading results, particularly in the second half of

2012, compared to the prior-year period. Citi’s
  position serving corporate

clients
  for markets products also contributed to the strength and diversity

of client flows.

Equity markets revenues increased 1%, due to improved derivatives performance as well as
         the absence of proprietary trading losses in 2011, partially offset by lower cash equity volumes that impacted the industry
         as a whole. Citi’s improved performance in derivatives reflected improved trading and continued progress in capturing
         additional client wallet share.

Investment banking revenues increased
  10%, reflecting increases in

debt
  underwriting and advisory revenues, partially offset by lower equity

underwriting revenues. Debt underwriting
  revenues rose 18%, driven by

increases in investment grade and high yield bond issuances.
  Advisory

revenues increased 4%,
  despite the overall reduction in market activity

during the year. Equity underwriting revenues
  declined 7%, driven by

lower levels
  of market and client activity.

Lending revenues decreased 45%, driven
  by the mark-to-market losses

on
  hedges related to accrual loans (see table below). The loss on lending

hedges compared to a gain in the prior
  year, resulted from CDS spreads

narrowing during 2012. Excluding lending hedges related to
  accrual

loans, lending revenues
  increased 31%, primarily driven by growth in the

Corporate loan portfolio and improved spreads in
  most regions.

Private Bank revenues increased 8%,
  driven by growth in client assets as a

result of client acquisition and development efforts in Citi’s targeted
  client

segments. Deposit volumes,
  investment assets under management and

loans all increased, while pricing and product mix optimization
  initiatives

offset underlying
  spread compression across products.

Expenses

decreased 4%.
Excluding repositioning charges of $349 million in 2012 (including $237 million
in the fourth quarter of 2012) compared to $267 million in 2011, expenses also
decreased 4%, driven by efficiency savings from ongoing re-engineering programs
and lower compensation costs. The repositioning efforts in

S&B

announced in the fourth quarter of 2012 are designed to streamline

S&B

’s client coverage model and improve overall
productivity.

Provisions

increased 5% to $122 million, primarily reflecting lower loan loss reserve
releases, partially offset by lower net credit losses, both due to portfolio
stabilization.


2011 vs. 2010

Net income

decreased 24%. Excluding $1.7 billion of positive CVA/DVA (see table
below), net income decreased 43%, primarily driven by lower revenues in most
products and higher expenses.

Revenues

decreased 7%, driven by lower revenues partially offset by positive
CVA/DVA resulting from the widening of Citi’s credit spreads in 2011. Excluding
CVA/DVA:

Revenues decreased 16%, reflecting
  lower revenues in fixed income

markets, equity markets and investment banking
  revenues.

Fixed income markets revenues
  decreased 24%, due to significant year-

over-year declines in spread products and, to a lesser extent, a
  decline in

rates and currencies
  reflecting adverse market conditions, particularly

during the second half of 2011 when the trading
  environment was

significantly more
  challenging. The declines in trading volumes made

hedging and market-making more challenging,
  particularly in less

liquid
  products such as credit, securitized markets, and municipals. Citi’s

concerted effort to reduce overall risk
  positions to respond to a decline

in liquidity, particularly in the latter half of 2011, also contributed
  to

the decrease.

Equity markets revenues decreased 35%,
  driven by declining revenues in

equity proprietary trading as positions in the business were wound
  down,

a decline in equity
  derivatives revenues and, to a lesser extent, a decline

in cash equities. The wind-down of Citi’s equity
  proprietary trading was

completed
  at the end of 2011. Also, equity markets experienced adverse

market conditions during the second half of
  2011.

Investment banking revenues decreased
  14%, as the macroeconomic

concerns
  and market uncertainty drove lower volumes in debt and equity

issuance and declines in equity underwriting,
  debt underwriting, and

advisory
  revenues. Equity underwriting revenues declined 28%, largely

driven by the absence of strong IPO activity in
  Asia in the fourth quarter

of 2010.
  Debt underwriting declined 10%, primarily due to lower bond

issuance activity. Advisory revenues declined
  5%, due to lower levels of

client
  activity.

Lending revenues increased 86%, driven
  by a mark-to-market gain in

hedges
  related to accrual loans (see table below), resulting from CDS

spreads widening during 2011. Excluding lending
  hedges related to

accrual loans,
  lending revenues increased 25%, primarily due to growth

in the Corporate loan portfolio in all
  regions.

Private Bank revenues increased 6%,
  driven by growth in both lending

and deposit products and improved customer spreads.

Expenses

increased 3%,
primarily due to investment spending, which largely occurred in the first half
of 2011, relating to new hires and technology investments. The increase in
expenses was also driven by higher repositioning charges and the negative impact
of FX translation (which contributed approximately 2% to the expense growth),
partially offset by productivity saves and reduced incentive compensation due to
business results. The increase in the level of investment spending in

S&B

was largely completed at the end of
2011.

Provisions

increased $140 million, primarily due to builds in
the allowance for unfunded lending commitments as a result of portfolio growth
and higher net credit losses.

Hedges on

S&B

accrual loans
      reflect the mark-to-market on credit derivatives used to hedge the
      corporate loan accrual portfolio. The fixed premium cost of these hedges
      is included (netted against) the core lending revenues to reflect the cost
      of the credit protection.

The discussion of the
results of operations for Transaction Services below
excludes the impact of FX translation for all periods presented. Presentation of
the results of operations, excluding the impact of FX translation, are non-GAAP
financial measures. Citi believes the presentation of Transaction Services’ results excluding the impact of FX translation is
a more meaningful depiction of the underlying fundamentals of the business. For
a reconciliation of certain of these metrics to the reported results, see the
table above.

2012 vs. 2011

Net income

increased 10%, reflecting growth in revenues, partially offset by higher
expenses and credit costs.

Revenues

increased 5% as higher trade loan and deposit balances were partially
offset by continued spread compression and lower market volumes. Treasury and
Trade Solutions revenues were up 8%, driven by growth in trade as end-of-period
trade loans grew 23%. Cash management revenues also grew, reflecting growth in
deposit balances and fees, partially offset by continued spread compression due
to the continued low interest rate environment. Securities and Fund Services
revenues decreased 2%, primarily driven by lower market volumes as well as
spread compression on deposits. Citi expects spread compression will continue to
negatively impact

Transaction
Services

.

Expenses

increased 2%. Excluding repositioning charges of $134 million in 2012
(including $95 million in the fourth quarter of 2012) compared to $60 million in
2011, expenses were flat, primarily driven by incremental investment spending
and higher legal and related costs, offset by efficiency savings.

Average deposits and other customer liabilities

grew 13%, driven by focused deposit building activities as well as continued
market demand for U.S. dollar deposits (for additional information on Citi’s
deposits, see “Capital Resources and Liquidity—Funding and Liquidity”
below).

2011 vs. 2010

Net income

decreased 11%, as higher expenses, driven by investment spending,
outpaced revenue growth.

Revenues

grew 3%, driven
primarily by international growth, as improvement in fees and increased deposit
balances more than offset the continued spread compression. Treasury and Trade Solutions revenues increased 4%, driven primarily by growth
in the trade and commercial cards businesses and increased deposits, partially
offset by the impact of the continued low rate environment. Securities and Fund Services revenues increased 1%, primarily due to growth in
transaction and settlement volumes, driven in part by the increase in activity
resulting from market volatility, and new client mandates.

Expenses

increased 14%, reflecting investment spending and higher business
volumes, partially offset by productivity savings.

Average deposits and other customer liabilities

grew 7% and included the shift to operating balances as the business
continued to emphasize more stable, lower cost deposits as a way to mitigate
spread compression (for additional information on Citi’s deposits, see “Capital
Resources and Liquidity—Funding and Liquidity” below).


CORPORATE/OTHER

Corporate/Other

includes
unallocated global staff functions (including finance, risk, human resources,
legal and compliance), other corporate expenses and unallocated global
operations and technology expenses, Corporate Treasury and discontinued
operations. At December 31, 2012, this segment had approximately $249 billion of
assets, or 13%, of Citigroup’s total assets, consisting primarily of Citi’s
liquidity portfolio (approximately $46 billion of cash and cash equivalents and
$145 billion of liquid available-for-sale securities, each as of December 31,
2012).

2012 vs. 2011

The net loss increased by $1.3 billion due to a
decrease in revenues and an increase in repositioning charges and legal and
related expenses. The net loss increased despite a $582 million tax benefit
related to the resolution of certain tax audit items in the third quarter of
2012 (see the “Executive Summary” above for a discussion of this tax benefit as
well as the impact of minority investments on the results of operations of

Corporate/Other

during 2012, also as discussed
below).

Revenues

decreased $693
million, driven by an other-than-temporary impairment of pretax $(1.2) billion
on Citi’s investment in Akbank and a loss of pretax $424 million on the partial
sale of Akbank, as well as lower investment yields on Citi’s treasury portfolio
and the negative impact of hedging activities. These negative impacts to
revenues were partially offset by an aggregate pretax gain on the sales of
Citi’s remaining interest in HDFC and its interest in SPDB.

Expenses

increased by $921 million, largely driven by higher legal and related
costs, as well as higher repositioning charges, including $253 million in the
fourth quarter of 2012.

2011 vs. 2010

The net loss of $589 million reflected a decline
of $811 million compared to net income of $222 million in 2010. This decline was
primarily due to lower revenues and higher expenses.

Revenues

decreased $869 million, primarily driven by lower investment yields on
Citi’s treasury portfolio and lower gains on sales of available-for-sale
securities, partially offset by gains on hedging activities and the gain on the
sale of a portion of Citi’s holdings in HDFC (see the “Executive Summary”
above).

Expenses

increased $787 million, due to higher legal and
related costs and investment spending, primarily in
technology.


CITI HOLDINGS

Citi Holdings contains
businesses and portfolios of assets that Citigroup has determined are not
central to its core Citicorp businesses and consists of

Brokerage and Asset Management, Local Consumer
Lending

and

Special Asset Pool

.

Consistent with its strategy, Citi intends to continue to exit these
businesses and portfolios as quickly as practicable in an economically rational
manner. Citi Holdings assets have declined by approximately $302 billion since
the end of 2009. To date, the decrease in Citi Holdings assets has been
primarily driven by asset sales and business dispositions, as well as portfolio
run-off and pay-downs. Asset levels have also been impacted, and will continue
to be impacted, by charge-offs and fair value marks as and when appropriate.
Citi expects the wind-down of the assets in Citi Holdings will continue,
although likely at a slower pace than experienced over the past several years as
Citi has already disposed of some of the larger operating businesses within Citi
Holdings (see also “Risk Factors—Business and Operational Risks”
below).

As of December 31, 2012, Citi
Holdings assets were approximately $156 billion, a decrease of approximately 31%
year-over-year and a decrease of 9% from September 30, 2012. The decline in
assets of $69 billion in 2012 was composed of a decline of approximately $17
billion related to MSSB (primarily consisting of $6.6 billion related to the
sale of Citi’s 14% interest and impairment on the remaining investment and
approximately $11 billion of margin loans), $18 billion of other asset sales and
business dispositions, $30 billion of run-off and pay-downs and $4 billion of
charge-offs and fair value marks. Citi Holdings represented approximately 8% of
Citi’s assets as of December 31, 2012, while Citi Holdings risk-weighted assets
(as defined under current regulatory guidelines) of approximately $144 billion
at December 31, 2012 represented approximately 15% of Citi’s risk-weighted
assets as of that date.

BROKERAGE AND ASSET
MANAGEMENT

Brokerage and Asset
Management (BAM)

primarily
consists of Citi’s remaining investment in, and assets related to, MSSB. At
December 31, 2012,

BAM

had approximately $9
billion of assets, or approximately 6% of Citi Holdings assets, of which
approximately $8 billion related to MSSB. During 2012,

BAM

’s assets declined 67% due to the decline in assets related to MSSB (see
discussion below). At December 31, 2012, the MSSB assets were composed of an
approximate $4.7 billion equity investment and $3 billion of other MSSB
financing (consisting of approximately $2 billion of preferred stock and $1
billion of loans). For information on the agreement entered into with Morgan
Stanley regarding MSSB on September 11, 2012, see Citigroup’s Current Report on
Form 8-K filed with the SEC on September 11, 2012. The remaining assets in

BAM

2012 vs. 2011

The net loss in

BAM

increased by $2.9 billion due to the loss related to MSSB, consisting of
(i) an $800 million after-tax loss on Citi’s sale of the 14% interest in MSSB to
Morgan Stanley and (ii) a $2.1 billion after-tax other-than-temporary impairment
of the carrying value of Citigroup’s remaining 35% interest in MSSB. For
additional information on MSSB, see Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements. Excluding the impact of MSSB, the net loss in

BAM

was flat.

Revenues

decreased by $5.0 billion to $(4.7) billion due
to the MSSB impact described above. Excluding this impact, revenues in

BAM

were $(15) million, compared to $282 million in
the prior-year period, due to higher funding costs related to MSSB assets, partially
offset by a higher equity contribution from MSSB.

Expenses

decreased
37%, primarily driven by lower legal and related costs.

Provisions

decreased by $49 million due to the absence of certain unfunded lending
commitments.

2011 vs. 2010

The net loss increased 24% as lower revenues were
partly offset by lower expenses.

Revenues

decreased by 54%,
driven by the 2010 sale of Citi’s Habitat and Colfondos businesses (including a
$78 million pretax gain on sale related to the transactions in the first quarter
of 2010) and lower revenues from MSSB.

Expenses

decreased 26%,
also driven by divestitures, as well as lower legal and related
expenses.

Provisions

increased 55%, primarily due to the absence of
the prior-year reserve releases.


LOCAL CONSUMER LENDING

Local Consumer Lending
(LCL)

includes a substantial
portion of Citigroup’s

North
America

mortgage business (see
“North America Consumer Mortgage Lending” below), CitiFinancial North America
(consisting of the OneMain and CitiFinancial Servicing businesses), remaining
student loans and credit card portfolios, and other local consumer finance
businesses globally (including Western European cards and retail banking and
Japan Consumer Finance). At December 31, 2012,

LCL

consisted of approximately $126 billion of assets (with approximately $123
billion in

North
America

), or approximately 81% of
Citi Holdings assets, and thus represents the largest segment within Citi
Holdings. The

North
America

assets primarily consist
of residential mortgages (residential first mortgages and home equity loans),
which stood at $92 billion as of December 31, 2012.

4.69

%

5.16

%

2012 vs. 2011

The net loss decreased by 28%, driven mainly by
the improved credit environment primarily in

North America

mortgages.

Revenues

decreased 20%,
primarily due to a 22% net interest revenue decline resulting from a 24% decline
in loan balances. This decline was driven by continued asset sales, divestitures
and run-off. Non-interest revenue decreased 12%, primarily due to portfolio
run-off, partially offset by a lower repurchase reserve build. The repurchase
reserve build was $700 million compared to $945 million in 2011 (see “Managing
Global Risk—Credit Risk—Citigroup Residential Mortgages—Representations and
Warranties” below).

Expenses

decreased 18%,
driven by lower volumes and divestitures. Legal and related expenses in

LCL

remained elevated due to the previously disclosed
$305 million charge in the fourth quarter of 2012, related to the settlement
agreement reached with the Federal Reserve Board and OCC regarding the
independent foreclosure review process required by the Federal Reserve Board and
OCC consent orders entered into in April 2011 (see “Managing

Global Risk—Credit
Risk—

North America

Consumer Mortgage Lending—Independent Foreclosure
Review Settlement” below). In addition, legal and related expenses were elevated
due to additional reserves related to payment protection insurance (PPI) (see
“Payment Protection Insurance” below) and other legal and related matters
impacting the business.

Provisions

decreased 25%,
driven primarily by the improved credit environment in

North America

mortgages, lower volumes and divestitures. Net
credit losses decreased by 22%, despite being impacted by incremental
charge-offs of approximately $635 million in the third quarter of 2012 relating
to OCC guidance regarding the treatment of mortgage loans where the borrower has
gone through Chapter 7 bankruptcy (see Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements) and $370 million of incremental charge-offs in the first quarter of
2012 related to previously deferred principal balances on modified mortgages
related to anticipated forgiveness of principal in connection with the national
mortgage settlement. Substantially all of these charge-offs were offset by
reserve releases. In addition, net credit losses in 2012 were negatively
impacted by an additional aggregate amount


of $146 million related to the
national mortgage settlement. Citi expects that net credit losses in

LCL

will continue to be negatively impacted by Citi’s
fulfillment of the terms of the national mortgage settlement through the second
quarter of 2013 (see “Managing Global Risk—Credit Risk—National Mortgage
Settlement” below).

Excluding the incremental charge-offs arising from the OCC guidance and
the previously deferred balances on modified mortgages, net credit losses
in

LCL

would have declined 35%, with net credit losses
in

North America

mortgages decreasing by 20%, other portfolios
in

North America

by 56% and international by 49%. These declines
were driven by lower overall asset levels driven partly by the sale of
delinquent loans as well as underlying credit improvements. While Citi expects
some continued improvement in credit going forward, declines in net credit
losses in

LCL

will largely be driven by declines in asset
levels, including continued sales of delinquent residential first mortgages (see
“Managing Global Risk—Credit Risk—

North America

Consumer
Mortgage Lending—

North
America

Consumer Mortgage
Quarterly Credit Trends” below).

Average assets

declined
24%, driven by the impact of asset sales and portfolio run-off, including
declines of $16 billion in

North
America

mortgage loans and $11
billion in international average assets.

2011 vs. 2010

The net loss decreased 18%, driven primarily by
the improving credit environment, including lower net credit losses and higher
loan loss reserve releases in mortgages. The improvement in credit was partly
offset by lower revenues due to decreasing asset balances and sales.

Revenues

decreased 38%, driven primarily by the lower asset balances due to asset
sales, divestitures and run-offs, which also drove the 40% decline in net
interest revenue. Non-interest revenue decreased 30% due to the impact of
divestitures. The repurchase reserve build was $945 million compared to $917
million in 2010.

Expenses

decreased 6%, driven by the lower volumes and
divestitures, partly offset by higher legal and related expenses, including
those relating to the national mortgage settlement, reserves related to
potential PPI refunds (see “Payment Protection Insurance” below) and
implementation costs associated with the Federal Reserve Board and OCC consent
orders (see “Managing Global Risk—Credit Risk—

North America

Consumer Mortgage Lending—National Mortgage
Settlement” below).

Provisions

decreased 43%,
driven by lower credit losses and higher loan loss reserve releases. Net credit
losses decreased 37%, primarily due to the credit improvements of $1.6 billion
in

North America

mortgages, although the pace of the decline in
net credit losses slowed. Loan loss reserve releases increased 85%, driven by
higher releases in CitiFinancial North America due to better credit quality and
lower loan balances.

Average

assets declined
34%, primarily driven by portfolio run-off and the impact of asset sales and
divestitures, including continued sales of student loans, auto loans and
delinquent mortgages.


Japan Consumer Finance

Citi continues to actively
monitor various aspects of its Japan Consumer Finance business, including
customer defaults, refund claims and litigation, as well as financial,
legislative, regulatory, judicial and other political developments, relating to
the charging of “gray zone” interest. Gray zone interest represents interest at
rates that are legal but for which claims may not be enforceable. In 2008, Citi
decided to exit its Japan Consumer Finance business and has liquidated
approximately 85% of the portfolio since that time. As of December 31, 2012,
Citi’s Japan Consumer Finance business had approximately $709 million in
outstanding loans that currently charge or have previously charged interest
rates in the gray zone, compared to approximately $2.1 billion as of December
31, 2011. However, Citi could also be subject to refund claims on previously
outstanding loans that charged gray zone interest and thus could be subject to
losses on loans in excess of these amounts.

During 2012,

LCL

recorded a net
decrease in its reserves related to customer refunds in the Japan Consumer
Finance business of approximately $117 million (pretax) compared to an increase
in reserves of approximately $119 million (pretax) in 2011. At December 31,
2012, Citi’s reserves related to customer refunds in the Japan Consumer Finance
business were approximately $736 million. Although Citi recorded a net decrease
in its reserves in 2012, the charging of gray zone interest continues to be a
focus in Japan. Regulators in Japan have stated that they are planning to submit
legislation to establish a framework for collective legal action proceedings. If
such legislation is passed and implemented, it could potentially introduce a
more accessible procedure for current and former customers to pursue refund
claims.

Citi continues to monitor and
evaluate these developments and the potential impact to both currently and
previously outstanding loans in this business and its reserves related thereto.
The potential amount of losses and their impact on Citi is subject to
significant uncertainty and continues to be difficult to predict.

Payment Protection
Insurance

The alleged
misselling of PPI by financial institutions in the U.K. has been, and continues to
be, the subject of intense review and focus by U.K. regulators, particularly the
Financial Services Authority (FSA). The FSA has found certain problems across
the industry with how these products were sold, including customers not
realizing that the cost of PPI premiums was being added to their loan or PPI
being unsuitable for the customer.

PPI is designed to cover a customer’s loan repayments if certain events
occur, such as long-term illness or unemployment. Prior to 2008, certain of
Citi’s U.K. consumer finance businesses, primarily CitiFinancial Europe plc and
Canada Square Operations Ltd (formerly Egg Banking plc), engaged in the sale of
PPI. While Citi has sold a significant portion of these businesses, and the
remaining businesses are in the process of wind down, Citi generally remains
subject to customer complaints for, and retains the potential liability relating
to, the sale of PPI by these businesses.

In
2011, the FSA required all firms engaged in the sale of PPI in the U.K. to review
their historical sales processes for PPI. In addition, the FSA is requiring all
such firms to contact proactively any customers who may have been mis-sold PPI
after January 2005 and invite them to have their individual sale reviewed
(Customer Contact Exercise).

Citi initiated a pilot Customer Contact Exercise during the third quarter
of 2012 and expects to initiate the full Customer Contact Exercise during the
first quarter of 2013; however, the timing and details of the Customer Contact
Exercise are subject to discussion and agreement with the FSA. While Citi is not
required to contact customers proactively for the sale of PPI prior to January
2005, it is still subject to customer complaints for those sales.

During the third quarter of 2012, the FSA also
requested that a number of firms, including Citi, re-evaluate PPI customer
complaints that were reviewed and rejected prior to December 2010 to determine
if, based on the current regulations for the assessment of PPI complaints,
customers would have been entitled to redress (Customer Re-Evaluation Exercise).
Citi currently expects to complete the Customer Re-Evaluation Exercise by the
end of the first quarter of 2013.

Redress, whether as a result of customer complaints pursuant to or
outside of the required Customer Contact Exercise, or pursuant to the Customer
Re-Evaluation Exercise, generally involves the repayment of premiums and the
refund of all applicable contractual interest together with compensatory
interest of 8%. Citi estimates that the number of PPI policies sold after
January 2005 (across all applicable Citi businesses in the U.K.) was approximately
417,000, for which premiums totaling approximately $490 million were collected.
As noted above, however, Citi also remains subject to customer complaints on the
sale of PPI prior to January 2005, and thus it could be subject to customer
complaints substantially higher than this amount.

During 2012, Citi increased its PPI reserves by
approximately $266 million ($175 million of which was recorded in

LCL

and $91 million of which was recorded in

Corporate/Other

for discontinued operations). This amount
included a $148 million reserve increase in the fourth quarter of 2012 ($57
million of which was recorded in

LCL

and $91 million of
which was recorded in

Corporate/Other

for
discontinued operations). PPI claims paid during 2012 totaled $181 million,
which were charged against the reserve. The increase in the reserves during 2012
was mainly due to a significant increase in the level of customer complaints
outside of the Customer Contact Exercise, which Citi believes is largely as a
result of the continued regulatory focus and increased customer awareness of PPI
issues across the industry. The fourth quarter of 2012 reserve increase was also
driven by a higher than anticipated rate of response to the pilot Customer
Contact Exercise, which Citi believes was also likely due in part to the
heightened awareness of PPI issues. At December 31, 2012, Citi’s PPI reserve was
$376 million.

While the number
of customer complaints regarding the sale of PPI significantly increased in
2012, and the number could continue to increase, the potential losses and impact
on Citi remain volatile and are subject to significant
uncertainty.


SPECIAL ASSET POOL

The

Special Asset Pool (SAP)

consists of a portfolio of securities, loans and
other assets that Citigroup intends to continue to reduce over time through
asset sales and portfolio run-off.

SAP

had approximately $21
billion of assets as of December 31, 2012, which constituted approximately 13%
of Citi Holdings assets.

2012 vs. 2011

The net loss of $177 million reflected a decline
of $665 million compared to net income of $488 million in 2011, mainly driven by
a decrease in revenues and higher credit costs, partially offset by a tax
benefit on the sale of a business in 2012.

Revenues

were $(500)
million. CVA/DVA was $157 million, compared to $74 million in 2011. Excluding
the impact of CVA/DVA, revenues in

SAP

were $(657) million,
compared to $473 million in 2011. The decline in revenues was driven in part by
lower non-interest revenue due to the absence of positive private equity marks
and lower gains on asset sales, as well as an aggregate repurchase reserve build
in 2012 of approximately $244 million related to private-label mortgage
securitizations (see “Managing Global Risk—Credit Risk—Citigroup Residential
Mortgages—Representations and Warranties” below). The loss in net interest
revenues improved from the prior year due to lower funding costs, but remained
negative. Citi expects continued negative net interest revenues, as interest
earning assets continue to be a smaller portion of the overall asset
pool.

Expenses

increased 11%, driven by higher legal and related
costs, partially offset by lower expenses from lower volume and asset
levels.

Provisions

were a benefit of $224 million, which represented
a 73% decline from 2011 due to a decrease in loan loss reserve releases (a
release of $140 million compared to a release of $1.9 billion in 2011),
partially offset by a $1.1 billion decline in net credit losses.

Assets

declined 49% to $21 billion, primarily driven by sales, amortization and
prepayments. Asset sales of $11 billion generated pretax gains of approximately
$0.3 billion, compared to asset sales of $29 billion and pretax gains of $0.5
billion in 2011.

2011 vs. 2010

Net income

decreased 50%, driven by the decrease in revenues due to lower asset
balances, partially offset by lower expenses and improved
credit.

Revenues

decreased 81%,
driven by the overall decline in net interest revenue during the year, as
interest-earning assets declined and thus represented a smaller portion of the
overall asset pool. Non-interest revenue decreased by 42% due to lower gains on
asset sales and the absence of positive private equity marks from the prior-year
period.

Expenses

decreased 49%, driven by lower volume and asset
levels, as well as lower legal and related costs.

Provisions

were a benefit of $827 million, which represented an improvement of $1.1
billion from the prior year, as credit conditions improved during 2011. The
improvement was primarily driven by a $945 million decrease in net credit losses
as well as an increase in loan loss reserve releases.

Assets

declined 49%, primarily driven by sales, amortization and prepayments.
Asset sales of $29 billion generated pretax gains of approximately $0.5 billion,
compared to asset sales of $39 billion and pretax gains of $1.3 billion in
2010.

ASSETS

Cash and Deposits with
Banks

Cash and deposits
with banks

is composed of both

Cash and due from banks

and

Deposits with banks. Cash and due from banks

includes (i) cash on hand at
Citi’s domestic and overseas offices, and (ii) non-interest-bearing balances due
from banks, including non-interest-bearing demand deposit accounts with
correspondent banks, central banks (such as the Federal Reserve Bank), and other
banks or depository institutions for normal operating purposes.

Deposits with banks

includes interest-bearing balances, demand
deposits and time deposits held in or due from banks (including correspondent
banks, central banks and other banks or depository institutions) maintained for,
among other things, normal operating and regulatory reserve requirement
purposes.

During 2012, cash and deposits
with banks decreased $45 billion, or 24%, driven by a $53 billion, or 34%,
decrease in deposits with banks

offset by an $8 billion, or 27%,
increase in cash and due from banks. The purposeful reduction in cash and
deposits with banks was in keeping with Citi’s continued strategy to deleverage
the balance sheet and deploy excess cash into investments. The overall decline
resulted from cash used to repay long-term debt maturities (net of modest
issuances) and to reduce other long-term debt and short-term borrowings
(including the redemption of trust preferred

securities and debt
repurchases), the funding of asset growth in the Citicorp businesses (including
continued lending to both Consumer and Corporate clients), as well as the
reinvestment of cash into higher yielding available-for-sale (AFS) securities.
These uses of cash were partially offset by the cash generated by the $65
billion increase in customer deposits over the course of 2012, as well as cash
generated from asset sales, primarily in Citi Holdings (including the $1.89
billion paid to Citi by Morgan Stanley for the 14% interest in MSSB, as
described under “Citi Holdings—Brokerage and Asset Management” and in Note 15 to
the Consolidated Financial Statements), and from Citi’s operations.

The $65 billion, or 32%, decline in cash and
deposits with banks during the fourth quarter of 2012 was similarly driven by
cash used to repay short-term borrowings and long-term debt obligations and the
redeployment of excess cash into investments. The reduction during the fourth
quarter also reflected a net decline in client deposits that was expected during
the quarter and reflected the run-off of episodic deposits that came in at the
end of the third quarter and the outflows of deposits related to the Transaction
Account Guarantee (TAG) program, partially offset by deposit growth in the
normal course of business. These deposit changes are discussed further under
“Capital Resources and Liquidity—Funding and Liquidity”
below.


Federal Funds Sold and Securities
Borrowed or

Purchased Under Agreements
to Resell (Reverse Repos)

Federal funds sold consist of unsecured advances to third parties of
excess balances in reserve accounts held at the Federal Reserve Banks. During
2011 and 2012, Citi’s federal funds sold were not significant.

Reverse repos and securities borrowing
transactions decreased by $15 billion, or 5%, during 2012, and declined $17
billion, or 6%, compared to the third quarter of 2012. The majority of this
decrease was due to changes in the mix of assets within certain

Securities and Banking

businesses between reverse repos and trading
account assets.

For further information
regarding these balance sheet categories, see Notes 1 and 12 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements.

Trading Account
Assets

Trading account
assets

includes debt and
marketable equity securities, derivatives in a net receivable position, residual
interests in securitizations and physical commodities inventory. In addition,
certain assets that Citigroup has elected to carry at fair value, such as
certain loans and purchase guarantees, are also included in

Trading account assets

.

During 2012, trading account assets increased $29 billion, or 10%,
primarily due to increases in equity securities ($24 billion, or 72%), foreign
government securities ($10 billion, or 12%), and mortgage-backed securities ($4
billion, or 13%), partially offset by an $8 billion, or 12%, decrease in
derivative assets. A significant portion of the increase in Citi’s trading
account assets (approximately half of which occurred in the first quarter of
2012, with the remainder of the growth occurring steadily during the rest of
2012) was the reversal of reductions in trading positions during the second half
of 2011 as a result of the economic uncertainty that largely began in the third
quarter of 2011 and continued into the fourth quarter. During 2011, Citi reduced
its rates trading in the G10, particularly in Europe, given the market
environment in the region, and credit trading and securitized markets also
declined due to reduced client volume and less market liquidity. In 2012, the
increases in trading assets and the assets classes noted above were the result
of a more favorable market environment and more robust trading activities, as
well as a change in the asset mix of positions held in certain equities
businesses.

Average trading account assets
were $251 billion in 2012, compared to $270 billion in 2011. The decrease versus
the prior year reflected the higher levels of trading assets (excluding
derivative assets) during the first half of 2011, prior to the de-risking and
market-related reductions noted above.

For further information on Citi’s trading account assets, see Notes 1 and
14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Investments

Investments

consist of
debt and equity securities that are available-for-sale, debt securities that are
held-to-maturity, non-marketable equity securities that are carried at fair
value, and non-marketable equity securities carried at cost. Debt securities
include bonds, notes and redeemable preferred stock, as well as certain
mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities and other structured notes.
Marketable and non-marketable equity securities carried at fair value include
common and nonredeemable preferred stock. Nonmarketable equity securities
carried at cost primarily include equity shares issued by the Federal Reserve
Bank and the Federal Home Loan Banks that Citigroup is required to
hold.

During 2012, investments increased by
$19 billion, or 6%, primarily due to a $23 billion, or 9%, increase in AFS,
predominantly foreign government and U.S. Treasury securities, partially offset
by a $1 billion decrease in held-to-maturity securities. The majority of this
increase occurred during the fourth quarter of 2012, where investments increased
$17 billion, or 6%, in total. The increase in AFS was part of the continued
balance sheet strategy to redeploy excess cash into higher-yielding
investments.

As
noted above, the increase in AFS included growth in foreign government
securities (as the increase in deposits in many countries resulted in higher
liquid resources and drove the investment in foreign government AFS, primarily
in

Asia

and

Latin America

) and U.S.
Treasury securities. This growth and reallocation was supplemented by smaller
increases in mortgage-backed securities (both U.S. government agency MBS and
non-U.S. residential MBS), municipal securities and other asset-backed
securities, partially offset by a reduction in U.S. federal agency
securities.

For
further information regarding investments, see Notes 1 and 15 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements.


Loans

Loans

represent the largest asset category of Citi’s balance sheet. Citi’s
total loans (as discussed throughout this section, are presented net of unearned
income) were $655 billion at December 31, 2012, compared to $647 billion at
December 31, 2011. Excluding the impact of FX translation, loans increased 1%
year-over-year. At year-end 2012, Consumer and Corporate loans represented 62%
and 38%, respectively, of Citi’s total loans.

In Citicorp, loans were up 7% to $540 billion at year end 2012, as
compared to $507 billion at the end of 2011. Citicorp Corporate loans increased
11% year-over-year, and Citicorp Consumer loans were up 3%
year-over-year.

Corporate loan growth was driven by

Transaction Services

(25% growth), particularly from increased trade
finance lending in most regions, as well as growth in the

Securities and Banking

Corporate loan book (6% growth), with increased
borrowing generally across most segments and regions. Growth in Corporate lending
included increases in Private Bank and certain middle-market client segments
overseas, with other Corporate lending segments down slightly as compared to
year-end 2011. During 2012, Citi continued to optimize the Corporate lending
portfolio, including selling certain loans that did not fit its target market
profile.

Consumer loan growth was
driven by

Global

Consumer Banking

, as loans
increased 3% year-over-year, led by

Latin America

and

Asia. North
America

Consumer loans decreased
1%, driven by declines in card loans, as the cards market reflected overall
consumer deleveraging as well as other regulatory changes. Retail lending in

North America

, however, increased 10% year-over-year, as a
result of higher real estate lending as well as growth in the commercial
segment.

In contrast, Citi Holdings
loans declined 18% year-over-year, due to the continued run-off and asset sales
in the portfolios.

During 2012, average loans of $649 billion yielded an average rate of
7.5%, compared to $644 billion and 7.8%, respectively, in the prior year. For
further information on Citi’s loan portfolios, see generally “Managing Global
Risk—Credit Risk” below and Notes 1 and 16 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements.

Other
Assets

Other assets

consists of

Brokerage receivables, Goodwill,
Intangibles

and

Mortgage servicing rights

in addition to

Other assets

(including, among other items, loans
held-for-sale, deferred tax assets, equity-method investments, interest and fees
receivable, premises and equipment, certain end-user derivatives in a net
receivable position, repossessed assets and other receivables).

During 2012, other assets decreased $10 billion,
or 5%, primarily due to a $5 billion decrease in brokerage receivables, a $3
billion decrease in other assets, a $1 billion decrease in mortgage servicing
rights (see “Managing Global Risk—Credit Risk—

North America

Consumer Mortgage Lending—Mortgage Servicing
Rights” below), and a $1 billion decrease in intangible assets.

For further information on brokerage receivables,
see Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. For further information
regarding goodwill and intangible assets, see Note 18 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements.

LIABILITIES

Deposits

Deposits

represent customer funds that are payable on demand or upon maturity.
For a discussion of Citi’s deposits, see “Capital Resources and
Liquidity—Funding and Liquidity” below.

Federal Funds Purchased and Securities
Loaned or Sold

Under Agreements to Repurchase (Repos)

Federal funds purchased consist of unsecured
advances of excess balances in reserve accounts held at the Federal Reserve
Banks from third parties. During 2011 and 2012, Citi’s federal funds purchased
were not significant.

For further information on Citi’s secured
financing transactions, including repos and securities lending transactions, see
“Capital Resources and Liquidity—Funding and Liquidity” below. See also Notes 1
and 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on
these balance sheet categories.

Trading Account
Liabilities

Trading account
liabilities

includes securities
sold, not yet purchased (short positions), and derivatives in a net payable
position, as well as certain liabilities that Citigroup has elected to carry at
fair value.

During 2012, trading account
liabilities decreased by $10 billion, or 8%, primarily due to a $5 billion, or
8%, decrease in derivative liabilities, and a reduction in short equity
positions. In 2012, average trading account liabilities were $74 billion,
compared to $86 billion in 2011, primarily due to lower average volumes of short
equity positions.

For further information on Citi’s trading account liabilities, see Notes
1 and 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Debt

Debt

is composed of both short-term and long-term borrowings. Short-term
borrowings include commercial paper and borrowings from unaffiliated banks and
other market participants. Long-term borrowings include senior notes,

      respective segment information depicts the assets and liabilities managed
      by each segment as of such date. While this presentation is not defined by
      GAAP, Citi believes that these non-GAAP financial measures enhance
      investors’ understanding of the balance sheet components managed by the
      underlying business segments, as well as the beneficial inter-relationship
      of the asset and liability dynamics of the balance sheet components among
      Citi’s business segments.

CAPITAL RESOURCES AND
LIQUIDITY

CAPITAL RESOURCES

Overview

Capital is used principally to support assets in Citi’s
businesses and to absorb credit, market and operational losses. Citi primarily
generates capital through earnings from its operating businesses. Citi may
augment its capital through issuances of common stock, perpetual preferred stock
and equity issued through awards under employee benefit plans, among other
issuances. During the fourth quarter of 2012, Citi issued approximately $2.25
billion of noncumulative perpetual preferred stock (see “Funding and
Liquidity—Long-Term Debt” below).

Citi has also previously augmented
its regulatory capital through the issuance of subordinated debt underlying
trust preferred securities, although the treatment of such instruments as
regulatory capital will be phased out under the U.S. Basel III rules in
accordance with the timeframe specified by The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and
Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (Dodd-Frank Act) (see “Regulatory Capital
Standards” below). Accordingly, Citi has begun to redeem certain of its trust
preferred securities (see “Funding and Liquidity—Long-Term Debt” below) in
contemplation of such future phase out.

Further, changes in regulatory and
accounting standards as well as the impact of future events on Citi’s business
results, such as corporate and asset dispositions, may also affect Citi’s
capital levels.

Citigroup’s capital management
framework is designed to ensure that Citigroup and its principal subsidiaries
maintain sufficient capital consistent with each entity’s respective risk
profile and all applicable regulatory standards and guidelines. Citi assesses
its capital adequacy against a series of internal quantitative capital goals,
designed to evaluate the Company’s capital levels in expected and stressed
economic environments. Underlying these internal quantitative capital goals are
strategic capital considerations, centered on preserving and building financial
strength. Senior management, with oversight from the Board of Directors, is
responsible for the capital assessment and planning process, which is integrated
into Citi’s capital plan, as part of the Federal Reserve Board’s Comprehensive
Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) process. Implementation of the capital plan
is carried out mainly through Citigroup’s Asset and Liability Committee, with
oversight from the Risk Management and Finance Committee of Citigroup’s Board of
Directors. Asset and liability committees are also established globally and for
each significant legal entity, region, country and/or major line of
business.

Capital Ratios Under Current
Regulatory Guidelines

Citigroup is subject
to the risk-based capital guidelines (currently Basel I) issued by the Federal
Reserve Board. Historically, capital adequacy has been measured, in part, based
on two risk-based capital ratios, the Tier 1 Capital and Total Capital (Tier 1
Capital + Tier 2 Capital) ratios. Tier 1 Capital consists of the sum of “core
capital elements,” such as qualifying common stockholders’ equity, as adjusted,
qualifying perpetual preferred stock, qualifying noncontrolling interests, and
qualifying trust preferred securities, principally reduced by goodwill, other
disallowed intangible assets, and

disallowed deferred tax assets. Total
Capital also includes “supplementary” Tier 2 Capital elements, such as
qualifying subordinated debt and a limited portion of the allowance for credit
losses. Both measures of capital adequacy are stated as a percentage of
risk-weighted assets.

In 2009, the U.S. banking regulators
developed a new supervisory measure of capital termed “Tier 1 Common,” which is
defined as Tier 1 Capital less non-common elements, including qualifying
perpetual preferred stock, qualifying noncontrolling interests, and qualifying
trust preferred securities.

Citigroup’s risk-weighted assets, as
currently computed under Basel I, are principally derived from application of
the risk-based capital guidelines related to the measurement of credit risk.
Pursuant to these guidelines, on-balance-sheet assets and the credit equivalent
amount of certain off-balance-sheet exposures (such as financial guarantees,
unfunded lending commitments, letters of credit and derivatives) are assigned to
one of several prescribed risk-weight categories based upon the perceived credit
risk associated with the obligor or, if relevant, the guarantor, the nature of
the collateral, or external credit ratings. Risk-weighted assets also
incorporate a measure for market risk on covered trading account positions and
all foreign exchange and commodity positions whether or not carried in the
trading account. Excluded from risk-weighted assets are any assets, such as
goodwill and deferred tax assets, to the extent required to be deducted from
regulatory capital.

Citigroup is also subject to a
Leverage ratio requirement, a non-risk-based measure of capital adequacy, which
is defined as Tier 1 Capital as a percentage of quarterly adjusted average total
assets.

To be “well capitalized” under
current federal bank regulatory agency definitions, a bank holding company must
have a Tier 1 Capital ratio of at least 6%, a Total Capital ratio of at least
10%, and not be subject to a Federal Reserve Board directive to maintain higher
capital levels. In addition, the Federal Reserve Board expects bank holding
companies to maintain a minimum Leverage ratio of 3% or 4%, depending on factors
specified in its regulations. The following table sets forth Citigroup’s
regulatory capital ratios as of December 31, 2012 and December 31,
2011:

N/A


Basel II.5 and
III

In June 2012, the U.S. banking
agencies released final (revised) market risk capital rules (Basel II.5), which
became effective on January 1, 2013. At the same time, the U.S. banking agencies
also released proposed Basel III rules, although the timing of the finalization
and effective date(s) of these rules is subject to uncertainty. Collectively
these rules would establish an integrated framework of standards applicable to
virtually all U.S. banking organizations, including Citi and Citibank, N.A., and
upon implementation would comprehensively revise and replace existing regulatory
capital requirements. For additional information on the proposed U.S. Basel III
and final Basel II.5 rules see “Regulatory Capital Standards” and “Risk
Factors—Regulatory Risks” below.

Citi’s estimated Tier 1 Common ratio
as of December 31, 2012, assuming application of the Basel II.5 rules, was
11.08%, compared to 12.67% under Basel I.


This decline reflects the
significant increase in risk-weighted assets under the Basel II.5 rules relative
to those under the current Basel I market risk capital rules. Furthermore, Citi
continues to incorporate mandated enhancements and refinements to its Basel II.5
market risk models for which conditional approval has been received from the
Federal Reserve Board and OCC. Citi’s Basel II.5 risk-weighted assets would be
substantially higher absent the successful incorporation of these required
enhancements and refinements.

At December 31, 2012, Citi’s
estimated Basel III Tier 1 Common ratio was 8.7%, compared to an estimated 8.6%
at September 30, 2012 (each based on total risk-weighted assets calculated under
the proposed U.S. Basel III “advanced approaches” and including Basel
II.5).


This slight increase quarter-over-quarter was primarily due
to lower risk-weighted assets, partially offset by a decline in Tier 1 Common
Capital attributable largely to changes in OCI as well as certain other
components.

Citi’s estimated Basel III Tier 1
Common ratio is based on its understanding, expectations and interpretation of
the proposed U.S. Basel III requirements, anticipated compliance with all
necessary enhancements to model calibration and other refinements, as well as
further regulatory clarity and implementation guidance in the
U.S.

____________________


Citi’s estimate of
      risk-weighted assets under Basel II.5 is a non-GAAP financial measure as
      of December 31, 2012. Citi believes this metric provides useful
      information to investors and others by measuring Citi’s progress against
      future regulatory capital standards.


Citi’s estimated Basel III
      Tier 1 Common ratio and its related components are non-GAAP financial
      measures. Citi believes this ratio and its components (the latter of which
      are presented in the table below) provide useful information to investors
      and others by measuring Citi’s progress against expected future regulatory
      capital standards.

      No material repurchases were made in 2012. See “Risk Factors—Business and
      Operational Risks” and “Purchases of Equity Securities”
  below.


Tangible Common Equity and
Tangible Book Value Per Share

Tangible
common equity (TCE), as defined by Citigroup, represents common equity less
goodwill, other intangible assets (other than mortgage servicing rights (MSRs)),
and related net deferred tax assets. Other companies may calculate TCE in a
different manner. Citi’s TCE was $155.1 billion at December 31, 2012 and $145.4
billion at December 31, 2011. The TCE ratio (TCE divided by Basel I
risk-weighted assets) was 16.0% at December 31, 2012 and 14.9% at December 31,
2011.

total stockholders’ equity to TCE, and book value per share to tangible book

Impact of Changes on Capital
Ratios Under Current Regulatory Guidelines

The following table presents the estimated sensitivity of Citigroup’s and
Citibank, N.A.’s capital ratios to changes of $100 million in Tier 1 Common
Capital, Tier 1 Capital or Total Capital (numerator), or changes of $1 billion
in risk-weighted assets or adjusted average total assets (denominator), as of
December 31, 2012. This information is provided for the purpose of analyzing the
impact that a change in Citigroup’s or Citibank, N.A.’s financial position or
results of operations could have on these ratios. These sensitivities only
consider a single change to either a component of capital, risk-weighted assets
or adjusted average total assets. Accordingly, an event that affects more than
one factor may have a larger basis point impact than is reflected in this
table.

At December 31, 2012,
Citigroup Global Markets Inc., a U.S. broker-dealer registered with the SEC that
is an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Citigroup, had net capital, computed
in accordance with the SEC’s net capital rule, of $6.2 billion, which exceeded
the minimum requirement by $5.7 billion.

In addition, certain of Citi’s other
broker-dealer subsidiaries are subject to regulation in the countries in which
they do business, including requirements to maintain specified levels of net
capital or its equivalent. Citigroup’s other broker-dealer subsidiaries were in
compliance with their capital requirements at December 31, 2012. See Note 20 to
the Consolidated Financial Statements.


Regulatory Capital
Standards

The future regulatory capital
standards applicable to Citi include Basel II, Basel II.5 and Basel III, as well
as the current Basel I credit risk capital rules, until superseded.

Basel II

In November 2007, the U.S. banking agencies adopted Basel II,
a new set of risk-based capital standards for large, internationally active U.S.
banking organizations, including Citi. These standards require Citi to comply
with the most advanced Basel II approaches for calculating risk-weighted assets
for credit and operational risks.

More specifically, credit risk under
Basel II is generally measured using an advanced internal ratings-based models
approach which is applicable to wholesale and retail exposures, and under
certain circumstances also to securitization and equity exposures. For wholesale
and retail exposures, a U.S. banking organization is required to input risk
parameters generated by its internal risk models into specified required
formulas to determine risk-weighted assets. Basel II provides several
approaches, subject to various conditions and qualifying criteria, to measure
risk-weighted assets for securitization exposures. For equity exposures, a U.S.
banking organization may use a simple risk weight approach or, if it qualifies
to do so, an internal models approach to measure risk-weighted assets for
exposures other than exposures to investments funds, for which a look through
approach must be used.

Basel II sets forth advanced
measurement approaches to be employed by a U.S. banking organization in the
measurement of its operational risk, which is defined by Citi as the risk of
loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, systems or human
factors, or from external events. The advanced measurement approaches do not
require a banking organization to use a specific methodology in its operational
risk assessment and rely on a banking organization’s internal estimates of its
operational risks to generate an operational risk capital
requirement.

The U.S. Basel II implementation
timetable originally consisted of a parallel calculation period under the
current regulatory capital rules (Basel I), followed by a three-year
transitional “floor” period, during which Basel II risk-based capital
requirements could not fall below certain floors based on application of the
Basel I rules. Citi began parallel Basel I and Basel II reporting to the U.S.
banking agencies on April 1, 2010, although, as required under U.S. banking
regulations, reported only its Basel I capital ratios for purposes of assessing
compliance with minimum Tier 1 Capital and Total Capital ratio
requirements.

In June 2011, the U.S. banking
agencies adopted final regulations to implement the “capital floor” provision of
the so-called “Collins Amendment” of the Dodd-Frank Act. These regulations
eliminated the three-year transitional floor period in favor of a permanent
floor based on the generally applicable risk-based capital rules (currently
Basel I). Pursuant to these regulations, a banking organization that has
formally implemented Basel II must calculate its risk-based capital requirements
under both Basel I and Basel II, compare the two results, and then report the
lower of the resulting capital ratios for purposes of determining compliance
with its minimum Tier 1 Capital and Total Capital ratio requirements. As of
December 31, 2012, neither Citi nor any other U.S. banking organization had
received approval from the U.S. banking agencies to formally implement Basel II.
Citi expects, however, that it will be required to formally implement Basel II
during 2013 and will begin reporting the lower of its Basel I and Basel II
ratios.

Basel II.5

Basel II.5 substantially revised the market risk capital
framework, and implements a more comprehensive and risk sensitive methodology
for calculating market risk capital requirements for covered trading positions.
Further, the U.S. version of the Basel II.5 rules also implements the Dodd-Frank
Act requirement that all federal agencies remove references to, and reliance on,
credit ratings in their regulations, and replace these references with
alternative standards for evaluating creditworthiness. As a result, the U.S.
banking agencies provided alternative methodologies to external credit ratings
to be used in assessing capital requirements on certain debt and securitization
positions subject to the Basel II.5 rules.

Basel III

The U.S. Basel III rules consist of three notices of proposed
rulemaking (NPRs): the “Basel III NPR,” the “Standardized Approach NPR” and the
“Advanced Approaches NPR.” With the broad exceptions of the new “Standardized
Approach” to be employed by substantially all U.S. banking organizations in
deriving credit risk-weighted assets and the required alternatives to the use of
external credit ratings in arriving at applicable risk weights for certain
exposures as referenced above, the NPRs are largely consistent with the Basel
Committee’s Basel III rules. In November 2012, the U.S. banking agencies
announced that none of the proposed rules would be finalized and effective
January 1, 2013 as was, in part, initially suggested.


Basel III NPR

The Basel III NPR, as with the Basel Committee Basel III
rules, is intended to raise the quantity and quality of regulatory capital by
formally introducing not only Tier 1 Common Capital and mandating that it be the
predominant form of regulatory capital, but by also narrowing the definition of
qualifying capital elements at all three regulatory capital tiers as well as
imposing broader and more constraining regulatory adjustments and
deductions.

The Basel III NPR would modify the
regulations implementing the capital floor provision of the Collins Amendment of
the Dodd-Frank Act that were adopted in June 2011 (as discussed above). This
provision would require “Advanced Approaches” banking organizations (generally
those with consolidated total assets of at least $250 billion or consolidated
total on-balance sheet foreign exposures of at least $10 billion), which
includes Citi and Citibank, N.A., to calculate each of the three risk-based
capital ratios (Tier 1 Common, Tier 1 Capital and Total Capital) under both the
proposed “Standardized Approach” and the proposed “Advanced Approaches” and
report the lower of each of the resulting capital ratios. The principal
differences between these two approaches are in the composition and calculation
of total risk-weighted assets, as well as in the definition of Total Capital.
Compliance with the Basel III NPR stated minimum Tier 1 Common, Tier 1 Capital,
and Total Capital ratio requirements of 4.5%, 6%, and 8%, respectively, would be
assessed based upon each of the reported ratios. The newly established Tier 1
Common and increased Tier 1 Capital stated minimum ratio requirements have been
proposed to be phased in over a three-year period. Under the Basel III NPR,
consistent with the Basel Committee Basel III rules, there would be no change in
the stated minimum Total Capital ratio requirement.

Additionally, the Basel
III NPR establishes a 2.5% Capital Conservation Buffer applicable to
substantially all U.S. banking organizations and, for Advanced Approaches
banking organizations, a potential Countercyclical Capital Buffer of up to 2.5%. The Countercyclical Capital Buffer would be invoked upon a determination by
the U.S. banking agencies that the market is experiencing excessive aggregate
credit growth, and would be an extension of the Capital Conservation Buffer
(i.e., an aggregate combined buffer of potentially between 2.5% and 5%). Citi
would be subject to both the Capital Conservation Buffer and, if invoked, the
Countercyclical Capital Buffer. Consistent with the Basel Committee Basel III
rules, both of these buffers would be required to be comprised entirely of Tier
1 Common Capital.

The calculation of the Capital
Conservation Buffer for Advanced Approaches banking organizations, including
Citi, would be based on a comparison of each of the three risk-based capital
ratios as calculated under the Advanced Approaches and the stated minimum
required ratios for each (i.e., 4.5% Tier 1 Common and 6% Tier 1 Capital, both
as fully phased-in, and 8% Total Capital), with the reportable Capital
Conservation Buffer being the smallest of the three differences. If a banking
organization failed to comply with the proposed buffers, it would be subject to
increasingly onerous restrictions (depending upon the extent of the shortfall)
regarding capital distributions and discretionary executive bonus payments. The
buffers are proposed to be phased in from January 1, 2016 through January 1,
2019.

Unlike the Basel Committee’s final rules
for global systemically important banks (G-SIBs), the Basel III NPR does not
include measures for G-SIBs, such as those addressing the methodology for
assessing global systemic importance, the imposition of additional Tier 1 Common
capital surcharges, and the phase-in period regarding these requirements. The
Federal Reserve Board is required by the Dodd-Frank Act to issue rules
establishing a quantitative risk-based capital surcharge for financial
institutions deemed to be systemically important and posing risk to market-wide
financial stability, such as Citi, and the Federal Reserve Board has indicated
that it intends for these rules to be consistent with the Basel Committee’s
final G-SIB rules. Although these rules have not yet been proposed, Citi
anticipates that it will likely be subject to a 2.5% initial additional capital
surcharge.

The Basel III NPR, consistent with
the Basel Committee’s Basel III rules, provides that certain capital
instruments, such as trust preferred securities, would no longer qualify as
non-common components of Tier 1 Capital. Furthermore, the Collins Amendment of
the Dodd-Frank Act generally requires a phase-out of these securities over a
three-year period beginning January 1, 2013 for bank holding companies, such as
Citi, that had $15 billion or more in total consolidated assets as of December
31, 2009. Accordingly, the U.S. banking agencies have proposed that trust
preferred securities and other non-qualifying Tier 1 Capital instruments, as
well as non-qualifying Tier 2 Capital instruments, be phased out by these bank
holding companies, including Citi, at a 25% per year incremental phase-out
beginning on January 1, 2013 (i.e., 75% of these capital instruments would be
includable in Tier 1 Capital on January 1, 2013, 50% on January 1, 2014, and 25%
on January 1, 2015), with a full phase-out of these capital instruments by
January 1, 2016. However, the timing of the phase-out of trust preferred
securities and other non-qualifying Tier 1 and Tier 2 Capital instruments is
currently uncertain, given the delay in finalization and implementation of the
U.S. Basel III rules. For additional information on Citi’s outstanding trust
preferred securities, see Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. See
also “Funding and Liquidity” below.

Under the Basel III NPR, Advanced
Approaches banking organizations would also be required to calculate two
leverage ratios, a “Tier 1” Leverage ratio and a “Supplementary” Leverage ratio.
The Tier 1 Leverage ratio would be a modified version of the current U.S.
leverage ratio and would reflect the more restrictive proposed Basel III
definition of Tier 1 Capital in the numerator, but with the same current
denominator consisting of average total on-balance sheet assets less amounts
deducted from Tier 1 Capital. Citi, as with substantially all U.S. banking
organizations, would be required to maintain a minimum Tier 1 Leverage ratio of
4%. The Supplementary Leverage ratio would significantly differ from the Tier 1
Leverage ratio regarding the inclusion of certain off-balance sheet exposures
within the denominator of the ratio. Advanced Approaches banking organizations,
such as Citi, would be required to maintain a minimum Supplementary Leverage
ratio of 3%, commencing on January 1, 2018, although it was proposed that
reporting commence on January 1, 2015. The Basel Committee’s Basel III rules
only require that banking organizations calculate a similar Supplementary
Leverage ratio.


In addition, under the Basel III NPR, the
U.S. banking agencies are proposing to revise the Prompt Corrective Action (PCA)
regulations in certain respects. The PCA requirements direct the U.S. banking
agencies to enforce increasingly strict limitations on the activities of insured
depository institutions that fail to meet certain regulatory capital thresholds.
The PCA framework contains five categories of capital adequacy as measured by
risk-based capital and leverage ratios: “well capitalized,” “adequately
capitalized,” “undercapitalized,” “significantly undercapitalized,” and
“critically undercapitalized.”

The U.S. banking agencies are
proposing to revise the PCA regulations to accommodate a new minimum Tier 1
Common ratio requirement for substantially all categories of capital adequacy
(other than critically undercapitalized), increase the minimum Tier 1 Capital
ratio requirement at each category, and introduce for Advanced Approaches
insured depository institutions the Supplementary Leverage ratio as a metric,
but only for the “adequately capitalized” and “undercapitalized” categories.
These revisions have been proposed to be effective on January 1, 2015, with the
exception of the Supplementary Leverage ratio for Advanced Approaches insured
depository institutions for which January 1, 2018 was proposed as the effective
date. Accordingly, as proposed, beginning January 1, 2015, an insured depository
institution, such as Citibank, N.A., would need minimum Tier 1 Common, Tier 1
Capital, Total Capital, and Tier 1 Leverage ratios of 6.5% (a new requirement),
8% (a 2% increase over the current requirement), 10%, and 5%, respectively, to
be considered “well capitalized.”

Standardized Approach
NPR

The Standardized Approach NPR would be
applicable to substantially all U.S. banking organizations, including Citi and
Citibank, N.A., and when effective would replace the existing Basel I rules
governing the calculation of risk-weighted assets for credit risk. As proposed,
this approach would incorporate heightened risk sensitivity for calculating
risk-weighted assets for certain on-balance sheet assets and off-balance sheet
exposures, including those to foreign sovereign governments and banks,
residential mortgages, corporate and securitization exposures, and counterparty
credit risk on derivative contracts, as compared to Basel I. Total risk-weighted
assets under the Standardized Approach would exclude risk-weighted assets
arising from operational risk, require more limited approaches in measuring
risk-weighted assets for securitization exposures under Basel II.5, and apply
the standardized risk-weights to arrive at credit risk-weighted assets. As
required under the Dodd-Frank Act, the Standardized Approach proposes to rely on
alternatives to external credit ratings in the treatment of certain exposures.
The proposed effective date for implementation of the Standardized Approach is
January 1, 2015, with an option for U.S. banking organizations to early
adopt.

Advanced Approaches
NPR

The Advanced Approaches NPR
incorporates published revisions to the Basel Committee’s Advanced Approaches
calculation of risk-weighted assets as proposed amendments to the U.S. Basel II
capital guidelines. Total risk-weighted assets under the Advanced Approaches
would include not only market risk equivalent risk-weighted assets as determined
under Basel II.5, but also the results of applying the Advanced Approaches in
calculating credit and operational risk-weighted assets. Primary among the
proposed Basel II modifications are those related to the treatment of
counterparty credit risk, as well as substantial revisions to the securitization
exposure framework. As required by the Dodd-Frank Act, the Advanced Approaches
NPR also proposes to remove references to, and reliance on, external credit
ratings for various types of exposures.


FUNDING AND
LIQUIDITY

Overview

Citi’s funding and liquidity objectives generally are to
maintain liquidity to fund its existing asset base as well as grow its core
businesses in Citicorp, while at the same time maintain sufficient excess
liquidity, structured appropriately, so that it can operate under a wide variety
of market conditions, including market disruptions for both short- and long-term
periods. Citigroup’s primary liquidity objectives are established by entity, and
in aggregate, across three major categories:

the non-bank, which is largely composed of the
  parent holding company

(Citigroup) and Citi’s
  broker-dealer subsidiaries (collectively referred to in

this section as “non-bank”);

Citi’s significant Citibank entities, which
  consist of Citibank, N.A. units

domiciled in
  the U.S., Western Europe, Hong Kong, Japan and Singapore

(collectively referred to in this section as “significant
  Citibank entities”);

and

other Citibank and Banamex entities.

At an aggregate level, Citigroup’s
goal is to ensure that there is sufficient funding in amount and tenor to ensure
that aggregate liquidity resources are available for these entities. The
liquidity framework requires that entities be self-sufficient or net providers
of liquidity, including in conditions established under their designated stress
tests.

Citi’s primary sources of funding
include (i) deposits via Citi’s bank subsidiaries, which are Citi’s most stable
and lowest cost source of long-term funding, (ii) long-term debt (primarily
senior and subordinated debt) issued at the non-bank level and certain bank
subsidiaries, and (iii) stockholders’ equity. These sources may be supplemented
by short-term borrowings, primarily in the form of secured financing
transactions (securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase, or
repos).

As referenced above, Citigroup works
to ensure that the structural tenor of these funding sources is sufficiently
long in relation to the tenor of its asset base. The key goal of Citi’s
asset/liability management is to ensure that there is excess tenor in the
liability structure so as to provide excess liquidity to fund the assets. The
excess liquidity resulting from a longer-term tenor profile can effectively
offset potential decreases in liquidity that may occur under stress. This excess
funding is held in the form of aggregate liquidity resources, as described
below.

All amounts in the table above are
as of period-end and may increase or decrease intra-period in the ordinary
course of business.

As set forth in the table above,
Citigroup’s aggregate liquidity resources totaled approximately $353.8 billion
at December 31, 2012, compared to $404.2 billion at September 30, 2012 and
$405.5 billion at December 31, 2011. During 2011 and the first half of 2012,
Citi consciously maintained an excess liquidity position given uncertainties in
both the global economic outlook and the pace of its balance sheet deleveraging.
In the second half of 2012, as these uncertainties showed signs of abating, Citi
purposefully began to decrease its liquidity resources, primarily through
long-term debt reductions and limiting deposit growth, as well as through
increased lending to both Consumer and Corporate clients.

As discussed
in more detail below, this reduction in excess liquidity in turn contributed to
a reduction in overall cost of funds, and thus improved Citi’s net interest
margin, which increased to 2.88% for full year 2012 from 2.86% for full year
2011 (see “Deposits” and “Market Risk—Interest Revenue/ Expense and Yields”
below, respectively).

At December 31, 2012, Citigroup’s
non-bank aggregate liquidity resources totaled approximately $64.5 billion,
compared to $77.7 billion at September 30, 2012 and $98.4 billion at December
31, 2011. These amounts included unencumbered liquid securities and cash held in
Citi’s U.S. and non-U.S. broker-dealer entities. The purposeful decrease in
aggregate liquidity resources of Citi’s non-bank entities year-over-year and
quarter-over-quarter was primarily due to the continued pay down and runoff of
long-term debt, including Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program (TLGP) debt,
which fully matured by the end of 2012.

Citigroup’s significant Citibank
entities had approximately $199.8 billion of aggregate liquidity resources as of
December 31, 2012, compared to $236.7 billion at September 30, 2012 and $200.2
billion at December 31, 2011. The decrease in aggregate liquidity resources
during the fourth quarter of 2012 was primarily due to an anticipated reduction
in episodic deposits and the expiration of the Transaction Account Guarantee
(TAG) program (see “Deposits” below), as well as the repayment of remaining TLGP
borrowings and a reduction in secured borrowings. As of December 31, 2012, the
significant Citibank entities’ liquidity resources included $26.5 billion of
cash on deposit with major central banks (including the U.S. Federal Reserve
Bank, European Central Bank, Bank


of England, Swiss National
Bank, Bank of Japan, the Monetary Authority of Singapore and the Hong Kong
Monetary Authority), compared with $72.7 billion at September 30, 2012 and $70.7
billion at December 31, 2011.

The significant Citibank entities’ liquidity
resources amount as of December 31, 2012 also included unencumbered liquid
securities. These securities are available-for-sale or secured financing through
private markets or by pledging to the major central banks. The liquidity value
of these securities was $173.3 billion at December 31, 2012 compared to $164.0
billion at September 30, 2012 and $129.5 billion at December 31, 2011.

Citi estimates that its other Citibank and Banamex
entities and subsidiaries held approximately $89.5 billion in aggregate
liquidity resources as of December 31, 2012, compared to $89.8 billion at
September 30, 2012 and $106.9 billion at December 31, 2011. The decrease
year-over-year was primarily due to increased lending and limited deposit growth
in those entities. The $89.5 billion as of December 31, 2012 included $13.3
billion of cash on deposit with central banks and $76.2 billion of unencumbered
liquid securities.

Citi’s $353.8 billion of aggregate liquidity resources as of December 31,
2012 does not include additional potential liquidity in the form of Citigroup’s
borrowing capacity from the various Federal Home Loan Banks (FHLB), which was
approximately $36.7 billion as of December 31, 2012 and is maintained by pledged
collateral to all such banks. The aggregate liquidity resources shown above also
do not include Citi’s borrowing capacity at the U.S. Federal Reserve Bank
discount window or international central banks, which capacity would also be in
addition to the resources noted above.

Moreover, in general, Citigroup can freely fund legal entities within its
bank vehicles. Citigroup’s bank subsidiaries, including Citibank, N.A., can lend
to the Citigroup parent and broker-dealer entities in accordance with Section
23A of the Federal Reserve Act. As of December 31, 2012, the amount available
for lending to these non-bank entities under Section 23A was approximately $15
billion, provided the funds are collateralized appropriately.

Overall, subject to market conditions, Citi
expects to continue to modestly manage down its aggregate liquidity resources as
it continues to pay down or allow its outstanding long-term debt to mature (see
“Long-Term Debt” below).

Aggregate Liquidity
Resources—By Type

The
following table shows the composition of Citi’s aggregate liquidity resources by
type of asset as of each of the periods indicated. For securities, the amounts
represent the liquidity value that could potentially be realized, and thus
excludes any securities that are encumbered, as well as the haircuts that would
be required for secured financing transactions. Year-over-year, the composition
of Citi’s aggregate liquidity resources shifted as Citi continued to optimize
its liquidity portfolio. Cash and foreign government trading securities
(particularly in Western Europe) decreased, while U.S. treasuries and agencies
increased.

Foreign government
      also includes foreign government agencies, multinationals and foreign

      largely to support local liquidity requirements and Citi’s local
      franchises and, as of December 31, 2012, principally included government
      bonds from Korea, Japan, Mexico, Brazil, Hong Kong, Singapore and
      Taiwan.

The
aggregate liquidity resources are composed entirely of cash and securities
positions. While Citi utilizes derivatives to manage the interest rate and
currency risks related to the aggregate liquidity resources, credit derivatives
are not used.

Deposits

Deposits are the primary and lowest cost funding
source for Citi’s bank subsidiaries. As of December 31, 2012, approximately 78%
of the liabilities of Citi’s bank subsidiaries were deposits, compared to 76% as
of September 30, 2012 and 75% as of December 31, 2011.

The table below sets forth the end of period and
average deposits, by business and/or segment, for each of the periods
indicated.

Citi continued to focus on maintaining a
geographically diverse retail and corporate deposit base that stood at
approximately $931 billion at December 31, 2012, up 7% year-over-year. Average
deposits of $929 billion as of December 31, 2012 increased 8% year-over-year.
The increase in end-of-period deposits year-over-year was largely due to higher
deposit volumes in each of Citicorp’s deposit-taking businesses

(Transaction Services, Securities and Banking and
Global Consumer Banking)

.
Year-over-year deposit growth occurred in all four regions, including 9% growth
in

EMEA

and 10% growth in

Latin America

. As of December 31, 2012, approximately 59% of
Citi’s deposits were located outside of the U.S., compared to 61% at December
31, 2011.


Quarter-over-quarter, end-of-period deposits decreased 1% on a reported
basis (2% when adjusted for the impact of FX translation). During the fourth
quarter of 2012, there was an expected decline in end-of-period deposits
reflecting the runoff of approximately $12 billion of episodic deposits which
came in at the end of the third quarter, as well as $10 billion primarily due to
the expiration of the TAG program on December 31, 2012. These reductions were
partially offset by deposit growth across deposit-taking businesses,
particularly

Global Consumer
Banking

. Further, at the
direction of MSSB, Citi transferred $4.5 billion in deposits to Morgan Stanley
during the fourth quarter of 2012 in connection with the sale of Citi’s 14%
interest in MSSB (see “Citi Holdings—Brokerage and Asset Management” above),
although this decline was offset by deposit growth in the normal course of
business.

During 2012, the composition
of Citi’s deposits continued to shift toward a greater proportion of operating
balances, and also toward non-interest-bearing accounts within those operating
balances. (Citi defines operating balances as checking and savings accounts for
individuals, as well as cash management accounts for corporations. This compares
to time deposits, where rates are fixed for the term of the deposit and which
have generally lower margins). Citi believes that operating accounts are lower
cost and more reliable deposits, and exhibit “stickier,” or more retentive,
behavior. Operating balances represented 79% of Citi’s average total deposit
base as of December 31, 2012, compared to 76% at both September 30, 2012 and
December 31, 2011. Citi currently expects this shift to continue into
2013.

Deposits can be
interest-bearing or non-interest-bearing. Of Citi’s $931 billion of deposits as
of December 31, 2012, $195 billion were non-interest-bearing, compared to $177
billion at December 31, 2011. The remainder, or $736 billion, was
interest-bearing, compared to $689 billion at December 31, 2011.

Citi’s overall cost of funds on deposits decreased
during 2012, despite deposit growth throughout the year. Excluding the impact of
the higher FDIC assessment and deposit insurance, the average rate on Citi’s
total deposits was 0.64% at December 31, 2012, compared with 0.80% at December
31, 2011, and 0.86% at December 31, 2010. This translated into an approximate
$345 million reduction in quarterly interest expense over the past two years.
Consistent with prevailing interest rates, Citi experienced declining deposit
rates during 2012, notwithstanding pressure on deposit rates due to competitive
pricing in certain regions.

Long-Term Debt

Long-term debt (generally defined as original
maturities of one year or more) continued to represent the most significant
component of Citi’s funding for its non-bank entities, or 40% of the funding for
the non-bank entities as of December 31, 2012, compared to 45% as of December
31, 2011. The vast majority of this funding is composed of senior term debt,
along with subordinated instruments.

Senior long-term debt includes benchmark notes and structured notes, such
as equity- and credit-linked notes. Citi’s issuance of structured notes is
generally driven by customer demand and is not a significant source of liquidity
for Citi. Structured notes frequently contain contractual features, such as call
options, which can lead to an expectation that the debt will be redeemed earlier
than one year, despite contractually scheduled maturities greater than one year.
As such, when considering the measurement of Citi’s long-term “structural”
liquidity, structured notes with these contractual features are not included
(see footnote 1 to the “Long-Term Debt Issuances and Maturities” table
below).

During 2012, due to the
expected phase-out of Tier 1 Capital treatment for trust preferred securities
beginning as early as 2013, Citi redeemed four series of its outstanding trust
preferred securities, for an aggregate amount of approximately $5.9 billion.
Furthermore, in anticipation of this change in qualifying regulatory capital,
Citi issued approximately $2.25 billion of preferred stock during 2012. For
details on Citi’s remaining outstanding trust preferred securities, as well as
its long-term debt generally, see Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements. See also “Capital Resources—Regulatory Capital Standards”
above.

Long-term debt is an important
funding source for Citi’s non-bank entities due in part to its multi-year
maturity structure. The weighted average maturities of long-term debt issued by
Citigroup and its affiliates, including Citibank, N.A., with a remaining life
greater than one year as of December 31, 2012 (excluding trust preferred
securities), was approximately 7.2 years, compared to 7.0 years at September 30,
2012 and 7.1 years at December 31, 2011.

      2012, and December 31, 2011, respectively.

(2)

Of the approximate
      $26.4 billion of total bank and non-bank securitized debt and
      securitizations as of December 31, 2012, approximately $23.0 billion
      related to credit card securitizations, the vast majority of which was at
      the bank level.

(3)

Of this amount,
      approximately $16.3 billion related to collateralized advances from the
      FHLB as of December 31, 2012.

As
set forth in the table above, Citi’s overall long-term debt decreased by
approximately $84 billion year-over-year. In the bank, the decrease was due to
securitization and TLGP run-off that was replaced with deposit growth. In the
non-bank, the decrease was primarily due to TLGP run-off, trust preferred
redemptions, debt maturities and debt repurchases through tender offers or
buybacks (see discussion below), partially offset by issuances. While long-term
debt in the non-bank declined over the course of the past year, Citi
correspondingly reduced its overall level of assets—including illiquid
assets—that debt was meant to support. These reductions are in keeping with
Citi’s continued strategy to deleverage its balance sheet and lower funding
costs.

As noted above and as part of
its liquidity and funding strategy, Citi has considered, and may continue to
consider, opportunities to repurchase its long-term and short-term debt pursuant
to open market purchases, tender offers or other means. Such repurchases further
decrease Citi’s overall funding costs. During 2012, Citi repurchased an
aggregate of approximately $11.1 billion of its outstanding long-term and
short-term debt, primarily pursuant to selective public tender offers and open
market purchases, compared to $3.3 billion during 2011.

Citi expects to continue to reduce its outstanding
long-term debt during 2013, although it expects such reductions to occur at a
more moderate rate as compared to 2012. These reductions could occur through
natural maturities as well as repurchases, tender offers, redemptions and
similar means, depending upon the overall economic
environment.

Citi defines
      structural long-term debt as its long-term debt (original maturities of
      one year or more), excluding certain structured debt, such as
      equity-linked and credit-linked notes, with early redemption features
      effective within one year. Issuances and maturities of these notes are
      included in this table in “Local country level, FHLB and other.” See
      footnote 2 below. Structural long-term debt is a non-GAAP measure.
      Citigroup believes that the structural long-term debt measure provides
      useful information to its investors as it excludes long-term debt that
      could in fact be redeemed by the holders thereof within one
  year.

(2)

As referenced above,
      “other” includes long-term debt not considered structural long-term debt
      relating to certain structured notes. The amounts of issuances included in
      this line, and thus excluded from “structural long-term debt,” were $2.0
      billion, $3.7 billion, and $3.3 billion in 2012, 2011, and 2010,
      respectively. The amounts of maturities included in this line, and thus
      excluded from “structural long-term debt,” were $2.4 billion, $2.4
      billion, and $3.0 billion, in 2012, 2011, and 2010,
  respectively.

      $0.5 billion in 2017; and $2.0 billion
thereafter.

As
set forth in the table above, Citi’s structural long-term debt maturities peaked
during 2012 at $80.7 billion, and included the maturity of the last remaining
TLGP debt.

Secured Financing Transactions and
Short-Term Borrowings

As
referenced above, Citi supplements its primary sources of funding with
short-term borrowings. Short-term borrowings generally include (i) secured
financing (securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase, or repos)
and (ii) short-term borrowings consisting of commercial paper and borrowings
from the FHLBs and other market participants. See Note 19 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements for further information on Citigroup’s and its affiliates’
outstanding short-term borrowings.

The following table contains the year-end, average and maximum month-end
amounts for the following respective short-term borrowings categories at the end
of each of the three prior fiscal years.

Secured
Financing

Secured financing is
primarily conducted through Citi’s broker-dealer subsidiaries to facilitate
customer matched-book activity and to efficiently fund a portion of the trading
inventory. As of December 31, 2012, approximately 36% of the funding for Citi’s
non-bank entities, primarily the broker-dealer, was from secured
financings.

Secured financing was $211 billion as of December 31, 2012, compared to
$198 billion as of December 31, 2011. Average balances for secured financing
were approximately $224 billion for the year ended December 31, 2012, compared to $220
billion for the year ended December 31, 2011. Changes in levels of secured financing were
primarily due to fluctuations in inventory for all periods discussed above
(either on an end-of-quarter or on an average basis).

Commercial
Paper

Citi’s commercial paper
balances have decreased and will likely continue to do so as Citi shifts its
funding mix away from short-term sources to deposits and long-term debt and
equity. The following table sets forth Citi’s commercial paper outstanding for
each of its non-bank entities and significant Citibank entities, respectively,
for each of the periods indicated:

with $33 billion at December 31, 2011.

Liquidity Management, Measures and
Stress Testing

Liquidity
Management

Citi’s aggregate
liquidity resources are managed by the Citi Treasurer. Liquidity is managed via
a centralized treasury model by Corporate Treasury and by in-country treasurers.
Pursuant to this structure, Citi’s liquidity resources are managed with a goal
of ensuring the asset/liability match and that liquidity positions are
appropriate in every country and throughout Citi.

Citi’s Chief Risk Officer is responsible for the
overall risk profile of Citi’s aggregate liquidity resources. The Chief Risk
Officer and Chief Financial Officer co-chair Citi’s Asset Liability Management
Committee (ALCO), which includes Citi’s Treasurer and senior executives. ALCO
sets the strategy of the liquidity portfolio and monitors its performance.
Significant changes to portfolio asset allocations need to be approved by ALCO.

Excess cash available in Citi’s aggregate
liquidity resources is available to be invested in a liquid portfolio such that
cash can be made available to meet demand in a stress situation. At December 31,
2012, Citi’s liquidity pool was primarily invested in cash, government
securities, including U.S. agency debt and U.S. agency mortgage-backed
securities, and a certain amount of highly rated investment-grade credits. While
the vast majority of Citi’s liquidity pool at December 31, 2012 consisted of
long positions, Citi utilizes derivatives to manage its interest rate and
currency risks; credit derivatives are not used.

Liquidity Measures

Citi uses multiple measures
in monitoring its liquidity, including without limitation those described
below.

In broad terms, the structural
liquidity ratio, defined as the sum of deposits, long-term debt and
stockholders’ equity as a percentage of total assets, measures whether the asset
base is funded by sufficiently long-dated liabilities. Citi’s structural
liquidity ratio remained stable over the past year at approximately 73% as of
December 31, 2012.

In addition, Citi believes it is currently in compliance with the
proposed Basel III Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR), as amended by the Basel
Committee on Banking Supervision on January 7, 2013 (the amended LCR
guidelines), even though such ratio is not proposed to take full effect until
2019. Using the amended LCR guidelines, Citi’s estimated LCR was approximately
122% as of December 31, 2012, compared with approximately 127% at September 30,
2012 and 143% at March 31, 2012.


On a dollar basis, the 122% LCR
represents additional liquidity of approximately $65 billion above the proposed
minimum 100% LCR threshold. Citi’s LCR may decrease modestly over
time.

The LCR is designed to ensure
banks maintain an adequate level of unencumbered cash and highly liquid
securities that can be converted to cash to meet liquidity needs under an acute
30-day stress scenario. The LCR estimate is calculated in accordance with the
amended LCR guidelines. Under the amended LCR guidelines, the LCR is calculated
by dividing the amount of highly liquid unencumbered government and
government-backed cash securities, as well as unencumbered cash, by the
estimated net outflows over a stressed 30-day period. The net cash outflows are
calculated by applying assumed outflow factors, prescribed in the amended LCR
guidelines, to the various categories of liabilities (deposits, unsecured and
secured wholesale borrowings), as well as to unused commitments and
derivatives-related exposures, partially offset by inflows from assets maturing
within 30 days. The amended LCR requirements expanded the definition of liquid
assets, and reduced outflow estimates for certain types of deposits and
commitments.

Stress
Testing

Liquidity stress
testing is performed for each of Citi’s major entities, operating subsidiaries
and/or countries. Stress testing and scenario analyses are intended to quantify
the potential impact of a liquidity event on the balance sheet and liquidity
position, and to identify viable funding alternatives that can be utilized.
These scenarios include assumptions about significant changes in key funding
sources, market triggers (such as credit ratings), potential uses of funding and
political and economic conditions in certain countries. These conditions include
standard and stressed market conditions as well as firm-specific
events.

A
wide range of liquidity stress tests are important for monitoring purposes. Some
span liquidity events over a full year, some may cover an intense stress period
of one month, and still other time frames may be appropriate. These potential
liquidity events are useful to ascertain potential mismatches between liquidity
sources and uses over a variety of horizons

____________________


Citi’s estimated LCR
      is a non-GAAP financial measure. Citi believes this measure provides
      useful information to investors and others by measuring Citi’s progress
      toward potential future expected regulatory liquidity
  standards.


(overnight, one week, two weeks, one
month, three months, one year), and liquidity limits are set accordingly. To
monitor the liquidity of a unit, those stress tests and potential mismatches may
be calculated with varying frequencies, with several important tests performed
daily.

Given the range of potential
stresses, Citi maintains a series of contingency funding plans on a consolidated
basis as well as for individual entities. These plans specify a wide range of
readily available actions that are available in a variety of adverse market
conditions, or idiosyncratic disruptions.

Credit Ratings

Citigroup’s funding and liquidity, including its
funding capacity, its ability to access the capital markets and other sources of
funds, as well as the cost of these funds, and its ability to maintain certain
deposits, is partially dependent on its credit ratings. The table below
indicates the ratings for Citigroup, Citibank, N.A. and Citigroup Global Markets
Inc. (a broker-dealer subsidiary of Citigroup) as of December 31,
2012.

Recent Credit Rating
Developments

On December 5,
2012, S&P concluded its annual review of Citi with no changes to the ratings
and outlooks on Citigroup and its subsidiaries. On October 16, 2012, S&P
noted that Citi’s ratings remain unchanged despite the change in senior
management. At the same time, S&P maintained a negative outlook on the
ratings. These ratings continue to receive two notches of government support
uplift, in line with other large banks.

On October 16, 2012, Fitch noted the change in Citi’s senior management
as an unexpected, but credit-neutral, event that would likely have no material
impact on the credit profile of Citibank, N.A. or its ratings in the near term.
On October 10, 2012, Fitch affirmed the long- and short-term ratings of “A/F1”
and the Viability Rating of “a-” for Citigroup and Citibank, N.A. and, as of
that date, the rating outlook by Fitch was stable. This rating action was taken
in conjunction with Fitch’s periodic review of the 13 global trading and
universal banks.

On February 12, 2013, Moody’s
changed the rating outlook on Citibank, N.A. from negative to stable, and
affirmed the long-term ratings. The negative outlook was assigned on October 16,
2012, following changes in Citi’s senior management. Moody’s maintained the
negative outlook on the long-term ratings of Citigroup Inc. On October 16, 2012,
Moody’s affirmed the long- and short-term ratings of Citigroup and Citibank,
N.A.

Potential Impacts of
Ratings Downgrades

Ratings
downgrades by Moody’s, Fitch or S&P could negatively impact Citigroup’s
and/or Citibank, N.A.’s funding and liquidity due to reduced funding capacity,
including derivatives triggers, which could take the form of cash obligations
and collateral requirements.

The following information is provided for the purpose of analyzing the
potential funding and liquidity impact to Citigroup and Citibank, N.A. of a
hypothetical, simultaneous ratings downgrade across all three major rating
agencies. This analysis is subject to certain estimates, estimation
methodologies, and judgments and uncertainties, including without limitation
those relating to potential ratings limitations certain entities may have with
respect to permissible counterparties, as well as general subjective
counterparty behavior (e.g., certain corporate customers and trading
counterparties could re-evaluate their business relationships with Citi, and
limit the trading of certain contracts or market instruments with Citi).
Moreover, changes in counterparty behavior could impact Citi’s funding and
liquidity as well as the results of operations of certain of its businesses.
Accordingly, the actual impact to Citigroup or Citibank, N.A. is unpredictable
and may differ materially from the potential funding and liquidity impacts
described below.

For additional information on
the impact of credit rating changes on Citi and its applicable subsidiaries, see
“Risk Factors—Liquidity Risks” below.


Citigroup Inc. and
Citibank, N.A.—Potential Derivative Triggers

As of December 31, 2012, Citi estimates that a
hypothetical one-notch downgrade of the senior debt/long-term rating of
Citigroup across all three major rating agencies could impact Citigroup’s
funding and liquidity due to derivative triggers by approximately $1.7 billion.
Other funding sources, such as secured financing transactions and other margin
requirements, for which there are no explicit triggers, could also be adversely
affected.

In addition, as of December 31, 2012, Citi estimates that a hypothetical
one-notch downgrade of the senior debt/long-term rating of Citibank, N.A. across
all three major rating agencies could impact Citibank, N.A.’s funding and
liquidity due to derivative triggers by approximately $3.4 billion.

In total, Citi estimates that a one-notch
downgrade of Citigroup and Citibank, N.A., across all three major rating
agencies, could result in aggregate cash obligations and collateral requirements
of approximately $5.1 billion (see also Note 23 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements). As set forth under “Aggregate Liquidity Resources” above, the
aggregate liquidity resources of Citi’s non-bank entities were approximately $65
billion, and the aggregate liquidity resources of Citi’s significant Citibank
entities and other Citibank and Banamex entities were approximately $289
billion, for a total of approximately $354 billion as of December 31, 2012.
These liquidity resources are available in part as a contingency for the
potential events described above.

In addition, a broad range of mitigating actions are currently included
in Citigroup’s and Citibank, N.A.’s detailed contingency funding plans. For
Citigroup, these mitigating factors include, but are not limited to, accessing
surplus funding capacity from existing clients, tailoring levels of secured
lending, adjusting the size of select trading books and collateralized
borrowings from Citi’s significant bank subsidiaries. Mitigating actions
available to Citibank, N.A. include, but are not limited to, selling or
financing highly liquid government securities, tailoring levels of secured
lending, adjusting the size of select trading books, reducing loan originations
and renewals, raising additional deposits, or borrowing from the FHLBs or
central banks. Citi believes these mitigating actions could substantially reduce
the funding and liquidity risk, if any, of the potential downgrades described
above.

Citibank, N.A.—Additional
Potential Impacts

In addition
to the above derivative triggers, Citi believes that a potential one-notch
downgrade of Citibank, N.A.’s senior debt/long-term rating by S&P and Fitch
could also have an adverse impact on the commercial paper/short-term rating of
Citibank, N.A. As of December 31, 2012, Citibank, N.A. had liquidity commitments
of approximately $18.7 billion to asset-backed commercial paper conduits. This
included $11.1 billion of commitments to consolidated conduits and $7.6 billion
of commitments to unconsolidated conduits (each as referenced in Note 22 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements).

In addition to the above-referenced aggregate liquidity resources of
Citi’s significant Citibank entities and other Citibank and Banamex entities, as
well as the various mitigating actions previously noted, mitigating actions
available to Citibank, N.A. to reduce the funding and liquidity risk, if any, of
the potential downgrades described above, include repricing or reducing certain
commitments to commercial paper conduits.

In addition, in the event of the potential downgrades described above,
Citi believes that certain corporate customers could re-evaluate their deposit
relationships with Citibank, N.A. Among other things, this re-evaluation could
include adjusting their discretionary deposit levels or changing their
depository institution, each of which could potentially reduce certain deposit
levels at Citibank, N.A. As a potential mitigant, however, Citi could choose to
adjust pricing or offer alternative deposit products to its existing customers,
or seek to attract deposits from new customers, as well as utilize the other
mitigating actions referenced above.


OFF-BALANCE-SHEET ARRANGEMENTS

Citigroup enters into various
types of off-balance-sheet arrangements in the ordinary course of business.
Citi’s involvement in these arrangements can take many different forms,
including without limitation:

purchasing or retaining residual and
  other interests in special purpose

entities, such as credit card receivables and mortgage-backed and
  other

asset-backed securitization
  entities;

holding senior and subordinated debt,
  interests in limited and general

partnerships and equity interests in other unconsolidated entities;
  and

providing guarantees,
  indemnifications, loan commitments, letters of

credit and representations and
  warranties.

Citi
enters into these arrangements for a variety of business purposes. These
securitization entities offer investors access to specific cash flows and risks
created through the securitization process. The securitization arrangements also
assist Citi and Citi’s customers in monetizing their financial assets at more
favorable rates than Citi or the customers could otherwise obtain.

The table below presents where a discussion of
Citi’s various off-balance-sheet arrangements may be found in this Form 10-K. In
addition, see “Significant Accounting Policies and Significant
Estimates—Securitizations,” as well as Notes 1, 22 and 27 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements.

CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS

The following table includes
information on Citigroup’s contractual obligations, as specified and aggregated
pursuant to SEC requirements.

Purchase obligations consist of those obligations
to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding on Citi.
For presentation purposes, purchase obligations are included in the table below
through the termination date of the respective agreements, even if the contract
is renewable. Many of the purchase agreements for goods or services include
clauses that would allow Citigroup to cancel the agreement with specified

notice; however, that impact
is not included in the table below (unless Citigroup has already notified the
counterparty of its intention to terminate the agreement).

Other liabilities

reflected on Citigroup’s Consolidated Balance
Sheet include obligations for goods and services that have already been
received, uncertain tax positions and other liabilities that have been incurred
and will ultimately be paid in cash.
