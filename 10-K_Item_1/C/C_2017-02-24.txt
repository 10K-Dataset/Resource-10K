Item 1. Business

OVERVIEW

Citigroup’s history dates back to the founding of the City

Bank of New York in 1812.

Citigroup is a global diversified financial services holding company whose businesses provide consumers, corporations, governments and institutions with a broad, yet focused, range of financial products and services, including consumer banking and credit, corporate and investment banking, securities brokerage, trade and securities services and wealth management. Citi has approximately 200 million customer accounts and does business in more than 160 countries and jurisdictions.

At December 31,


, Citi had approximately 219,000 full-time employees, compared to approximately 231,000 full-time employees at December 31,


.

Citigroup currently operates, for management reporting purposes, via two primary business segments: Citicorp, consisting of Citi’s

Global Consumer Banking

businesses and

Institutional Clients Group

; and Citi Holdings, consisting of businesses and portfolios of assets that Citigroup has determined are not central to its core Citicorp businesses.  For a further description of the business segments and the products and services they provide, see “Citigroup Segments” below, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Throughout this report, “Citigroup,” “Citi” and “the Company” refer to Citigroup Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries.

Certain reclassifications, including a realignment of certain businesses, have been made to the prior periods’ financial statements to conform to the current period’s presentation. For information on certain recent such reclassifications, see Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Please see “Risk Factors” below for a discussion of the most significant risks and uncertainties that could impact Citigroup’s businesses, financial condition and results of operations.


As described above, Citigroup is managed pursuant to the following segments:

(Chart continues on next page.)


The following are the four regions in which Citigroup operates. The regional results are fully reflected in the segment results above.

*

As announced in April 2016, beginning in the first quarter of 2017, the remaining businesses and portfolios of assets in Citi Holdings will be reported as part of

Corporate/Other

and Citi Holdings will cease to be a separately reported business segment.  For additional information, see “Citicorp” and “Citi Holdings” below.  Citi intends to release a revised Quarterly Financial Data Supplement reflecting this realignment prior to the release of its first quarter of 2017 earnings.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION

AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

As described further throughout this Executive Summary, Citi’s full year 2016 results of operations reflected solid overall performance and underlying momentum across the franchise, including in several businesses where Citi has been making investments, such as its

North America

Citi-branded cards business.  Citi also continued to demonstrate strong expense discipline, resulting in a Citicorp operating efficiency ratio of 58% in 2016.

In

Global Consumer Banking (GCB)

, results for the

North America

Citi-branded cards business reflected the acquisition of the Costco portfolio (late in the second quarter of 2016), but also modest growth in average loans and purchase sales in the remainder of the portfolio.  International

GCB

results reflected revenue growth and positive operating leverage in Mexico, and Citi announced its $1 billion investment in Mexico to be completed by 2020 where it believes it has the opportunity to build upon its strong brand position and scale to lead to improved returns.  In

Institutional Clients Group (ICG)

, Citi generated year-over-year revenue growth, despite the challenging market conditions in the first quarter of 2016 and the volatility in the energy sector earlier in the year.

In Citicorp, loans increased 4% and deposits increased 3%.  Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation into U.S. dollars for reporting purposes (FX translation), Citicorp loans increased 6% and deposits increased 5%.  (Citi’s results of operations excluding the impact of FX translation are non-GAAP financial measures.  Citi believes the presentation of its results of operations excluding the impact of FX translation provides a meaningful depiction for investors of the underlying fundamentals of its businesses.)  Credit quality remained broadly favorable in every region.

2016 was an important year for Citi in several additional respects.  First, Citi Holdings will no longer be reported separately (it will be reported as part of

Corporate/Other

beginning in the first quarter of 2017).  At its peak, Citi Holdings had over $800 billion in assets and in certain quarters generated significant losses.  As of December 31, 2016, Citi Holdings’ assets of $54 billion constituted only approximately 3% of Citigroup’s GAAP assets, and with $87 million of net income in the fourth quarter of 2016, Citi Holdings was profitable for ten consecutive quarters.  Accordingly, the results of operations and financial condition of Citigroup are now driven by the core Citicorp franchise.

Second, Citi increased the amount of capital it returned to shareholders during 2016 while at the same time increasing its key regulatory capital metrics (see “Capital Resources” below).  During 2016, Citi returned nearly $11.0 billion of capital to common shareholders in the form of dividends and the repurchase of 196 million common shares, including the additional $1.75 billion increase to its common stock repurchase program announced in November 2016.  And third, while Citi has more work to do, Citi achieved a significant milestone during 2016 when it received feedback from the

Federal Reserve Board and FDIC that neither agency had found deficiencies in Citi’s 2015 resolution plan.

Going into 2017, while economic sentiment has improved, there continues to be much uncertainty, primarily as a result of a new U.S. presidential administration and policies and the anticipated beginning of the exit of the U.K. from the European Union.  For a more detailed discussion of the risks and uncertainties that could impact Citi’s businesses, results of operations and financial condition during 2017, see each respective business’s results of operations, “Risk Factors” and “Managing Global Risk” below.  Despite these uncertainties, Citi intends to continue to build on the progress made during 2016 with a focus on further optimizing its performance to benefit shareholders.

2016 Summary Results

Citigroup

Citigroup reported net income of $14.9 billion, or $4.72 per share, compared to $17.2 billion, or $5.40 per share, in the prior year.  Results in 2015 included $254 million ($162 million after-tax) of CVA/DVA.

Excluding the impact of CVA/DVA in 2015, Citigroup reported net income of $14.9 billion for 2016, or $4.72 per share, compared to $17.1 billion, or $5.35 per share, in the prior year.  (Citi’s results of operations excluding the impact of CVA/DVA are non-GAAP financial measures.  Citi excludes the impact of CVA/DVA from results for 2015 for consistency with the current year’s presentation.)  The 13% decrease in net income from the prior year was primarily driven by lower revenues, largely due to the decline in Citi Holdings, partially offset by lower expenses and lower credit costs.

Citi’s revenues were $69.9 billion in 2016, a decrease of 8% from the prior year, driven by a 2% decline in Citicorp and a 57% decline in Citi Holdings.  Excluding CVA/DVA in 2015                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    and the impact of FX translation (which increased the reported decline in revenues versus the prior year by approximately $1.7 billion), Citigroup revenues decreased 6% from the prior year, driven by a 56% decrease in Citi Holdings, partially offset by a 1% increase in Citicorp revenues.

As previously announced, in January 2017, Citi signed agreements to effectively exit its U.S. mortgage servicing operations by the end of 2018 and intensify its focus on originations.  These transactions are expected to negatively impact Citi’s pretax earnings by approximately $400 million, including a loss on sale and certain related transaction costs, in the first quarter of 2017.  For additional information on these transactions, see Note 29 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Expenses

Citigroup expenses decreased 5% versus the prior year as significantly lower expenses in Citi Holdings, efficiency savings and a benefit from the impact of FX translation were partially offset by ongoing investments in Citicorp (including those referenced above).  FX translation increased the reported


decline in expenses versus the prior year period by approximately $1.2 billion.

Citicorp expenses increased 1%, reflecting the ongoing investments in the franchise, partially offset by efficiency savings and the benefit from the impact of FX translation.

Citi Holdings’ expenses were $3.2 billion, down 43% from the prior year, primarily driven by sales and run-off of Citi Holdings assets and lower legal and repositioning costs.

Credit Costs

Citi’s total provisions for credit losses and for benefits and claims of $7.0 billion decreased 12% from the prior year.  The decrease was driven by a decrease in net credit losses and a lower provision for benefits and claims due to lower insurance-related business activity within Citi Holdings, partially offset by a net loan loss reserve build, largely driven by

North America

cards within Citicorp, compared to a net loan loss reserve release in the prior year.

Net credit losses of $6.6 billion declined 10% versus the prior year.  Consumer net credit losses declined 14% to

$6.1 billion, mostly reflecting continued improvement in the

North America

mortgage portfolio and ongoing divestiture activity within Citi Holdings, partially offset by higher net credit losses in

North America

cards in Citicorp due to volume growth.  Corporate net credit losses increased $267 million to $511 million, mostly related to the energy portfolio in the first half of 2016, with a vast majority

of the corporate net credit losses offset by releases of previously established loan loss reserves (for additional information, see “

Institutional Clients Group

” and “Credit Risk—Corporate Credit” below).

The net build of allowance for loan losses and unfunded lending commitments was $217 million in 2016, compared to a $120 million release in 2015.  Citicorp’s net reserve build was $680 million, compared to a net loan loss reserve build of $358 million in 2015.  The larger net reserve build in 2016 was primarily related to the

North America

cards franchise, driven primarily by the impact of the Costco portfolio acquisition, volume growth and seasoning and the absence of reserve releases that occurred in 2015 as credit normalized (see “

Global Consumer Banking

—

North America GCB

” below), partially offset by a net reserve release in

ICG

.  Overall, Citi expects its credit costs will likely be higher in 2017 as compared to 2016, driven by loan growth and seasoning.

For additional information on Citi’s consumer and corporate credit costs and allowance for loan losses, see “Credit Risk” below.

Capital

Citigroup’s Tier 1 Capital and Common Equity Tier 1 Capital ratios, on a fully implemented basis, were 14.2% and 12.6% as of December 31, 2016, respectively, compared to 13.5% and 12.1% as of December 31, 2015 (all based on the Basel III Advanced Approaches for determining risk-weighted assets).  Citigroup’s Supplementary Leverage ratio as of December 31, 2016, on a fully implemented basis, was 7.2%, compared to 7.1% as of December 31, 2015.  For additional information on Citi’s capital ratios and related components, including the

impact of Citi’s DTAs on its capital ratios, see “Capital Resources” below.

Citicorp

Citicorp net income decreased 12% from the prior year to $14.3 billion.  CVA/DVA, recorded in

ICG

,

was $269 million ($172 million after-tax) in 2015 (for a summary of CVA/DVA by business within

ICG

, see “

Institutional Clients Group

” below).  Excluding CVA/DVA in 2015, Citicorp’s net income decreased 11% from the prior year, primarily driven by lower revenues, higher expenses and higher credit costs.

Citicorp revenues decreased 2% from the prior year to $66.0 billion, reflecting a 2% decline in

GCB

revenues and lower revenues in

Corporate/Other

as

ICG

revenues were largely unchanged.  As referenced above, excluding CVA/DVA in 2015 and the impact of FX translation, Citicorp’s revenues increased 1% versus the prior year, as growth in the

GCB

and

ICG

franchises were partially offset by lower revenues in

Corporate/Other

.

GCB

revenues of $31.8 billion decreased 2% versus the prior year.  Excluding the impact of FX translation,

GCB

revenues increased 1%, as increases in

North America GCB

and

Latin America GCB

were

partially offset by a decrease in

Asia GCB

.

North America GCB

revenues increased 1% to $20.0 billion, as higher revenues in Citi-branded cards were partially offset by lower retail banking revenues.  Citi-branded cards revenues of $8.2 billion were up 5% versus the prior year, mostly reflecting the addition of the Costco portfolio.  Citi retail services revenues of $6.4 billion were largely unchanged versus the prior year, as the impact of previously disclosed renewals and extension of several partnerships as well as the absence of revenues from portfolio exits was offset by modest growth in average loans.  Retail banking revenues decreased 3% from the prior year to $5.3 billion.  Excluding the previously disclosed $110 million gain on the sale of branches in Texas in the prior year, retail banking revenues decreased 1% reflecting lower mortgage revenues, partially offset by higher average loans and checking deposits.

North America GCB

average deposits of $183 billion increased 1% year-over-year and average retail loans of $54 billion grew 9%.  Average Citi retail services loans of $44 billion increased 1% versus the prior year while retail services purchase sales of $80 billion were unchanged versus the prior year.  Average Citi-branded card loans of $73 billion increased 14%, while Citi-branded card purchase sales of $251 billion increased 37% versus the prior year, each including the impact of the Costco portfolio acquisition.

International

GCB

revenues (consisting of

Latin America GCB

and

Asia GCB

(which includes the results of operations of

GCB

activities in certain

EMEA

countries)) decreased 8% versus the prior year to $11.8 billion, driven by a decline in

Latin America GCB

(14%) and

Asia GCB

(2%).  Excluding the impact of FX translation, international

GCB

revenues were unchanged versus the prior year.

Latin America GCB

revenues increased 1% versus the prior year

,

as increases in average loan and deposit balances were partially offset by the


absence of the previously disclosed $160 million gain (excluding the impact of FX translation, $180 million as reported) related to the sale of Citi’s merchant acquiring business in Mexico in the third quarter of 2015.

Asia GCB

revenues declined 1% versus the prior year, reflecting

lower wealth management revenues driven by weak investor sentiment in early 2016, partially offset by growth in cards revenues.  For additional information on the results of operations of

Latin America GCB

and

Asia GCB

for 2016, including the impact of FX translation,

see “

Global Consumer Banking

” below.  Year-over-year, international

GCB

average deposits of $117 billion increased 6%, average retail loans of $86 billion decreased 1%, investment assets under management were largely unchanged, average card loans of $23 billion increased 1% and card purchase sales of $90 billion increased 3%, all excluding the impact of FX translation.

ICG

revenues were $33.9 billion in 2016, largely unchanged from the prior year as a 4% increase in

Markets and securities services

was offset by a 5% decrease in

Banking

revenues (including the impact of $594 of million mark-to-market losses on hedges related to accrual loans within corporate lending, compared to gains of $324 million in the prior year).  Excluding CVA/DVA in 2015 and the impact of mark-to-market gains (losses) on loan hedges,

ICG

revenues increased 3% from the prior year to $34.4 billion, driven by 6% growth in

Markets and securities services

and 1% growth in

Banking

revenues.

revenues of $17.1 billion (excluding CVA/DVA in 2015 and the impact of mark-to-market gains (losses) on hedges), were up 1% compared to the prior year, as growth in treasury and trade solutions and private bank were partially offset by lower investment banking revenues.  Investment banking revenues of $4.3 billion decreased 6% versus the prior year.  Advisory revenues decreased 9% to $1.0 billion, primarily reflecting lower activity during the first half of 2016.  Debt underwriting revenues increased 5% to $2.7 billion, as the continued low interest rate environment resulted in strong industry-wide activity in 2016, while equity underwriting revenues decreased 31% to $628 million, largely reflecting an industry-wide slowdown in activity during the year.

Private bank revenues increased 3% (3% excluding CVA/DVA in 2015) to $3.0 billion from the prior year, driven by loan growth and improved deposit spreads, partially offset by lower capital markets activity.  Corporate lending revenues declined 46% to $1.2 billion, including $594 million of mark-to-market losses on hedges related to accrual loans compared to a $324 million gain in the prior year.  Excluding the mark-to-market impact of loan hedges, corporate lending revenues decreased 3% versus the prior year, primarily driven by a lease financing adjustment in the second quarter of 2016, lower spreads and higher hedging costs.  Treasury and trade solutions revenues of $8.1 billion increased 4% versus the prior year.  Excluding the impact of FX translation, treasury and trade solutions revenues increased 8%, reflecting continued growth in transaction volumes and fee growth.

Markets and securities services

revenues of $17.3 billion, excluding CVA/DVA in 2015, increased 6% from the prior year.  Fixed income markets revenues of $13.0 billion

increased 13% (15% excluding CVA/DVA in 2015) from the prior year, driven by growth in both rates and currencies and spread products.  Equity markets revenues of $2.9 billion decreased 10% (9% excluding CVA/DVA in 2015) from the prior year, reflecting an industry-wide slowdown in client activity.  Securities services revenues of $2.2 billion increased 1% versus the prior year.  Excluding the impact of FX translation, securities services revenues increased 5% as increased client activity, higher deposit volumes and improved spreads more than offset the absence of revenues from divested businesses.  For additional information on the results of operations of

ICG

for 2016, see “

Institutional Clients Group

” below.

Corporate/Other

revenues decreased to $410 million from $908 million in the prior year, primarily reflecting the absence of gains from real estate and other asset sales and the equity contribution related to Citi’s stake in China Guangfa Bank, which was divested in the third quarter of 2016.  For additional information on the results of operations of

Corporate/Other

for 2016, see “

Corporate/Other

” below.

Citicorp end-of-period loans increased 4% to $591 billion from the prior year, driven by a 5% increase in consumer loans and a 3% increase in corporate loans.  Excluding the impact of FX translation, Citicorp loans grew 6%, with 8% growth in consumer loans and 4% growth in corporate loans.

Citi Holdings

Citi Holdings’ net income was $600 million in 2016, compared to $974 million in the prior year.  CVA/DVA

was negative $15 million (negative $10 million after-tax) in 2015.  Excluding the impact of CVA/DVA in the prior year, Citi Holdings’ net income was $600 million, compared to $984 million in the prior year, primarily reflecting lower revenues, partially offset lower expenses and lower credit costs.  Citi does not expect the same level of net income from Citi Holdings to recur in 2017.

Citi Holdings’ revenues were $3.9 billion, down 57% from the prior year.  Excluding CVA/DVA in 2015, Citi Holdings’ revenues also decreased 57% to $3.9 billion from the prior year, mainly reflecting continued reductions in Citi Holdings assets and lower net gains on asset sales.  For additional information on the results of operations of Citi Holdings for 2016, see “Citi Holdings” below.

As noted above, at the end of 2016, Citi Holdings’ assets were $54 billion, 33% below the prior year, and represented approximately 3% of Citi’s total GAAP assets.  Citi Holdings’ risk-weighted assets were $104 billion as of December 31, 2016, a decrease of 25% from the prior year, and represented 9% of Citi’s risk-weighted assets under Basel III (based on the Advanced Approaches for determining risk-weighted assets).

CITICORP

Citicorp is Citigroup’s global bank for consumers and businesses and represents Citi’s core franchises. Citicorp is focused on providing best-in-class products and services to customers and leveraging Citigroup’s unparalleled global network, including many of the world’s emerging economies.  Citicorp is physically present in 97 countries and jurisdictions, many for over 100 years, and offers services in over 160 countries and jurisdictions.  Citi believes this global network provides a strong foundation for servicing the broad financial services needs of its large multinational clients and for meeting the needs of retail, private banking, commercial, public sector and institutional clients around the world.

Citicorp consists of the following operating businesses:

Global Consumer Banking

(which consists of consumer banking businesses in

North America, Latin America

(consisting of Citi’s consumer banking businesses in Mexico) and

Asia

) and

Institutional Clients Group

(which includes

Banking

and

Markets and securities services

). Citicorp also includes

.  At December 31, 2016, Citicorp had approximately $1.7 trillion of assets and $927 billion of deposits, representing approximately 97% of Citi’s total assets and nearly100% of Citi’s total deposits.

As announced in April 2016, beginning in the first quarter of 2017, the remaining businesses and portfolios of assets in Citi Holdings will be reported as part of

Corporate/Other

and Citi Holdings will cease to be a separately reported business segment.  These businesses and assets, consisting of approximately $54 billion of assets, $33 billion of loans and $2 billion of deposits, contributed approximately $3.9 billion of revenues, $3.2 billion of expenses and net income of $600 million in 2016.

NORTH AMERICA GCB

North America GCB

provides traditional retail banking, including commercial banking, and its Citi-branded cards and Citi retail services card products to retail customers and small to mid-size businesses, as applicable, in the U.S.

North America GCB

’s U.S. cards product portfolio includes its proprietary portfolio (including the Citi Double Cash, Thank You and Value cards) and co-branded cards (including, among others, American Airlines and Costco) within Citi-branded cards as well as its co-brand and private label relationships (including, among others, Sears, The Home Depot, Macy’s and Best Buy) within Citi retail services.

As of December 31, 2016,

North America GCB

’s 723 retail bank branches are concentrated in the six key metropolitan areas of New York, Chicago, Miami, Washington, D.C., Los Angeles and San Francisco.  Also as of December 31, 2016,

North America GCB

had approximately 10.5 million retail banking customer accounts, $55.3 billion of retail banking loans and $185.0 billion of deposits.  In addition,

North America GCB

vs.


Net income

decreased by 22% due to significantly higher cost of credit and higher expenses, partially offset by higher revenues.

Revenues

increased 1%, reflecting higher revenues in Citi-branded cards, partially offset by lower revenues in retail banking.

Retail banking revenues decreased 3%.  Excluding the previously disclosed $110 million gain on sale of branches in Texas in the first quarter of 2015, revenues decreased 1%, primarily driven by lower mortgage revenues.  The decline in mortgage revenues was due to lower gain on sale revenues due to lower mortgage originations, lower servicing revenues and lower spreads driven by higher cost of funds.

North America GCB

expects higher interest rates could negatively impact mortgage revenues in 2017.  The decline in mortgage revenues was partially offset by continued volume growth, including growth in average loans (9%) and average checking deposits (9%).

Cards revenues increased 3%.  In Citi-branded cards, revenues increased 5%, primarily reflecting the acquisition of the Costco portfolio (completed June 17, 2016) as well as volume growth, partially offset by higher investment-related acquisition and rewards costs and the impact of higher promotional balances.  Average loans grew 14% (3% excluding Costco) and purchase sales grew 37% (9% excluding Costco), driven by continued investments in the portfolio.  While

North America GCB

believes it has largely absorbed the impact of higher acquisition and rewards costs as of year-end 2016, it expects the negative impact of higher promotional balances driven by new card accounts in the business could continue to impact Citi-branded cards revenues in the first half of 2017, with this impact abating in the second half of 2017.

Citi retail services revenues were largely unchanged as the impact of the previously disclosed renewal and extension of several partnerships within the portfolio as well as the absence of revenues from portfolio exits were offset by modest growth in average loans.  Average loans increased 1%, while purchase sales were largely unchanged.

North America GCB

expects Citi retail services revenues to continue to reflect the impacts of the more competitive terms of the partnership renewals and the portfolio sales during 2017, partially offset by volume growth.

Expenses

increased 7%, primarily due to the Costco acquisition, continued investment spending (including marketing spending), volume growth, higher repositioning charges and regulatory and compliance costs.  This increase was partially offset by ongoing efficiency savings, including continued reductions in retail banking branches (7%) in 2016, and lower legal and related costs.

Provisions

increased 33%, driven by a net loan loss reserve build ($658 million), compared to a loan loss reserve release in the prior year ($330 million), and higher net credit losses (5%).  The net loan loss reserve build mostly reflected reserve builds in the cards portfolios and was primarily driven by the impact of the acquisition of the Costco portfolio, as well as volume growth and seasoning of the portfolios and the absence of nearly $400 million of reserve releases in 2015 as

credit normalized.  The reserve build was also due to the estimated impact of proposed regulatory guidelines in July 2016 on third-party debt collections.

The increase in net credit losses was driven by increases in the cards businesses and retail banking.  In retail banking, net credit losses grew 38% to $207 million, primarily due to an increase related to Citi’s energy and energy-related exposures within the commercial banking portfolio, which was largely offset by releases of previously established loan loss reserves (for information on Citi’s energy and energy-related exposures within commercial banking in

North America

GCB

, see “Credit Risk—Commercial Credit” below).

In Citi-branded cards, net credit losses increased 1% to $1.9 billion, driven by volume growth (14% increase in average loans), including the impact of Costco beginning in the fourth quarter of 2016, seasoning and the impact of the regulatory changes on collections.   In Citi retail services, net credit losses increased 6% to $1.8 billion, primarily due to portfolio growth and seasoning and the impact of the regulatory changes on collections.

North America GCB

expects net credit losses in 2017 in cards to reflect the full year impact of the Costco portfolio acquisition, portfolio growth and seasoning and the impact of regulatory changes on collections.

For additional information on

North America GCB’s

retail banking, including commercial banking, and its Citi-branded cards and Citi retail services portfolios, see “Credit Risk—Consumer Credit” below.

2015 vs. 2014

Net income

decreased by 4% due to lower loan loss reserve releases and lower revenues, partially offset by lower expenses and lower net credit losses.

Revenues

decreased 1%, reflecting lower revenues in Citi-branded cards, partially offset by higher revenues in retail banking.  Retail banking revenues increased 5%.  The increase was primarily driven by 7% growth in average loans, 9% growth in average checking deposits, improved deposit spreads and slightly higher mortgage origination revenues, partially offset by lower net gains on branch sales (approximately $40 million) and mortgage portfolio sales (approximately $80 million) as well as a lower mortgage repurchase reserve release (approximately $50 million) compared to 2014.  Cards revenues decreased 3% due to a 2% decline in average loans, partially offset by a 4% increase in purchase sales.  In Citi-branded cards, revenues decreased 6%, primarily reflecting an increase in acquisition and rewards costs, particularly during the second half of 2015, as

North America GCB

deployed its investment spending to grow its new account acquisitions in its core products.  The decrease in Citi-branded cards revenues was also due to the continued impact of lower average loans (down 4%), driven primarily by continued high customer payment rates during the year, partially offset by a 6% increase in purchase sales.

Citi retail services revenues were largely unchanged as the continued impact of lower fuel prices and higher contractual partner payments was offset by the impact of higher spreads.  Purchase sales were unchanged as the


continued impact of lower fuel prices was offset by volume growth.

Expenses

decreased 5%, primarily due to ongoing cost reduction initiatives, including as a result of

North America GCB’s

branch rationalization strategy, and lower repositioning charges, partially offset by increased investment spending (including marketing, among other areas) in Citi-branded cards.

Provisions

increased 16% largely due to lower net loan loss reserve releases (74%), partially offset by lower net credit losses (11%).  Net credit losses declined in Citi-branded cards (down 14% to $1.9 billion) and in Citi retail services (down 8% to $1.7 billion).  The lower loan loss reserve release reflected overall credit stabilization in the cards portfolios during 2015.


LATIN AMERICA GCB

Latin America GCB

provides traditional retail banking, including commercial banking, and its Citi-branded card products to retail customers and small to mid-size businesses in Mexico through Citibanamex (previously known as Banco Nacional de Mexico, or Banamex), one of Mexico’s largest banks.

At December 31, 2016,

Latin America GCB

had 1,494 retail branches in Mexico, with approximately 27.4 million retail banking customer accounts, $18.3 billion in retail banking loans and $26.4 billion in deposits.  In addition, the business had approximately 5.8 million Citi-branded card accounts with $4.8 billion in outstanding loan balances.

vs.


Net income

increased 7%, driven by higher revenues and lower expenses, partially offset by higher credit costs.

Revenues

increased 1%, driven by overall volume growth, largely offset by the absence of a previously disclosed $160 million gain on sale (excluding the impact of FX translation, $180 million as reported) related to the sale of the merchant acquiring business in Mexico in the third quarter of 2015.  Excluding this gain, revenues increased 5%, primarily due to higher revenues in retail banking, partially offset by lower revenues in cards.

Retail banking revenues increased 4%.  Excluding the gain on sale related to the merchant acquiring business, revenues increased 9%, driven by volume growth, including an increase in average loans (8%) due to higher personal loans, and higher average deposits (12%).  Cards revenues decreased 4%, driven by the continued impact of higher payment rates, partially offset by increased purchase sales (8%).

Expenses

decreased 2% as lower legal and related expenses, the impact of business divestitures, ongoing efficiency savings and the impact of certain episodic items in 2015 were partially offset by higher repositioning charges and ongoing investment spending.  Citi continues to execute on its investment plans for Citibanamex (totaling more than $1 billion over the next several years), including initiatives to modernize the branch network, enhance digital capabilities and upgrade core operating platforms.

Provisions

increased 1%, driven by a higher net loan loss reserve build, partially offset by lower net credit losses.  The net loan loss reserve build increased $56 million, largely due to volume growth within the personal loan and mortgage portfolios.  Net credit losses decreased 5%, largely reflecting continued lower net credit losses in the cards portfolio due to a focus on higher credit quality customers, partially offset by higher net credit losses in the personal loan portfolio.  Despite this decrease,

Latin America GCB

expects net credit losses within its loan portfolios could increase consistent with continued portfolio growth and seasoning.  For additional information on

Latin

America GCB’s

retail banking, including commercial banking, and its Citi-branded cards portfolios, see “Credit Risk—Consumer Credit” below.

In 2016, Mexico experienced slower economic growth and the value of the peso declined, particularly later in the year, which resulted in higher inflation and negatively impacted consumer confidence.  These factors could negatively impact

Latin America GCB’s

results in the near term.  For additional information on potential macroeconomic and geopolitical challenges and other risks facing

Latin America GCB

, see “Risk Factors—Strategic Risks” below.

2015 vs. 2014

Net income

decreased 7% as higher expenses were partially offset by higher revenues and lower credit costs.

Revenues

increased 3%, primarily due to the gain on sale related to the Mexico merchant acquiring business.  Excluding this gain, revenues were largely unchanged as higher retail banking revenues were offset by lower cards revenues.  Revenues were also impacted by continued slow economic growth in Mexico during 2015.  Retail banking revenues increased 2%, excluding the gain on sale related to the merchant acquiring business.  This increase in retail banking revenues reflected volume growth.  Cards revenues decreased 2%, primarily due to higher payment rates, as well as muted volumes and ongoing shifts in consumer behavior, including due to the previously disclosed regulatory reforms in Mexico enacted in 2013.

Expenses

increased 8%, primarily due to higher regulatory and compliance costs, higher technology spending and mandatory salary increases, partially offset by lower repositioning charges, lower legal and related costs and ongoing efficiency savings.

Provisions

declined 6%, driven by a higher net loan loss reserve release.  Net credit losses were largely unchanged as higher net credit losses in the commercial banking and small business banking portfolios were offset by the absence of a $71 million charge-off in the fourth quarter of 2014 related to Citi’s homebuilder exposure in Mexico.  The net loan loss reserve build declined 70%, primarily due to lower builds related to cards, partially offset by the absence of releases related to the homebuilder exposure in 2014.


ASIA GCB

Asia GCB

provides traditional retail banking, including commercial banking, and its Citi-branded card products to retail customers and small to mid-size businesses, as applicable.

vs.


Net income

decreased 10%, reflecting lower revenues and higher expenses.

Revenues

decreased 1%, reflecting lower retail banking revenues, partially offset by higher cards revenues.  Retail banking revenues decreased 2%, mainly due to a 5% decrease in wealth management revenues due to lower client activity in the first half of 2016, particularly in China, Hong Kong and Korea.  The decline in retail banking revenues was also due to modestly lower investment assets under management (1%) driven by lower equity market values and a decline in average loans (decrease of 4%).  The decline in revenues was partially offset by growth in deposit volumes (4% increase in average deposits) and higher insurance revenues.  The lower average loans were due to the continued optimization of the retail loan portfolio away from lower-yielding mortgage loans, as well as de-risking in the commercial portfolio with a focus on growing higher return personal loans.

Cards revenues increased 2%, driven by continued improvement in yields, modestly abating regulatory headwinds and modest volume growth due to continued stabilizing payment rates.  Volume growth was driven by a 1% increase in average loans and a 2% increase in purchase sales.

Expenses

increased 3%, primarily due to higher repositioning costs in the first half of 2016, higher regulatory and compliance costs and increased investment spending, partially offset by efficiency savings.

Provisions

were largely unchanged as lower net loan loss reserve releases were offset by lower net credit losses, primarily in the commercial portfolio due to the de-risking.

2015 vs. 2014

Net income

was largely unchanged as lower revenues were offset by lower expenses and lower cost of credit.

Revenues

decreased 3%, primarily due to an industry-wide slowdown in investment sales, particularly in the second half of 2015, as well as spread compression and higher payment rates and the ongoing impact of regulatory changes in cards, partially offset by volume growth.  Retail banking revenues decreased 2%, mainly due to a decline in investment sales revenue, reflecting weaker customer confidence due to slowing economic growth and volatility in the capital markets, as well as spread compression.  This decline in revenues was partially offset by higher volumes, driven by lending (2% increase in average loans), deposit products (5% increase in average deposits) and higher insurance fee revenues.

Cards revenues decreased 5%, primarily due to spread compression, including continued high payment rates, and the ongoing impact of regulatory changes, partially offset by modest volume growth (a 3% increase in average loans and a 5% increase in purchase sales).  Cards revenues were also impacted by the weaker customer confidence.

Expenses

decreased 4%, primarily due to the absence of repositioning charges in Korea in 2014 and efficiency savings, partially offset by higher regulatory and compliance costs, investment spending, volume-related growth and compensation expense.

Provisions

decreased 5%, primarily due to higher loan loss reserve releases, largely offset by an increase in net credit losses related to the consumer business in Russia due to deterioration in the economic environment.


INSTITUTIONAL CLIENTS GROUP

Institutional Clients Group (ICG)

ICG

transacts with clients in both cash instruments and derivatives, including fixed income, foreign currency, equity and commodity products.

ICG

revenue is generated primarily from fees and spreads associated with these activities.

ICG

earns fee income for assisting clients in clearing transactions, providing brokerage and investment banking services and other such activities.  Revenue generated from these activities is recorded in

Commissions and fees

and

.  Revenue is also generated from transaction processing and assets under custody and administration. Revenue generated from these activities is primarily recorded in

Administration and other fiduciary fees

. In addition, as a market maker,

ICG

facilitates transactions, including holding product inventory to meet client demand, and earns the differential between the price at which it buys and sells the products. These price differentials and the unrealized gains and losses on the inventory are recorded in

Principal transactions

(for additional information on

Principal transactions

revenue, see Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements).

Other

primarily includes mark-to-market gains and losses on certain credit derivatives, gains and losses on available-for-sale (AFS) securities and other non-recurring gains and losses. Interest income earned on assets held less interest paid to customers on deposits and long-term and short-term debt is recorded as

Net interest revenue

.

The amount and types of

Markets

revenues are impacted by a variety of interrelated factors, including market liquidity; changes in market variables such as interest rates, foreign exchange rates, equity prices, commodity prices, and credit spreads, as well as their implied volatilities; investor confidence; and other macroeconomic conditions. Assuming all other market conditions do not change, increases in client activity levels or bid/offer spreads generally result in increases in revenues.  However, changes in market conditions can significantly impact client activity levels, bid/offer spreads, and the fair value of product inventory. For example, a decrease in market liquidity may increase bid/offer spreads, decrease client activity levels, and widen credit spreads on product inventory positions.

ICG’s

management of the

Markets

businesses involves daily monitoring and evaluating of the above factors at the trading desk as well as the country level.

ICG

does not separately track the impact on total

Markets

revenues of the volume of transactions, bid/offer spreads, fair value changes of product inventory positions and economic hedges because, as noted above, these components are interrelated and are not deemed useful or necessary individually to manage the

Markets

businesses at an aggregate

level.

In the

Markets

businesses, client revenues are those revenues directly attributable to client transactions at the time of inception, including commissions, interest, or fees earned. Client revenues do not include the results of client facilitation activities (for example, holding product inventory in anticipation of client demand) or the results of certain economic hedging activities.

ICG

’s international presence is supported by trading floors in approximately 80 countries and a proprietary network in 97 countries and jurisdictions. At December 31, 2016,

ICG

had approximately $1.3 trillion of assets and $610 billion of deposits, while two of its businesses, securities services and issuer services, managed approximately $15.2 trillion of assets under custody compared to $15.1 trillion at the end of 2015.

The increase was primarily due to continued growth in transaction volumes with new and existing clients, continued growth in deposit balances and improved spreads in certain regions. The trade business experienced modest growth due to a continued focus on high quality loan growth and spread improvements. End-of-period deposit balances increased 5% (6% excluding the impact of FX translation), while average trade loans decreased 2% (1% excluding the impact of FX translation).

Fixed income markets

revenues increased 15%, with higher revenues in all regions. The increase was largely driven by both higher principal transactions revenues (up 22%) and other revenues (up 78%). The increase in principal transactions revenues was primarily due to higher rates and currencies revenues, reflecting increased client revenues and higher volatility. Principal transactions revenues also increased due to higher spread products revenues. Other revenues increased mainly due to foreign currency losses in 2015.

Rates and currencies revenues grew 22%, driven by strength in all regions, primarily due to a more favorable trading environment and higher client revenues, particularly with corporate clients. The increase in client revenues was primarily driven by volatility following the vote in the U.K. to withdraw from the EU and the U.S. presidential election, as well as changing expectations regarding the interest rate environment.  Spread products revenues increased 5% offset by lower other fixed income revenues. The increase in spread products revenues reflects higher client revenues in credit products, securitized products and municipal securities, particularly in the second half of 2016 as client risk appetite recovered. This increase in spread products revenues was partially offset by the impact of significantly lower liquidity in the market in the first quarter of 2016, particularly in securitized products, as well as market uncertainty in municipal securities in the fourth quarter of 2016 due to potential changes in U.S. tax laws following the U.S. presidential election.

Provisions

decreased 49%, driven by a net loan loss reserve release of $30 million (compared to a net build of $748 million in the prior year).  The significant decline in loan loss reserve builds related to energy and energy-related exposures, and was driven by stabilization of commodities as oil prices continued to recover from lows in early 2016.  The decline in cost of credit was partially offset by higher net credit losses of $516 million (compared to $214 million in the prior year) mostly related to the energy and energy-related exposures, with a vast majority offset by the release of previously established loan loss reserves.

Provisions

increased $915 million to $962 million, primarily reflecting a net loan loss reserve build ($748 million), compared to a net loan loss reserve release ($228 million) in 2014.  The net loan loss reserve build included approximately $530 million for energy and energy-related exposures, including $250 million in the fourth quarter of 2015, due to the significant decline in commodity prices during the second half of 2015. The remainder of the build during 2015 was primarily due to volume growth and overall macroeconomic conditions.

The higher net loan loss reserve build during 2015 was partially offset by lower net credit losses.  Net credit losses decreased 22%, primarily due to the absence of net credit losses of approximately $165 million related to the Petróleos Mexicanos (Pemex) supplier program, which were incurred during 2014 (for additional information, see Citi’s Form 8-K filed with the SEC on February 28, 2014), partially offset by increased net credit losses related to a limited number of energy and energy-related exposures, including approximately $75 million in the fourth quarter of 2015.

vs.


The

net loss

was $659 million, compared to net income of $424 million in 2015, primarily reflecting lower revenues and a higher effective tax rate in 2016 due to the absence of certain tax benefits in 2015.  The net loss was also due to the absence of the favorable tax impact reflecting the resolution of state and local audits in the second quarter of 2015.

Revenues

decreased 55%, primarily due to the absence of gains on real estate and other asset sales in 2015, lower gains on debt buybacks and the absence of the equity contribution related to China Guangfa Bank (which was sold in the third quarter of 2016), partially offset by higher investment income.

Expenses

increased 2%, largely driven by higher corporate-wide advertising and marketing expenses primarily related to Citi’s sponsorship of the U.S. Olympic team and higher consulting costs, partially offset by lower legal and related expenses, lower repositioning costs and a benefit from FX translation.

2015 vs. 2014

Net income

was $424 million, compared to a net loss of $5.4 billion in 2014, largely reflecting significantly lower expenses, the increased tax benefits and the favorable tax impact reflecting the resolution of the state and local audits, as well as higher revenues.

Revenues

increased $605 million to $908 million, primarily due to the gains on debt buybacks and the real estate sales in 2015, as well as higher revenues from sales of AFS securities, partially offset by hedging activities.

Expenses

decreased $4.3 billion to $1.8 billion, largely driven by lower legal and related expenses ($797 million compared to $4.4 billion in 2014), a benefit from FX translation and lower repositioning charges.


CITI HOLDINGS

Citi Holdings contains the remaining businesses and portfolios of assets that Citigroup has determined are not central to its core Citicorp businesses.  As announced in April 2016, Citi will no longer report the results of Citi Holdings separately beginning in the first quarter of 2017 and Citi Holdings will cease to be a separately reported business segment.  For additional information, see “Citigroup Segments” and “Citicorp” above.

As of December 31, 2016, Citi Holdings assets were approximately $54 billion, a decrease of 33% year-over-year and 11% from September 30, 2016.  The decline in assets of $7 billion from September 30, 2016 primarily consisted of divestitures and run-off.  As of December 31, 2016, Citi had signed agreements to reduce Citi Holdings GAAP assets by an additional $9 billion, subject to regulatory approvals and other closing conditions.

Also as of December 31, 2016, consumer assets in Citi Holdings were approximately $49 billion, or approximately 91% of Citi Holdings assets.  Of the consumer assets, approximately $28 billion, or 57%, consisted of

North America

mortgages (residential first mortgages and home equity loans).  As of December 31, 2016, Citi Holdings represented approximately 3% of Citi’s GAAP assets and 9% of its risk-weighted assets under Basel III (based on the Advanced Approaches).

vs.


Net income

was $600 million, compared to net income of $984 million in 2015, primarily due to lower revenues, partially offset by lower expenses and lower credit costs.

Revenues

decreased 57%, primarily driven by the overall wind-down of the portfolio and lower net gains on sales, particularly the sales of OneMain Financial and the retail banking and credit cards businesses in Japan in the fourth quarter of 2015.

Expenses

declined 43%, primarily due to sales and run-off of assets, lower legal and related costs and lower repositioning costs.

Provisions

decreased 95% due to lower net credit losses and a lower provision for benefits and claims (decrease of 84%) due to lower insurance-related business activity.  Net credit losses declined 68%, primarily due to the impact of divestitures and continued credit improvements in

North America

mortgages.  The net reserve release declined 3%.

2015 vs. 2014

Net income

was $984 million, an improvement from a net loss of $3.4 billion in 2014, largely due to the impact of a charge of $3.8 billion ($3.7 billion after-tax) in 2014 to settle RMBS and CDO-related claims.  Excluding the mortgage settlement, net income increased $705 million, primarily due to lower expenses and lower net credit losses, partially offset by a lower net loan loss reserve release and lower revenues.

Revenues

decreased 4%, primarily driven by the overall wind-down of the portfolio, the impact of redemptions of high cost debt and the impact of recording OneMain Financial net credit losses as a reduction of revenue beginning in the second quarter of 2015, mostly offset by higher gains on asset sales, including the sales of OneMain Financial and the retail banking and credit cards businesses in Japan.

Expenses

declined 49%.  Excluding the impact of the mortgage settlement, expenses declined 22%, primarily due to sales and run-off of Citi Holdings assets and lower legal and related costs ($431 million compared to $1.0 billion in 2014).

Provisions

decreased 22%.  Excluding the impact of the mortgage settlement, provisions decreased 20%, driven by lower net credit losses, partially offset by a lower net loss reserve release.  Net credit losses declined 39%, primarily due to the impact of the recording of OneMain Financial net credit losses as a reduction in revenue, continued improvements in

North America

mortgages and overall lower asset levels.  The net reserve release decreased 49%.  Excluding the impact of the mortgage settlement, the net reserve release decreased 52% to $478 million, primarily due to lower releases related to the

North America

mortgage portfolio.

Payment Protection Insurance (PPI)

The selling of PPI by financial institutions in the U.K. has been the subject of intense review and focus by U.K. regulators and the U.K. Supreme Court.  For additional information on PPI, see “Citi Holdings” in Citi’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2013 filed with the SEC on March 3, 2014.

PPI is designed to cover a customer’s loan repayments if certain events occur, such as long-term illness or unemployment.  The U.K. Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) found certain problems across the industry with how these products were sold, including customers not realizing that the cost of PPI premiums was being added to their loan or PPI being unsuitable for the customer.  Redress generally involves

the repayment of premiums and the refund of all applicable contractual interest together with compensatory interest of 8%.  In addition, during the fourth quarter of 2015, the U.K. Supreme Court issued a ruling in a case (Plevin) involving PPI pursuant to which the court ruled, independent of the sale of the PPI contract, the PPI contract at issue in the case was “unfair” due to the high sales commissions earned and the lack of disclosure to the customer thereof.

During the third quarter of 2016, the FCA issued a new consultation paper that proposed (i) a deadline for PPI complaints of June 2019 (a 2018 deadline was proposed previously) for both non-Plevin and Plevin complaints; (ii) an FCA-led customer communications campaign in advance of the deadline, with bank funding of the campaign; and (iii) a failure to disclose a sales commission of 50% or more would be deemed unfair when assessing a new PPI complaint and require a customer refund of the difference between the commission paid and 50%, plus interest.  Final rules have not yet been published by the FCA.

During 2016, Citi increased its PPI reserves by approximately $134 million ($63 million of which was recorded in Citi Holdings and $71 million of which was recorded in discontinued operations).  The increase for full year 2016 compared to an increase of $153 million during 2015 and was primarily due to the new proposed deadline for PPI complaints as well as the ongoing level of PPI claims.

Citi’s year-end 2016 PPI reserve was $228 million (compared to $262 million as of December 31, 2015).

Additional reserving actions, if any, in 2017 will largely depend on the timing and requirements of the FCA’s final rules and the level of customer response to any communications campaign.


OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS

Citigroup enters into various types of off-balance sheet arrangements in the ordinary course of business. Citi’s involvement in these arrangements can take many different forms, including without limitation:

•

purchasing or retaining residual and other interests in unconsolidated special purpose entities, such as mortgage-backed and other asset-backed securitization entities;

•

holding senior and subordinated debt, interests in limited and general partnerships and equity interests in other unconsolidated special purpose entities;

•

providing guarantees, indemnifications, loan commitments, letters of credit and representations and warranties; and

•

entering into operating leases for property and equipment.

Citi enters into these arrangements for a variety of business purposes. For example, securitization arrangements offer investors access to specific cash flows and risks created through the securitization process. Securitization arrangements also assist Citi and its customers in monetizing their financial assets and securing financing at more favorable rates than Citi or the customers could otherwise obtain.

The table below shows where a discussion of Citi’s various off-balance sheet arrangements may be found in this Form 10-K. In addition, see Notes 1, 21 and 26 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

For additional information about long-term debt obligations, see “Liquidity Risk—Long-Term Debt” below and Note


to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

(2)

Contractual obligations related to interest payments on long-term debt for 2017–2021 are calculated by applying the December 31,


weighted-average interest rate (

3.49%

) on average outstanding long-term debt to the average remaining contractual obligations on long-term debt for each of those years. The “Thereafter” interest payments on long-term debt for the remaining years to maturity (2022–2098) are calculated by applying current interest rates on the remaining contractual obligations on long-term debt for each of those years.

(3)

Purchase obligations consist of obligations to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding on Citi. For presentation purposes, purchase obligations are included in the table above through the termination date of the respective agreements, even if the contract is renewable. Many of the purchase agreements for goods or services include clauses that would allow Citi to cancel the agreement with specified notice; however, that impact is not included in the table above (unless Citi has already notified the counterparty of its intention to terminate the agreement).

CAPITAL RESOURCES

Overview

Capital is used principally to support assets in Citi’s businesses and to absorb credit, market, and operational losses. Citi primarily generates capital through earnings from its operating businesses. Citi may augment its capital through issuances of common stock, noncumulative perpetual preferred stock and equity issued through awards under employee benefit plans, among other issuances. Further, Citi’s capital levels may also be affected by changes in accounting and regulatory standards as well as U.S. corporate tax laws, and the impact of future events on Citi’s business results, such as changes in interest and foreign exchange rates, as well as business and asset dispositions.

During 2016, Citi returned a total of approximately $10.7 billion of capital to common shareholders in the form of share repurchases (approximately 196 million common shares) and dividends.

Capital Management

Citi’s capital management framework is designed to ensure that Citigroup and its principal subsidiaries maintain sufficient capital consistent with each entity’s respective risk profile, management targets, and all applicable regulatory standards and guidelines. Citi assesses its capital adequacy against a series of internal quantitative capital goals, designed to evaluate the Company’s capital levels in expected and stressed economic environments. Underlying these internal quantitative capital goals are strategic capital considerations, centered on preserving and building financial strength. The Citigroup Capital Committee, with oversight from the Risk Management Committee of Citigroup’s Board of Directors, has responsibility for Citi’s aggregate capital structure, including the capital assessment and planning process, which is integrated into Citi’s capital plan. Balance sheet management, including oversight of capital adequacy, for Citigroup’s subsidiaries is governed by each entity’s Asset and Liability Committee, where applicable. For additional information regarding Citi’s capital planning and stress testing exercises, see “Capital Planning and Stress Testing” below.

Current Regulatory Capital Standards

Citi is subject to regulatory capital standards issued by the Federal Reserve Board which constitute the U.S. Basel III rules. These rules establish an integrated capital adequacy framework, encompassing both risk-based capital ratios and leverage ratios.

Risk-Based Capital Ratios

The U.S. Basel III rules set forth the composition of regulatory capital (including the application of regulatory capital adjustments and deductions), as well as two comprehensive methodologies (a Standardized Approach and Advanced Approaches) for measuring total risk-weighted assets. Total risk-weighted assets under the Advanced Approaches, which are primarily models based, include credit, market, and operational risk-weighted assets. Conversely, the Standardized Approach excludes operational risk-weighted assets and generally applies prescribed supervisory risk weights to broad categories of credit risk exposures. As a result, credit risk-weighted assets calculated under the Advanced Approaches are more risk sensitive than those calculated under the Standardized Approach. Market risk-weighted assets are derived on a generally consistent basis under both approaches.

The U.S. Basel III rules establish stated minimum Common Equity Tier 1 Capital, Tier 1 Capital and Total Capital ratios for substantially all U.S. banking organizations, including Citi and Citibank, N.A. (Citibank). Moreover, these rules provide for both a fixed Capital Conservation Buffer and, for Advanced Approaches banking organizations, such as Citi and Citibank, also a discretionary Countercyclical Capital Buffer. These capital buffers would be available to absorb losses in advance of any potential impairment of regulatory capital below the stated minimum risk-based capital ratio requirements. In September 2016, the Federal Reserve Board released a policy statement which established the framework for setting the amount of the U.S. Countercyclical Capital Buffer. Separately, in October 2016, the Federal Reserve Board voted to affirm the Countercyclical Capital Buffer amount at the current level of 0%.

Further, the U.S. Basel III rules implement the “capital floor provision” of the so-called “Collins Amendment” of the Dodd-Frank Act, which requires Advanced Approaches

banking organizations to calculate each of the three risk-based capital ratios (Common Equity Tier 1 Capital, Tier 1 Capital, and Total Capital) under both the U.S. Basel III Standardized Approach starting on January 1, 2015 and the Advanced Approaches and publicly report (as well as measure compliance against) the lower of each of the resulting risk-based capital ratios.


GSIB Surcharge

In August 2015, the Federal Reserve Board issued a rule which imposes a risk-based capital surcharge upon U.S. bank holding companies that are identified as global systemically important bank holding companies (GSIBs), including Citi. The GSIB surcharge augments the Capital Conservation Buffer and, if invoked, any Countercyclical Capital Buffer, and would result in restrictions on earnings distributions (e.g., dividends, equity repurchases, and discretionary executive bonuses) should the expanded buffer be breached to absorb losses during periods of financial or economic stress, with the degree of such restrictions based upon the extent to which the expanded buffer is breached.

Under the Federal Reserve Board’s rule, identification of a GSIB is based primarily on quantitative measurement indicators underlying five equally weighted broad categories of systemic importance: (i) size, (ii) interconnectedness, (iii) cross-jurisdictional activity, (iv) substitutability, and (v) complexity. With the exception of size, each of the other categories are comprised of multiple indicators also of equal weight, and amounting to 12 indicators in total.

A U.S. bank holding company that is designated a GSIB under the established methodology is required, on an annual basis, to calculate a surcharge using two methods and will be subject to the higher of the resulting two surcharges. The first method (“method 1”) is based on the same five broad categories of systemic importance used to identify a GSIB. Under the second method (“method 2”), the substitutability category is replaced with a quantitative measure intended to assess the extent of a GSIB’s reliance on short-term wholesale funding. Moreover, method 1 incorporates relative measures of systemic importance across certain global banking organizations and a year-end spot foreign exchange rate, whereas method 2 uses fixed measures of systemic importance and application of an average foreign exchange rate over a three-year period. Effective for 2017 and thereafter, the GSIB surcharges calculated under both method 1 and method 2 are based on measures of systemic importance from the year immediately preceding that in which the GSIB surcharge calculations are being performed (e.g., the method 1 and method 2 GSIB surcharges to be calculated by December 31, 2017 will be based on 2016 systemic indicator data). Generally, the surcharge derived under method 2 will result in a higher surcharge than derived under method 1.

Should a GSIB’s systemic importance change year-over-year such that it becomes subject to a higher surcharge, the higher surcharge would not become effective for a full year (e.g., a higher surcharge calculated by December 31, 2017 would not become effective until January 1, 2019). However, if a GSIB’s systemic importance changes such that the GSIB would be subject to a lower surcharge, the GSIB would be subject to the lower surcharge beginning with the next calendar year (e.g., a lower surcharge calculated by December 31, 2017 would become effective January 1, 2018).

GSIB surcharges under the rule, which are required to be composed entirely of Common Equity Tier 1 Capital, initially range from 1.0% to 4.5% of total risk-weighted assets. Citi’s initial GSIB surcharge effective January 1, 2016 was 3.5%, as derived under method 2. However, ongoing efforts in addressing quantitative measures of systemic importance have resulted in a reduction of Citi’s method 2 GSIB surcharge to 3%, effective January 1, 2017. Citi’s method 1 GSIB surcharge for 2016 was lower at 2%, and remains unchanged for 2017. Citi expects that its method 2 GSIB surcharge will continue to remain higher than its GSIB surcharge derived under method 1, and as such Citi’s GSIB surcharge effective for 2018 and 2019 would not exceed 3%.

Transition Provisions

The U.S. Basel III rules contain several differing, largely multi-year transition provisions (i.e., “phase-ins” and “phase-outs”), including with respect to substantially all regulatory capital adjustments and deductions, and non-qualifying Tier 1 and Tier 2 Capital instruments (such as non-grandfathered trust preferred securities and certain subordinated debt issuances). Moreover, the GSIB surcharge, Capital Conservation Buffer, and any Countercyclical Capital Buffer (currently 0%), commenced phase-in on January 1, 2016, becoming fully effective on January 1, 2019. With the exception of the non-grandfathered trust preferred securities which do not fully phase-out until January 1, 2022 and the capital buffers and GSIB surcharge which do not fully phase-in until January 1, 2019, all other transition provisions will be entirely reflected in Citi’s regulatory capital ratios by January 1, 2018. Citi considers all of these transition provisions as being fully implemented on January 1, 2019 (full implementation), with the inclusion of the capital buffers and GSIB surcharge.

The following chart sets forth the transitional progression from January 1, 2015 to full implementation by January 1, 2019 of the regulatory capital components (i.e., inclusive of the mandatory 2.5% Capital Conservation Buffer and the Countercyclical Capital Buffer at its current level of 0%, as well as an estimated 3% GSIB surcharge) comprising the effective minimum risk-based capital ratios.


Basel III Transition Arrangements: Minimum Risk-Based Capital Ratios

The following chart presents the transition arrangements (phase-in and phase-out) from January 1, 2015 through January 1, 2018 under the U.S. Basel III rules for significant regulatory capital adjustments and deductions relative to Citi.

Basel III Transition Arrangements: Significant Regulatory Capital Adjustments and Deductions

(1)

Includes the phase-in of Common Equity Tier 1 Capital deductions for all intangible assets other than goodwill and mortgage servicing rights (MSRs); and excess over 10%/15% limitations for deferred tax assets (DTAs) arising from temporary differences, significant common stock investments in unconsolidated financial institutions and MSRs. Goodwill (including goodwill “embedded” in the valuation of significant common stock investments in unconsolidated financial institutions) is fully deducted in arriving at Common Equity Tier 1 Capital. The amount of other intangible assets, aside from MSRs, not deducted in arriving at Common Equity Tier 1 Capital are risk-weighted at 100%, as are the excess over the 10%/15% limitations for DTAs arising from temporary differences, significant common stock investments in unconsolidated financial institutions and MSRs prior to full implementation of the U.S. Basel III rules. Upon full implementation, the amount of temporary difference DTAs, significant common stock investments in unconsolidated financial institutions and MSRs not deducted in arriving at Common Equity Tier 1 Capital are risk-weighted at 250%.

(2)

Includes the phase-in of Common Equity Tier 1 Capital deductions related to DTAs arising from net operating loss, foreign tax credit and general business credit carry-forwards and defined benefit pension plan net assets; and the phase-in of the Common Equity Tier 1 Capital adjustment for cumulative unrealized net gains (losses) related to changes in fair value of financial liabilities attributable to Citi’s own creditworthiness.

(3)

To the extent Additional Tier 1 Capital is not sufficient to absorb regulatory capital adjustments and deductions, such excess is to be applied against Common Equity Tier 1 Capital.

(4)

Includes the phase-out from Common Equity Tier 1 Capital of adjustments related to unrealized gains (losses) on available-for-sale (AFS) debt securities; unrealized gains on AFS equity securities; unrealized gains (losses) on held-to-maturity (HTM) securities included in

Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)

(AOCI); and defined benefit plans liability adjustment.

Under the U.S. Basel III rules, Citi, as with principally all U.S. banking organizations, is also required to maintain a minimum Tier 1 Leverage ratio of 4%. The Tier 1 Leverage ratio, a non-risk-based measure of capital adequacy, is defined as Tier 1 Capital as a percentage of quarterly adjusted average total assets less amounts deducted from Tier 1 Capital.

Supplementary Leverage Ratio

Advanced Approaches banking organizations are additionally required to calculate a Supplementary Leverage ratio, which significantly differs from the Tier 1 Leverage ratio by also including certain off-balance sheet exposures within the denominator of the ratio (Total Leverage Exposure). The Supplementary Leverage ratio represents end of period Tier 1 Capital to Total Leverage Exposure, with the latter defined as the sum of the daily average of on-balance sheet assets for the quarter and the average of certain off-balance sheet exposures calculated as of the last day of each month in the quarter, less applicable Tier 1 Capital deductions. Advanced Approaches banking organizations will be required to maintain a stated minimum Supplementary Leverage ratio of 3% commencing on January 1, 2018, but were required to publicly disclose the ratio commencing with the first quarter of 2015.

Further, U.S. GSIBs, and their subsidiary insured depository institutions, including Citi and Citibank, are subject to enhanced Supplementary Leverage ratio standards. The enhanced Supplementary Leverage ratio standards establish a 2% leverage buffer for U.S. GSIBs in addition to the stated 3% minimum Supplementary Leverage ratio requirement in the U.S. Basel III rules. If a U.S. GSIB fails to exceed the 2% leverage buffer, it will be subject to increasingly onerous restrictions (depending upon the extent of the shortfall) regarding capital distributions and discretionary executive bonus payments. Accordingly, U.S. GSIBs are effectively subject to a 5% minimum Supplementary Leverage ratio requirement. Citi is required to be compliant with this higher effective minimum ratio requirement on January 1, 2018.

Prompt Corrective Action Framework

The U.S. Basel III rules revised the Prompt Corrective Action (PCA) regulations applicable to insured depository institutions in certain respects.

In general, the PCA regulations direct the U.S. banking agencies to enforce increasingly strict limitations on the activities of insured depository institutions that fail to meet certain regulatory capital thresholds. The PCA framework contains five categories of capital adequacy as measured by risk-based capital and leverage ratios: (i) “well capitalized”; (ii) “adequately capitalized”; (iii) “undercapitalized”;          (iv) “significantly undercapitalized”; and (v) “critically undercapitalized.”

Accordingly, beginning January 1, 2015, an insured depository institution, such as Citibank, must maintain minimum Common Equity Tier 1 Capital, Tier 1 Capital, Total Capital, and Tier 1 Leverage ratios of 6.5%, 8%, 10%

and 5%, respectively, to be considered “well capitalized.” Additionally, insured depository institution subsidiaries of U.S. GSIBs, such as Citibank, must maintain a minimum Supplementary Leverage ratio of 6%, effective January 1, 2018, to be considered “well capitalized.”

Capital Planning and Stress Testing

Citi is subject to an annual assessment by the Federal Reserve Board as to whether Citi has effective capital planning processes as well as sufficient regulatory capital to absorb losses during stressful economic and financial conditions, while also meeting obligations to creditors and counterparties and continuing to serve as a credit intermediary. This annual assessment includes two related programs:

•

The Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) evaluates Citi’s capital adequacy, capital adequacy process, and its planned capital distributions, such as dividend payments and common stock repurchases. As part of CCAR, the Federal Reserve Board assesses whether Citi has sufficient capital to continue operations throughout times of economic and financial market stress and whether Citi has robust, forward-looking capital planning processes that account for its unique risks. The Federal Reserve Board may object to Citi’s annual capital plan based on either quantitative or qualitative grounds. If the Federal Reserve Board objects to Citi’s annual capital plan, Citi may not undertake any capital distribution unless the Federal Reserve Board indicates in writing that it does not object to the distribution.

•

Dodd-Frank Act Stress Testing (DFAST) is a forward-looking quantitative evaluation of the impact of stressful economic and financial market conditions on Citi’s regulatory capital. This program serves to inform the Federal Reserve Board, the financial companies, and the general public, how Citi’s regulatory capital ratios might change using a hypothetical set of adverse economic conditions as designed by the Federal Reserve Board. In addition to the annual supervisory stress test conducted by the Federal Reserve Board, Citi is required to conduct annual company-run stress tests under the same adverse economic conditions designed by the Federal Reserve Board, as well as conduct a mid-cycle stress test under company-developed scenarios.

Both CCAR and DFAST include an estimate of projected revenues, losses, reserves, pro forma regulatory capital ratios, and any other additional capital measures deemed relevant by Citi. Projections are required over a nine-quarter planning horizon under three supervisory scenarios (baseline, adverse and severely adverse conditions). All risk-based capital ratios reflect application of the Standardized Approach framework and the transition arrangements under the U.S. Basel III rules. Moreover, the Federal Reserve Board has deferred the use of the Advanced Approaches framework indefinitely, and has modified the


2017 CCAR instructions, in part, to incorporate the Supplementary Leverage ratio. Accordingly, Advanced Approaches banking organizations will therefore be required to demonstrate an ability to maintain a Supplementary Leverage ratio in excess of the stated minimum requirement for the quarters of the 2017 CCAR planning horizon which are subsequent to the effective date of the ratio (i.e., the first quarter of 2018 through the first quarter of 2019).

In February 2017, the Federal Reserve Board issued a final rule adopting certain revisions to its capital planning and stress testing rules which become effective with the 2017 CCAR cycle. The revisions include a reduction in the amount of capital a banking organization subject to the quantitative requirements of CCAR may request to distribute in excess of the amount otherwise previously approved under its capital plan. The so-called “de-minimis exception” threshold will be lowered from the current 1.0% to 0.25% of Tier 1 Capital, and will be available to these banking organizations, subject to compliance with certain conditions, including 15 days prior notification as to planned execution of the exception and no objection by the Federal Reserve Board within that timeframe. Citi announced an increase to its common stock repurchase program of up to $1.75 billion in November 2016, in accordance with the current de-minimis exception. For additional information regarding CCAR, see “Risk Factors—Strategic Risks” below.

Citigroup’s Capital Resources Under Current Regulatory Standards

During 2015 and thereafter, Citi is required to maintain stated minimum Common Equity Tier 1 Capital, Tier 1 Capital and Total Capital ratios of 4.5%, 6% and 8%, respectively. Citi’s effective minimum Common Equity Tier 1 Capital, Tier 1 Capital and Total Capital ratios during 2016, inclusive of the 25% phase-in of both the 2.5% Capital Conservation Buffer and the 3.5% GSIB surcharge (all of which is to be composed of Common Equity Tier 1 Capital), are 6%, 7.5%, and 9.5%, respectively. Citi’s effective and stated minimum Common Equity Tier 1 Capital, Tier 1 Capital and Total Capital ratios during 2015 were equivalent at 4.5%, 6%, and 8%, respectively.

Furthermore, to be “well capitalized” under current federal bank regulatory agency definitions, a bank holding

company must have a Tier 1 Capital ratio of at least 6%, a Total Capital ratio of at least 10%, and not be subject to a Federal Reserve Board directive to maintain higher capital levels.

The following tables set forth the capital tiers, total risk-weighted assets, risk-based capital ratios, quarterly adjusted average total assets, Total Leverage Exposure and leverage ratios under current regulatory standards (reflecting Basel III Transition Arrangements) for Citi as of December 31,


and December 31,


.

Citigroup Capital Components and Ratios Under Current Regulatory Standards (Basel III Transition Arrangements)

(1)

Under the Advanced Approaches framework eligible credit reserves that exceed expected credit losses are eligible for inclusion in Tier 2 Capital to the extent the excess reserves do not exceed 0.6% of credit risk-weighted assets, which differs from the Standardized Approach in which the allowance for credit losses is eligible for inclusion in Tier 2 Capital up to 1.25% of credit risk-weighted assets, with any excess allowance for credit losses being deducted in arriving at credit risk-weighted assets.

(2)

As of December 31,


and December 31,


, Citi’s reportable Common Equity Tier 1 Capital, Tier 1 Capital, and Total Capital ratios were the lower derived under the Basel III Advanced Approaches framework.

(3)

Tier 1 Leverage ratio denominator.

(4)

Supplementary Leverage ratio denominator.

As indicated in the table above, Citigroup’s capital ratios at December 31,


were in excess of the stated minimum requirements under the U.S. Basel III rules. In

addition, Citi was also “well capitalized” under current federal bank regulatory agency definitions as of December 31,


.


Components of Citigroup Capital Under Current Regulatory Standards

(Basel III Advanced Approaches with Transition Arrangements)


Citigroup Risk-Weighted Assets Under Current Regulatory Standards

(Basel III Advanced Approaches with Transition Arrangements)

(1)

Issuance costs of $184 million and $147 million related to preferred stock outstanding at December 31,


and December 31,


, respectively, are excluded from common stockholders’ equity and netted against preferred stock in accordance with Federal Reserve Board regulatory reporting requirements, which differ from those under U.S. GAAP.

(2)

In addition, includes the net amount of unamortized loss on HTM securities. This amount relates to securities that were previously transferred from AFS to HTM, and non-credit related factors such as changes in interest rates and liquidity spreads for HTM securities with other-than-temporary impairment.

(3)

The transition arrangements for significant regulatory capital adjustments and deductions impacting Common Equity Tier 1 Capital and/or Additional Tier 1 Capital are set forth above in the chart entitled “Basel III Transition Arrangements: Significant Regulatory Capital Adjustments and Deductions.”

(4)

Common Equity Tier 1 Capital is adjusted for accumulated net unrealized gains (losses) on cash flow hedges included in AOCI that relate to the hedging of items not recognized at fair value on the balance sheet.

(5)

The cumulative impact of changes in Citigroup’s own creditworthiness in valuing liabilities for which the fair value option has been elected and own-credit valuation adjustments on derivatives are excluded from Common Equity Tier 1 Capital, in accordance with the U.S. Basel III rules.

(6)

Includes goodwill “embedded” in the valuation of significant common stock investments in unconsolidated financial institutions.

(7)

Identifiable intangible assets other than MSRs increased by approximately $2.2 billion as a result of the acquisition of the Costco cards portfolio, as well as the renewal and extension of the co-branded credit card program agreement with American Airlines. For additional information, see Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

(8)

Of Citi’s approximately $46.7 billion of net DTAs at December 31, 2016, approximately $22.0 billion were includable in regulatory capital pursuant to the U.S. Basel III rules, while approximately $24.7 billion were excluded. Excluded from Citi’s regulatory capital as of December 31, 2016 was approximately $26.1 billion of net DTAs arising from net operating loss, foreign tax credit and general business credit carry-forwards as well as temporary differences, of which approximately $17.6 billion were deducted from Common Equity Tier 1 Capital and approximately $8.5 billion were deducted from Additional Tier 1 Capital, reduced by approximately $1.4 billion of net DTLs primarily associated with goodwill and certain other intangible assets. Separately, under the U.S. Basel III rules, goodwill and these other intangible assets are deducted net of associated DTLs in arriving at Common Equity Tier 1 Capital. DTAs arising from net operating loss, foreign tax credit and general business credit carry-forwards are required to be deducted from both Common Equity Tier 1 Capital and Additional Tier 1 Capital under the transition arrangements of the U.S. Basel III rules; whereas DTAs arising from temporary differences are deducted in full from Common Equity Tier 1 Capital under these rules, if in excess of 10%/15% limitations (see note below).

(9)

Assets subject to 10%/15% limitations include MSRs, DTAs arising from temporary differences and significant common stock investments in unconsolidated financial institutions. At December 31,


and December 31,


, this deduction related only to DTAs arising from temporary differences that exceeded the 10% limitation. Accordingly, approximately $4.8 billion of DTAs arising from temporary differences were excluded from Citi’s Common Equity Tier 1 Capital as of December 31, 2016. Changes to the U.S. corporate tax regime that impact the value of Citi’s DTAs arising from temporary differences, which exceed the then current amount deducted from Citi’s Common Equity Tier 1 Capital, would further reduce Citi’s regulatory capital to the extent of such excess after tax (for additional discussion on potential U.S. corporate tax reform, see “Risk Factors—Strategic Risks” below).

(10)

Represents Citigroup Capital XIII trust preferred securities, which are permanently grandfathered as Tier 1 Capital under the U.S. Basel III rules, as well as non-grandfathered trust preferred securities which are eligible for inclusion in Tier 1 Capital during 2015 in an amount up to 25% of the aggregate outstanding principal amounts of such issuances as of January 1, 2014. The remaining 75% of non-grandfathered trust preferred securities are eligible for inclusion in Tier 2 Capital during 2015 in accordance with the transition arrangements for non-qualifying capital instruments under the U.S. Basel III rules. As of December 31, 2015, however, the entire amount of non-grandfathered trust preferred securities was included within Tier 1 Capital, as the amounts outstanding did not exceed the respective threshold for exclusion from Tier 1 Capital. Effective January 1, 2016, non-grandfathered trust preferred securities are not eligible for inclusion in Tier 1 Capital, but are eligible for inclusion in Tier 2 Capital subject to full phase-out by January 1, 2022. During 2016, non-grandfathered trust preferred securities are eligible for inclusion in Tier 2 Capital in an amount up to 60% of the aggregate outstanding principal amounts of such issuances as of January 1, 2014.

(11)

Effective July 2015, banking entities were required to be in compliance with the Volcker Rule of the Dodd-Frank Act that prohibits conducting certain proprietary investment activities and limits their ownership of, and relationships with, covered funds. Accordingly, Citi is required by the Volcker Rule to deduct from Tier 1 Capital all permitted ownership interests in covered funds that were acquired after December 31, 2013.

(12)

50% of the minimum regulatory capital requirements of insurance underwriting subsidiaries must be deducted from each of Tier 1 Capital and Tier 2 Capital.

(13)

Under the transition arrangements of the U.S. Basel III rules, non-qualifying subordinated debt issuances which consist of those with a fixed-to-floating rate step-up feature where the call/step-up date has not passed are eligible for inclusion in Tier 2 Capital during 2015 up to 25% of the aggregate outstanding principal amounts of such issuances as of January 1, 2014. Effective January 1, 2016, non-qualifying subordinated debt issuances are not eligible for inclusion in Tier 2 Capital.

(14)

Advanced Approaches banking organizations are permitted to include in Tier 2 Capital eligible credit reserves that exceed expected credit losses to the extent that the excess reserves do not exceed 0.6% of credit risk-weighted assets.

(15)

Under the U.S. Basel III rules, credit risk-weighted assets during the transition period reflect the effects of transitional arrangements related to regulatory capital adjustments and deductions and, as a result, will differ from credit risk-weighted assets derived under full implementation of the rules.


Citigroup Capital Rollforward Under Current Regulatory Standards

(Basel III Advanced Approaches with Transition Arrangements)

(1)

During the twelve months ended December 31, 2016, Citi issued approximately $2.5 billion of qualifying perpetual preferred stock with issuance costs of $37 million. In accordance with Federal Reserve Board regulatory reporting requirements, which differ from those under U.S. GAAP, such issuance costs are excluded from common stockholders’ equity and netted against preferred stock.


Citigroup Risk-Weighted Assets Rollforward Under Current Regulatory Standards

(Basel III Advanced Approaches with Transition Arrangements)

(1)

Retail exposures decreased during the three and twelve months ended

December 31, 2016

primarily due to residential mortgage loan sales and repayments, divestitures of certain Citi Holdings portfolios and the impact of FX translation. The decrease in retail exposures during the three months ended

December 31, 2016

was partially offset by increases in qualifying revolving (cards) exposures attributable to seasonal holiday spending, whereas the decrease in retail exposures during the twelve months ended

December 31, 2016

was partially offset by the acquisition of the Costco cards portfolio.

(2)

Wholesale exposures decreased during the three and twelve months ended

December 31, 2016

primarily due to decreases in commercial loans, decreases in securities AFS and securities HTM, and the impact of FX translation. The decrease in wholesale exposures during the three months ended

December 31, 2016

was partially offset by increases in loan commitments.

(3)

Repo-style transactions decreased during the twelve months ended

December 31, 2016

primarily due to exposure decreases and model enhancements.

(4)

Securitization exposures decreased during the three and twelve months ended

December 31, 2016

primarily due to sales and maturities of exposures.

(5)

Equity exposures decreased during the twelve months ended

December 31, 2016

primarily due to the sale of Citi’s investment in China Guangfa Bank.

(6)

OTC derivatives decreased during the three months ended

December 31, 2016

primarily due to changes in fair value. OTC derivatives increased during the twelve months ended

December 31, 2016

primarily driven by increased trade volume and model enhancements.

(7)

Derivatives CVA decreased during the three months ended

December 31, 2016

primarily driven by exposure reduction and credit spread changes. Derivatives CVA increased during the twelve months ended

December 31, 2016

primarily driven by increased volatility, trade volume and model enhancements.

(8)

Other exposures include cleared transactions, unsettled transactions, assets other than those reportable in specific exposure categories and non-material portfolios.

(9)

Supervisory 6% multiplier does not apply to derivatives CVA.

(10)

Risk levels decreased during the three months ended

December 31, 2016

primarily due to reductions in risk and exposures subject to Stressed Value at Risk and a reduction in positions subject to standard specific risk charges, partially offset by an increase in exposures subject to comprehensive risk. Risk levels decreased during the twelve months ended

December 31, 2016

primarily due to reductions in risk and exposures subject to Stressed Value at Risk and a reduction in positions subject to securitization charges, partially offset by an increase in positions subject to standard specific risk charges.

(11)

Risk-weighted assets declined during the three and twelve months ended

December 31, 2016

due to changes in model inputs regarding volatility and the correlation between market risk factors.

(12)

Operational risk-weighted assets decreased during the three months ended

December 31, 2016

primarily driven by routine quarterly updates to model parameters. Operational risk-weighted assets increased during the twelve months ended

December 31, 2016

primarily due to the implementation of certain enhancements to Citi’s Advanced Measurement Approaches model in the third quarter of 2016, partially offset by routine quarterly updates to model parameters.


Capital Resources of Citigroup’s Subsidiary U.S. Depository Institutions Under Current Regulatory Standards

Citigroup’s subsidiary U.S. depository institutions are also subject to regulatory capital standards issued by their respective primary federal bank regulatory agencies, which are similar to the standards of the Federal Reserve Board.

During 2016, Citi’s primary subsidiary U.S. depository institution, Citibank, N.A. (Citibank), was subject to effective minimum Common Equity Tier 1 Capital, Tier 1 Capital and Total Capital ratios, inclusive of the 25% phase-in of the 2.5% Capital Conservation Buffer, of 5.125%, 6.625% and 8.625%, respectively. Citibank’s effective and

stated minimum Common Equity Tier 1 Capital, Tier 1 Capital and Total Capital ratios during 2015 were equivalent at 4.5%, 6%, and 8%, respectively.

The following table sets forth the capital tiers, total risk-weighted assets, risk-based capital ratios, quarterly adjusted average total assets, Total Leverage Exposure and leverage ratios under current regulatory standards (reflecting Basel III Transition Arrangements) for Citibank, Citi’s primary subsidiary U.S. depository institution, as of December 31,


and December 31,


.

(2)

As of December 31, 2016, Citibank’s reportable Common Equity Tier 1 Capital and Tier 1 Capital ratios were the lower derived under the Basel III Standardized Approach, whereas Citibank's reportable Total Capital ratio as of December 31, 2016 was the lower derived under the Basel III Advanced Approaches framework. As of December 31, 2015, Citibank’s reportable Common Equity Tier 1 Capital, Tier 1 Capital, and Total Capital ratios were the lower derived under the Basel III Standardized Approach.

As indicated in the table above, Citibank’s capital ratios at December 31,


were in excess of the stated minimum requirements under the U.S. Basel III rules. In addition, Citibank was also “well capitalized” as of December 31,


under the revised PCA regulations which became effective January 1, 2015.

Further, Citibank is required to conduct the annual Dodd-Frank Act Stress Test. The annual stress test consists of a forward-looking quantitative evaluation of the impact of stressful economic and financial market conditions under several scenarios on Citibank’s regulatory capital. This program serves to inform the Office of the Comptroller of

the Currency how Citibank’s regulatory capital ratios might change during a hypothetical set of adverse economic

conditions and to ultimately evaluate the reliability of Citibank’s capital planning process.


Impact of Changes on Citigroup and Citibank Capital Ratios Under Current Regulatory Capital Standards

The following tables present the estimated sensitivity of Citigroup’s and Citibank’s capital ratios to changes of $100 million in Common Equity Tier 1 Capital, Tier 1 Capital and Total Capital (numerator), and changes of $1 billion in Advanced Approaches and Standardized Approach risk-weighted assets, quarterly adjusted average total assets, as well as Total Leverage Exposure (denominator), under current regulatory capital standards (reflecting Basel III Transition Arrangements), as of December 31,


. This

information is provided for the purpose of analyzing the impact that a change in Citigroup’s or Citibank’s financial position or results of operations could have on these ratios. These sensitivities only consider a single change to either a component of capital, risk-weighted assets, quarterly adjusted average total assets, or Total Leverage Exposure. Accordingly, an event that affects more than one factor may have a larger basis point impact than is reflected in these tables.

Citigroup Broker-Dealer Subsidiaries

At December 31,


, Citigroup Global Markets Inc., a U.S. broker-dealer registered with the SEC that is an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Citigroup, had net capital, computed in accordance with the SEC’s net capital rule, of approximately $9.3 billion, which exceeded the minimum requirement by approximately $7.4 billion.

Moreover, Citigroup Global Markets Limited, a broker-dealer registered with the United Kingdom’s Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) that is also an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Citigroup, had total capital of $16.8 billion at December 31,


, which exceeded the PRA's minimum regulatory capital requirements.

In addition, certain of Citi’s other broker-dealer

subsidiaries are subject to regulation in the countries in which they do business, including requirements to maintain specified levels of net capital or its equivalent. Citigroup’s other broker-dealer subsidiaries were in compliance with their capital requirements at December 31,

Citigroup’s Capital Resources Under Basel III

(Full Implementation)

Citi currently estimates that its effective minimum Common Equity Tier 1 Capital, Tier 1 Capital and Total Capital ratio requirements under the U.S. Basel III rules, on a fully implemented basis, inclusive of the 2.5% Capital Conservation Buffer and the Countercyclical Capital Buffer at its current level of 0%, as well as assuming a 3% GSIB surcharge, may be 10%, 11.5% and 13.5%, respectively.

Further, under the U.S. Basel III rules, Citi must also comply with a 4% minimum Tier 1 Leverage ratio requirement and an effective 5% minimum Supplementary Leverage ratio requirement.

The following tables set forth the capital tiers, total risk-weighted assets, risk-based capital ratios, quarterly adjusted average total assets, Total Leverage Exposure and leverage ratios, assuming full implementation under the U.S. Basel III rules, for Citi as of December 31,

Supplementary Leverage ratio denominator.


Common Equity Tier 1 Capital Ratio

Citi’s Common Equity Tier 1 Capital ratio was 12.6% at December 31, 2016, compared to 12.6% at September 30, 2016 and 12.1% at December 31, 2015 (all based on application of the Advanced Approaches for determining total risk-weighted assets). The ratio remained unchanged quarter-over-quarter, as quarterly net income of $3.6 billion and a decline in total risk-weighted assets were offset by the return of approximately $4.7 billion of capital to common

shareholders and movements in AOCI. The increase in Citi’s Common Equity Tier 1 Capital ratio from year-end 2015 reflected continued growth in Common Equity Tier 1 Capital resulting from net income of $14.9 billion and the favorable effects attributable to DTA utilization of approximately $1.2 billion, offset in part by the return of approximately $10.7 billion of capital to common shareholders.

Components of Citigroup Capital Under Basel III (Advanced Approaches with Full Implementation)

(1)

Issuance costs of $184 million and $147 million related to preferred stock outstanding at December 31,


and December 31,


, respectively, are excluded from common stockholders’ equity and netted against preferred stock in accordance with Federal Reserve Board regulatory reporting requirements, which differ from those under U.S. GAAP.

(2)

Common Equity Tier 1 Capital is adjusted for accumulated net unrealized gains (losses) on cash flow hedges included in AOCI that relate to the hedging of items not recognized at fair value on the balance sheet.

(3)

The cumulative impact of changes in Citigroup’s own creditworthiness in valuing liabilities for which the fair value option has been elected and own-credit valuation adjustments on derivatives are excluded from Common Equity Tier 1 Capital, in accordance with the U.S. Basel III rules.


(4)

Includes goodwill “embedded” in the valuation of significant common stock investments in unconsolidated financial institutions.

(5)

Identifiable intangible assets other than MSRs increased by approximately $2.2 billion as a result of the acquisition of the Costco cards portfolio, as well as the renewal and extension of the co-branded credit card program agreement with American Airlines. For additional information, see Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

(6)

Of Citi’s approximately $46.7 billion of net DTAs at December 31, 2016, approximately $17.4 billion were includable in Common Equity Tier 1 Capital pursuant to the U.S. Basel III rules, while approximately $29.3 billion were excluded. Excluded from Citi’s Common Equity Tier 1 Capital as of December 31, 2016 was a total of approximately $30.7 billion of net DTAs arising from net operating loss, foreign tax credit and general business credit carry-forwards as well as temporary differences, reduced by approximately $1.4 billion of net DTLs primarily associated with goodwill and certain other intangible assets. Separately, under the U.S. Basel III rules, goodwill and these other intangible assets are deducted net of associated DTLs in arriving at Common Equity Tier 1 Capital. DTAs arising from net operating loss, foreign tax credit and general business credit carry-forwards are required to be fully deducted from Common Equity Tier 1 Capital under full implementation of the U.S. Basel III rules; whereas DTAs arising from temporary differences are deducted from Common Equity Tier 1 Capital if in excess of 10%/15% limitations (see note below).

(7)

Assets subject to 10%/15% limitations include MSRs, DTAs arising from temporary differences and significant common stock investments in unconsolidated financial institutions. At December 31,


, and December 31,


, this deduction related only to DTAs arising from temporary differences that exceeded the 10% limitation. Accordingly, approximately $9.4 billion of DTAs arising from temporary differences were excluded from Citi’s Common Equity Tier 1 Capital as of December 31, 2016. Changes to the U.S. corporate tax regime that impact the value of Citi’s DTAs arising from temporary differences, which exceed the then current amount deducted from Citi’s Common Equity Tier 1 Capital, would further reduce Citi’s regulatory capital to the extent of such excess after tax (for additional discussion on potential U.S. corporate tax reform, see “Risk Factors—Strategic Risks” below).

Citigroup Capital Rollforward Under Basel III (Advanced Approaches with Full Implementation)

(1)

During the twelve months ended December 31, 2016, Citi issued approximately $2.5 billion of qualifying perpetual preferred stock with issuance costs of $37 million. In accordance with Federal Reserve Board regulatory reporting requirements, which differ from those under U.S. GAAP, such issuance costs are excluded from common stockholders’ equity and netted against preferred stock.


Citigroup Risk-Weighted Assets Under Basel III (Full Implementation) at December 31,


Citigroup Risk-Weighted Assets Under Basel III (Full Implementation) at December 31,


Total risk-weighted assets under both the Basel III Advanced Approaches and the Standardized Approach declined from year-end


due to decreases in credit and market risk-weighted assets. The decline in total risk-weighted assets under the Basel III Advanced Approaches was partially offset by an increase in operational risk-weighted assets primarily due to the implementation of certain enhancements to Citi’s Advanced Measurement Approaches model during the third quarter of 2016.

The decline in credit risk-weighted assets was mainly attributable to residential mortgage loan sales and repayments and divestitures of certain Citi Holdings portfolios, partially offset by the acquisition of the Costco cards portfolio and increases in OTC derivative exposures due to increased volatility and trade volume. Model enhancements impacting OTC derivatives and derivatives CVA further offset the decline in credit risk-weighted assets under the Basel III Advanced Approaches.

The decline in market risk-weighted assets was primarily due to decreases in positions subject to Stressed Value at Risk and securitization charges.


Citigroup Risk-Weighted Assets Rollforward (Basel III Advanced Approaches with Full Implementation)

(1)

Retail exposures decreased during the three and twelve months ended

December 31, 2016

primarily due to residential mortgage loan sales and repayments, divestitures of certain Citi Holdings portfolios and the impact of FX translation. The decrease in retail exposures during the three months ended

December 31, 2016

was partially offset by increases in qualifying revolving (cards) exposures attributable to seasonal holiday spending, whereas the decrease in retail exposures during the twelve months ended

December 31, 2016

was partially offset by the acquisition of the Costco cards portfolio.

(2)

Wholesale exposures decreased during the three and twelve months ended

December 31, 2016

primarily due to decreases in commercial loans, decreases in securities AFS and securities HTM, and the impact of FX translation. The decrease in wholesale exposures during the three months ended

December 31, 2016

was partially offset by increases in loan commitments.

(3)

Repo-style transactions decreased during the twelve months ended

December 31, 2016

December 31, 2016

primarily due to sales and maturities of exposures.

(5)

Equity exposures decreased during the twelve months ended

December 31, 2016

primarily due to the sale of Citi’s investment in China Guangfa Bank.

(6)

OTC derivatives decreased during the three months ended

December 31, 2016

primarily due to changes in fair value. OTC derivatives increased during the twelve months ended

December 31, 2016

primarily driven by increased trade volume and model enhancements.

(7)

Derivatives CVA decreased during the three months ended

December 31, 2016

primarily driven by exposure reduction and credit spread changes. Derivatives CVA increased during the twelve months ended

December 31, 2016

primarily driven by increased volatility, trade volume and model enhancements.

(8)

Other exposures include cleared transactions, unsettled transactions, assets other than those reportable in specific exposure categories and non-material portfolios.

(9)

Supervisory 6% multiplier does not apply to derivatives CVA.

(10)

Risk levels decreased during the three months ended

December 31, 2016

primarily due to reductions in risk and exposures subject to Stressed Value at Risk and a reduction in positions subject to standard specific risk charges, partially offset by an increase in exposures subject to comprehensive risk. Risk levels decreased during the twelve months ended

December 31, 2016

primarily due to reductions in risk and exposures subject to Stressed Value at Risk and a reduction in positions subject to securitization charges, partially offset by an increase in positions subject to standard specific risk charges.

(11)

Risk-weighted assets declined during the three and twelve months ended

December 31, 2016

due to changes in model inputs regarding volatility and the correlation between market risk factors.

(12)

Operational risk-weighted assets decreased during the three months ended

December 31, 2016

primarily driven by routine quarterly updates to model parameters. Operational risk-weighted assets increased during the twelve months ended

December 31, 2016

primarily due to the implementation of certain enhancements to Citi’s Advanced Measurement Approaches model in the third quarter of 2016, partially offset by routine quarterly updates to model parameters.


Supplementary Leverage Ratio

Citigroup’s Supplementary Leverage ratio was 7.2% for the fourth quarter of 2016, compared to 7.4% for the third quarter of 2016 and 7.1% for the fourth quarter of 2015. The decline in the ratio quarter-over-quarter was principally driven by a decrease in Tier 1 Capital largely attributable to the return of approximately $4.7 billion of capital to common shareholders and movements in AOCI, offset in part by quarterly net income of $3.6 billion and a decrease in Total Leverage Exposure. The growth in the ratio from the fourth quarter of 2015 was largely attributable to additional

Tier 1 Capital resulting from annual net income of $14.9 billion and approximately $2.5 billion (net of issuance costs) of noncumulative perpetual preferred stock issuances, offset in part by the return of approximately $10.7 billion of capital to common shareholders and movements in AOCI.

The following table sets forth Citi’s Supplementary Leverage ratio and related components, assuming full implementation under the U.S. Basel III rules, for the three months ended December 31,


and December 31,


.

Citigroup Basel III Supplementary Leverage Ratio and Related Components (Full Implementation)

(1)

Represents the daily average of on-balance sheet assets for the quarter.

(2)

Represents the average of certain off-balance sheet exposures calculated as of the last day of each month in the quarter.

(3)

Under the U.S. Basel III rules, banking organizations are required to include in TLE the effective notional amount of sold credit derivatives, with netting of exposures permitted if certain conditions are met.

(4)

Repo-style transactions include repurchase or reverse repurchase transactions and securities borrowing or securities lending transactions.

Citibank’s Supplementary Leverage ratio, assuming full implementation under the U.S. Basel III rules, was 6.6% for the fourth quarter of 2016, compared to 6.8% for the third quarter of 2016 and 6.7% for the fourth quarter of 2015. The ratio decreased quarter-over-quarter, as the benefits associated with quarterly net income of $3.4 billion and a net decrease in Total Leverage Exposure were more than offset by movements in AOCI, as well as cash dividends paid by Citibank to its parent, Citicorp, and which were subsequently remitted to Citigroup. The ratio declined slightly from the fourth quarter of 2015, as the positive effect attributable to net income of $12.8 billion was more than offset by an overall increase in Total Leverage Exposure, as well as cash dividends paid by Citibank to its parent, Citicorp, and which were subsequently remitted to Citigroup.


Regulatory Capital Standards Developments

The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (Basel Committee) set forth a robust 2016 rulemaking agenda, comprised not only of rules designed to provide further clarification, modification or enhancement to the Basel III capital framework, but also, and more importantly, rules which would substantially revise the methodologies, including the imposition of certain constraints on the use of models, to be employed in the derivation of credit, market and operational risk-weighted assets.

Reducing Variation in Credit Risk-Weighted Assets

The Basel Committee has issued a series of consultative documents related to the derivation of credit risk-weighted assets, all of which are generally aimed at reducing complexity and promoting comparability between banking organizations. Two of the most significant proposals include a December 2015 consultative document that would revise the Standardized Approach, and another consultative document issued in March 2016 that would place constraints on the use of internal ratings-based (IRB) approaches.

The Basel Committee’s December 2015 consultative document would, in part, revise the Standardized Approach in measuring credit risk-weighted assets with respect to certain on-balance sheet assets, such as in relation to the risk-weighted methodologies employed with respect to bank, corporate, and real estate (both residential and commercial) exposures; the treatment of off-balance sheet commitments; and aspects of the credit risk mitigation framework. Moreover, the proposal would permit the use of external credit ratings combined with due diligence requirements in the calculation of credit risk-weighted assets for exposures to banks and corporates, while also providing alternative approaches for jurisdictions that do not allow the use of external credit ratings for risk-based capital purposes, such as the U.S.

The Basel Committee’s March 2016 consultative document proposes revisions to the IRB approaches, in part, by prohibiting the use of such approaches for certain so-called “low default” exposures, including those to banks and other financial institutions, as well as large corporations. Moreover, the proposal also prohibits the use of the IRB approaches for equity exposures in the banking book. Additionally, for other exposures where the IRB approaches would still be permissible, the proposal establishes floors by exposure type regarding the estimation of certain model parameters used in the derivation of credit risk-weighted assets, and also provides greater specification as to permissible parameter estimation practices under the IRB approaches. Finally, the proposal indicates that the Basel Committee is considering whether to impose an aggregate capital floor which would be calibrated in the range of 60 - 90% of total risk-weighted assets as calculated under the Basel Committee’s Standardized Approach.

Revised Minimum Capital Requirements for Market Risk

In January 2016, the Basel Committee issued a final rule which sets forth a revised market risk capital framework, resulting from the so-called “fundamental review of the trading book” and four quantitative impact studies over several years.

The final rule establishes a revised boundary between the trading book and banking book which, in part, provides more prescriptive guidance as to qualifying trading book positions as well as imposes heightened restrictions and, in certain instances, additional capital charges, on the transfer of positions between the trading book and banking book. Moreover, the final rule also revises both the internal models approach and the standardized approach in certain respects.

If the U.S. banking agencies were to adopt the Basel Committee’s final rule unchanged, Citi believes its market risk-weighted assets could increase significantly. However, as set forth in the tables above, Citi’s market risk-weighted assets constituted approximately 5% of its total risk-weighted assets. Accordingly, Citi currently believes that the overall impact to its total risk-weighted assets, and thus its risk-based capital ratios, would not be material.

Standardized Measurement Approach for Operational Risk

In March 2016, the Basel Committee issued a consultative document which proposes revisions to the operational risk capital framework applicable to the Advanced Approaches for calculating risk-weighted assets. The consultative document introduces the Standardized Measurement Approach (SMA).

Operational risk capital is derived under the SMA through the combination of two components, a so-called “Business Indicator Component” and a “Loss Component”. The Business Indicator component, primarily reflective of various income statement elements (i.e., a modified gross income indicator), is calculated as the sum of the three year average of its components. The Loss Component reflects the operational loss exposure of a banking organization that can be inferred from internal loss experience, and is based on a 10 year average.

If the U.S. banking agencies were to adopt the Basel Committee’s proposal unchanged, Citi’s operational risk-weighted assets could increase significantly.

Revisions to the Basel III Leverage Ratio Framework

In April 2016, the Basel Committee issued a consultative document which proposes certain revisions as to the design and calibration of the Basel III leverage ratio (similar to the U.S. Basel III Supplementary Leverage ratio). Among the proposed revisions are those with respect to the exposure measure (i.e., the denominator of the ratio) in relation to the treatment of derivative exposures, provisions, and off-balance sheet exposures.


Revisions to the Definition of Regulatory Capital

In October 2016, the Basel Committee issued a consultative document and a discussion paper related to the regulatory treatment of accounting provisions under the Basel III regulatory capital framework. Both the International Accounting Standards Board and more recently the U.S. Financial Accounting Standards Board issued new accounting pronouncements related to impairment of financial assets that require the use of expected credit loss models rather than incurred loss models. Measuring impairment using expected credit loss models may result in higher accounting provisions and consequently increased volatility in regulatory capital.

Separately, in October 2016, the Basel Committee issued a final rule which amends the Basel III definition of regulatory capital to include a Tier 2 Capital deduction for investments by an internationally active bank (both GSIBs and non-GSIBs) in Total Loss-Absorbing Capacity (TLAC) and certain other debt instruments issued by GSIBs that do not otherwise qualify as regulatory capital (i.e., TLAC holdings). Under the final rule, a Tier 2 Capital deduction is required under certain circumstances for investments in TLAC holdings which exceed certain thresholds, based on Common Equity Tier 1 Capital, as adjusted. Moreover, the final rule clarifies that any Common Equity Tier 1 Capital that is being used to meet the TLAC requirement cannot also be used to meet the regulatory capital buffers, including the GSIB surcharge.

In December 2016, the Federal Reserve Board released a final rule which, among other matters, imposes a minimum TLAC requirement on U.S. GSIBs. The U.S. Basel III treatment of TLAC holdings, however, was deferred. In this regard, the Federal Reserve Board indicated that it intends to address the regulatory capital treatment for investments in, or exposure to, unsecured debt instruments issued by U.S. GSIBs jointly with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation at a later time, so as to ensure that  these requirements are consistently applied to all banking organizations subject to the regulatory capital requirements of the U.S. banking agencies. For additional information regarding the Federal Reserve Board’s final rule, see “Risk Factors—Strategic Risks” and “Managing Global Risk—Liquidity Risk—Long-Term Debt—Total Loss-Absorbing Capacity (TLAC)” below.

Interest Rate Risk in the Banking Book

In April 2016, the Basel Committee issued a final rule which sets forth revised principles regarding the supervisory review process over a bank’s management of interest rate risk in the banking book (IRRBB), as well as the methods expected to be used by banks for the measurement, monitoring and control of IRRBB. Moreover, the final rule establishes qualitative and quantitative public disclosure requirements for IRRBB. The final rule is applicable to large, internationally active banking organizations, and is expected to be implemented by 2018.

2017 Implications and Beyond

Despite the proliferation of proposed new rules by the Basel Committee during 2016, substantial uncertainty remains with respect to the eventual nature, extent and timing of future changes to the Basel III capital framework, both internationally as well as from a U.S. rulemaking perspective.

In January 2017, the Group of Central Bank Governors and Heads of Supervision (GHOS), the oversight body of the Basel Committee, postponed a meeting which was originally scheduled to review the Basel Committee’s package of proposals. Concurrently, the Basel Committee publicly announced that it needed more time to calibrate and finalize its revised Basel III capital framework, and that it “expected to complete this work in the near future.” Accordingly, these developments have introduced additional uncertainty, including whether international harmonization regarding a revised Basel III capital framework will ultimately be realized.

Further, the potential exists for other changes with respect to rulemaking activities in the U.S., given the new presidential administration and Congress.


Tangible Common Equity, Tangible Book Value Per Share, Book Value Per Share and Returns on Equity

Tangible common equity (TCE), as defined by Citi, represents common equity less goodwill and other intangible assets (other than MSRs). Other companies may calculate TCE in a different manner. TCE, tangible book value per share and returns on average TCE are non-GAAP financial measures. Citi believes these capital metrics provide useful information, as they are used by investors and industry analysts.

(1)

Identifiable intangible assets (other than MSRs) increased by approximately $2.2 billion as a result of the acquisition of the Costco cards portfolio, as well as the renewal and extension of the co-branded credit card program agreement with American Airlines. For additional information, see Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

(2)

Represents average net DTAs excluded in arriving at Common Equity Tier 1 Capital under full implementation of the U.S. Basel III rules. The average is based upon quarter-end amounts over the most recent five quarters through December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
