Item 1. Business

OVERVIEW

Citigroup’s history dates back to the founding of Citibank in 1812. Citigroup’s original corporate
predecessor was incorporated in 1988 under the laws of the State of Delaware.
Following a series of transactions over a number of years, Citigroup Inc. was
formed in 1998 upon the merger of Citicorp and Travelers Group
Inc.

Citigroup is now a global diversified financial services holding company
whose businesses provide consumers, corporations, governments and institutions
with a broad range of financial products and services. Citi has approximately
200 million customer accounts and does business in more than 140
countries.

Citigroup currently operates, for management
reporting purposes, via two primary business segments: Citicorp, consisting of
our

Regional Consumer Banking

businesses and

Institutional Clients Group

; and Citi Holdings, consisting of our

Brokerage and Asset Management

and

Local Consumer Lending

businesses, and a

Special Asset Pool

. There is also a third segment,

Corporate/Other

.

For a further description of
the business segments and the products and services they provide, see “Citigroup
Segments” below, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
and Results of Operations” and Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements.

Throughout this report, “Citigroup” and “Citi”
refer to Citigroup Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries.


As described above,
Citigroup is managed pursuant to the following segments:

OVERVIEW (Continued)

On December 23, 2009,
Citigroup repaid $20 billion of trust preferred securities held by the U.S.
Treasury under the U.S. government’s Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP)
and exited from the loss-sharing agreement, which covered a specified
pool of assets, with the U.S. Treasury, FDIC and the Federal Reserve Bank of New
York. In connection with the exiting from the loss-sharing agreement,
$1.8 billion of the approximately $7.1 billion of additional trust preferred
securities held by the U.S. Treasury and FDIC was cancelled. As a result of the
repayment of TARP and the exit from the loss-sharing agreement,
effective in 2010, Citi is no longer deemed to be a beneficiary of “exceptional
financial assistance” under TARP.

Following these
transactions, as of December 31, 2009 (i) the U.S. Treasury continued to hold
approximately 7.7 billion shares, or approximately 27%, of Citi’s common stock,
(ii) the U.S. Treasury and FDIC continue to hold an aggregate of approximately
$5.3 billion of Citi’s trust preferred securities, and (iii) the U.S. Treasury
continues to hold three warrants exercisable for an aggregate of approximately
465.1 million shares of Citi’s common stock. See “Management’s Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Executive
Summary—Repayment of TARP and Exit from Loss-Sharing Agreement; Common and
Preferred Stock Activities” for additional information.

At December 31, 2009,
Citi had approximately 265,300 full-time employees and 3,700 part-time
employees. At December 31, 2008, Citi had approximately 322,800 full-time and
4,100 part-time employees.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Introduction

Citigroup is a global
diversified financial services holding company whose businesses provide
consumers, corporations, governments and institutions with a broad range of
financial products and services, including consumer banking, credit cards,
corporate and investment banking, securities brokerage and wealth management.
Citigroup has approximately 200 million customer accounts and does business in
more than 140 countries.

In response to the
dramatic and profound changes in the market environment that became increasingly
apparent through 2008, in early 2009, Citigroup decided to increase the focus on
its core businesses and reorganized into three business segments for management
and reporting purposes: Citicorp (

Regional Consumer Banking

and

Institutional Clients Group

); Citi Holdings (

Brokerage

and

Asset Management, Local Consumer Lending,

and

Special Asset Pool

); and Corporate/Other (Treasury, corporate
expenses). Citi believes the realignment allows it to enhance the capabilities
and performance of Citigroup’s core assets, through Citicorp, as well as to
tighten its focus on risk management and reduce and realize value from its
non-core assets, through Citi Holdings.

Citigroup reported a
net loss for 2009 of $1.6 billion, as compared to a $27.7 billion loss in 2008.
Diluted EPS was a loss of $0.80 per share in 2009, versus a loss of $5.63 per
share in 2008, and net revenue was $80.3 billion in 2009, versus $51.6 billion
in 2008. Net interest revenue declined by $4.8 billion to $48.9 billion in 2009,
generally as a result of lower average interest-earning assets, as the company
continued its focus on de-risking its balance sheet and decreasing its total
assets. Non-interest revenues improved by approximately $33.5 billion to $31.4
billion in 2009, primarily due to lower negative revenue marks in 2009. The
decrease in net loss from year to year was primarily attributable to lower
revenue marks in 2009 compared with 2008 (a pretax loss of $3.4 billion in 2009
versus a pretax loss of $38.5 billion in 2008), the $11.1 billion pretax Smith
Barney gain on sale recorded in the second quarter of 2009 and a $1.4 billion
pretax gain related to the exchange offers recognized in the third quarter of
2009. Partially offsetting these items were increasing credit loss provisions
during the year and a $10.1 billion pretax loss associated with the repayment of
TARP and the exit from the loss-sharing agreement with the U.S. government.
Additionally, 2008 included a $9.6 billion pretax goodwill impairment, a $0.9
billion pretax impairment related to Nikko Asset Management, and $3.3 billion
pretax of restructuring/repositioning charges. Continued strength of the core
Citi franchise was demonstrated by

strong revenues in

Securities and Banking

(S&B)

(up 23% from 2008 levels, excluding credit
value adjustments (CVA)) and continued stability in both the retail and
institutional deposit bases. At December 31, 2009, total deposits were $836
billion, up 8% from December 31, 2008.

Despite very
difficult market and economic conditions, Citicorp remained profitable with
$14.8 billion in income from continuing operations in 2009 versus $6.2 billion
in 2008, reflecting the strength of the underlying franchise, continued client
focus, cost management and strengthened risk management. Citi Holdings recorded
a loss of $8.2 billion in 2009 versus a $36.0 billion loss in 2008 as
substantial reductions in negative revenue marks, cost cuts and the Smith Barney
gain more than offset continued increases in credit costs within

Local Consumer Lending

. The gain related to the exchange offers and loss associated with TARP
repayment and exiting the loss-sharing agreement was recorded in

Corporate/Other

.

Citigroup’s 2009
financial results include the impact of 18 divestitures completed in 2009,
including Smith Barney, Nikko Cordial Securities and Nikko Asset Management, and
19 divestitures completed in 2008, including Citi’s German retail banking
operations, CitiCapital and Redecard. These divestitures were completed in
accordance with Citi’s strategy of exiting non-core businesses, while optimizing
value for shareholders.

Citi’s effective tax
rate on continuing operations in 2009 was 86%, versus 39% in 2008. The tax
provision reflected a benefit arising from a higher proportion of income earned
and indefinitely reinvested in countries with relatively lower tax rates, which
accounted for 26 percentage points of the differential between the
federal statutory tax rate and Citi’s effective tax rate in 2009, as well as a
higher proportion of income from tax-advantaged sources.

Repayment of TARP and Exit
from Loss-Sharing Agreement; Common and Preferred Stock Activities

Background

In October and December
2008, Citigroup raised $25 billion and $20 billion, respectively, through the
sale of preferred stock and warrants to purchase common stock to the U.S.
Treasury as part of TARP. In January 2009, Citi issued approximately $7.1
billion of preferred stock to the U.S. Treasury and FDIC, as well as a warrant
to purchase common stock to the U.S. Treasury, as consideration for the
loss-sharing agreement with the U.S. Treasury, FDIC and the Federal Reserve Bank
of New York covering a specified pool of Citigroup assets.

Pursuant to
Citigroup’s exchange offers consummated in July 2009, the $25 billion of TARP
preferred stock issued to the U.S. Treasury in October 2008 was exchanged for
approximately 7.7 billion shares of Citigroup common stock. At the same time,
the $20 billion of TARP preferred stock issued to the U.S. Treasury in December
2008 and the approximately $7.1 billion of


preferred stock issued
to the U.S. Treasury and FDIC as consideration for the loss-sharing agreement
were exchanged for trust preferred securities. Prior to the exchange of the
preferred stock held by the U.S. government pursuant to the exchange offers,
Citigroup paid the U.S. government approximately $2.2 billion in preferred
dividends on its investment in Citi, and has subsequently paid approximately
$800 million in interest on the trust preferred securities issued pursuant
to the exchange offers.

Repayment of TARP and Exit
from loss-sharing agreement

On December 23, 2009,
Citigroup repaid the $20 billion of TARP trust preferred securities held by the
U.S. Treasury and exited the loss-sharing agreement. In connection with the exit
of the loss-sharing agreement, $1.8 billion of the trust preferred securities
held by the U.S. Treasury out of the approximately $7.1 billion of trust
preferred securities issued in consideration for such agreement to the U.S.
Treasury and FDIC was cancelled.

In

connection
with the repayment of TARP in December 2009, Citigroup raised an aggregate of
approximately $20.3 billion in common equity.  On December 22, 2009
Citigroup issued $17.0 billion of common stock, or approximately 5.4 billion
shares, and $3.5 billion of tangible equity units (T-DECs) of which
approximately $2.8 billion was recorded as common equity and $0.7 billion was
recorded as long-term debt. On December 29, 2009, Citigroup raised an additional
approximate $0.6 billion of common stock, or approximately 185 million shares,
pursuant to exercise of the underwriters’ overallotment option. In addition, in
January 2010, Citigroup issued $1.7 billion of common stock equivalents to its
employees in lieu of cash compensation they would have otherwise received.
Subject to shareholder approval at Citi’s annual shareholder meeting scheduled
to be held on April 20, 2010, the common stock equivalents will be converted
into common stock.

Following the
repayment of TARP and exit from the loss-sharing agreement, as of
December 31, 2009, the U.S. Treasury continues to hold approximately 7.7 billion
shares, or approximately 27.0%, of Citi’s common stock, not including the
exercise of the warrants issued to the U.S. Treasury that remain outstanding, as
described below. The U.S. Treasury has indicated that it intends to sell its
holding in Citi common stock in 2010, subject to a 90-day lock-up period
expiring on March 16, 2010. In addition, the U.S. Treasury and FDIC continue to
hold an aggregate of approximately $5.3 billion of the trust preferred
securities originally issued by Citi as consideration for the loss-sharing
agreement.

As a result of Citi’s
repayment of the $20 billion of TARP trust preferred securities and the exit of
the loss-sharing agreement, effective in 2010, Citi is no longer deemed to be a
beneficiary of “exceptional financial assistance” under TARP.

Common stock warrants issued to the U.S.
Treasury

The three warrants
issued to the U.S. Treasury as part of TARP and the loss-sharing agreement
remain outstanding as of December 31, 2009 following Citi’s repayment of TARP
and exit from the loss-sharing agreement.

Each of the warrants
has a term of 10 years from the date of issuance. The warrant issued to the U.S.
Treasury in October 2008 has an exercise price of $17.85 per share and is
exercisable for approximately 210.1 million shares of common stock. The warrant
issued to the U.S. Treasury in December 2008 has an exercise price of $10.61 per
share and is exercisable for approximately 188.5 million shares of common stock.
The warrant issued to the U.S. Treasury as part of the loss-sharing agreement in
January 2009 also has an exercise price of $10.61 and is exercisable for
approximately 66.5 million shares of common stock.


The following table
summarizes Citigroup’s issuances, exchanges and repayments of preferred and
common stock and trust preferred securities during 2008 and 2009:

(1)

In addition to the U.S. government exchanges, pursuant to the
      exchange offers, private holders of approximately $12.5 billion aggregate
      liquidation value of Citi preferred stock exchanged such preferred stock
      for approximately 3.8 billion shares of Citi common stock. In addition,
      public holders of approximately $20.3 billion aggregate liquidation value
      of Citi preferred stock and trust preferred securities exchanged such
      securities for approximately 5.8 billion shares of Citi common
      stock.


Business Environment

The business environment
for financial services firms continued to be challenging in 2009, particularly
for firms with significant exposure to consumer credit. U.S. unemployment
reached 10.1%, GDP continued to contract through the second quarter, housing
markets remained weak, and personal and business bankruptcies increased. These
factors drove substantial increases in credit costs across consumer and
corporate portfolios. Credit spreads continued to widen earlier in the year,
driving further declines in the value of credit-sensitive financial instruments.
Equity markets were also very weak during early 2009. At its low point in March
2009, the S&P 500 had declined 55% from December 31, 2007 levels.

While these trends
were negative for the economy and the financial services industry as a whole,
they were accompanied by very high levels of volatility and wide spreads within
fixed income markets during the first quarter of 2009, which provided
substantial trading opportunities. As a result, fixed income capital markets
businesses achieved high levels of revenue and profitability during the first
quarter, offsetting some of the substantial credit losses incurred in
consumer-oriented businesses, including mortgages and cards.

Beginning in late
2008, significant U.S. government actions were implemented to help stabilize the
U.S. economy and restore confidence in the capital markets. The U.S. government
had available over $700 billion to invest in financial institutions, including
$45 billion in Citi, through TARP. In early 2009, a $787 billion stimulus bill
was signed into law. A number of additional programs helped further stimulate
demand in 2009, including the U.S. government’s first-time home buyer credit
programs. The U.S. government also directly supported the capital markets
through various programs, including the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan
Facility (TALF) and the Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program (TLGP), and
through substantial direct purchases of mortgage-backed securities. These
actions, combined with continued accommodative monetary policy on the part of
the Federal Reserve Board, helped keep home mortgage rates near historic lows
and worked to facilitate the continued flow of credit to consumers.

Late in 2009, some
early positive economic signs were observed. U.S. GDP growth was positive in the
third and fourth quarters. The S&P 500 finished the year up 23% from
December 31, 2008, and up 67% from the trough level in March 2009, though still
down 24% from December 31, 2007. Credit spreads, while still elevated, tightened
significantly from peak levels in the early part of 2009. In the second half of
the year, Citi began to observe some very early signs of stabilization and, in
some areas, moderation in U.S. consumer credit trends as net credit losses
declined sequentially during the third and fourth quarters, though remaining
quite elevated. In addition,

improving economic and
market trends led to relatively stronger advisory and equity underwriting
volumes in the fourth quarter. On the other hand, lower levels of market
volatility and volumes resulted in diminished trading opportunities, which led
to significant sequential declines in

S&B

revenues in the second half of the
year. In certain key markets in

Asia

and

Latin America

, improvement in the labor markets and overall
economic recovery was earlier, and somewhat stronger, than that observed in the
U.S. Citi observed improving credit trends in key markets including South Korea,
Mexico, Australia, Singapore and India, driven by improving economic conditions
as well as Citi’s loss mitigation efforts. Further, while

EMEA

continued to
be affected by a challenging economic environment, labor markets began to show
some improvement, particularly in Russia and Turkey, and there were some early
signs of financial stability returning to some of Citi’s key markets in the
region.

While some economic
and market improvements were observed in late 2009, Citi remains cautious,
particularly with respect to its North American businesses, as U.S. unemployment
remains high at 10.0% as of December 31, 2009, and housing markets remain
relatively weak. In addition, there remains significant uncertainty regarding
the pace of economic recovery and the impact of the U.S. government’s unwinding
of its extensive economic and market supports, which may accelerate in 2010. See
“2010 Business Outlook” below.

Citigroup's Actions in Response to Market
Challenges

During 2009, Citigroup
sought to respond to market challenges and the profound changes in the market
environment—changes in funding markets, operating models and client
needs—including:

Citi restructured into two primary operating segments—Citicorp and Citi
Holdings.

As described above,
Citicorp comprises Citi’s core franchise, while Citi Holdings consists of
non-core businesses and assets that Citi intends to exit as quickly
as practicable while seeking to optimize value
for shareholders.

Citigroup continued to reduce operating expenses and
headcount.

Citi’s ongoing operating
expenses in the fourth quarter of 2009 totaled $12.3 billion, down from $15.1
billion (excluding the goodwill impairment charge) in the fourth quarter of 2008
and $15.7 billion in the fourth quarter of 2007. The decline in expenses was
primarily driven by divestitures and re-engineering efforts. In addition, Citi
reduced headcount by over 100,000 to approximately 265,000 at December 31, 2009,
compared to 375,000 at peak levels in 2007.


Citigroup strengthened its balance sheet.

Citi increased its common capital
  ratios.

Citi
  significantly increased its Tier 1 Common and Tangible Common

Equity (TCE) ratios during 2009, primarily
  as a result of its exchange

offers completed in the third quarter of 2009. At December 31, 2009,
  Citi’s

Tier 1 Common ratio was
  9.6% and its TCE ratio was 10.9%, compared

to 2.3% and 3.1% at December 31, 2008,
  respectively. In addition,

Citi’s Tier 1 Capital ratio was 11.7% at December 31, 2009. Tier

1 Common and related ratios are
  measures used and relied on by U.S.

banking regulators; however, Tier 1 Common, TCE and related ratios
  are

non-GAAP financial measures
  for SEC purposes. See “Capital Resources

and Liquidity—Capital Resources” for
  additional information on

these
  measures.

Citi improved its liquidity
  position.

Citigroup
  lengthened the maturity structure of its liabilities, increased

balances of cash and highly liquid
  securities, continued to grow its

deposit base, raised substantial equity capital and reduced illiquid
  assets,

primarily in Citi
  Holdings. As a result, structural liquidity (defined as

deposits, long-term debt and equity as a
  percentage of total assets) grew

to 73% as of December 31, 2009, compared to 66% at December 31,

and 63% at December 31,
  2007. Citigroup had $193 billion of cash and

deposits with banks as of December 31, 2009.
  Citi currently anticipates

issuing less than $15 billion of Citigroup-level long-term debt in 2010
  (down from

$85 billion in 2009)
  due to its current strong liquidity position and

anticipated asset reductions within Citi
  Holdings.

Citi continued to de-risk and decrease the
  amount of its total assets.

Citi’s total assets were approximately $1.86 trillion as of December
  31,

2009, down from
  approximately $1.94 trillion at December 31, 2008 and

$2.19 trillion at December 31, 2007.
  Consistent with Citi’s strategy, Citi

Holdings now represents less than 30% of Citi’s total assets as of
  December

31, 2009, compared to
  41% at the start of 2008. While Citi made progress

in de-risking and decreasing total assets,
  particularly in Citi Holdings,

these actions, together with an expansion of the Company’s loss
  mitigation

efforts and
  declining yields in the trading book, resulted in a 9% reduction

in net interest revenue in 2009 versus 2008
  and a decrease in

Citi’s net
  interest margin (NIM) to 2.65% at December 31, 2009

compared to 3.26% at December 31,
  2008.

Citigroup increased its allowance for loan losses.

During 2009, Citi added
a net build of $8.0 billion to its allowance for loan losses. The allowance for
loan losses was $36 billion at December 31, 2009, or 6.1% of loans, compared to
$29.6 billion, or 4.3% of loans, at year-end 2008. With the adoption of SFAS 166
and 167 in the first quarter of 2010, loan loss reserves would have been $49.4
billion, or 6.6% of loans, each as of December 31, 2009 and based on current
estimates. The consumer loan loss reserve was $28.4 billion at December 31,
2009, representing 14.1 months of concurrent charge-off coverage, versus 13.1
months at December 31, 2008.

Citi began to make selected investments in its core businesses.

Within

Regional Consumer Banking

, Citi began making selected investments in its core businesses in the
latter part of 2009. For example, in

Asia

, Citi invested
in new customer acquisition in the emerging affluent segment and in card usage
promotion. In

Latin America

, Citi invested in card account acquisition,
with a focus on higher-quality new accounts, consistent with portfolio
repositioning objectives. Citigroup also continued to invest in consumer banking
technology, for example, in banking products in markets such as Singapore, Hong
Kong and South Korea, where mobile phones and mobile banking have intersected in
ways not yet seen in the U.S. Within

Transaction Services

, Citi continued to invest in technology to support its global network,
including its investor services suite of products, prepaid and commercial cards
offerings and launch of a new front end online banking technology that provides
a diverse set of functionality beyond traditional transaction management and
reporting.

These and similar
investments have increased, and will likely continue to increase, Citi’s
operating expenses.

2010 BUSINESS OUTLOOK

While showing signs of
improvement, the macroeconomic environment going into 2010 remains challenging,
with U.S. unemployment still elevated. The U.S. government has indicated its
intention to continue scaling back programs put in place to support the market
during 2008 and 2009. The impact of the U.S. government’s exit from many of
these programs is a source of uncertainty in 2010, as is the future course of
monetary policy. In addition, the potential impact of new laws and regulations
(e.g., The Credit Card Accountability Responsibility and Disclosure Act of 2009
(CARD Act)), potential new capital standards, and other legislative and
regulatory initiatives is a source of significant additional uncertainty
regarding the business and market environment.


Citigroup is
maintaining a cautious stance in light of this uncertain market environment and
continued macroeconomic headwinds. As it enters 2010, Citi is focused on
maintaining high levels of capital and liquidity, rigorous risk management
practices and cost discipline. In Citi Holdings, Citi will continue to focus on
reducing assets, which could result in lower revenues and operating expenses in
2010. In Citicorp, the focus will remain on serving the company’s core
institutional, corporate and retail client base in the U.S. and around the
world. Citi will continue to focus on credit loss mitigation and expense
control, and may continue to invest in areas such as

Asia

and

Latin America

, where economic recovery and growth appear to
be taking hold. Operating expenses may grow modestly in Citicorp in 2010, as a
portion of the cost reductions achieved in Citi Holdings is re-invested in the
core franchise.

Credit costs will
likely remain a significant driver of Citigroup’s results in 2010, particularly
in

North America

, where credit trends will largely depend on
the broader macroeconomic environment, as well as the impact

of industry factors such
as CARD Act implementation and the outcome of the Home Affordable Modification
Program (HAMP) and other loss mitigation efforts. See “Results of
Operations—Citicorp—

North America Regional
Consumer Banking

,

” “—Citi
Holdings—

Local Consumer Lending

”
and

“Managing Global
Risk—Credit Risk” for additional information. Citi expects U.S. consumer net
credit losses to increase modestly in the first quarter of 2010 from fourth
quarter 2009 levels, due in part to expected seasonal patterns, after which
there may be some slight improvement. However, net credit losses in the second
half of 2010 will be dependent on the macroeconomic environment and success of
the company’s ongoing loss mitigation efforts. Changes to Citigroup’s consumer
loan loss reserve balances will continue to reflect the losses embedded in
Citi’s consumer loan portfolio due to underlying credit trends as well as the
impact of Citi’s forbearance programs. Citi currently expects NIM to remain
under pressure due to its enhanced liquidity position and ongoing de-risking of
the balance sheet.

2009 vs. 2008

Revenues, net of interest
expense

declined 7%,
primarily reflecting higher credit losses in the securitization trusts, which
were offset by higher credit-card-securitization revenue, higher net interest
margin in cards and higher volumes in retail banking.

Net interest
revenue

was up 24%, driven
by the impact of pricing actions and lower funding costs in Citi-branded cards,
and by higher deposit volumes in retail banking, with average deposits up 11%
from the prior year.

Non-interest
revenue

declined 34%,
driven by higher credit losses flowing through the securitization trusts
partially offset by securitization revenue, and by the absence of a $349 million
gain on the sale of Visa shares and a $170 million gain from a cards portfolio
sale in the prior year.

Operating
expenses

declined 36% from
the prior year. Excluding a 2008 goodwill impairment charge of $2.3 billion,
expenses were down 12% reflecting the benefits from re-engineering efforts,
lower marketing costs, and the absence of $217 million in repositioning charges
in the prior year offset by the absence of a prior-year $159 million Visa
litigation reserve release.

Provisions for loan
losses and for benefits and claims

increased $562 million, or 52%, primarily due
to rising net credit losses in both cards and retail banking. Continued
weakening of leading credit indicators and trends in the macroeconomic
environment, including rising unemployment and higher bankruptcy filings,
primarily drove higher credit costs. The cards managed net credit loss ratio
increased 386 basis points to 9.58%, while the retail banking net credit loss
ratio increased 75 basis points to 4.29% (see the “Managed Presentations”
section below).


2008 vs. 2007

Revenues, net of
interest expense

decreased 21%, driven by
lower securitization revenue and higher credit losses in the securitization
trusts, which were partially offset by higher net interest margin in cards and
higher revenues in retail banking. Lower securitization revenue was mainly
driven by a write-down of $1.1 billion in the residual interest in securitized
balances. The residual interest was primarily affected by deterioration in the
projected credit loss assumption used to value the asset.

Net
interest revenue

was up 21%, mainly driven by lower funding costs.

Non-interest
revenue

decreased 39%, primarily due to lower securitization revenue, higher credit
losses in the securitization trusts, and the absence of a $297 million gain on
the sale of MasterCard shares in 2007. This decline was partially offset by a
$349 million gain on the sale of Visa shares and a $170 million gain from a
cards portfolio sale in 2008.

Operating
expenses increased

31%, primarily driven by a
$2.3 billion goodwill impairment charge in 2008. Excluding the charge, expenses
were down 5% mainly reflecting the absence of a $292 million Visa
litigation-related charge in 2007 and a $159 million Visa litigation reserve
release in 2008, partially offset by $217 million repositioning charges in
2008.

Provisions
for loan losses and for benefits and claims

increased $540 million driven
by higher net credit losses, up $165 million, and a higher loan loss reserve
build, up $367 million, in both cards and retail banking. Higher credit costs
reflected a weakening of leading credit indicators, including the continued
acceleration in the rate at which delinquent cards customers advanced to
write-off, as well as trends in the macroeconomic environment, including the
housing market downturn and rising unemployment. The cards managed net credit
loss ratio increased 191 basis points to 5.72%, while the retail banking net
credit loss ratio increased 14 basis points to 3.54%.

Managed Presentations

Managed-basis (Managed) presentations detail certain
non-GAAP financial measures. Managed presentations (applicable only to North
American branded and retail partner credit card operations in

NA RCB

and Citi Holdings

—

Local Consumer
Lending

,
respectively, as there are no deconsolidated credit card securitizations in any
other region) include results from both the on-balance-sheet loans and
off-balance-sheet loans, and exclude the impact of credit card securitizations
activity. Managed presentations assume that securitized loans have not been sold
and present the results of the securitized loans in the same manner as
Citigroup’s owned loans. Citigroup believes that Managed presentations are
useful to investors because they are widely used by analysts and investors
within the credit card industry. Managed presentations are commonly used by
other companies within the financial services industry. See also the “2010
Outlook” for

2010 Outlook

In 2010,

NA RCB

is expected to continue to
operate in a challenging economic and credit environment. Revenues will be
affected by the continued U.S. economic downturn that has impacted customer
demand and credit performance, as well as by legislative and regulatory changes.
Both retail banking and cards will continue to focus on tight expense control,
productivity improvements, and effective credit management. With high levels of
unemployment and bankruptcy filings in 2010, net credit losses, delinquencies
and defaults are expected to remain at elevated levels during the
year.

NA
RCB

results will also continue to be impacted by Citi’s continued
implementation of the CARD Act as well as the company’s loss mitigation and
forbearance programs, particularly in Citi’s card and U.S. mortgage businesses.
The majority of the provisions of the CARD Act will have taken effect by
February 2010. The CARD Act implementation began to impact card revenues in the
fourth quarter of 2009 as lower net interest rate revenue due to such
implementation was partially mitigated by pricing actions. Management
within

NA RCB

continues to review and
revise the company’s credit card business model to implement the required
changes of the CARD Act, and this will likely continue throughout 2010. While
management of

NA RCB

believes that it can mitigate
a portion of the impact of the CARD Act, Citi currently estimates that the net
impact of the CARD Act on

NA RCB

revenues
for 2010 could be a reduction of approximately $400 to $600 million. See also
“Results of Operations—Citi Holdings—

Local
Consumer Lending

” and “Managing Global Risk—Credit Risk”
below.

In
addition, on January 1, 2010, Citi adopted SFAS No. 166,

Accounting for Transfers of
Financial Assets, an Amendment of FASB Statement No. 140

(SFAS 166) and SFAS No.

Amendments to FASB
Interpretation No. 46(R)

(SFAS 167). These new
accounting standards will be applied prospectively and will require
consolidation of certain credit card securitization trusts and
the elimination of sale accounting for transfers of credit card receivables
to those trusts. Under previous accounting standards, transfers of credit card
receivables to the securitization trusts were accounted for as sales.
Consequently, beginning in 2010, the financial results of

NA RCB

will vary from previously
reported financial results prepared under the amended accounting standards. See
Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of “Future
Application of Accounting Standards” for further
detail.

2009 vs.

Revenues, net of interest
expense

declined
17%. More than half of the revenue decline is attributable to the impact of FX
translation. Other drivers included lower wealth-management and lending revenues
due to lower volumes and spread compression from credit tightening initiatives.
Investment sales declined by 26% due to market conditions at the start of the
year with assets under management increasing by 9% by year
end.

Net interest revenue

was 23% lower than the prior year due to external competitive pressure
on rates and higher funding costs, with average loans for retail banking down
18% and average deposits down 18%.

Non-interest revenue

decreased by 3%, primarily due to the impact of FX translation.
Excluding FX there was marginal
growth.

Operating expenses

declined 27%, reflecting expense control actions, lower marketing expenses and
the impact of FX translation. Cost savings were achieved by branch closures,
headcount reductions and process re-engineering
efforts.

Provisions for loan losses

increased $482 million to $794 million.

Net

credit
losses

increased from $237 million to $487 million, while the loan loss
reserve build increased from $75 million to $307 million. Higher credit costs
reflected continued credit deterioration across the region.


2008 vs.

Revenues, net of interest

expense increased 18% due to growth in the
size of the portfolio across Central and Eastern Europe and the Middle East.
Investment sales declined by 39% with assets under management declining by 42%
as a result of market conditions in the second half of
2008.

Net interest revenue

was 31% higher than the prior year due to growth in the size of the
portfolio across Central and Eastern Europe and the Middle East and growth in
revolving balances. Average loans for retail banking were up 26%, cards were up
49% and average deposits were up
22%.

Non-interest revenue

decreased by 4% due to reduced investment revenue as a result of market
conditions.

Operating expenses

increased 19%, reflecting growth in the portfolio and repositioning
charges.

Provisions for loan losses

increased 49% to $312 million.

Net
credit losses

increased from $113 million to $237 million, while the

Loan loss reserve build

decreased by 22%
to $75 million. Credit costs increased as a result of market conditions driving
deterioration in the portfolio.

Outlook

During
2010,

EMEA RCB

businesses are expected to operate in an
environment of continued challenging economic and credit conditions. While key
business drivers, including deposits, investment sales and card purchase sales,
began to show some signs of improvement during the latter part of 2009,
continued positive developments, if any, will depend on the success of

EMEA RCB

’s strategy of concentrated focus on larger
urban markets. Credit quality is currently anticipated to improve modestly with
remedial programs and tighter origination standards reducing both delinquencies
and credit losses, with some continued pockets of weakness in Poland and
Hungary. Loan and card volume growth will continue to be controlled, driven by
tighter origination standards.

2009 vs.

Revenues, net of interest
expense

declined 16%, driven by
the impact of FX translation as well as lower activity in the branded cards
business.

Net interest revenue

decreased 17%, mainly driven by FX translation impact as well as lower
volumes and spread compression in the branded cards business that offset the
growth in loans, deposits and investment products in the retail
business.

Non interest revenue

decreased 13%, driven also by FX impact and lower branded cards fee
income from lower customer activity.

Operating expenses

decreased 52%, primarily driven by the absence of a goodwill impairment charge
of $4.3 billion in 2008, the benefit associated with the FX impact and saves
from restructuring actions implemented primarily at the end of 2008. The $125
million related to 2008 restructuring charges was offset by an expense benefit
of $257 million related to a legal vehicle restructuring in 2008. Expenses
increased slightly in the fourth quarter of 2009 primarily due to selected
marketing and investment
spending.

Provisions for loan losses and for benefits and claims

decreased 13% primarily reflecting lower loan
loss reserve builds as a result of lower volumes, improved portfolio quality and
lower net credit losses in the branded cards portfolio primarily in Mexico due
to repositioning in the portfolio.


2008 vs.

Revenues,
net of interest expense

increased 6% compared to the prior year, associated with higher volumes and
partially offset by the extraordinary gains recorded in 2007: a $235 million
gain on the sale of Visa shares and a $78 million gain on the sale of MasterCard
shares.

Net interest revenue

increased 15% driven by higher volumes in both the branded cards and
retail businesses.

Non-interest revenue

declined, driven by the 2007 Visa and MasterCard extraordinary
gains.

Operating expenses

growth of 97% was mainly driven by goodwill impairment of $4.3 billion in 2008,
and to a lesser extent, restructuring charges of $125 million. Partially
offsetting these increases was a $257 million expense benefit related to a legal
vehicle restructuring.

Provisions for loan losses and for benefits and claims

increased 94%, primarily
driven by higher loan loss reserve builds in 2008 reflecting portfolio growth
and market conditions.

Outlook

Improving economic conditions across the region, including the level of
exchange rates, the credit environment and unemployment rates, are currently
expected to have a positive impact on

LATAM RCB

performance in 2010. However,

LATAM RCB

results
will depend on overall macroeconomic conditions in the region as well as the
impact of loss mitigation efforts and the repositioning of the
portfolio.

During the fourth quarter of 2009,

LATAM RCB

began to increase investments in card account
acquisition, with a focus on higher-quality accounts. This step may begin to
contribute to account and card revenue growth in 2010. While the business
anticipates continued selective marketing and investment spending during the
year, management of

LATAM RCB

currently
expects that overall operating expenses will continue to reflect re-engineering
efforts.

In addition, Mexico’s Ministry of Finance has publicly stated that the
U.S. government ownership stake in Citigroup does not violate Mexican law
barring indirect foreign government ownership of Mexican affiliate banks. The
Mexican Senate has asked the Mexican Supreme Court to determine the
constitutionality of the Ministry’s interpretation. The Mexican Supreme Court is
considering and will issue a resolution on the matter. Neither Citi, Banamex nor
the U.S. government is a party to this proceeding.

2009 vs.

Revenues,
net of interest expense

declined
9%, driven by the absence of the gain on Visa shares in the prior year, lower
investment product revenues and cards purchase sales, lower spreads, and the
impact of FX translation.

Net interest revenue

was 5% lower than the prior year. Average loans and deposits were down
10% and 4%, respectively, in each case partly due to the impact of FX
translation.

Non-interest revenue

declined 19%, primarily due to the decline in investment revenues, lower
cards purchase sales, the absence of the gain on Visa shares and the impact of
FX translation.

Operating expenses

declined 9%, reflecting the benefits of re-engineering efforts and the impact of
FX translation. Expenses increased slightly in the fourth quarter of 2009
primarily due to selected marketing and investment
spending.

Provisions for loan losses and for benefits and claims

increased 28%, mainly due to the impact of a
higher credit reserve build and an increase in net credit
losses partially offset by the impact of FX translation. In the first
half of the year, rising credit losses were particularly apparent in the
portfolios in India and South Korea. However, delinquencies improved in recent
periods and net credit losses flattened as the region showed early signs of
economic recovery and increased levels of customer activity.


2008 vs.

Revenues, net of interest
expense

increased 4%, driven by
higher cards purchase sales and higher loan and deposit volumes, partially
offset by lower gains on Visa shares than the prior year and a 47% decline in
investment sales.

Net interest revenue

was 13% higher than the prior year reflecting higher card balances,
higher average loans and deposits, and better spreads.

Non-interest revenue

declined 11%, primarily due to the lower gains on Visa shares than the
prior year and the decline in investment sales, partially offset by higher cards
purchase sales.

Operating expenses

increased 11%, reflecting higher business volume and restructuring expenses in
2008.

Provisions for loan losses and for benefits and claims

increased 64%, mainly due to higher net
credit losses and higher credit reserve builds, reflective of the overall
economic environment in the region.

Outlook

The 2010
performance of

Asia RCB

will continue to
be driven by improving macroeconomic conditions in the region, supported by
continued investment spending in the business and product capability.

Asia RCB

anticipates continued investment in
expanded retail distribution, an enhanced wealth management offering and
increased expenditure on card promotion and account acquisition, which could
result in an increase in year-on-year expenses. While

Asia RCB

currently expects credit trends,
including declining net credit losses and improving delinquencies, to continue
in 2010, credit trends in the region will also be affected by the pace of
recovery in the U.S. and European Union.

2009 vs.

Revenues, net of interest expense

increased 11% or $2.7 billion, as markets began to recover in the early part of
2009, bringing back higher levels of volume activity and higher levels of
liquidity, which began to decline again in the third quarter of 2009. The growth
in revenue in the early part of the year was mainly due to a $7.1 billion
increase in fixed income markets, reflecting strong trading opportunities across
all asset classes in the first half of 2009, and a $1.5 billion increase in
investment banking revenue primarily from increases in debt and equity
underwriting activities reflecting higher transaction volumes from depressed
2008 levels. These increases were offset by a $6.4 billion decrease in lending
revenue primarily from losses on credit default swap hedges. Excluding the 2009
and 2008 CVA impact, as indicated in the table below, revenues increased 23% or
$5.5 billion.

Operating expenses

decreased 17%, or $2.7 billion. Excluding the 2008 repositioning and
restructuring charges and the 2009 litigation reserve release, operating
expenses declined 11% or $1.6 billion, mainly as a result of headcount
reductions and benefits from expense
management.

Provisions for loan losses and for benefits and claims

decreased 7% or $129 million, to $1.7 billion, mainly due to lower credit
reserve builds and net credit losses, due to an improved credit environment,
particularly in the latter part of the year.

2008 vs.

Revenues, net of interest expense

decreased 2% or $0.4 billion reflecting the overall difficult market conditions.
Excluding the 2008 and 2007 CVA impact, revenues decreased 3% or $0.6 billion.
The reduction in revenue was primarily due to a decrease in investment banking
revenue of $2.3 billion to $3.2 billion, mainly in debt and equity underwriting,
reflecting lower volumes, and a decrease in equity markets revenue of $2.3
billion to $2.9 billion due to extremely high volatility and reduced levels of
activity. These reductions were offset by an increase in fixed income markets of
$2.9 billion to $14.4 billion due to strong performance in interest rates and
currencies, and an increase in lending revenue of $2.4 billion to $4.2 billion
mainly from gains on credit default swap
hedges.

Operating expenses

decreased by 2% or $0.4 billion. Excluding the 2008 and 2007 repositioning and
restructuring charges and the 2007 litigation reserve reversal, operating
expenses decreased by 7% or $1.1 billion driven by headcount reduction and lower
performance-based incentives.

Provisions for credit losses and for benefits and
claims

increased $1.3 billion to $1.8 billion mainly from higher credit
reserve builds and net credit losses offset by a lower provision for unfunded
lending commitments due to deterioration in the credit
environment.

In the table above, 2009 includes a $330 million pretax adjustment to the
CVA balance, which reduced pretax revenues for the year, reflecting a correction
of an error related to prior periods. See

“Significant Accounting
Policies and Significant Estimates

”

below and Notes 1
and 34 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a further discussion of this
adjustment.

Outlook

The 2010 outlook for

S&B

will depend on the
level of client activity and on macroeconomic conditions, market valuations and
volatility, interest rates and other market factors. Management of

S&B

currently expects to maintain client activity throughout 2010 and to operate in
market conditions that offer moderate volatility and increased
liquidity.

Operating expenses will benefit from continued re-engineering and expense
management initiatives, but will be offset by investments in talent and
infrastructure to support growth.


TRANSACTION SERVICES

Transaction Services

is composed of Treasury and Trade Solutions (TTS) and Securities and Fund
Services (SFS). TTS provides comprehensive cash management and trade finance for
corporations, financial institutions and public sector entities worldwide. SFS
provides custody and funds services to investors such as insurance companies and
mutual funds, clearing services to intermediaries such as broker-dealers, and
depository and agency/trust services to multinational corporations and
governments globally. Revenue is generated from net interest revenue on deposits
in TTS and SFS, as well as trade loans and from fees for transaction processing
and fees on assets under custody in SFS.

2009 vs.

Revenues,
net of interest expense

declined 2% compared to 2008 as strong growth in balances was more than offset
by lower spreads driven by low interest rates globally.

Average deposits and other customer liability balances

grew 8%, driven by strong growth in all regions.

Treasury and Trade Solutions

revenues grew 7% as a result of strong growth in balances and higher
trade revenues.

Securities and Funds Services

revenues declined 18%, attributable to reductions in asset valuations and
volumes.

Operating expenses

declined 12%, mainly as a result of headcount reductions and successful
execution of reengineering initiatives.

Cost of credit

declined 80%, which was primarily attributable to overall portfolio
management.

Net income

increased 12%, leading to a record net income, with growth across all regions
reflecting benefits of continued re-engineering and expense management
efforts.

2008 vs.

Revenues, net of interest expense

grew 23% driven by new business and implementations, growth in customer
liability balances, increased transaction volumes and the impact of
acquisitions.

Average deposits and other customer liability balances

grew 14% driven by success of new business growth and
implementations.

Treasury and Trade Solutions

revenues grew 26% as a result of strong liability and fee growth as well
as increased client penetration.

Securities and Funds Services

revenues grew 17% as a result of increased assets under custody, volumes
and liability balances.

Outlook

Transaction Services

business performance will continue to be impacted in 2010 by levels of interest
rates, economic activity, volatility in global capital markets, foreign exchange
and market valuations globally. Levels of client activity and client cash and
security flows are key factors dependent on macroeconomic conditions.

Transaction Services

intends to continue to
invest in technology to support its global network, as well as investments to
build out its investor services suite of products aimed at large,
under-penetrated markets for middle and back office outsourcing among a range of
investors. These and similar investments could lead to increasing operating
expenses.


CITI HOLDINGS

Citi Holdings contains businesses and portfolios of assets that Citigroup
has determined are not central to its core Citicorp business. These noncore
businesses tend to be more asset-intensive and reliant on wholesale funding and
also may be product-driven rather than client-driven. Citi intends to exit these
businesses as quickly as practicable yet in an economically rational
manner through business divestitures, portfolio run-off and asset sales. Citi
has made substantial progress divesting and exiting businesses from Citi
Holdings, having completed 15 divestitures in 2009, including Smith Barney,
Nikko Cordial Securities, Nikko Asset Management Financial Institution Credit
Card business (FI) and Diners Club North America. Citi Holdings’
assets have been reduced by nearly 40%, or $351 billion, from the peak level of
$898 billion in the first quarter of 2008 to $547 billion at year-end 2009. Citi
Holdings’ assets represented less than 30% of Citi’s assets as of December 31,
2009. Asset reductions from Citi Holdings have the combined benefits of further
fortifying Citigroup’s capital base, lowering risk, simplifying the organization
and allowing Citi to allocate capital to fund long-term strategic
businesses.

Citi Holdings consists
of the following businesses:

Brokerage and Asset Management; Local Consumer Lending;

and

Special Asset
Pool.

With Citi’s exit from the loss-sharing agreement with the U.S. government
in December 2009, the Company conducted a broad review of the Citi Holdings
asset base to determine which assets are strategically important to Citicorp. As
a result of this analysis, approximately $61 billion of assets will be moved
from Citi Holdings into Citicorp in the first quarter of 2010. The assets
consist primarily of approximately $34 billion of U.S. mortgages that will be
transferred to

NA RCB

, approximately $19 billion of commercial and corporate loans and
securities related to core Citicorp clients, of which approximately $17 billion
will be moved to

S&B

and the remainder to

NA RCB

, and approximately $5.0 billion of assets related to Citi’s Mexico
asset management business that will be moved to

LATAM RCB

.

BROKERAGE AND ASSET
MANAGEMENT

Brokerage and Asset Management
(BAM)

, which constituted approximately 6% of Citi Holdings by assets as of
December 31, 2009, consists of Citi’s global retail brokerage and asset
management businesses. This segment was substantially affected and reduced in
size in 2009 due to the divestitures of Smith Barney (to the Morgan Stanley
Smith Barney joint venture (MSSB JV)) and Nikko Cordial Securities. At December
31, 2009,

BAM

had approximately $35 billion of assets, which included $26 billion of assets
from the 49% interest in the MSSB JV ($13 billion investment and $13 billion in
loans associated with the clients of the MSSB JV) and $9 billion of assets from
a diverse set of asset management and insurance businesses of which
approximately half will be transferred into the

LATAM RCB

during the first quarter of 2010, as discussed under “Citi Holdings”
above. Morgan Stanley has options to purchase Citi’s remaining stake in the MSSB
JV over three years starting in 2012. The 2009 results include an $11.1 billion
gain ($6.7 billion after-tax) on the sale of Smith Barney.

2009 vs.

Revenues,
net of interest expense

increased 80% versus the prior year mainly driven by the $11.1 billion pretax
gain on the sale ($6.7 billion after-tax) on the MSSB JV transaction in the
second quarter of 2009 and a $320 million pretax gain on the sale of the managed
futures business to the MSSB JV in the third quarter of 2009. Excluding these
gains, revenue decreased primarily due to the absence of Smith Barney from May
2009 onwards and the absence of fourth-quarter revenue of Nikko Asset
Management, partially offset by an improvement in marks in Retail Alternative
Investments.

Revenues

in the prior year include a $347 million pretax gain on sale of CitiStreet and
charges related to the settlement of auction rate securities of $393 million
pretax.

Operating expenses

decreased 64% from the prior year, mainly driven by the absence of Smith Barney
and Nikko Asset Management expenses, re-engineering efforts and the absence of
2008 one-time expenses ($0.9 billion intangible impairment, $0.2 billion of
restructuring and $0.5 billion of write-downs and other
charges).

Provisions for loan losses and for benefits and claims

decreased 15% mainly reflecting a $50 million decrease in provision for benefits
and claims, partially offset by increased reserve builds of $28
million.

Assets

decreased 40% versus the prior year, mostly driven by the sales of Nikko Cordial
Securities and Nikko Asset Management ($25 billion) and the managed futures
business ($1.4 billion), partially offset by increased Smith Barney assets of $4
billion.

2008 vs.

Revenues, net of interest
expense

decreased 21% from the prior year primarily due to lower transactional and
investment revenues in Smith Barney, lower revenues in Nikko Asset Management
and higher markdowns in Retail Alternative
Investments.

Operating expenses

increased 16% versus the prior year, mainly driven by a $0.9 billion intangible
impairment in Nikko Asset Management in the fourth quarter of 2008, $0.2 billion
of restructuring charges and $0.5 billion of write-downs and other
charges.

Provisions for loan losses and for benefits and claims

increased $65 million compared to the prior year, mainly due to a $52 million
increase in provisions for benefits and claims.

Assets

increased 4% versus the prior year.


LOCAL CONSUMER LENDING

Local Consumer Lending
(LCL)

, which constituted approximately 65% of Citi Holdings by assets as of
December 31, 2009, includes a portion of Citigroup’s North American mortgage
business, retail partner cards, Western European cards and retail banking,
CitiFinancial North America, Primerica, Student Loan Corporation and other local
consumer finance businesses globally. At December 31, 2009,

LCL

had $358 billion of assets ($317 billion in

North America

). About one-half of the assets in

LCL

as of December 31, 2009 consisted of U.S. mortgages in the company’s
CitiMortgage and CitiFinancial operations. The North American assets consist of
residential mortgage loans, retail partner card loans, student loans, personal
loans, auto loans, commercial real estate, and other consumer loans and
assets.

2009 vs.

Revenues,
net of interest expense

decreased 22% versus the prior year, mostly due to lower net interest revenue.

Net interest revenue

was 23% lower than the prior year, primarily due to lower balances, de-risking
of the portfolio, and spread compression.

Net interest revenue

as a percentage of average loans decreased 63 basis points from the prior year,
primarily due to the impact of higher delinquencies, interest write-offs, loan
modification programs, higher FDIC charges and CARD Act implementation (in the
latter part of 2009),  partially offset by retail partner cards pricing
actions.

LCL

results will continue to be
impacted by the CARD Act. Citi currently estimates that the net impact on

LCL

revenues for 2010 could be a reduction of
approximately $50 to $150 million. See also “

North America Regional Consumer Banking

”
and “Managing Global Risk—Credit Risk” for additional information on the
impact of the CARD Act to Citi’s credit card businesses

. Average loans decreased 12%, with

North America

down 11% and international down 19%.

Non-interest revenue

decreased $1.1 billion mostly driven by the impact of higher credit losses
flowing through the securitization
trusts.

Operating expenses

declined 30% from the prior year, due to lower volumes and reductions from
expense re-engineering actions, and the impact of goodwill write-offs of $3.0
billion in the fourth quarter of 2008, partially offset by higher other real
estate owned and collection costs.

Provisions for loan losses and for benefits and
claims

increased 14% versus the prior year reflecting an increase in net
credit losses of $6.1 billion,

partially offset by lower reserve builds of $2.7 billion. Higher net
credit losses were primarily driven by higher losses of $3.6 billion in
residential real estate lending, $1.0 billion in retail partner cards, and $0.7
billion in international.

Assets

decreased $58 billion versus the prior year, primarily driven by lower
originations, wind-down of specific businesses, asset sales, divestitures,
write-offs and higher loan loss reserve balances. Key divestitures in 2009
included the FI credit card business, Italy consumer finance, Diners Europe,
Portugal cards, Norway consumer, and Diners Club North America.

2008 vs.

Revenues, net of interest expense

decreased 9% versus the prior year, mostly due to lower

Non-interest revenue

.

Net interest revenue

declined 1% versus the prior year. Average loans increased 3%; however, revenues
declined, driven by lower balances, de-risking of the portfolio, and spread
compression.

Non-interest revenue

decreased $2 billion, primarily due to the impact of securitization in retail
partners cards and the mark-to-market on the mortgage servicing rights asset and
related hedge in real estate
lending.

Operating expenses

increased 31%, driven by the impact of goodwill write-offs of $3.0 billion in
the fourth quarter of 2008 and restructuring costs. Excluding one-time expenses,
expenses were slightly higher due to increased volumes.


Provisions for loan losses and for benefits and claims

increased 76% versus the prior year reflecting increased net credit losses of
$6.4 billion and higher reserve builds of $3.1 billion. Higher net credit losses
were primarily driven by $3.9 billion in real estate lending and $0.8 billion in
retail partner cards.

Assets

decreased $65 billion versus the prior year, primarily driven by Real Estate
Lending and higher loan loss reserve balances in 2008.

Japan
Consumer Finance

Citigroup continues to actively monitor a number of matters involving its
Japan Consumer Finance business, including customer refund claims and defaults,
as well as financial and legislative, regulatory, judicial and other political
developments, relating to the charging of “gray zone” interest. Gray zone
interest represents interest at rates that are legal but for which claims may
not be enforceable. This business has incurred and will continue to face net
credit losses and refunds, due in part to the impact of Japanese consumer
lending laws passed in the fourth quarter of 2006 and judicial and regulatory
actions. In addition, legislation effective in 2010 will impose a lower interest
rate cap and lower lending cap on consumer lending in Japan, which may reduce
credit availability and increase potential claims and losses relating to gray
zone interest.

Citi determined in 2008 to exit its Japanese Consumer Finance business
and has been liquidating its portfolio and otherwise winding down the business.
Citi continues to monitor and evaluate both currently and previously outstanding
accounts in its Japanese Consumer Finance business and its reserves related
thereto. However, the trend in the type, number and amount of claims, and the
potential full amount of losses and their impact on Citi requires evaluation in
a potentially volatile environment, is subject to significant uncertainties and
continues to be difficult to predict.


SPECIAL ASSET POOL

Special Asset Pool (SAP)

, which constituted approximately 28% of Citi
Holdings by assets as of December 31, 2009, is a portfolio of securities, loans
and other assets that Citigroup intends to actively reduce over time through
asset sales and portfolio run-off. At December 31, 2009,

SAP

had $154
billion of assets.

SAP

assets have
declined by $197 billion or 56% from peak levels in 2007 reflecting cumulative
write-downs, asset sales and portfolio run-off. Assets have been reduced by $87
billion from year-ago levels. Approximately 60% of

SAP

assets are now
accounted for on an accrual basis, which has helped reduce income
volatility.

2009 vs.

Revenues, net of interest expense

increased $35.9 billion in 2009, primarily
due to the absence of significant negative revenue marks occurring in the prior
year. Total negative marks were $1.9 billion in 2009 as compared to $38.1
billion in 2008, as described in more detail below. Revenue in the current
year included a positive $1.3 billion CVA on derivative positions, excluding
monoline insurers, and positive marks of $0.8 billion on subprime-related direct
exposures. These positive revenues were partially offset by negative revenues of
$1.5 billion on Alt-A mortgages, $1.3 billion of write-downs on commercial real
estate, and a negative $1.6 billion CVA on the monoline insurers and fair value
option liabilities. Revenue was also affected by negative marks on private
equity positions and write-downs on highly leveraged finance
commitments.

Operating expenses

decreased 9% in 2009, mainly driven by lower compensation and lower volumes and
transaction expenses, partially offset by costs associated with the U.S.
government loss-sharing agreement, which Citi exited in the fourth quarter of
2009.

Provisions for credit losses and for benefits and
claims

increased $1.5
billion, primarily driven by $4.5 billion in increased net credit losses,
partially offset by a lower reserve build of $3.0
billion.

Assets

declined 36%
versus the prior year, primarily driven by amortization and prepayments, sales,
marks and charge-offs. Asset sales during the fourth quarter of 2009 ($10
billion) were executed at or above Citi’s marks generating $800 million in
pretax gains for the quarter.

2008 vs.

Revenues, net of interest expense

decreased $21.7 billion, primarily due to
negative net revenue marks. Revenue included $14.3 billion of write-downs on
subprime-related direct exposures and a negative $6.8 billion CVA related to the
monoline insurers and derivative positions. Revenue was also negatively affected
by write-downs on highly leveraged finance commitments, Alt-A mortgage revenue,
write-downs on structured investment vehicles and commercial real estate, and
mark-to-market on auction rate securities. Total negative marks were $38.1
billion in 2008 as compared to $20.2 billion in 2007, which are described in
more detail below.

Operating expenses

decreased 8%, mainly driven by lower compensation and transaction
expenses.

Provisions for credit losses and for benefits and
claims

increased $2.7
billion, primarily due to a $2.2 billion increase in the reserve build and an
increase in net credit losses of $0.5
billion.

Assets

declined 31%
versus the prior year, primarily driven by amortization and prepayments, sales,
and marks and charge-offs.

Credit
Valuation Adjustment (CVA) Related to Monoline
Insurers

CVA is
calculated by applying forward default probabilities, which are derived using
the counterparty’s current credit spread, to the expected exposure profile. The
exposure primarily relates to hedges on super-senior subprime exposures that
were executed with various monoline insurance companies. See “Managing Global
Risk

—

Credit
Risk—Direct Exposure to Monolines” for further discussion.

Credit
Valuation Adjustment on Citi’s Debt Liabilities for Which Citi Has Elected the
Fair

Value
Option

Citi is required to use its own credit spreads
in determining the current value for its derivative liabilities and all other
liabilities for which it has elected the fair value option. When Citi’s credit
spreads widen (deteriorate), Citi recognizes a gain on these liabilities because
the value of the liabilities has decreased. When Citi’s credit spreads narrow
(improve), Citi recognizes a loss on these liabilities because the value of the
liabilities has increased. The approximately $252 million of losses recorded in

SAP

on its fair value option liabilities
(excluding derivative liabilities) during 2009 was principally due to the
maturing of debt on which Citi has elected the fair value option.

Credit
Valuation Adjustment on Derivative Positions, Excluding Monoline
Insurers

The
approximately $1,283 million net gain in derivative positions held in

SAP

during 2009 was due to the narrowing spreads
of Citi’s counterparties on its derivative assets. See “Derivatives—Fair
Valuation Adjustments for Derivatives” for further discussion.

Accretion
on Reclassified Assets

In the fourth quarter of 2008, Citi Holdings reclassified $33.3 billion
of debt securities within

SAP

from
trading securities to HTM investments, $4.7 billion of debt securities from
trading securities to AFS, and $15.7 billion of loans from held-for-sale to
held-for-investment. All assets were reclassified with an amortized cost equal
to the fair value on the date of reclassification. The difference between the
amortized cost basis and the expected principal cash flows is treated as a
purchase discount and accreted into income over the remaining life of the
security or loan. All of these reclassified debt securities and loans are held
in

SAP

. During 2009,

SAP

recognized
approximately $1,994 million of interest revenue from this
accretion.


CORPORATE/OTHER

Corporate/Other

includes global staff functions (includes finance, risk, human resources, legal
and compliance) and other corporate expense, global operations and technology
(O&T), residual Corporate Treasury and Corporate items. At December 31,
2009, this segment had approximately $230 billion of assets, consisting
primarily of the Company’s liquidity portfolio, including $110 billion of cash
and cash equivalents.

2009 vs.

Revenues, net of interest expense

declined, primarily due to the pretax loss on
debt extinguishment related to the repayment of the $20 billion of TARP trust
preferred securities and the pretax loss in connection with the exit from the
loss-sharing agreement with the U.S. government. Revenues also declined, due to
the absence of the 2008 sale of Citigroup Global Services Limited recorded in
O&T. This was partially offset by a pretax gain related to the exchange
offers, revenues and higher intersegment eliminations.

Operating
expenses

increased,
primarily due to intersegment eliminations and increases in compensation,
partially offset by lower repositioning reserves.

2008 vs.

Revenues, net of interest expense

increased primarily due to the gain in 2007
on the sale of certain corporate-owned assets and higher intersegment
eliminations, partially offset by improved Treasury hedging
activities.

Operating expenses

declined, primarily due to lower restructuring charges in 2008 as well as
reductions in incentive compensation and benefits expense.

Loans

Loans are an extension of credit to
individuals, corporations, or government institutions. Loans vary across regions
and industries and primarily include credit cards, mortgages, other real estate
lending, personal loans, auto loans, student loans, and corporate loans. The
majority of loans are carried at cost with a minimal amount recorded at fair
value.

Consumer and corporate loans
comprised 72% and 28%, respectively, of Citi’s total loans (net of unearned
income and before the allowance for loan losses) as of December 31,
2009.

During 2009, consumer loans (net of
allowance for loan losses) decreased by $64 billion, or 14%, primarily due to
a:

$33 billion, or 12%, decrease in
  mortgage and real estate loans; and

$17 billion, or 19%, decrease in
  credit card loans, mostly in the U.S.

These decreases were driven by
tightened lending standards and credit activity during the year.

During 2009, corporate loans
decreased $46 billion, or 22%, primarily driven by a decrease of $21 billion, or
20%, in commercial and industrial loans.

During 2009, average consumer loans
(net of unearned income) of $456 billion yielded an average rate of 7.8%,
compared to $513 billion and 8.9% in the prior year. Average corporate loans of
$190 billion yielded an average rate of 6.3% in 2009, compared to $221 billion
and 7.7% in the prior year.

For further
information, see “Loans Outstanding” under “Managing Global Risk—Credit Risk”
and Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Trading
Account Assets (Liabilities)

Trading account assets

include debt and marketable equity securities, derivatives in a
receivable position, residual interests in securitizations, and physical
commodities inventory. In addition, certain assets that Citigroup has elected to
carry at fair value, such as certain loans and purchase guarantees, are also
included in

Trading account assets

.

Trading account liabilities

include securities sold, not yet purchased (short positions) and
derivatives in a net payable position as well as certain liabilities that
Citigroup has elected to carry at fair value.

All

Trading account assets

and

Trading account liabilities

are reported at their fair value, except for
physical commodities inventory which is carried at the lower of cost or market,
with unrealized gains and losses recognized in current income.

During 2009,

Trading account assets

decreased by $35 billion, or 9%, due to a:

$56 billion, or 49%, decrease in
  revaluation gains primarily consisting of decreases in interest rate and
  foreign exchange contracts as well as a decrease in netting agreements;

$16 billion, or 30%, decrease in
  mortgage loan securities driven by decreased agency and subprime debt;

$20 billion, or 172%, increase in
  U.S. Treasury and federal agency securities;

$15 billion, or 27%, increase in
  foreign government securities; and

$7 billion, or 9%, increase in
  corporate and other debt securities.


Total average

Trading account assets

were $267 billion in 2009, compared to $373 billion in 2008, yielding
average rates of 4.0% and 4.7%,
respectively.

During 2009,

Trading account liabilities

decreased by $28 billion, or 17%, due to a:

$51 billion, or 44%, decrease in
  revaluation losses primarily due to

decreases in interest rate, foreign exchange and equity contracts as
  well as

a decrease in netting
  agreements; and

$23 billion, or 45%, increase in
  securities sold, not yet purchased,

comprised of an $18 billion increase in debt securities, with U.S.
  Treasury

securities increasing
  by $5 billion.

In 2009, average

Trading account liabilities

were $60 billion, yielding an average rate of 0.5%, compared to $75
billion and 1.7% in the prior
year.

Federal
Funds Sold (Purchased) and Securities Borrowed (Loaned) or Purchased (Sold)

Under
Agreements to Resell (Repurchase)

Federal funds sold and federal funds purchased
consist of unsecured advances of excess balances in reserve accounts held at
Federal Reserve banks. When Citigroup advances federal funds to a third party,
it is selling its excess reserves. Similarly, when Citigroup receives federal
funds, it is purchasing reserves from a third party. These interest-bearing
transactions typically have an original maturity of one business
day.

Securities borrowed and securities loaned are recorded at the amount of
cash advanced or received, with a minimal amount adjusted for fair value. With
respect to securities borrowed, Citi pays cash collateral in an amount in excess
of the market value of securities borrowed, and receives excess in the case of
securities loaned. Citigroup monitors the market value of securities borrowed
and loaned on a daily basis with additional collateral advanced or obtained as
necessary. Interest received or paid for these transactions is recorded in
interest income or interest
expense.

Securities purchased under agreements to
resell and securities sold under agreements to repurchase are treated as
collateralized financing transactions and are primarily carried at fair value
since January 1, 2007. Citigroup’s policy is to take possession of securities
purchased under agreements to resell. The market value of securities to be
repurchased and resold is monitored, and additional collateral is obtained where
appropriate to protect against credit
exposure.

During 2009, the increase of $38 billion, or
21%, in federal funds sold and securities borrowed or purchased under agreements
to resell, and the decrease of $51 billion, or 25%, in federal funds purchased
and securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase were primarily
driven by Citi’s liquidity management objective of increasing cash and liquid
securities positions.

For further information regarding these
balance sheet categories, see Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements.

Investments

Investments

consist
of debt and equity securities that are available-for-sale, debt securities that
are held-to-maturity, non-marketable equity securities that are carried at fair
value, and non-marketable equity securities carried at cost. Debt securities
include bonds, notes and redeemable preferred stock, as well as loan-backed
securities (such as mortgage-backed securities) and other structured notes.
Marketable and non-marketable equity securities carried at fair value include
common and nonredeemable preferred stock. These instruments provide Citi with
long-term investment opportunities while in most cases remaining relatively
liquid.

Non-marketable equity securities carried at cost primarily include equity
shares issued by the Federal Reserve Bank and the Federal Home Loan Bank that
Citigroup is required to hold.

Investment securities classified as
available-for-sale are primarily carried at fair value with the changes in fair
value generally recognized in stockholders’ equity (accumulated other
comprehensive income). Declines in fair value that are deemed
other-than-temporary, as well as gains and losses from the sale of these
investment securities, are recognized in current earnings. Certain investments
in non-marketable equity securities and certain investments that would otherwise
be accounted for using the equity method are carried at fair value. Changes in
fair value of such investments are recorded in earnings. Debt securities
classified as held-to-maturity are carried at cost unless a decline in fair
value below cost is deemed other-than-temporary, in which case such a decline is
recorded in current earnings.

During 2009, investments increased by $50
billion, or 20%, principally due to a:

$64 billion increase in
  available-for-sale securities (U.S. Treasury and federal agency securities,
  $30 billion; foreign governments, $22 billion; and corporate, $10 billion);
  and

$13 billion decrease in
  held-to-maturity securities (predominantly asset-backed securities).

For further information regarding investments, see Note 16 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements.

Other
Assets

Other assets

are
composed of cash and due from banks, deposits with banks, brokerage receivables,
goodwill, intangibles, and various other assets.

During 2009,

Other assets

decreased $24 billion, or 5%, due to a:

$11 billion decrease in

Brokerage receivables

, driven by the absence of

unsettled customer trades as markets have
  become more liquid;

$5 billion decrease in

Intangible assets

and $2 billion decrease in

Goodwill

,
  predominantly from the sale of Nikko Cordial Securities and

Nikko Asset Management and the MSSB JV with
  Morgan Stanley;

$3 billion decrease in

Deposits with banks

, from decreased deposits with

the Federal Reserve used to purchase highly
  liquid securities; and

$5 billion decrease in various
  other assets.

For further information regarding

Goodwill

and

Intangible assets

, see Note
19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. For further discussion on

Brokerage receivables

, see Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements.


Deposits

Deposits represent customer funds that are
payable on demand or upon maturity. The majority of deposits are carried at
cost, with a minimal amount recorded at fair value. Deposits can be
interest-bearing or non-interest-bearing. Interest-bearing deposits payable by
foreign and U.S. domestic banking subsidiaries of Citigroup comprise 58% and 28%
of total deposits, respectively, while non-interest-bearing deposits comprise 5%
and 9% of total deposits,
respectively.

During 2009, total deposits increased by $62
billion, or 8%.

Total average
deposits increased $10 billion or 1% during 2009.

For more information on deposits, see “Capital Resources and
Liquidity—Liquidity.”

Debt

Debt is composed of both short-term and
long-term borrowings. It includes commercial paper, borrowings from unaffiliated
banks, senior notes (including collateralized advances from the Federal Home
Loan Bank), subordinated notes and trust preferred securities. The majority of
debt is carried at cost, with approximately $27 billion recorded at fair
value.

During 2009, total debt decreased by $53 billion, or 11%, with

Short-term borrowings

decreasing by $58 billion, or 46%.

Long-term debt

increased by only $5 billion, or
1%.

The decrease in

Short-term borrowings

was due to a decline of $39 billion in other funds borrowed and $19
billion in commercial paper primarily caused by decreased need for short-term
funding due to excess liquidity caused by increased deposits and a reduction in
assets.

Average commercial paper outstanding in 2009 was $25 billion with an
average rate of 1.0%, compared to $32 billion and 3.1% in 2008. Average other
funds borrowed in 2009 were $77 billion, with an average rate of 1.5%, compared
to $83 billion and 1.7% in the prior
year.

Average long-term debt outstanding during 2009 was $345 billion, compared
to $348 billion in 2008, with an average rate of 3.6% and 4.6%,
respectively.

For more information on debt, see Note 20 to
the Consolidated Financial Statements and “Capital Resources and
Liquidity—Liquidity.”

The above supplemental information
reflects Citigroup’s consolidated GAAP balance sheet by reporting segment as of
December 31, 2009. The respective segment information closely depicts the assets
and liabilities managed by each segment as of such date. While this presentation
is not defined by GAAP, Citi believes that these non-GAAP financial measures
enhance investors’ understanding of the balance sheet components managed by the
underlying business segments, as well as the beneficial interrelationship of the
asset and liability dynamics of the balance sheet components among Citi’s
business segments.


CAPITAL RESOURCES AND
LIQUIDITY

CAPITAL RESOURCES

Overview

Capital has historically been generated by
earnings from Citi’s operating businesses. Citi may also augment its capital
through issuances of common stock, convertible preferred stock, preferred stock,
equity issued through awards under employee benefit plans, and, in the case of
regulatory capital, through the issuance of subordinated debt underlying trust
preferred securities. In addition, the impact of future events on Citi’s
business results, such as corporate and asset dispositions, as well as changes
in accounting standards, also affect Citi’s capital
levels.

Generally, capital is used primarily to support assets in Citi’s
businesses and to absorb market, credit, or operational losses. While capital
may be used for other purposes, such as to pay dividends or repurchase common
stock, Citi’s ability to utilize its capital for these purposes is currently
restricted due to its agreements with the U.S. government, generally for so long
as the U.S. government continues to hold Citi’s common stock or trust preferred
securities. See also “Supervision and Regulation”
below.

Citigroup’s capital management framework is designed to ensure that
Citigroup and its principal subsidiaries maintain sufficient capital consistent
with Citi’s risk profile and all applicable regulatory standards and guidelines,
as well as external rating agency considerations. The capital management process
is centrally overseen by senior management and is reviewed at the consolidated,
legal entity, and country level.

Senior management is responsible for the
capital management process mainly through Citigroup’s Finance and Asset and
Liability Committee (FinALCO), with oversight from the Risk Management and
Finance Committee of Citigroup’s Board of Directors. The FinALCO is composed of
the senior-most management of Citigroup for the purpose of engaging management
in decision-making and related discussions on capital and liquidity matters.
Among other things, FinALCO’s responsibilities include: determining the
financial structure of Citigroup and its principal subsidiaries; ensuring that
Citigroup and its regulated entities are adequately capitalized in consultation
with its regulators; determining appropriate asset levels and return hurdles for
Citigroup and individual businesses; reviewing the funding and capital markets
plan for Citigroup; and monitoring interest rate risk, corporate and bank
liquidity, and the impact of currency translation on non-U.S. earnings and
capital.

Capital
Ratios

Citigroup
is subject to the risk-based capital guidelines issued by the Federal Reserve
Board. Historically, capital adequacy has been measured, in part, based on two
risk-based capital ratios, the Tier 1 Capital and Total Capital (Tier 1 Capital
+ Tier 2 Capital) ratios. Tier 1 Capital consists of the sum of “core capital
elements,” such as qualifying common stockholders’ equity, as adjusted,
qualifying noncontrolling interests, and qualifying mandatorily redeemable
securities of subsidiary trusts, principally reduced by goodwill, other
disallowed intangible assets, and disallowed deferred tax assets. Total Capital
also includes “supplementary” Tier 2 Capital elements, such as qualifying
subordinated debt and a limited portion of the allowance for credit losses. Both
measures of capital adequacy are stated as a percentage of risk-weighted assets.
Further, in conjunction with the conduct of the 2009 Supervisory Capital
Assessment Program (SCAP), U.S. banking regulators developed a new measure of
capital termed “Tier 1 Common,” which has been defined as Tier 1 Capital less
non-common elements, including qualifying perpetual preferred stock, qualifying
noncontrolling interests, and qualifying mandatorily redeemable securities of
subsidiary trusts.

Citigroup’s risk-weighted assets are
principally derived from application of the risk-based capital guidelines
related to the measurement of credit risk. Pursuant to these guidelines,
on-balance-sheet assets and the credit equivalent amount of certain
off-balance-sheet exposures (such as financial guarantees, unfunded lending
commitments, letters of credit, and derivatives) are assigned to one of several
prescribed risk-weight categories based upon the perceived credit risk
associated with the obligor, or if relevant, the guarantor, the nature of the
collateral, or external credit ratings.

Risk-weighted assets also incorporate a measure for market risk on
covered trading account positions and all foreign exchange and commodity
positions whether or not carried in the trading account. Excluded from
risk-weighted assets are any assets, such as goodwill and deferred tax assets,
to the extent required to be deducted from regulatory capital. See “Components
of Capital Under Regulatory Guidelines”
below.

Citigroup is also subject to a Leverage ratio requirement, a
non-risk-based measure of capital adequacy, which is defined as Tier 1 Capital
as a percentage of quarterly adjusted average total
assets.

To be “well capitalized” under federal bank
regulatory agency definitions, a bank holding company must have a Tier 1 Capital
ratio of at least 6%, a Total Capital ratio of at least 10%, and a Leverage
ratio of at least 3%, and not be subject to a Federal Reserve Board directive to
maintain higher capital levels. The following table sets forth Citigroup’s
regulatory capital ratios as of December 31, 2009 and December 31,
2008.

Actions Significantly Impacting Citigroup’s
Capital

Primarily as a result of the preferred stock and trust preferred
securities exchange offers consummated in the third quarter of 2009, and capital
raised in connection with the $20 billion TARP repayment as well as
the exiting of the loss-sharing agreement in the fourth quarter of 2009, the
overall quality of Citigroup’s capital was enhanced, with Tier 1 Common
increasing by approximately $82 billion from December 31, 2008 to December 31,
2009. In addition, Citigroup’s Tangible Common Equity (TCE) increased by
approximately $87 billion from December 31, 2008 to December 31, 2009. Tier 1
Common and related capital adequacy ratios are measures used and relied upon by
U.S. banking regulators, while TCE is a capital adequacy metric used and relied
upon by industry analysts. However, both metrics and related ratios are
considered “non-GAAP financial measures” for SEC purposes. See “Capital Ratios,”
“Components of Capital Under Regulatory Guidelines,” and “Tangible Common
Equity” for additional information on these measures.

Actions Significantly Impacting Citigroup’s Risk-Weighted
Assets

In the
fourth quarter of 2009, Citigroup entered into an agreement to exit the
loss-sharing agreement with the U.S. Treasury, FDIC, and Federal Reserve
Bank of New York, which covered losses on a specifically designated portfolio,
principally comprised of consumer assets, and initially valued at approximately
$301 billion as of November 21, 2008. Under the agreement, these designated
assets had been risk-weighted at 20% for purposes of calculating Citi’s
risk-based capital ratios. With the exiting of the agreement, commencing
December 31, 2009, Citigroup discontinued risk-weighting these assets at 20%.
Rather, the assets were risk-weighted as required in accordance with risk-based
capital guidelines, as described above, and consistent to that prior to entering
into the agreement. The exiting of the loss-sharing agreement increased
Citigroup’s risk-weighted assets by approximately $136 billion, and
correspondingly decreased Citi’s Tier 1 Common, Tier 1 Capital, and Total
Capital ratios by approximately 125 basis points, approximately 157 basis
points, and approximately 183 basis points, respectively, at December 31,
2009.

In addition, during the first half of 2009, all three of Citigroup’s
primary credit card securitization trusts

—

the Master Trust,
Omni Trust, and Broadway Trust—had bonds placed on ratings watch with negative
implications by rating agencies. As a result of the ratings watch status,
certain actions were taken by Citi with respect to each of the trusts. In
general, the actions subordinated certain senior interests in the trust assets
that were retained by Citi, which effectively placed these interests below
investor interests in terms of priority of
payment.

As a result of these actions, based on the
applicable regulatory capital rules, Citigroup began including the sold assets
for all three of the credit card securitization trusts in its risk-weighted
assets for purposes of calculating its risk-based capital ratios during 2009.
The increase in risk-weighted assets occurred in the quarter during 2009 in
which the respective actions took place. The effect of these changes increased
Citigroup’s risk-weighted assets by approximately $82 billion, and decreased
Citigroup’s Tier 1 Capital ratio

by approximately 100
basis points each as of March 31, 2009, with respect to the Master and Omni
Trusts. The inclusion of the Broadway Trust increased Citigroup’s risk-weighted
assets by an additional approximate $900 million at June 30, 2009. All bond
ratings for each of the trusts have been affirmed by the rating agencies, and no
downgrades had occurred as of December 31, 2009.

Accounting Changes Significantly Impacting Citigroup’s Capital

—

Elimination
of Qualifying Special Purpose Entities (QSPEs) and Changes in the Consolidation
Model for Variable Interest Entities (VIEs)

Changes that the FASB adopted in 2009
regarding sales treatment for assets and consolidation of off-balance-sheet
VIEs, as promulgated in SFAS 166 and SFAS 167, respectively, will have a
significant and immediate impact on Citigroup’s capital ratios beginning in the
first quarter of 2010. Specifically, the pro forma impact on Citigroup’s capital
ratios of the adoption on January 1, 2010 of SFAS 166 and SFAS 167 (based on
financial information as of December 31, 2009) would be as follows:

Common
Stockholders’ Equity

Citigroup’s common stockholders’ equity increased during 2009 by $81.4
billion to $152.4 billion, and represented 8.2% of total assets as of December
31, 2009. Citigroup’s common stockholders’ equity was $71.0 billion, which
represented 3.7% of total assets, at December 31,
2008.

As of December 31, 2009, approximately $6.7 billion of stock repurchases
remained under Citi’s authorized repurchase programs. No material repurchases
were made in 2009 or 2008. In addition, for so long as the U.S. government holds
any Citigroup common stock or trust preferred securities acquired pursuant to
the preferred stock exchange offers, Citigroup has agreed not to acquire,
repurchase, or redeem any Citigroup equity or trust preferred securities, other
than pursuant to administering its employee benefit plans or other customary
exceptions, or with the consent of the U.S. government. See also “Supervision
and Regulation.”

31, 2009 and 2008, respectively.

The TCE ratio (TCE divided by risk-weighted
assets) was 10.9% and 3.1% at December 31, 2009 and 2008,
respectively.

Capital
Resources of Citigroup’s Depository Institutions

Citigroup’s U.S. subsidiary depository
institutions are subject to risk-based capital guidelines issued by their
respective primary federal bank regulatory agencies, which are similar to the
guidelines of the Federal Reserve Board. To be “well capitalized” under these
regulatory definitions, Citigroup’s depository institutions must have a Tier 1
Capital ratio of at least 6%, a Total Capital (Tier 1 Capital + Tier 2 Capital)
ratio of at least 10%, and a Leverage ratio of at least 5%, and not be subject
to a regulatory directive to meet and maintain higher capital
levels.

At December 31, 2009, all of Citigroup’s subsidiary depository
institutions were “well capitalized” under federal bank regulatory agency
definitions, including Citigroup’s primary depository institution, Citibank,
N.A., as noted in the following table:

Citibank, N.A. had a $2.8 billion net loss for 2009. In addition, during
2009, Citibank, N.A. received capital contributions from its immediate parent
company, Citicorp, in the amount of $33.0 billion. Total subordinated notes
issued to Citibank, N.A.’s immediate parent company, Citicorp, included in
Citibank, N.A.’s Tier 2 Capital declined from $28.2 billion outstanding at
December 31, 2008 to $4.0 billion outstanding at December 31, 2009, reflecting
the redemption of $24.2 billion of subordinated notes during 2009.


The following table

Broker-Dealer Subsidiaries

At December 31, 2009, Citigroup Global Markets
Inc., a broker-dealer registered with the SEC that is an indirect wholly owned
subsidiary of Citigroup Global Markets Holdings Inc., had net capital, computed
in accordance with the SEC’s net capital rule, of $10.9 billion, which exceeded
the minimum requirement by $10.2 billion.

In addition, certain of Citi’s
broker-dealer subsidiaries are subject to regulation in the other countries in
which they do business, including requirements to maintain specified levels of
net capital or its equivalent. Citigroup’s broker-dealer subsidiaries were in
compliance with their capital requirements at December 31, 2009. The
requirements applicable to these subsidiaries in the U.S. and other
jurisdictions may be subject to political uncertainty and potential change in
light of the recent financial crisis and regulatory reform proposals currently
being considered at both the legislative and regulatory
levels.

Regulatory
Capital Standards Developments

Citigroup supports the move to a new set of
risk-based capital standards, published on June 26, 2004 (and subsequently
amended in November 2005) by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision,
consisting of central banks and bank supervisors from 13 countries. The
international version of the Basel II framework will allow Citigroup to leverage
internal risk models used to measure credit, operational, and market risk
exposures to drive regulatory capital calculations.

On December 7, 2007, the U.S. banking regulators published the rules for
large banks to comply with Basel II in the U.S. These rules require Citigroup,
as a large and internationally active bank, to comply with the most advanced
Basel II approaches for calculating credit and operational risk capital
requirements. The U.S. implementation timetable consists of a parallel
calculation period under the current regulatory capital regime (Basel I) and
Basel II, starting anytime between April 1, 2008 and April 1, 2010, followed by
a three-year transition period, typically starting 12 months after the beginning
of parallel reporting. U.S. regulators have reserved the right to change how
Basel II is applied in the U.S. following a review at the end of the second year
of the transitional period, and to retain the existing prompt corrective action
and leverage capital requirements applicable to banking organizations in the
U.S. Citigroup intends to implement Basel II within the timeframe required by
the final rules. The Basel II (or its successor) requirements are the subject of
political uncertainty and potential tightening or other change in light of the
recent financial crisis and regulatory reform proposals currently being
considered at both the legislative and regulatory levels. See also “Risk
Factors.”


FUNDING AND
LIQUIDITY

General

Citigroup’s cash flows and liquidity needs are
primarily generated within its operating subsidiaries.  Exceptions exist
for major corporate items, such as the TARP repayment, and for equity and
certain long-term debt issuances, which take place at the Citigroup corporate
level.  Generally, Citi’s management of funding and liquidity is designed
to optimize availability of funds as needed within Citi’s legal and regulatory
structure. Various constraints limit certain subsidiaries’ ability to pay
dividends or otherwise make funds available.  Consistent with these
constraints, Citigroup’s primary objectives for funding and liquidity management
are established by entity and in aggregate across three main operating entities,
as follows:  (i) Citigroup, as the parent holding company; (ii) banking
subsidiaries; and (iii) non-banking
subsidiaries.

Citigroup sources of funding include deposits,
collateralized financing transactions and a variety of unsecured short- and
long-term instruments, including federal funds purchased, commercial paper,
long-term debt, trust preferred securities, preferred stock and common
stock.

As a result of continued deleveraging, growth
in deposits, term securitization under government and non-government programs,
the issuance of long-term debt under the FDIC’s Temporary Liquidity Guarantee
Program (TLGP) and the issuance of non-guaranteed debt (particularly during the
latter part of 2009), Citigroup substantially increased its balances of cash and
highly liquid securities and reduced its short-term borrowings during
2009.

Citi has focused on growing a geographically diverse retail and corporate
deposit base that stood at approximately $836 billion as of December 31, 2009,
up $62 billion compared to December 31, 2008. On a volume basis, deposit
increases occurred in

Regional
Consumer Banking

, particularly in

North America

, and in

Transaction Services

due to
growth in all regions and strength in Treasury and Trade Solutions. Excluding
the impact of foreign exchange, Citi’s deposit base has increased sequentially
over each of the last six quarters. The deposits are diversified across products
and regions, with approximately 64% outside of the U.S.  This
diversification provides Citi with an important and low-cost source of funding.
A significant portion of these deposits has been, and is currently expected to
be, long-term and stable and is considered to be core. During 2010, although our
deposit balances may be subject to seasonal fluctuations, we anticipate pursuing
modest deposit growth while concentrating on widening spreads

.

At December 31, 2009, long-term debt and commercial paper outstanding for
Citigroup, Citigroup Global Market Holdings Inc. (CGMHI), Citigroup Funding Inc.
(CFI) and other Citigroup subsidiaries, collectively, were as

See Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further detail
on Citigroup’s and its affiliates’ long-term debt and commercial paper
outstanding. Commercial paper outstanding as of December 31, 2009 has decreased
from $29 billion as of December 31, 2008 to $10 billion. In 2010, commercial
paper is expected to continue to be an important source of funding for Citi,
maintained at approximately the $10 billion level.

The TLGP expired on October 31, 2009 and Citigroup and its affiliates
elected not to participate in any FDIC-approved extension of the program. In
addition, as of the end of 2009, Citigroup had substantially eliminated
 utilization of short-term government funding
programs.


In addition to growing its deposit base and engaging in long-term debt
funding, Citi has been actively building its structural liquidity by reducing
total assets. Total assets as of December 31, 2009 have declined 4% as compared
to December 31, 2008. Loans (net of allowance), which are one of Citi’s most
illiquid assets, are down $109 billion, or approximately 15%. Deposits as a
percentage of loans have increased to 150% as of December 31, 2009 from 116% as
of December 31, 2008. Structural liquidity, defined as the

sum of deposits,
long-term debt and stockholders’ equity as a percentage of total assets, has
increased steadily through 2008

and 2009 and was 73% at December 31, 2009, as compared with 66% at
December 31, 2008.

As noted in the table above,
Citigroup’s aggregate liquidity resources totaled $315.5 billion as of December
31, 2009, compared with $200.3 billion as of December 31, 2008.  As of
December 31, 2009, Citigroup’s and its affiliates’ liquidity portfolio and
broker-dealer “cash box” totaled $86.8 billion as compared with $72.0 billion at
December 31, 2008. This includes the liquidity portfolio and cash box held in
the U.S. as well as government bonds held by Citigroup’s broker-dealer entities
in the United Kingdom and Japan. Further, at December 31, 2009, Citigroup’s bank
subsidiaries had an aggregate of approximately $105.1 billion of cash on deposit
with major Central Banks (including the U.S. Federal Reserve Bank of New York,
the European Central Bank, Bank of England, Swiss National Bank, Bank of Japan,
the Monetary Authority of Singapore, and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority),
compared with approximately $74.5 billion at December 31, 2008. Citigroup’s bank
subsidiaries also have significant additional liquidity resources through
unencumbered highly liquid securities available for secured funding through
private markets or that are, or could be, pledged to the major Central Banks and
the U.S. Federal Home Loan Banks.  The value of these liquid securities was
$123.6 billion at December 31, 2009 compared with $53.8 billion at December 31,
2008. Significant amounts of cash and liquid securities are also available in
other Citigroup entities.

Consistent with the strategic reconfiguration
of Citi’s balance sheet, the build-up of liquidity resources and the shift in
focus on increasing structural liabilities, Citigroup entered 2010 with much of
its required long-term debt funding already in place. As a consequence, it is
currently expected that the direct long-term funding requirements for Citigroup
and CFI in 2010 will be $15 billion, which is well below the $39 billion of
expected maturities.

Banking Subsidiaries—Constraints on Supplying
Funds

There are various
legal and regulatory limitations on the ability of Citigroup’s subsidiary
depository institutions to pay dividends, extend credit or otherwise supply
funds to Citigroup and its non-bank subsidiaries. In determining the declaration
of dividends, each depository institution must also consider its effect on
applicable risk-based capital and leverage ratio requirements, as well as policy
statements of the federal regulatory agencies that indicate that banking
organizations should generally pay dividends out of current operating earnings.
Citigroup did not receive any dividends from its banking subsidiaries during
2009.

Some of Citigroup’s non-bank subsidiaries have credit facilities with
Citigroup’s subsidiary depository institutions, including Citibank, N.A.
Borrowings under these facilities must be secured in accordance with Section 23A
of the Federal Reserve Act. There are various legal restrictions on the extent
to which Citi’s subsidiary depository institutions can lend or extend credit to
or engage in certain other transactions with Citigroup and certain of its
non-bank subsidiaries. In general, transactions must be on arm’s-length terms
and be secured by designated amounts of specified collateral. See Note 20 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements.

Management of Liquidity

Management of liquidity at Citigroup is the
responsibility of the Treasurer. Citigroup runs a centralized treasury model
where the overall balance sheet is managed by Citigroup Treasury through Global
Franchise Treasurers and Regional Treasurers.  Day-to-day liquidity and
funding are managed by treasurers at the country and business level and are
monitored by Corporate Treasury and independent risk management.

A uniform liquidity risk management policy exists for Citigroup, its
consolidated subsidiaries and managed affiliates. Under this policy, there is a
single set of standards for the measurement of liquidity risk in order to ensure
consistency across businesses, stability in methodologies, transparency of risk,
and establishment of appropriate risk appetite.


Liquidity management is overseen by the Board of Directors through its
Risk Management and Finance Committee and by senior management through
Citigroup’s Finance and Asset and Liability Committee (FinALCO). One of the
objectives of the Risk Management and Finance Committee of Citigroup’s Board of
Directors as well as the FinALCO is to monitor and review overall liquidity
policies and practices as well as the liquidity and balance sheet positions of
Citigroup and its principal subsidiaries. Additionally, oversight of liquidity
is provided by Citigroup’s Global Asset and Liability Committee. Asset and
Liability Committees are also established for each region, country and/or major
line of business.

MONITORING LIQUIDITY

Funding and Liquidity Plans

Each principal operating subsidiary and/or
country must prepare a Funding and Liquidity Plan for approval by the Treasurer
and independent risk management. For significant entities, as defined by balance
sheet size and the liquidity risk position, the Funding and Liquidity Plan is
prepared and approved on an annual basis. The Funding and Liquidity Plan
addresses strategic liquidity issues and establishes the parameters for
identifying, measuring, monitoring and limiting liquidity risk and sets forth
key assumptions for liquidity risk management. The Funding and Liquidity Plan
includes analysis of the balance sheet, as well as the economic and business
conditions impacting, or potentially impacting, the liquidity of the major
operating subsidiary and/or country. As part of the Funding and Liquidity Plan,
liquidity limits, liquidity ratios, market triggers, and assumptions for
periodic stress tests are established and approved.

Risk Tolerance

Citigroup establishes its key risk tolerances
based on stress tests and a cash capital ratio (as described in “Liquidity
Ratios” below). This framework requires that entities be self-sufficient or net
providers of liquidity in their designated stress tests and have excess cash
capital. Aggregate self sufficiency targets have been established for the
banking subsidiaries, Citigroup, the parent holding company, and CGMHI as well
as for individual entities as part of their Funding and Liquidity Plans. In
addition, an important benchmark for the combined Citigroup, the parent
holding company, and CGMHI is to maintain sufficient liquidity to meet all
maturing obligations for a one-year period without access to the unsecured
wholesale markets.

Within this context, there are a
series of tools used to monitor Citigroup’s liquidity position.  These
include liquidity gaps and associated limits, liquidity ratios, stress testing
and market triggers, as described below.

Liquidity Gaps and Limits

Citigroup uses a monitoring tool that measures
potential funding gaps over various time horizons in a standard operating
environment. The gap for any given funding need represents the potential market
access required, or placements to the market (internal or external) over
designated tenors. Limits establish risk appetite for potential market access in
standard operating conditions and are monitored against the liquidity position
on a daily basis. Limits are established based on evaluation of available
contingent actions and liquidity vulnerabilities under designated stress
scenarios. While the contingent capacity places a cap on the limits, the limits
are also evaluated based on the structural liquidity of the balance sheet,
stability of liabilities, liquidity of assets, depth of markets, the experience
of management, size of the balance sheet, historical utilization, and an
evaluation of expected business and funding strategy. Limits are established
such that in stress scenarios, entities are self-funded or net providers of
liquidity. Thus, the risk tolerance for liquidity funding gaps is limited based
on the capacity to cover the position in a stressed environment. These limits
are the key daily risk-management tool for Citigroup, the parent holding
company, and its banking subsidiaries.

Liquidity Ratios

A series of standard corporate-wide liquidity
ratios has been established to monitor the structural elements of Citigroup’s
liquidity. One of the key structural liquidity measures is the cash capital
ratio. Cash capital is a broader measure of the ability to fund the structurally
illiquid portion of Citigroup’s balance sheet than traditional measures such as
deposits to loans or core deposits to loans.  Cash capital measures the
amount of long-term funding (>1 year) available to fund illiquid
assets.  Long-term funding includes core customer deposits, long-term debt
and equity. Illiquid assets include loans (net of liquidity adjustments),
illiquid securities, securities haircuts and other assets (i.e., goodwill,
intangibles, fixed assets, receivables, etc.).  Cash capital targets are
established for Citigroup, the parent holding company, CGMHI
and Citigroup’s aggregate banking subsidiaries.  In addition, each
entity is required to calculate a cash capital ratio on a monthly basis.
Benchmarks must be established and approved for the cash capital ratio as part
of the entities’ Funding and Liquidity plan.  At December 31, 2009, the
combined Citigroup, the parent holding company, and CGMHI, as well as the
aggregate banking subsidiaries had an excess of cash capital. In addition, as of
December 31, 2009 the combined Citigroup, the parent holding company, and CGMHI
maintained liquidity to meet all maturing obligations significantly in excess
of  a one-year period without access to the unsecured wholesale
markets.


Stress Testing

Simulated liquidity stress testing is
periodically performed for each major operating subsidiary and/or country.
Stress testing / scenario analyses are intended to quantify the likely impact of
an event on the balance sheet and liquidity position and to identify viable
funding alternatives that can be utilized in a liquidity event. A variety of
firm-specific and market-related scenarios are used at the consolidated level
and in individual countries.

These scenarios include assumptions about significant changes in key
funding sources, credit ratings, contingent uses of funding, and political and
economic conditions in certain countries. The results of stress tests of
individual countries and operating subsidiaries are reviewed to ensure that each
individual major operating subsidiary or country is either self-funded or a net
provider of liquidity. In addition, a Contingency Funding Plan is prepared on a
periodic basis for Citigroup. The plan includes detailed policies, procedures,
roles and responsibilities, and the results of corporate stress tests. The
product of these stress tests is a series of alternatives that can be used by
the Treasurer in a liquidity
event.

As a result of the recent financial crisis, Citigroup increased the
frequency, duration, and severity of certain stress testing, particularly
related to the interconnection of idiosyncratic and systemic risk. Citigroup,
the parent holding company,  CGMHI and Citigroup’s largest bank entities
perform their key stress tests at a minimum on a monthly basis. In addition, in
conformity with recommendations made by the Credit Risk Management Policy Group,
Citigroup calculates a stressed 30-day maximum cash outflow compared with its
liquidity resources for some of its key operating entities. This 30-day maximum
cash outflow is performed on a daily basis.  For other entities, stress
testing is performed at a minimum on a quarterly basis.

Market Triggers

Market triggers are internal or external
market or economic factors that may imply a change to market liquidity or
Citigroup’s access to the markets.  Citigroup market triggers are
monitored by the Treasurer and the head of risk architecture and are
presented to the FinALCO.

Appropriate market triggers are also
established and monitored for each major operating subsidiary and/or
country.  Local triggers are reviewed with the local country or business
Asset and Liability Committee and independent risk management.

Credit Ratings

Citigroup’s
ability to access the capital markets and other sources of funds, as well as the
cost of these funds and its ability to maintain certain deposits, is dependent
on its credit ratings. The table below indicates the current ratings for
Citigroup.

As a result of the Citigroup
guarantee, changes in ratings for Citigroup Funding Inc. are the same as those
of Citigroup noted above.

On February 9, 2010, S&P
affirmed the counterparty credit and debt ratings of Citi. At the same time,
S&P revised its outlook on Citi to negative from stable. This action was the
result of S&P’s view that there is increased uncertainty about the U.S.
government’s willingness to provide extraordinary support to a number of
systematically important financial institutions. Outlooks from both Moody’s and
Fitch remained stable.

Ratings downgrades by Fitch Ratings, Moody’s Investors Service or
Standard & Poor’s have had and could continue to have material impacts on
funding and liquidity, and could also have further explicit material impact on
liquidity due to collateral triggers and other cash requirements. Because of the
current credit ratings of Citigroup Inc., a one-notch downgrade of

its senior debt/long-term rating could impact Citigroup Inc.’s commercial
paper/short-term rating. As of December 31, 2009, a one-notch downgrade of the
senior debt/long-term rating of Citigroup Inc., accompanied by a one-notch
downgrade of Citigroup Inc.’s commercial paper/short-term rating, would result
in an approximate $4.2 billion funding requirement in the form of collateral and
cash obligations. Further, as of December 31, 2009, a one-notch downgrade of the
senior debt/long-term ratings of Citibank, N.A. would result in an approximate
$4.2 billion funding requirement in the form of collateral and cash obligations.
Because of the current credit ratings of Citibank, N.A., a one-notch downgrade
of its senior debt/long-term rating is unlikely to have any impact on its
commercial paper/short-term rating.


OFF-BALANCE-SHEET
ARRANGEMENTS

Citigroup and its
subsidiaries are involved with several types of off-balance-sheet arrangements,
including special purpose entities (SPEs), primarily in connection with
securitization activities in

Regional Consumer Banking

and

Institutional Clients
Group

. Citigroup and its
subsidiaries use SPEs principally to obtain liquidity and favorable capital
treatment by securitizing certain of Citigroup’s financial assets, assisting
clients in securitizing their financial assets and creating investment products
for clients. For further

information on Citi’s
securitization activities and involvement in SPEs,

see Note 23 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and “Significant
Accounting Policies and Significant
Estimates—Securitizations.”

The following tables describe
certain characteristics of assets owned by certain identified significant
unconsolidated variable interest entities (VIEs) as of December 31, 2009. These

and Note 1 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of SFAS Nos. 166 and 167,
effective in the first quarter of 2010, and their impact on Citi.


CONTRACTUAL
OBLIGATIONS

The following table
includes aggregated information about Citigroup’s contractual obligations that
impact its short- and long-term liquidity and capital needs. The table includes
information about payments due under specified contractual obligations,
aggregated by type of contractual obligation. It includes the maturity profile
of Citigroup’s consolidated long-term debt, leases and other long-term
liabilities.

Citigroup’s contractual obligations include
purchase obligations that are enforceable and legally binding for Citi. For the
purposes of the table below, purchase obligations are included through the
termination date of the respective agreements, even if the contract is
renewable. Many of the purchase agreements for goods or services include clauses
that would allow Citigroup to cancel the agreement with specified notice;
however, that impact is not included in the table (unless Citigroup has already
notified the counterparty of its intention to terminate the
agreement).

Other liabilities reflected on Citigroup’s
Consolidated Balance Sheet include obligations for goods and services that have
already been received, uncertain tax positions, as well as other long-term
liabilities that have been incurred and will ultimately be paid in
cash.

Excluded from the following table are obligations that are generally
short-term in nature, including deposit liabilities and securities sold under

agreements to repurchase. The table also excludes certain
insurance and

investment contracts
subject to mortality and morbidity risks or without defined maturities, such
that the timing of payments and withdrawals is uncertain. The liabilities
related to these insurance and investment contracts are included on the
Consolidated Balance Sheet as Insurance Policy and Claims Reserves,
Contractholder Funds, and Separate and Variable Accounts.

Citigroup’s funding policy for pension plans is generally to fund to the
minimum amounts required by the applicable laws and regulations. At December 31,
2009, there were no minimum required contributions, and no contributions are
currently planned for the U.S. pension plans. Accordingly, no amounts have been
included in the table below for future contributions to the U.S. pension plans.
For the non-U.S. pension plans, discretionary contributions in 2010 are
anticipated to be approximately $160 million. The anticipated cash contributions
in 2010 related to the non-U.S. postretirement benefit plans are $72
million. These amounts are included in the purchase obligations in the table
below. The estimated pension and postretirement plan contributions are subject
to change, since contribution decisions are affected by various factors, such as
market performance, regulatory and legal requirements, and management’s ability
to change funding policy. For additional information regarding Citi’s retirement
benefit obligations, see Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
