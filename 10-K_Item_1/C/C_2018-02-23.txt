Item 1. Business

OVERVIEW

Citigroup’s history dates back to the founding of the City

Bank of New York in 1812.

Citigroup is a global diversified financial services holding company whose businesses provide consumers, corporations, governments and institutions with a broad, yet focused, range of financial products and services, including consumer banking and credit, corporate and investment banking, securities brokerage, trade and securities services and wealth management. Citi has approximately 200 million customer accounts and does business in more than 160 countries and jurisdictions.

At December 31,


, Citi had approximately 209,000 full-time employees, compared to approximately 219,000 full-time employees at December 31,

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION

AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

As described further throughout this Executive Summary, Citi reported balanced operating results for full-year 2017, reflecting continued momentum across businesses and geographies, notably many of those where Citi has been making investments.

During 2017, Citi had revenue and loan growth and positive operating leverage as well as operating margin expansion in the

Institutional Clients Group (ICG)

and every region in

Global Consumer Banking (GCB).

Citi also continued to demonstrate strong expense discipline, resulting in an operating efficiency ratio of 58% in 2017.

Results in 2017 also included an updated estimate for a one-time, non-cash charge of $22.6 billion related to the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (Tax Reform), which impacted the tax line within

Corporate/Other

, as well as the tax lines in

North America GCB

and

ICG

(for additional information on this updated estimate, see “Impact of Tax Reform” below).

In 2017, Citi increased the amount of capital returned to shareholders, while each of its key regulatory capital metrics remained strong (see “Capital” below). During the year, Citi returned approximately $17.1 billion in the form of common stock repurchases and dividends and repurchased approximately 214 million common shares as outstanding common shares declined 7% from the prior year.

Going into 2018, while economic sentiment has improved and the macroeconomic environment remains largely positive, there continue to be various economic, political and other risks and uncertainties that could impact Citi’s businesses and future results. For a more detailed discussion of the risks and uncertainties that could impact Citi’s businesses, results of operations and financial condition during 2018, see each respective business’s results of operations, “Risk Factors” and “Managing Global Risk” below. Despite these risks and uncertainties, Citi intends to continue to build on the progress made during 2017 with a focus on further optimizing its performance to benefit shareholders.

2017 Summary Results

Citigroup

Citigroup reported a net loss of $6.8 billion, or $2.98 per share, compared to net income of $14.9 billion, or $4.72 per share, in the prior year. Excluding the impact of Tax Reform, Citigroup net income of $15.8 billion increased 6% compared to the prior year, reflecting higher revenues, partially offset by higher cost of credit, while earnings per share increased 13%, including the impact of a 7% reduction in average shares outstanding. (Citi’s results of operations excluding the impact of Tax Reform are non-GAAP financial measures. Citi believes the presentation of its results of operations excluding the impact of Tax Reform provides a meaningful depiction for investors of the underlying fundamentals of its businesses.) For additional information regarding the impact of Tax Reform, see “Impact of Tax Reform,” “Risk Factors,”

“Significant Accounting Policies and Significant Estimates—Income Taxes” below and Notes 1 and 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Citigroup revenues of $71.4 billion in 2017 increased 2%, driven by 6% aggregate growth in

ICG

and

GCB

, partially offset by a 40% decrease in

Corporate/Other

, primarily due to the continued wind-down of legacy assets.

Citigroup’s end-of-period loans increased 7% to $667 billion versus the prior-year period. Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation in U.S. dollars for reporting purposes (FX translation), Citigroup’s end-of-period loans grew 5%, as 9% growth in

ICG

and 4% growth in

GCB

was partially offset by the continued wind-down of legacy assets in

Corporate/Other

(Citi’s results of operations excluding the impact of FX translation are non-GAAP financial measures. Citi believes the presentation of its results of operations excluding the impact of FX translation provides a meaningful depiction for investors of the underlying fundamentals of its businesses). Citigroup’s end-of-period deposits increased 3% to $960 billion versus the prior year. Excluding the impact of FX translation, Citigroup’s deposits were up 1%, as a 2% increase in

ICG

deposits was partially offset by a decline in

Corporate/ Other

deposits, and

GCB

deposits were largely unchanged.

Expenses

Citigroup operating expenses were largely unchanged versus the prior year, as the impact of higher volume-related expenses and ongoing investments were offset by efficiency savings and the wind-down of legacy assets. Year-over-year,

ICG

operating expenses were up 3% and

GCB

operating expenses increased 2%, while

Corporate/Other

operating expenses declined 24%, all versus the prior year.

Cost of Credit

Citi’s total provisions for credit losses and for benefits and claims of $7.5 billion increased 7% from the prior year. The increase was mostly driven by a $515 million increase in net credit losses, primarily in

North America GCB

, partially offset by a lower provision for benefits and claims due to continued legacy asset divestitures within

Corporate/Other

. The net loan loss reserve build of $266 million compared to a net loan loss reserve build of $217 million in the prior year. The increase was mostly due to volume growth and seasoning, as well as the impact of loan loss reserve builds related to forward-looking net credit loss expectations, all in the

North America

cards portfolios, partially offset by a higher net reserve release in

ICG

.

Net credit losses of $7.1 billion increased 8% versus the prior year. Consumer net credit losses increased 11% to

$6.7 billion, mostly reflecting volume growth and seasoning in the

North America

cards portfolios and the impact of acquiring the Costco portfolio. The increase in consumer net credit losses was partially offset by the continued wind-down of legacy assets in

Corporate/Other

. Corporate net credit losses


decreased 26% to $379 million, largely driven by improvement in the energy sector.

For additional information on Citi’s consumer and corporate credit costs and allowance for loan losses, see each respective business’s results of operations and “Credit Risk” below.

Capital

Citigroup’s Common Equity Tier 1 Capital and Tier 1 Capital ratios, on a fully implemented basis, were 12.4% and 14.1% as of December 31, 2017 (based on the Basel III Standardized Approach for determining risk-weighted assets), respectively, compared to 12.6% and 14.2% as of December 31, 2016 (based on the Basel III Advanced Approaches for determining risk-weighted assets). The decline in regulatory capital reflected the return of capital to common shareholders and an approximately $6 billion reduction in Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) Capital due to the impact of Tax Reform, partially offset by earnings growth. Citigroup’s Supplementary Leverage ratio as of December 31, 2017, on a fully implemented basis, was 6.7%, compared to 7.2% as of December 31, 2016. For additional information on Citi’s capital ratios and related components, including the impact of Tax Reform on its capital ratios, see “Capital Resources” below.

Global Consumer Banking

GCB

net income decreased 21%. Excluding the impact of Tax Reform,

GCB

net income decreased 6%, as higher revenues were more than offset by higher expenses and higher cost of credit. Operating expenses were $17.8 billion, up 2%, as higher volume-related expenses and continued investments were partially offset by efficiency savings.

GCB

revenues of $32.7 billion increased 4% versus the prior year, driven by growth across all regions.

North America GCB

revenues increased 3% to $20.3 billion, driven by higher revenues across all businesses. Citi-branded cards revenues of $8.6 billion were up 5% versus the prior year, mostly reflecting the addition of the Costco portfolio as well as modest growth in interest-earning balances, partially offset by the continued run-off of non-core portfolios as well as a higher cost to fund growth in transactor and promotional balances, given higher interest rates. Citi retail services revenues of $6.4 billion increased 1% versus the prior year, as continued loan growth was partially offset by the impact of the renewal and extension of certain partnerships, as well as the absence of gains on sales of two cards portfolios in 2016. Retail banking revenues increased 1% from the prior year to $5.3 billion. Excluding mortgage revenues, retail banking revenues of $4.5 billion were up 9% from the prior year, driven by continued growth in loans and assets under management, as well as a benefit from higher interest rates.

North America GCB

average deposits of $184 billion increased 1% year-over-year, average retail loans of $56 billion grew 3% and assets under management of $60 billion grew 14%. Average Citi-branded card loans of $85 billion increased 15%, while Citi-branded card purchase sales of $320 billion increased 28% versus the prior year. Average Citi retail services loans of $46 billion increased 4% versus the prior

year, while retail services purchase sales of $81 billion were up 2%. For additional information on the results of operations of

North America GCB

Global Consumer Banking—North America GCB

” below.

International

GCB

revenues (consisting of

Latin America GCB

and

Asia GCB

(which includes the results of operations in certain

EMEA

countries)) increased 6% versus the prior year to $12.4 billion. Excluding the impact of FX translation, international

GCB

revenues increased 5% versus the prior year.

Latin America GCB

revenues increased 6% versus the prior year

,

driven by growth in loans and deposits, as well as improved deposit spreads.

Asia GCB

revenues increased 5% (4% excluding modest gains on the sales of merchant acquiring businesses in the second and fourth quarters of 2017) versus the prior year, primarily reflecting an increase in cards revenues and wealth management revenues, partially offset by lower retail lending revenues. For additional information on the results of operations of

Latin America GCB

and

Asia GCB

for 2017, including the impact of FX translation,

see “

Global Consumer Banking—Latin America GCB

” and “

” below.

Year-over-year, international

GCB

average deposits of $122 billion increased 5%, average retail loans of $87 billion were largely unchanged, assets under management of $101 billion increased 14%, average card loans of $24 billion increased 5% and card purchase sales of $98 billion increased 7%, all excluding the impact of FX translation.

Institutional Clients Group

ICG

net income

decreased 5%. Excluding the impact of Tax Reform,

ICG

net income increased 16%, driven by higher revenues and a small benefit to cost of credit (compared to a $486 million cost of credit in the prior year), partially offset by higher operating expenses.

ICG

operating expenses increased 3% to $19.6 billion, as higher compensation, investments and volume-related expenses were partially offset by efficiency savings.

ICG

revenues were $35.7 billion in 2017, up 7% from the prior year, primarily driven by a 16% increase in

Banking

revenues.

Markets and securities services

were largely unchanged versus the prior year. The increase in

Banking

revenues included the impact of $133 million of losses on loan hedges within corporate lending, compared to losses of $594 million in the prior year.

Banking

revenues of $18.7 billion (excluding the impact of losses on loan hedges within corporate lending) increased 12%, driven by solid growth across all products. Investment banking revenues of $5.2 billion increased 20% versus the prior year, reflecting wallet share gains across all products. Advisory revenues increased 11% to $1.1 billion, equity underwriting revenues increased 68% to $1.1 billion and debt underwriting revenues increased 13% to $3.0 billion, all versus the prior year.

Private bank revenues increased 14% from the prior year, driven by growth in clients, loans, investments and deposits, as well as improved spreads. Corporate lending revenues increased 59% to $1.8 billion. Excluding the impact of losses on loan hedges, corporate lending revenues increased 12% versus the prior year, primarily driven by lower hedging costs,


as well as the prior-year adjustment to the residual value of a lease financing. Treasury and trade solutions revenues of $8.5 billion increased 7% versus the prior year, reflecting volume growth and improved spreads, with balanced growth across net interest and fee income.

Markets and securities services

revenues of $17.1 billion were largely unchanged from the prior year, as a decline in fixed income markets and equity markets revenues was offset by an increase in securities services revenues as well as a $580 million gain on the sale of a fixed income analytics business. Fixed income markets revenues of $12.1 billion decreased 6% from the prior year, reflecting low volatility, as well as the comparison to higher revenues from a more robust trading environment in the prior year following the vote in the U.K. in favor of its withdrawal from the European Union, as well as the U.S. election. Equity markets revenues of $2.7 billion decreased 2% from the prior year, driven by an episodic loss in derivatives of roughly $130 million related to a single client event. Excluding this item, equity markets revenues increased 2% from the prior year, driven by growth in client balances and higher investor client revenue. Securities services revenues of $2.3 billion increased 8%, driven by growth in client volumes and higher interest revenue. For additional information on the results of operations of

ICG

for 2017, see “

Institutional Clients Group

” below.

Corporate/Other

Corporate/Other

net loss was $19.7 billion in 2017, compared to net income of $498 million in the prior year. Excluding the impact of Tax Reform,

Corporate/Other

net income declined 69% to $153 million, reflecting lower revenues, partially offset by lower operating expenses and lower cost of credit. Operating expenses of $3.8 billion declined 24% from the prior-year period, reflecting the wind-down of legacy assets and lower legal expenses.

Corporate/Other

revenues were $3.1 billion, down 40% from the prior year, primarily reflecting the wind-down of legacy assets as well as the absence of gains related to debt buybacks in 2016.

Corporate/Other

end-of-period assets of $77 billion decreased 25% from the prior year, reflecting the continued wind-down of legacy assets as well as the impact of Tax Reform, which reduced assets by approximately $20 billion. For additional information on the results of operations of

Corporate/Other

for 2017, see “

Corporate/Other

” below.


Impact of Tax Reform

Citi’s full-year 2017 results included the updated estimate for a one-time, non-cash charge of $22.6 billion, recorded within

Corporate/Other

,

North America GCB

and

ICG

related to the enactment of Tax Reform, which was signed into law on December 22, 2017. This updated estimate resulted in a downward adjustment to fourth-quarter and full-year 2017 financial results, as well as changes in the segments where the impact was recorded (previously, the entire charge was recorded in

Corporate/Other

), from those reported on January 16, 2018, by an aggregate of $594 million due to refinements of original estimates. The approximate $6 billion reduction in CET1 Capital due to the impact of Tax Reform was unchanged.

This charge was composed of a $12.4 billion remeasurement of Citi’s deferred tax assets (DTAs) due to the reduction to the U.S. corporate tax rate and the change to a quasi-territorial tax system (see “Significant Accounting Policies and Estimates—Income Taxes” below), a $7.9 billion valuation allowance against Citi’s foreign tax credit (FTC) carry-forwards and its U.S. residual DTAs related to its non-U.S. branches, and a $2.3 billion reduction in Citi’s FTC carry-forwards related to the deemed repatriation of undistributed earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries.

The financial results in the table below disclose the as-reported GAAP results for 2017 and 2016, the impact of Tax Reform and the 2017 adjusted results excluding the impact of Tax Reform. The charge related to Tax Reform is reflected in Citi’s results throughout this Annual Report on Form 10-K, unless otherwise noted.

The final impact of Tax Reform may differ from the estimate due to, among other things, changes in assumptions

made by Citigroup and additional guidance that may be issued by the U.S. Department of the Treasury. For more information on possible changes to the estimated impact related to Tax Reform, see “Risk Factors—Strategic Risks” below and Notes 1 and 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Latin America

(consisting of Citi’s consumer banking business in Mexico) and

Asia

.

GCB

provides traditional banking services to retail customers through retail banking, including commercial banking, and Citi-branded cards and Citi retail services (for additional information on these businesses, see “Citigroup Segments” above).

GCB

is focused on its priority markets in the U.S., Mexico and

Asia

with 2,451 branches in 19 countries and jurisdictions as of December 31, 2017. At December 31, 2017,

GCB

had approximately $429 billion in assets and $307 billion in deposits.

GCB

’s overall strategy is to leverage Citi’s global footprint and be the pre-eminent bank for the emerging affluent and affluent consumers in large urban centers. In credit cards and in certain retail markets, Citi serves customers in a somewhat broader set of segments and geographies.

NORTH AMERICA GCB

North America GCB

provides traditional retail banking, including commercial banking, Citi-branded cards products and Citi retail services card products to retail customers and small to mid-size businesses, as applicable, in the U.S.

North America GCB

’s U.S. cards product portfolio includes its proprietary portfolio (including the Citi Double Cash, Thank You and Value cards) and co-branded cards (including, among others, American Airlines and Costco) within Citi-branded cards as well as its co-brand and private label relationships (including, among others, Sears, The Home Depot, Best Buy and Macy’s) within Citi retail services.

As previously announced, the Hilton Honors co-brand credit card partnership with Citi was scheduled to terminate as of year-end 2017. On October 23, 2017, Citi signed an agreement to sell the Hilton credit card portfolio (approximately $1.1 billion in outstanding loan balances in Citi-branded cards as of December 31, 2017) to American Express. In connection with the sale agreement, the existing partnership was extended through the closing date. The sale was completed on January 30, 2018, resulting in a pretax gain of approximately $150 million, which approximates one year of revenues from the portfolio. The sale will impact

North America GCB

’s quarterly comparisons in 2018.

As of December 31, 2017,

North America GCB

’s 694 retail bank branches are concentrated in the six key metropolitan areas of New York, Chicago, Miami, Washington, D.C., Los Angeles and San Francisco. Also as of December 31, 2017,

North America GCB

had approximately 9.2 million retail banking customer accounts, $56.0 billion in retail banking loans and $182.5 billion in deposits. In addition,

North America GCB

had approximately 121 million Citi-branded and Citi retail services credit card accounts with $139.7 billion in outstanding card loan balances.

vs.


Net income

decreased 37% and was impacted by an estimated $750 million non-cash charge recorded in the tax line due to the impact of Tax Reform (for additional information, see “Impact of Tax Reform” above). Excluding the impact of Tax Reform, net income decreased 14% due to higher cost of credit and slightly higher expenses, partially offset by higher revenues.

Revenues

increased 3%, driven by higher revenues across all businesses.

Retail banking revenues increased 1%. Excluding the decline in mortgage revenues (down of 32%), retail banking revenues were up 9%, driven by growth in checking deposits, continued growth in loans (average loans up 3%) and assets under management (up 14%) and increased commercial banking activity, as well as a benefit from higher interest rates. The decline in mortgage revenues was driven by lower origination activity and higher cost of funds, reflecting the higher interest rate environment, as well as the impact of the previously announced sale of a portion of Citi’s mortgage servicing rights.

Cards revenues increased 3%. In Citi-branded cards, revenues increased 5%, primarily reflecting the acquisition of the Costco portfolio (completed June 17, 2016), as well as modest growth in interest-earning balances, partially offset by the continued run-off of non-core portfolios and the higher cost to fund growth in transactor and promotional balances, given the higher interest rates. Average loans grew 15% and purchase sales grew 28%.

North America GCB

expects that additional terms in certain partnership contracts that go into effect in 2018 will negatively impact Citi-branded cards revenues going forward.

Citi retail services revenues increased 1%, as continued loan growth was partially offset by the impact of the previously disclosed renewal and extension of certain partnerships within the portfolio, as well as the absence of gains on sales of two cards portfolios in 2016. Average loans grew 4% and purchase sales grew 2%.

Expenses

increased 1%, driven by the addition of the Costco portfolio, higher volume-related expenses and investments, partially offset by efficiency savings.

Also included in expenses is an $80 million provision for remediation costs related to a Credit Card Accountability Responsibility and Disclosure Act (CARD Act) matter (for additional information, see “

Corporate/Other

” below and Note 27 to the Consolidated Financial Statements).

Provisions

increased 24% from the prior year, driven by higher net credit losses and a higher net loan loss reserve build.

Net credit losses increased 22% to $4.8 billion, largely driven by higher net credit losses in Citi-branded cards (up 28% to $2.4 billion) and Citi retail services (up 19% to $2.2 billion). The increase in net credit losses primarily reflected volume growth and seasoning in both cards portfolios, as well as the impact of acquiring the Costco portfolio in Citi-branded cards.

The net loan loss reserve build in 2017 was $873 million (compared to a build of $659 million in the prior year), driven by volume growth and seasoning in both cards portfolios, as

well as the increase in net flow rates in later delinquency buckets leading to higher inherent credit loss expectations, primarily in Citi retail services.

For additional information on

North America GCB

’s retail banking portfolios, including commercial banking, and its Citi-branded cards and Citi retail services portfolios, see “Credit Risk—Consumer Credit” below.


vs.


Net income

decreased by 23% due to significantly higher cost of credit and higher expenses, partially offset by higher revenues.

Revenues

increased 1%, reflecting higher revenues in Citi-branded cards, partially offset by lower revenues in retail banking and Citi retail services. Retail banking revenues decreased 2%. Excluding the previously disclosed $110 million gain on sale of branches in Texas in the first quarter of 2015, retail banking revenues were largely unchanged, as lower mortgage revenues were offset by continued volume growth, including growth in average loans (9%) and average checking deposits (9%).

Cards revenues increased 2%. In Citi-branded cards, revenues increased 5%, primarily reflecting the acquisition of the Costco portfolio as well as volume growth, partially offset by higher investment-related acquisition and rewards costs and the impact of higher promotional balances. Citi retail services revenues decreased 1%, as the impact of the renewal and extension of several partnerships within the portfolio as well as the absence of revenues from portfolio exits were partially offset by modest growth in average loans.

Expenses

increased 7%, primarily due to the Costco acquisition, continued investment spending, volume growth, higher repositioning charges and regulatory and compliance costs, partially offset by ongoing efficiency savings and lower legal and related costs.

Provisions

increased 33%, driven by a net loan loss reserve build, compared to a loan loss reserve release in the prior year, and higher net credit losses. The net loan loss reserve build mostly reflected reserve builds in the cards portfolios and was primarily driven by the impact of the acquisition of the Costco portfolio, as well as volume growth and seasoning of the portfolios and the absence of nearly $400 million of reserve releases in 2015 as credit normalized. The reserve build was also due to the estimated impact of proposed regulatory guidelines on third-party debt collections.

The increase in net credit losses was driven by increases in cards and retail banking. In retail banking, net credit losses grew 37%, primarily due to an increase related to Citi’s energy and energy-related exposures within the commercial banking portfolio, which was largely offset by releases of previously established loan loss reserves. In Citi-branded cards, net credit losses increased 1%, driven by volume growth, including the impact of Costco beginning in the fourth quarter of 2016, seasoning and the impact of the regulatory changes on collections. In Citi retail services, net credit losses increased 6%, primarily due to portfolio growth and seasoning and the impact of the regulatory changes on collections.


LATIN AMERICA GCB

Latin America GCB

provides traditional retail banking, including commercial banking, and its Citi-branded card products to retail customers and small to mid-size businesses in Mexico through Citibanamex, one of Mexico’s largest banks.

At December 31, 2017,

Latin America GCB

had 1,479 retail branches in Mexico, with approximately 27.7 million retail banking customer accounts, $19.9 billion in retail banking loans and $27.1 billion in deposits. In addition, the business had approximately 5.6 million Citi-branded card accounts with $5.4 billion in outstanding loan balances.

On November 27, 2017, Citi entered into an agreement to sell its Mexico asset management business reported within

Latin America GCB

Retail banking revenues increased 8%, reflecting continued growth in volumes, including an increase in average deposits (8%), average loans (6%), reflecting growth across most portfolios, an increase in assets under management (6%), as well as improved deposit spreads, driven by higher interest rates. Cards revenues were largely unchanged, as continued improvement in full-rate revolving loans in the second half of 2017 was offset by a higher cost to fund non-revolving loans. Purchase sales grew 8% and average card loans grew 5%.

Expenses

increased 4%, as ongoing investment spending and business growth were partially offset by efficiency savings. Citi continues to execute on its investment plans for Citibanamex (totaling more than $1 billion through 2020), including initiatives to modernize the branch network, enhance digital capabilities and upgrade core operating platforms.

Provisions

increased 12%, primarily driven by higher net credit losses (8%) and a $42 million increase in the net loan loss reserve build, largely reflecting volume growth and seasoning. The increase in the loan loss reserve build was also driven by a Mexico earthquake-related loan loss reserve build in the third quarter of 2017 (approximately $25 million).

ASIA GCB

Asia GCB

provides traditional retail banking, including commercial banking, and its Citi-branded card products to retail customers and small to mid-size businesses, as applicable. As of December 31, 2017, Citi’s most significant revenues in the region were from Singapore, Hong Kong, Korea, Australia, India, Taiwan, Indonesia, Philippines, Thailand and Malaysia. Included within

Asia GCB

, traditional retail banking and Citi-branded card products are also provided to retail customers in certain

EMEA

countries, primarily in Poland, Russia and the United Arab Emirates.

At December 31, 2017, on a combined basis, the businesses had 278 retail branches, approximately 16.0 million retail banking customer accounts, $70.0 billion in retail banking loans and $97.7 billion in deposits. In addition, the businesses had approximately 16.4 million Citi-branded card accounts with $19.8 billion in outstanding loan balances.

Net income

increased 15%, reflecting higher revenues and lower cost of credit, partially offset by higher expenses.

Revenues

increased 5%, driven by improvement in cards and wealth management revenues, partially offset by continued lower retail lending revenues.

Retail banking revenues increased 3%, primarily due to the continued improvement in wealth management revenues, partially offset by the repositioning of the retail loan portfolio. Wealth management revenues increased due to improvement in investor sentiment, stronger equity markets and increases in assets under management (18%) and investment sales (38%). Average deposits increased 5%. The increase in revenues was partially offset by the lower retail lending revenues (down 4%), reflecting continued lower average loans (1%) due to the continued optimization of this portfolio away from lower yielding mortgage loans to focus on growing higher-return personal loans.

Cards revenues increased 8%, reflecting 5% growth in average loans and 7% growth in purchase sales, both of which benefited from the previously disclosed portfolio acquisition in Australia in 2017, as well as modest gains in 2017 related to sales of merchant acquiring businesses in certain countries.

Expenses

Retail banking revenues decreased 2%, mainly due to a 5% decrease in wealth management revenues due to lower client activity, modestly lower investment assets under management and a decline in average loans. The decline in revenues was partially offset by growth in deposit volumes and higher insurance revenues. Cards revenues increased 1%, driven by continued improvement in yields, modestly abating regulatory headwinds and modest volume growth due to continued stabilizing payment rates.

INSTITUTIONAL CLIENTS GROUP

Institutional Clients Group (ICG)

includes

Banking

and

Markets and securities services

(for additional information on these businesses, see “Citigroup Segments” above).

ICG

provides corporate, institutional, public sector and high-net-worth clients around the world with a full range of wholesale banking products and services, including fixed income and equity sales and trading, foreign exchange, prime brokerage, derivative services, equity and fixed income research, corporate lending, investment banking and advisory services, private banking, cash management, trade finance and securities services.

ICG

transacts with clients in both cash instruments and derivatives, including fixed income, foreign currency, equity and commodity products.

ICG

revenue is generated primarily from fees and spreads associated with these activities.

ICG

earns fee income for assisting clients in clearing transactions, providing brokerage and investment banking services and other such activities. Revenue generated from these activities is recorded in

Commissions and fees

and

Investment banking

. Revenue is also generated from transaction processing and assets under custody and administration. Revenue generated from these activities is primarily recorded in

Administration and other fiduciary fees

. In addition, as a market maker,

ICG

facilitates transactions, including holding product inventory to meet client demand, and earns the differential between the price at which it buys and sells the products. These price differentials and the unrealized gains and losses on the inventory are recorded in

Principal transactions

(for additional information on

Principal transactions

revenue, see Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements).

Other

primarily includes mark-to-market gains and losses on certain credit derivatives, gains and losses on available-for-sale (AFS) securities and other non-recurring gains and losses. Interest income earned on assets held, less interest paid to customers on deposits and long- and short-term debt, is recorded as

Net interest revenue

.

The amount and types of

Markets

revenues are impacted by a variety of interrelated factors, including market liquidity; changes in market variables such as interest rates, foreign exchange rates, equity prices, commodity prices and credit spreads, as well as their implied volatilities; investor confidence; and other macroeconomic conditions. Assuming all other market conditions do not change, increases in client activity levels or bid/offer spreads generally result in increases in revenues. However, changes in market conditions can significantly impact client activity levels, bid/offer spreads and the fair value of product inventory. For example, a decrease in market liquidity may increase bid/offer spreads, decrease client activity levels and widen credit spreads on product inventory positions.

ICG

’s management of the

Markets

businesses involves daily monitoring and evaluating of the above factors at the trading desk as well as the country level.

ICG

does not separately track the impact on total

Markets

revenues of the volume of transactions, bid/offer spreads, fair value changes of product inventory positions and economic hedges because, as noted above, these components are interrelated and are not deemed useful or necessary individually to manage the

Markets

businesses at an aggregate

level.

In the

Markets

businesses, client revenues are those revenues directly attributable to client transactions at the time of inception, including commissions, interest or fees earned. Client revenues do not include the results of client facilitation activities (for example, holding product inventory in anticipation of client demand) or the results of certain economic hedging activities.

ICG

’s international presence is supported by trading floors in approximately 80 countries and a proprietary network in 98 countries and jurisdictions. At December 31, 2017,

ICG

had approximately $1.3 trillion of assets and $640 billion of deposits, while two of its businesses—securities services and issuer services—managed approximately $17.4 trillion of assets under custody compared to $15.2 trillion at the end of the prior-year period.

Credit derivatives are used to economically hedge a portion of the corporate loan portfolio that includes both accrual loans and loans at fair value. Gains (losses) on loan hedges includes the mark-to-market on the credit derivatives and the mark-to-market on the loans in the portfolio that are at fair value. The fixed premium costs of these hedges are netted against the corporate lending revenues to reflect the cost of credit protection. Citigroup’s results of operations excluding the impact of gains (losses) on loan hedges are non-GAAP financial measures.

Treasury and trade solutions

revenues increased 7%, reflecting growth across all regions that was balanced across both net interest and fee income. The increase was primarily due to continued growth in transaction volumes with new and existing clients, continued growth in deposit balances and improved spreads in certain regions. The trade business experienced modest revenue growth, as continued focus on high-quality loan growth was largely offset by industry-wide tightening of spreads. Average deposit balances increased 4%, while average trade loans increased 5% (4% excluding the impact of FX translation).

Fixed income markets

revenues decreased 6%, with lower revenues in all regions, primarily due to low volatility as well as the comparison to higher revenues in the prior year from a more robust trading environment following the vote in the U.K. in favor of its withdrawal from the European Union, as well as the U.S. election. The decline in revenues was driven by lower net interest revenue (decreased 22%), largely due to higher funding costs and a change in the mix of trading positions in support of client activity. The decline was partially offset by higher principal transactions revenues and commissions and fees revenues.

Rates and currencies revenues decreased 5%, driven by lower G10 rates and currencies revenues. Despite the challenging trading environment, corporate client revenues in rates and currencies across the global network remained strong. Spread products and other fixed income revenues decreased 6%, due to a difficult trading environment in the current year given low volatility, driving lower credit markets and commodities revenues, particularly in

North America

, partially offset by higher municipals revenues, as well as higher securitized markets revenues.

•

Equity markets

revenues decreased 2%. Excluding an episodic loss in derivatives of approximately $130 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 related to a single client event, revenues increased 2%, as continued growth in prime finance and delta one client balances and higher investor client activity (particularly in

EMEA

and

Asia

) were partially offset by lower episodic activity with corporate clients in

North America

. Excluding the episodic loss in derivatives, equity derivatives revenues increased, driven by the stronger investor client activity. Cash equities revenues were modestly higher as well, driven by higher revenues in

•

Securities services

revenues increased 8%. Excluding the impact of the prior year’s divestiture of a private equity fund services business, revenues increased 12%, reflecting strength in all regions, driven by growth in client volumes and higher interest revenue due to a more favorable rate environment.

increased 3%, as higher compensation, volume-related expenses and investments were partially offset by efficiency savings.

Provisions

improved $501 million, driven by a net loan loss release of $380 million (compared to a net release of $30 million in the prior year) and a 29% decline in net credit


losses. The increase in net loan loss reserve releases was driven by an improvement in the provision for unfunded lending commitments in the corporate loan portfolio, as well as a favorable credit environment, stability in commodity prices and continued improvement in the portfolio. The decline in net credit losses was largely driven by improvement in the energy sector, partially offset by the impact of the single client event in the fourth quarter noted above.

Provisions

decreased 49%, driven by a net loan loss reserve release of $30 million (compared to a net build of $748 million in the prior year). The significant decline in loan loss reserve builds was related to energy and energy-related exposures and was driven by stabilization of commodities as oil prices continued to recover from lows in early 2016. The decline in cost of credit was partially offset by higher net credit losses of $516 million (compared to $214 million in the prior year) mostly related to the energy and energy-related exposures, with a vast majority offset by the release of previously established loan loss reserves.

Excluding the impact of Tax Reform, net income declined 69% to $153 million, reflecting lower revenues, partially offset by lower expenses and lower cost of credit.

Revenues

declined 40%, primarily reflecting the continued wind-down of legacy assets and the absence of gains related to debt buybacks in 2016. Revenues included approximately $750 million in gains on asset sales in the first quarter of 2017, which more than offset a roughly $300 million charge related to the exit of Citi’s U.S. mortgage servicing operations in the quarter.

Expenses

declined 24%, reflecting the wind-down of legacy assets and lower legal expenses, partially offset by approximately $100 million in episodic expenses primarily related to the exit of the U.S. mortgage servicing operations.

Also included in expenses is an approximately $255 million provision for remediation costs related to a CARD Act matter (for additional information, see “

North America GCB

” above and Note 27 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). Citi believes the aggregate approximately $335 million provision (including the $80 million provision in

North America GCB

) to be sufficient for Citi’s planned remediation.

Provisions

decreased $244 million to a net benefit of $175 million, primarily due to lower net credit losses and a lower provision for benefits and claims, partially offset by a lower net loan loss reserve release. Net credit losses declined 66% to $149 million, primarily reflecting the impact of ongoing divestiture activity and the continued wind-down of the

North America

mortgage portfolio. The provision for benefits and claims declined by $105 million, primarily due to lower insurance activity. The net reserve release declined by $147 million to $317 million, and reflected the continued wind-down of the legacy

Payment Protection Insurance (PPI)

The selling of PPI by financial institutions in the U.K. has been the subject of intense review and focus by U.K. regulators and the U.K. Supreme Court.

PPI is designed to cover a customer’s loan repayments if certain events occur, such as long-term illness or unemployment.  The U.K. Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) found certain problems across the industry with how these products were sold, including customers not realizing that the cost of PPI premiums was being added to their loan or PPI being unsuitable for the customer.  Redress generally involves the repayment of premiums and the refund of all applicable contractual interest, together with compensatory interest of 8%.

In addition, during the fourth quarter of 2014, the U.K. Supreme Court issued a ruling in a case (Plevin) involving PPI pursuant to which the court ruled, independent of the sale of the PPI contract, that the PPI contract at issue in the case was “unfair” due to the high sales commissions earned and the lack of disclosure to the customer thereof.

In addition, the FCA released a policy statement related to PPI that (i) set a deadline of August 29, 2019 by which consumers must file PPI claims, (ii) provides for the launch of FCA-led marketing campaigns to inform consumers of this deadline, (iii) set new rules and guidance for the handling of PPI complaints in light of the Supreme Court’s decision on Plevin and (iv) requires all firms to contact all previously rejected customers who may be able to complain under the new “Plevin” rule (the Plevin Customer Contact Exercise). Citi completed the Plevin Customer Contact Exercise during the fourth quarter of 2017. The FCA-led marketing campaigns began in August 2017 and will continue through the August 2019 deadline. The level of PPI claims also continues to be influenced by the solicitation activity of Claims Management Companies (CMCs).

During 2017, Citi increased its PPI reserves by approximately $109 million (with $105 million recorded in

Corporate/Other

and $4 million recorded in

Discontinued operations

).  The increase for full-year 2017 compared to an increase of $134 million during 2016 and was primarily due to the ongoing level of PPI claims.

Citi’s year-end 2017 PPI reserve was $213 million, compared to $228 million as of December 31, 2016.

Additional reserving actions, if any, in 2018 will largely depend on the level of customer claims in response to the FCA-led marketing campaigns and the level of ongoing CMC activity.


OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS

Citigroup enters into various types of off-balance sheet arrangements in the ordinary course of business. Citi’s involvement in these arrangements can take many different forms, including without limitation:

•

purchasing or retaining residual and other interests in unconsolidated special purpose entities, such as mortgage-backed and other asset-backed securitization entities;

•

holding senior and subordinated debt, interests in limited and general partnerships and equity interests in other unconsolidated special purpose entities;

•

providing guarantees, indemnifications, loan commitments, letters of credit and representations and warranties; and

•

entering into operating leases for property and equipment.

Citi enters into these arrangements for a variety of business purposes. For example, securitization arrangements offer investors access to specific cash flows and risks created through the securitization process. Securitization arrangements also assist Citi and its customers in monetizing their financial assets and securing financing at more favorable rates than Citi or the customers could otherwise obtain.

The table below shows where a discussion of Citi’s various off-balance sheet arrangements may be found in this Form 10-K. In addition, see Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

CAPITAL RESOURCES

Overview

Capital is used principally to support assets in Citi’s businesses and to absorb credit, market and operational losses. Citi primarily generates capital through earnings from its operating businesses. Citi may augment its capital through issuances of common stock, noncumulative perpetual preferred stock and equity issued through awards under employee benefit plans, among other issuances. Further, Citi’s capital levels may also be affected by changes in accounting and regulatory standards, as well as U.S. corporate tax laws and the impact of future events on Citi’s business results, such as changes in interest and foreign exchange rates, as well as business and asset dispositions.

During 2017, Citi returned a total of $17.1 billion of capital to common shareholders in the form of share repurchases (approximately 214 million common shares) and dividends.

Capital Management

Citi’s capital management framework is designed to ensure that Citigroup and its principal subsidiaries maintain sufficient capital consistent with each entity’s respective risk profile, management targets and all applicable regulatory standards and guidelines. Citi assesses its capital adequacy against a series of internal quantitative capital goals, designed to evaluate the Company’s capital levels in expected and stressed economic environments. Underlying these internal quantitative capital goals are strategic capital considerations, centered on preserving and building financial strength. The Citigroup Capital Committee, with oversight from the Risk Management Committee of Citigroup’s Board of Directors, has responsibility for Citi’s aggregate capital structure, including the capital assessment and planning process, which is integrated into Citi’s capital plan. Balance sheet management, including oversight of capital adequacy, for Citigroup’s subsidiaries is governed by each entity’s Asset and Liability Committee, where applicable. For additional information regarding Citi’s capital planning and stress testing exercises, see “Stress Testing—Component of Capital Planning” below.

Current Regulatory Capital Standards

Citi is subject to regulatory capital standards issued by the Federal Reserve Board, which constitute the U.S. Basel III rules. These rules establish an integrated capital adequacy framework, encompassing both risk-based capital ratios and leverage ratios.

Risk-Based Capital Ratios

The U.S. Basel III rules set forth the composition of regulatory capital (including the application of regulatory capital adjustments and deductions), as well as two comprehensive methodologies (a Standardized Approach and Advanced Approaches) for measuring total risk-weighted assets. Total risk-weighted assets under the Advanced Approaches, which are primarily models based, include credit, market, and operational risk-weighted assets. Conversely, the Standardized Approach excludes operational risk-weighted assets and generally applies prescribed supervisory risk weights to broad categories of credit risk exposures. As a result, credit risk-weighted assets calculated under the Advanced Approaches are more risk sensitive than those calculated under the Standardized Approach. Market risk-weighted assets are derived on a generally consistent basis under both approaches.

The U.S. Basel III rules establish stated minimum Common Equity Tier 1 Capital, Tier 1 Capital and Total Capital ratios for substantially all U.S. banking organizations, including Citi and Citibank, N.A. (Citibank). Moreover, these rules provide for both a fixed Capital Conservation Buffer and, for Advanced Approaches banking organizations, such as Citi and Citibank, also a discretionary Countercyclical Capital Buffer. These capital buffers would be available to absorb losses in advance of any potential impairment of regulatory capital below the stated minimum risk-based capital ratio requirements. In December 2017, the Federal Reserve Board voted to affirm the Countercyclical Capital Buffer amount at the current level of 0%.

Further, the U.S. Basel III rules implement the “capital floor provision” of the so-called “Collins Amendment” of the Dodd-Frank Act, which requires Advanced Approaches

banking organizations to calculate each of the three risk-based capital ratios (Common Equity Tier 1 Capital, Tier 1 Capital, and Total Capital) under both the U.S. Basel III Standardized Approach and the Advanced Approaches and publicly report (as well as measure compliance against) the lower of each of the resulting risk-based capital ratios.


GSIB Surcharge

The Federal Reserve Board imposes a risk-based capital surcharge upon U.S. bank holding companies that are identified as global systemically important bank holding companies (GSIBs), including Citi. The GSIB surcharge augments the Capital Conservation Buffer and, if invoked, any Countercyclical Capital Buffer, and would result in restrictions on earnings distributions (e.g., dividends, equity repurchases, and discretionary executive bonuses) should the expanded buffer be breached to absorb losses during periods of financial or economic stress, with the degree of such restrictions based upon the extent to which the expanded buffer is breached.

Under the Federal Reserve Board’s rule, identification of a GSIB is based primarily on quantitative measurement indicators underlying five equally weighted broad categories of systemic importance: (i) size, (ii) interconnectedness, (iii) cross-jurisdictional activity, (iv) substitutability, and (v) complexity. With the exception of size, each of the other categories are composed of multiple indicators also of equal weight, and amounting to 12 indicators in total.

A U.S. bank holding company that is designated a GSIB under the established methodology is required, on an annual basis, to calculate a surcharge using two methods and will be subject to the higher of the resulting two surcharges. The first method (“method 1”) is based on the same five broad categories of systemic importance used to identify a GSIB. Under the second method (“method 2”), the substitutability category is replaced with a quantitative measure intended to assess the extent of a GSIB’s reliance on short-term wholesale funding. Moreover, method 1 incorporates relative measures of systemic importance across certain global banking organizations and a year-end spot foreign exchange rate, whereas method 2 uses fixed measures of systemic importance and application of an average foreign exchange rate over a three-year period. Effective for 2017 and thereafter, the GSIB surcharges calculated under both method 1 and method 2 are based on measures of systemic importance from the year immediately preceding that in which the GSIB surcharge calculations are being performed (e.g., the method 1 and method 2 GSIB surcharges to be calculated by December 31, 2017 will be based on 2016 systemic indicator data). Generally, the surcharge derived under method 2 will result in a higher surcharge than derived under method 1.

Should a GSIB’s systemic importance change year-over-year such that it becomes subject to a higher surcharge, the higher surcharge would not become effective for a full year (e.g., a higher surcharge calculated by December 31, 2018 would not become effective until January 1, 2020). However, if a GSIB’s systemic importance changes such that the GSIB would be subject to a lower surcharge, the GSIB would be subject to the lower surcharge beginning with the next calendar year (e.g., a lower surcharge calculated by December 31, 2018 would become effective January 1, 2019).

The following table sets forth Citi’s GSIB surcharge as derived under method 1 and method 2 for 2017 and 2016.

Citi’s GSIB surcharge effective for 2017 and 2016 was 3.0% and 3.5%, respectively, as derived under the higher method 2 result. Citi’s GSIB surcharge effective for 2018 will remain unchanged at 3.0%, as derived under the higher method 2 result. Citi expects that its method 2 GSIB surcharge will continue to remain higher than its method 1 GSIB surcharge, and as such Citi’s GSIB surcharge effective for 2019 will not exceed 3.0%, and Citi’s GSIB surcharge effective for 2020 is not expected to exceed 3.0%.

Transition Provisions

The U.S. Basel III rules contain several differing, largely multi-year transition provisions (i.e., “phase-ins” and “phase-outs”), including with respect to substantially all regulatory capital adjustments and deductions, and non-qualifying Tier 1 and Tier 2 Capital instruments (such as non-grandfathered trust preferred securities and certain subordinated debt issuances). Moreover, the GSIB surcharge, Capital Conservation Buffer, and any Countercyclical Capital Buffer (currently 0%), commenced phase-in on January 1, 2016, becoming fully effective on January 1, 2019. With the exception of the non-grandfathered trust preferred securities, which do not fully phase-out until January 1, 2022, and the capital buffers and GSIB surcharge, which do not fully phase-in until January 1, 2019, all other transition provisions will be entirely reflected in Citi’s regulatory capital ratios by January 1, 2018. Citi considers all of these transition provisions as being fully implemented on January 1, 2019 (full implementation), with the inclusion of the capital buffers and GSIB surcharge.

The following chart sets forth the transitional progression from January 1, 2016 to full implementation by January 1, 2019 of the regulatory capital components (i.e., inclusive of the mandatory 2.5% Capital Conservation Buffer and the Countercyclical Capital Buffer at its current level of 0%, as well as an estimated 3.0% GSIB surcharge) comprising the effective minimum risk-based capital ratios.


Basel III Transition Arrangements: Minimum Risk-Based Capital Ratios

The following chart presents the transition arrangements (phase-in and phase-out) from January 1, 2016 through January 1, 2018 under the U.S. Basel III rules for significant regulatory capital adjustments and deductions relative to Citi.

Basel III Transition Arrangements: Significant Regulatory Capital Adjustments and Deductions

(1)

Includes the phase-in of Common Equity Tier 1 Capital deductions for all intangible assets other than goodwill and mortgage servicing rights (MSRs); and excess over 10%/15% limitations for deferred tax assets (DTAs) arising from temporary differences, significant common stock investments in unconsolidated financial institutions and MSRs. Goodwill (including goodwill “embedded” in the valuation of significant common stock investments in unconsolidated financial institutions) is fully deducted in arriving at Common Equity Tier 1 Capital. The amount of all other intangible assets, aside from MSRs, not deducted in arriving at Common Equity Tier 1 Capital are risk-weighted at 100%, as are the excess over the 10%/15% limitations for DTAs arising from temporary differences, significant common stock investments in unconsolidated financial institutions and MSRs through December 31, 2017. Commencing January 1, 2018, the amount of temporary difference DTAs, significant common stock investments in unconsolidated financial institutions and MSRs not deducted in arriving at Common Equity Tier 1 Capital are risk-weighted at 250%.

(2)

Includes the phase-in of the Common Equity Tier 1 Capital and Additional Tier 1 Capital adjustment for cumulative unrealized net gains (losses) related to changes in fair value of financial liabilities attributable to Citi’s own creditworthiness; and the phase-in of Common Equity Tier 1 Capital and Additional Tier 1 Capital deductions related to DTAs arising from net operating loss, foreign tax credit and general business credit carry-forwards and defined benefit pension plan net assets;

(3)

Includes the phase-out from Common Equity Tier 1 Capital of adjustments related to net unrealized gains (losses) on available-for-sale (AFS) debt securities; unrealized gains on AFS equity securities; net unrealized gains (losses) on held-to-maturity (HTM) securities included in

Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)

(AOCI); and defined benefit plans liability adjustment.


Tier 1 Leverage Ratio

Under the U.S. Basel III rules, Citi, as with principally all U.S. banking organizations, is also required to maintain a minimum Tier 1 Leverage ratio of 4.0%. The Tier 1 Leverage ratio, a non-risk-based measure of capital adequacy, is defined as Tier 1 Capital as a percentage of quarterly adjusted average total assets less amounts deducted from Tier 1 Capital.

Supplementary Leverage Ratio

Advanced Approaches banking organizations are additionally required to calculate a Supplementary Leverage ratio, which significantly differs from the Tier 1 Leverage ratio by also including certain off-balance sheet exposures within the denominator of the ratio (Total Leverage Exposure). The Supplementary Leverage ratio represents end of period Tier 1 Capital to Total Leverage Exposure, with the latter defined as the sum of the daily average of on-balance sheet assets for the quarter and the average of certain off-balance sheet exposures calculated as of the last day of each month in the quarter, less applicable Tier 1 Capital deductions. Effective January 1, 2018, Advanced Approaches banking organizations are required to maintain a stated minimum Supplementary Leverage ratio of 3.0%.

Further, U.S. GSIBs, and their subsidiary insured depository institutions, including Citi and Citibank, are subject to enhanced Supplementary Leverage ratio standards. The enhanced Supplementary Leverage ratio standards establish a 2.0% leverage buffer for U.S. GSIBs in addition to the stated 3.0% minimum Supplementary Leverage ratio requirement in the U.S. Basel III rules. If a U.S. GSIB fails to exceed the 2.0% leverage buffer, it will be subject to increasingly onerous restrictions (depending upon the extent of the shortfall) regarding capital distributions and discretionary executive bonus payments. Accordingly, U.S. GSIBs are effectively subject to a 5.0% minimum Supplementary Leverage ratio requirement. Citi is required to be compliant with this higher effective minimum ratio requirement on January 1, 2018.

Prompt Corrective Action Framework

The U.S. Basel III rules revised the Prompt Corrective Action (PCA) regulations applicable to insured depository institutions in certain respects.

In general, the PCA regulations direct the U.S. banking agencies to enforce increasingly strict limitations on the activities of insured depository institutions that fail to meet certain regulatory capital thresholds. The PCA framework contains five categories of capital adequacy as measured by risk-based capital and leverage ratios: (i) “well capitalized,”

(ii) “adequately capitalized,” (iii) undercapitalized,” (iv) “significantly undercapitalized,” and (v) “critically undercapitalized.”

Accordingly, an insured depository institution, such as Citibank, must maintain minimum Common Equity Tier 1 Capital, Tier 1 Capital, Total Capital, and Tier 1 Leverage ratios of 6.5%, 8.0%, 10.0% and 5.0%, respectively, to be considered “well capitalized.” Additionally, insured depository institution subsidiaries of U.S. GSIBs, such as Citibank, must maintain a minimum Supplementary Leverage ratio of 6.0%, effective January 1, 2018, to be considered “well capitalized.”

Stress Testing Component of Capital Planning

Citi is subject to an annual assessment by the Federal Reserve Board as to whether Citigroup has effective capital planning processes as well as sufficient regulatory capital to absorb losses during stressful economic and financial conditions, while also meeting obligations to creditors and counterparties and continuing to serve as a credit intermediary. This annual assessment includes two related programs:

•

The Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) evaluates Citi’s capital adequacy, capital adequacy process, and its planned capital distributions, such as dividend payments and common stock repurchases. As part of CCAR, the Federal Reserve Board assesses whether Citi has sufficient capital to continue operations throughout times of economic and financial market stress and whether Citi has robust, forward-looking capital planning processes that account for its unique risks. The Federal Reserve Board may object to Citi’s annual capital plan based on either quantitative or qualitative grounds. If the Federal Reserve Board objects to Citi’s annual capital plan, Citi may not undertake any capital distribution unless the Federal Reserve Board indicates in writing that it does not object to the distribution.

•

Dodd-Frank Act Stress Testing (DFAST) is a forward-looking quantitative evaluation of the impact of stressful economic and financial market conditions on Citi’s regulatory capital. This program serves to inform the Federal Reserve Board, the financial companies, and the general public, how Citi’s regulatory capital ratios might change using a hypothetical set of adverse economic conditions as designed by the Federal Reserve Board. In addition to the annual supervisory stress test conducted by the Federal Reserve Board, Citi is required to conduct annual company-run stress tests under the same adverse economic conditions designed by the Federal Reserve Board, as well as conduct a mid-cycle stress test under company-developed scenarios.

Both CCAR and DFAST include an estimate of projected revenues, losses, reserves, pro forma regulatory capital ratios, and any other additional capital measures deemed relevant by Citi. Projections are required over a nine-quarter planning horizon under three supervisory scenarios (baseline, adverse and severely adverse conditions). All risk-based capital ratios reflect application of the Standardized Approach framework and the transition arrangements under the U.S. Basel III rules. Moreover, the Federal Reserve Board has deferred the use of the Advanced Approaches framework indefinitely. Beginning in 2018, CCAR incorporates the Supplementary Leverage ratio. Accordingly, Advanced Approaches banking organizations are required to demonstrate an ability to maintain a Supplementary Leverage ratio in excess of the stated minimum requirement for all quarters of the 2018 CCAR planning horizon.

For additional information regarding CCAR, see “Risk Factors—Strategic Risks” below.


Citigroup’s Capital Resources Under Current Regulatory Standards

Citi is required to maintain stated minimum Common Equity Tier 1 Capital, Tier 1 Capital and Total Capital ratios of 4.5%, 6.0% and 8.0%, respectively.

Citi’s effective minimum Common Equity Tier 1 Capital, Tier 1 Capital and Total Capital ratios during 2017, inclusive of the 50% phase-in of both the 2.5% Capital Conservation Buffer and the 3.0% GSIB surcharge (all of which is to be composed of Common Equity Tier 1 Capital), are 7.25%, 8.75% and 10.75%, respectively. Citi’s effective minimum Common Equity Tier 1 Capital, Tier 1 Capital and Total Capital ratios during 2016, inclusive of the 25% phase-in of both the 2.5% Capital Conservation Buffer and the 3.5% GSIB surcharge (all of which is to be composed of Common Equity Tier 1 Capital), were 6.0%, 7.5% and 9.5%, respectively.

Furthermore, to be “well capitalized” under current federal bank regulatory agency definitions, a bank holding

company must have a Tier 1 Capital ratio of at least 6.0%, a Total Capital ratio of at least 10.0%, and not be subject to a Federal Reserve Board directive to maintain higher capital levels.

The following tables set forth the capital tiers, total risk-weighted assets and underlying risk components, risk-based capital ratios, quarterly adjusted average total assets, Total Leverage Exposure and leverage ratios under current regulatory standards (reflecting Basel III Transition Arrangements) for Citi as of December 31,


and December 31,


.

Citigroup Capital Components and Ratios Under Current Regulatory Standards (Basel III Transition Arrangements)

(1)

Under the U.S. Basel III rules, credit risk-weighted assets during the transition period reflect the effects of transition arrangements related to regulatory capital adjustments and deductions and, as a result, will differ from credit risk-weighted assets derived under full implementation of the rules.

(2)

As of December 31,


, Citi’s reportable Common Equity Tier 1 Capital and Tier 1 Capital ratios were the lower derived under the Basel III Standardized Approach, whereas the reportable Total Capital ratio was the lower derived under the Basel III Advanced Approaches framework. As of December 31,


, Citi’s reportable Common Equity Tier 1 Capital, Tier 1 Capital, and Total Capital ratios were the lower derived under the Basel III Advanced Approaches framework.

(3)

Tier 1 Leverage ratio denominator.

(4)

Supplementary Leverage ratio denominator.

As indicated in the table above, Citigroup’s capital ratios at December 31,


were in excess of the stated and effective minimum requirements under the U.S. Basel III rules. In addition, Citi was also “well capitalized” under current federal bank regulatory agency definitions as of December 31,


.


Components of Citigroup Capital Under Current Regulatory Standards (Basel III Transition Arrangements)

Footnotes are presented on the following page.


(1)

Issuance costs of $184 million related to noncumulative perpetual preferred stock outstanding at December 31,


and December 31,


are excluded from common stockholders’ equity and netted against such preferred stock in accordance with Federal Reserve Board regulatory reporting requirements, which differ from those under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).

(2)

In addition, includes the net amount of unamortized loss on held-to-maturity (HTM) securities. This amount relates to securities that were previously transferred from AFS to HTM, and non-credit related factors such as changes in interest rates and liquidity spreads for HTM securities with other-than-temporary impairment.

(3)

The transition arrangements for significant regulatory capital adjustments and deductions impacting Common Equity Tier 1 Capital and Additional Tier 1 Capital are set forth above in the chart entitled “Basel III Transition Arrangements: Significant Regulatory Capital Adjustments and Deductions.”

(4)

Common Equity Tier 1 Capital is adjusted for accumulated net unrealized gains (losses) on cash flow hedges included in

Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)

(AOCI) that relate to the hedging of items not recognized at fair value on the balance sheet.

(5)

The cumulative impact of changes in Citigroup’s own creditworthiness in valuing liabilities for which the fair value option has been elected, and own-credit valuation adjustments on derivatives, are excluded from Common Equity Tier 1 Capital and Additional Tier 1 Capital, in accordance with the U.S. Basel III rules.

(6)

Includes goodwill “embedded” in the valuation of significant common stock investments in unconsolidated financial institutions.

(7)

Of Citi’s $22.5 billion of net DTAs at December 31,


, $10.2 billion were includable in regulatory capital pursuant to the U.S. Basel III rules, while $12.3 billion were excluded. Excluded from Citi’s regulatory capital at December 31,


was in total $13.1 billion of net DTAs arising from net operating loss, foreign tax credit and general business credit carry-forwards, of which $10.5 billion were deducted from Common Equity Tier 1 Capital and $2.6 billion were deducted from Additional Tier 1 Capital, which was reduced by $0.8 billion of net DTLs primarily associated with goodwill and certain other intangible assets. Separately, under the U.S. Basel III rules, goodwill and these other intangible assets are deducted net of associated DTLs in arriving at Common Equity Tier 1 Capital. DTAs arising from net operating loss, foreign tax credit and general business credit carry-forwards are required to be deducted from both Common Equity Tier 1 Capital and Additional Tier 1 Capital under the transition arrangements of the U.S. Basel III rules; whereas DTAs arising from temporary differences are deducted solely from Common Equity Tier 1 Capital under these rules, if in excess of 10%/15% limitations.

(8)

Assets subject to 10%/15% limitations include MSRs, DTAs arising from temporary differences and significant common stock investments in unconsolidated financial institutions. At December 31, 2017, none of these assets were in excess of the 10%/15% limitations. At December 31,


, this deduction related only to DTAs arising from temporary differences that exceeded the 10% limitation.

(9)

Represents Citigroup Capital XIII trust preferred securities, which are permanently grandfathered as Tier 1 Capital under the U.S. Basel III rules.

(10)

Banking entities are required to be in compliance with the Volcker Rule of the Dodd-Frank Act which prohibits conducting certain proprietary investment activities and limits their ownership of, and relationships with, covered funds. Accordingly, Citi is required by the Volcker Rule to deduct from Tier 1 Capital all permitted ownership interests in covered funds that were acquired after December 31, 2013.

(11)

50% of the minimum regulatory capital requirements of insurance underwriting subsidiaries must be deducted from each of Tier 1 Capital and Tier 2 Capital.

(12)

Effective January 1, 2016, non-grandfathered trust preferred securities are not eligible for inclusion in Tier 1 Capital, but are eligible for inclusion in Tier 2 Capital subject to full phase-out by January 1, 2022. Non-grandfathered trust preferred securities are eligible for inclusion in Tier 2 Capital in an amount up to 50% and 60% during 2017 and 2016, respectively, of the aggregate outstanding principal amounts of such issuances as of January 1, 2014, in accordance with the transition arrangements for non-qualifying capital instruments under the U.S. Basel III rules.

(13)

Under the Standardized Approach, the allowance for credit losses is eligible for inclusion in Tier 2 Capital up to 1.25% of credit risk-weighted assets, with any excess allowance for credit losses being deducted in arriving at credit risk-weighted assets, which differs from the Advanced Approaches framework, in which eligible credit reserves that exceed expected credit losses are eligible for inclusion in Tier 2 Capital to the extent the excess reserves do not exceed 0.6% of credit risk-weighted assets. The total amount of eligible credit reserves in excess of expected credit losses that were eligible for inclusion in Tier 2 Capital, subject to limitation, under the Advanced Approaches framework was $1.5 billion and $0.7 billion at December 31,


and December 31,


, respectively.


Citigroup Capital Rollforward Under Current Regulatory Standards (Basel III Transition Arrangements)


Citigroup Risk-Weighted Assets Rollforward Under Current Regulatory Standards

(Basel III Standardized Approach with Transition Arrangements)

(1)

General credit risk exposures include cash and balances due from depository institutions, securities, and loans and leases. General credit risk exposures increased during the three and twelve months ended December 31,


primarily due to corporate loan growth.

(2)

Repo-style transactions include repurchase or reverse repurchase transactions and securities borrowing or securities lending transactions.

(3)

Securitization exposures decreased during the twelve months ended December 31,


principally as a result of certain securitization exposures becoming subject to deduction from Tier 1 Capital under the Volcker Rule of the Dodd-Frank Act.

(4)

OTC derivatives decreased during the three and twelve months ended December 31,


primarily due to notional decreases.

(5)

Other exposures include cleared transactions, unsettled transactions, and other assets. Other exposures decreased during the three and twelve months ended December 31,


primarily due to a reduction in Citi’s deferred tax assets as a result of Tax Reform. For additional information regarding the impact of Tax Reform, see “Impact of Tax Reform” above.

(6)

Off-balance sheet exposures increased during the twelve months ended December 31,


primarily due to growth in corporate exposures.

(7)

Risk levels increased during the three months ended December 31,


primarily due to an increases in exposures subject to securitization charges and incremental risk charges, partially offset by a decrease in exposures subject to comprehensive risk and Risk Not In the Model. Risk levels increased during the twelve months ended December 31,


primarily due to an increase in exposure levels subject to Stressed Value at Risk, as well as an increase in positions subject to securitization charges.

(8)

Risk-weighted assets declined during the twelve months ended December 31,


, as Citi received supervisory approval to remove the Comprehensive Risk Measure model surcharge for correlation trading portfolios, commencing with the third quarter of 2017. Further contributing to the decline in risk-weighted assets during the twelve months ended December 31,


were changes in model inputs regarding volatility and the correlation between market risk factors.


Citigroup Risk-Weighted Assets Rollforward Under Current Regulatory Standards

(Basel III Advanced Approaches with Transition Arrangements)

(1)

Retail exposures increased during the three months ended December 31,


primarily due to increases in qualifying revolving (cards) exposures attributable to seasonal holiday spending. Retail exposures decreased during the twelve months ended December 31,


principally resulting from residential mortgage loan sales and repayments, and divestitures of certain legacy assets.

(2)

Wholesale exposures increased during the three and twelve months ended December 31,


primarily due to corporate loan growth. The increase in wholesale exposures during the twelve months ended December 31,


was partially offset by annual updates to model parameters.

(3)

Repo-style transactions decreased during the three months ended December 31,


primarily due to improved portfolio credit quality. Repo-style transactions increased during the  twelve months ended December 31,


primarily due to increased activity and a decline in portfolio credit quality.

(4)

Securitization exposures increased during the three months ended December 31,


primarily due to increased activity. Securitization exposures decreased during the twelve months ended December 31,


principally as a result of certain securitization exposures becoming subject to deduction from Tier 1 Capital under the Volcker Rule of the Dodd-Frank Act.

(5)

OTC derivatives decreased during the three months ended December 31,


primarily due to decreases in trade volume and changes in fair value. OTC derivatives decreased during the twelve months ended December 31,


primarily due to changes in fair value and improved portfolio credit quality.

(6)

Derivatives CVA decreased during the three and twelve months ended December 31,


primarily driven by decreased volatility and exposure reduction.

(7)

Other exposures include cleared transactions, unsettled transactions, assets other than those reportable in specific exposure categories and non-material portfolios. Other exposures decreased during the three and twelve months ended December 31,


primarily due to a reduction in Citi’s deferred tax assets as a result of Tax Reform. For additional information regarding the impact of Tax Reform, see “Impact of Tax Reform” above.

(8)

Supervisory 6% multiplier does not apply to derivatives CVA.

(9)

Risk levels increased during the three months ended December 31,


primarily due to an increases in exposures subject to securitization charges and incremental risk charges, partially offset by a decrease in exposures subject to comprehensive risk and Risk Not In the Model. Risk levels increased during the twelve months ended December 31,


primarily due to an increase in exposure levels subject to Stressed Value at Risk, as well as an increase in positions subject to securitization charges.

(10)

Risk-weighted assets declined during the twelve months ended December 31,


, as Citi received supervisory approval to remove the Comprehensive Risk Measure model surcharge for correlation trading portfolios, commencing with the third quarter of 2017. Further contributing to the decline in risk-weighted assets during the twelve months ended December 31,


were changes in model inputs regarding volatility and the correlation between market risk factors.

(11)

Operational risk-weighted assets decreased during the three months ended December 31,


primarily due to changes in operational loss severity and frequency. Operational risk-weighted assets decreased during the twelve months ended December 31,


primarily due to assessed improvements in the business environment and risk controls and changes in operational loss severity and frequency.


Capital Resources of Citigroup’s Subsidiary U.S.

Depository Institutions Under Current Regulatory Standards

Citigroup’s subsidiary U.S. depository institutions are also subject to regulatory capital standards issued by their respective primary federal bank regulatory agencies, which are similar to the standards of the Federal Reserve Board.

During 2017, Citi’s primary subsidiary U.S. depository institution, Citibank, N.A. (Citibank), is subject to effective minimum Common Equity Tier 1 Capital, Tier 1 Capital and Total Capital ratios, inclusive of the 50% phase-in of the 2.5% Capital Conservation Buffer, of 5.75%, 7.25% and 9.25%, respectively. Citibank’s effective minimum Common Equity Tier 1 Capital, Tier 1 Capital and Total Capital ratios during 2016, inclusive of the 25% phase-in of the 2.5% Capital

Conservation Buffer, were 5.125%, 6.625% and 8.625%, respectively. Citibank is required to maintain stated minimum Common Equity Tier 1 Capital, Tier 1 Capital and Total Capital ratios of 4.5%, 6.0% and 8.0%, respectively.

The following tables set forth the capital tiers, total risk-weighted assets and underlying risk components, risk-based capital ratios, quarterly adjusted average total assets, Total Leverage Exposure and leverage ratios under current regulatory standards (reflecting Basel III Transition Arrangements) for Citibank, Citi’s primary subsidiary U.S. depository institution, as of December 31,


and December 31,


.

Citibank Capital Components and Ratios Under Current Regulatory Standards (Basel III Transition Arrangements)

(1)

Under the Advanced Approaches framework eligible credit reserves that exceed expected credit losses are eligible for inclusion in Tier 2 Capital to the extent the excess reserves do not exceed 0.6% of credit risk-weighted assets, which differs from the Standardized Approach in which the allowance for credit losses is eligible for inclusion in Tier 2 Capital up to 1.25% of credit risk-weighted assets, with any excess allowance for credit losses being deducted in arriving at credit risk-weighted assets.

(2)

As of December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, Citibank’s reportable Common Equity Tier 1 Capital and Tier 1 Capital  ratios were the lower derived under the Basel III Standardized Approach. As of December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, Citibank’s reportable Total Capital ratio was the lower derived under the Basel III Advanced Approaches framework.

(3)

Tier 1 Leverage ratio denominator.

(4)

Supplementary Leverage ratio denominator.

As indicated in the table above, Citibank’s capital ratios at December 31,


were in excess of the stated and effective minimum requirements under the U.S. Basel III rules. In addition, Citibank was also “well capitalized” as of December 31,


under the revised PCA regulations.

Further, Citibank is required to conduct the annual Dodd-Frank Act Stress Test. The annual stress test consists of a forward-looking quantitative evaluation of the impact of stressful economic and financial market conditions under

several scenarios on Citibank’s regulatory capital. This program serves to inform the Office of the Comptroller of

the Currency as to how Citibank’s regulatory capital ratios might change during a hypothetical set of adverse economic

conditions and to ultimately evaluate the reliability of Citibank’s capital planning process.


Impact of Changes on Citigroup and Citibank Capital Ratios Under Current Regulatory Capital Standards

The following tables present the estimated sensitivity of Citigroup’s and Citibank’s capital ratios to changes of $100 million in Common Equity Tier 1 Capital, Tier 1 Capital and Total Capital (numerator), and changes of $1 billion in Advanced Approaches and Standardized Approach risk-weighted assets and quarterly adjusted average total assets, as well as Total Leverage Exposure (denominator), under current regulatory capital standards (reflecting Basel III Transition Arrangements), as of December 31,


. This information is

provided for the purpose of analyzing the impact that a change in Citigroup’s or Citibank’s financial position or results of operations could have on these ratios. These sensitivities only consider a single change to either a component of regulatory capital, risk-weighted assets, quarterly adjusted average total assets or Total Leverage Exposure. Accordingly, an event that affects more than one factor may have a larger basis point impact than is reflected in these tables.

Citigroup Broker-Dealer Subsidiaries

At December 31,


, Citigroup Global Markets Inc., a U.S. broker-dealer registered with the SEC that is an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Citigroup, had net capital, computed in accordance with the SEC’s net capital rule, of $11.0 billion, which exceeded the minimum requirement by $9.0 billion.

Moreover, Citigroup Global Markets Limited, a broker-dealer registered with the United Kingdom’s Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) that is also an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Citigroup, had total capital of $18.1 billion at December 31,


, which exceeded the PRA's minimum regulatory capital requirements.

In addition, certain of Citi’s other broker-dealer

subsidiaries are subject to regulation in the countries in which they do business, including requirements to maintain specified levels of net capital or its equivalent. Citigroup’s other broker-dealer subsidiaries were in compliance with their capital requirements at December 31,


.


Basel III (Full Implementation)

Citigroup’s Capital Resources Under Basel III

(Full Implementation)

Citi currently estimates that its effective minimum Common Equity Tier 1 Capital, Tier 1 Capital and Total Capital ratio requirements under the U.S. Basel III rules, on a fully implemented basis, inclusive of the 2.5% Capital Conservation Buffer and the Countercyclical Capital Buffer at its current level of 0%, as well as an expected 3.0% GSIB surcharge, may be 10.0%, 11.5% and 13.5%, respectively.

Further, under the U.S. Basel III rules, Citi must also comply with a 4.0% minimum Tier 1 Leverage ratio requirement and an effective 5.0% minimum Supplementary Leverage ratio requirement.

The following tables set forth the capital tiers, total risk-weighted assets and underlying risk components, risk-based capital ratios, quarterly adjusted average total assets, Total Leverage Exposure and leverage ratios, assuming full implementation under the U.S. Basel III rules, for Citi as of December 31,


and December 31,


.

At December 31,


, Citi’s constraining Common Equity Tier 1 Capital and Tier 1 Capital ratios were those derived under the Basel III Standardized Approach, whereas Citi’s binding Total Capital ratio was that resulting from application of the Basel III Advanced Approaches framework. Further, each of Citi’s risk-based capital ratios was constrained by the Basel III Advanced Approaches framework for all periods prior to June 30, 2017.

Common Equity Tier 1 Capital Ratio

Citi’s Common Equity Tier 1 Capital ratio was 12.4% at December 31, 2017, compared to 13.0% at September 30, 2017 and 12.6% at December 31, 2016. The ratio declined quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year, primarily due to a reduction in Common Equity Tier 1 Capital resulting from the return of capital to common shareholders as well as the impact of Tax Reform.


Components of Citigroup Capital Under Basel III (Full Implementation)

(1)

Issuance costs of $184 million related to noncumulative perpetual preferred stock outstanding at December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016 are excluded from common stockholders’ equity and netted against such preferred stock in accordance with Federal Reserve Board regulatory reporting requirements, which differ from those under U.S. GAAP.

(2)

Common Equity Tier 1 Capital is adjusted for accumulated net unrealized gains (losses) on cash flow hedges included in AOCI that relate to the hedging of items not recognized at fair value on the balance sheet.

(3)

The cumulative impact of changes in Citigroup’s own creditworthiness in valuing liabilities for which the fair value option has been elected, and own-credit valuation adjustments on derivatives, are excluded from Common Equity Tier 1 Capital, in accordance with the U.S. Basel III rules.

(4)

Includes goodwill “embedded” in the valuation of significant common stock investments in unconsolidated financial institutions.

Of Citi’s $22.5 billion of net DTAs at December 31, 2017, $10.2 billion were includable in Common Equity Tier 1 Capital pursuant to the U.S. Basel III rules, while $12.3 billion were excluded. Excluded from Citi’s Common Equity Tier 1 Capital as of December 31, 2017 was $13.1 billion of net DTAs arising from net operating loss, foreign tax credit and general business credit carry-forwards, which was reduced by $0.8 billion of net DTLs primarily associated with goodwill and certain other intangible assets. Separately, under the U.S. Basel III rules, goodwill and these other intangible assets are deducted net of associated DTLs in arriving at Common Equity Tier 1 Capital. DTAs arising from net operating loss, foreign tax credit and general business credit carry-forwards are required to be entirely deducted from Common Equity Tier 1 Capital under full implementation of the U.S. Basel III rules; whereas DTAs arising from temporary differences are deducted from Common Equity Tier 1 Capital if in excess of 10%/15% limitations.

(6)

Assets subject to 10%/15% limitations include MSRs, DTAs arising from temporary differences and significant common stock investments in unconsolidated financial institutions. At December 31, 2017, none of these assets were in excess of the 10%/15% limitations. At December 31, 2016, this deduction related only to DTAs arising from temporary differences that exceeded the 10% limitation.

(7)

Represents Citigroup Capital XIII trust preferred securities, which are permanently grandfathered as Tier 1 Capital under the U.S. Basel III rules.

(8)

Banking entities are required to be in compliance with the Volcker Rule of the Dodd-Frank Act which prohibits conducting certain proprietary investment activities and limits their ownership of, and relationships with, covered funds. Accordingly, Citi is required by the Volcker Rule to deduct from Tier 1 Capital all permitted ownership interests in covered funds that were acquired after December 31, 2013.

Under the Standardized Approach, the allowance for credit losses is eligible for inclusion in Tier 2 Capital up to 1.25% of credit risk-weighted assets, with any excess allowance for credit losses being deducted in arriving at credit risk-weighted assets, which differs from the Advanced Approaches framework, in which eligible credit reserves that exceed expected credit losses are eligible for inclusion in Tier 2 Capital to the extent the excess reserves do not exceed 0.6% of credit risk-weighted assets. The total amount of eligible credit reserves in excess of expected credit losses that were eligible for inclusion in Tier 2 Capital, subject to limitation, under the Advanced Approaches framework was $1.5 billion and $0.7 billion at December 31,


and December 31,


, respectively.

Total risk-weighted assets under the Basel III Standardized Approach increased from year-end


substantially due to higher credit risk-weighted assets, primarily resulting from corporate loan growth and increased repo-style transaction activity, partially offset by a decrease in OTC derivative trade activity and a reduction in Citi’s deferred tax assets as a result of Tax Reform.

Total risk-weighted assets under the Basel III Advanced Approaches decreased from year-end 2016, driven by substantially lower credit and operational risk-weighted assets. The decrease in credit risk-weighted assets was primarily due to a reduction in Citi’s deferred tax assets as a result of Tax Reform, changes in fair value and improved portfolio credit quality of OTC derivatives, residential mortgage loan sales and repayments, and divestitures of certain legacy assets. Operational risk-weighted assets decreased from year-end 2016 primarily due to assessed improvements in the business environment and risk controls, as well as changes in operational loss severity and frequency.


Supplementary Leverage Ratio

Citigroup’s Supplementary Leverage ratio was 6.7% for the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to 7.1% for the third quarter of 2017 and 7.2% for the fourth quarter of 2016. The decline in the ratio quarter-over-quarter was principally driven by a reduction in Tier 1 Capital resulting from the return of $6.3 billion of capital to common shareholders as well as the impact of Tax Reform. The decline in the ratio from the fourth quarter of 2016 was largely attributable to a reduction in Tier 1 Capital resulting from the return of $17.1 billion of capital to

common shareholders as well as the impact of Tax Reform, in conjunction with an increase in Total Leverage Exposure primarily due to growth in average on-balance sheet assets.

The following table sets forth Citi’s Supplementary Leverage ratio and related components, assuming full implementation under the U.S. Basel III rules, for the three months ended December 31,


and December 31,

Citibank’s Supplementary Leverage ratio, assuming full implementation under the U.S. Basel III rules, was 6.6% for the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to 6.7% for the third quarter of 2017 and 6.6% for the fourth quarter of 2016. The quarter-over-quarter decrease was primarily driven by a reduction in Tier 1 Capital resulting from the impact of Tax Reform, partially offset by capital contributions from Citibank’s parent, Citicorp, as well as a decrease in Total Leverage Exposure primarily due to a decline in potential future exposure on derivative contracts. The ratio remained unchanged from the fourth quarter of 2016, as an increase in Tier 1 Capital was offset by an increase in Total Leverage Exposure.


Regulatory Capital Standards Developments

The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (Basel Committee) issued several proposed and final rules during 2017, the most significant of which was designed to address final revisions or enhancements to the Basel III capital framework.

Basel III: Finalizing Post-Crisis Regulatory Capital Reforms

In December 2017, the Basel Committee issued a rule that finalizes several outstanding Basel III post-crisis regulatory capital reforms. The reforms, which generally become effective in 2022, relate to the methodologies in deriving credit and operational risk-weighted assets, the imposition of a new aggregate output floor for risk-weighted assets, and revisions to the leverage ratio framework.

The final rule, in part, revises the Standardized Approach in measuring credit risk-weighted assets with respect to certain on-balance sheet assets, such as in relation to the risk-weighting methodologies employed with respect to bank, corporate, and real estate (both residential and commercial) exposures; the treatment of off-balance sheet commitments; and aspects of the credit risk mitigation framework. Moreover, the final rule permits the use of external credit ratings combined with due diligence requirements in the calculation of credit risk-weighted assets for exposures to banks and corporates, while also providing alternative approaches for jurisdictions that do not allow the use of external credit ratings for risk-based capital purposes, such as the U.S.

The final rule also revises the internal ratings-based (IRB) approaches, in part, by prohibiting the use of such approaches for so-called “low default” exposures, including those to banks and other financial institutions, as well as large corporations. Further, the final rule also prohibits the use of the IRB approaches for equity exposures in the banking book. Additionally, for other exposures where the IRB approaches are still permissible, the final rule establishes floors by exposure type regarding the estimation of certain model parameters used in the derivation of credit risk-weighted assets, and also provides greater specification as to permissible parameter estimation practices under the IRB approaches.

Apart from credit risk, the final rule substantially revises the operational risk capital framework applicable to the Advanced Approaches for calculating risk-weighted assets by introducing the Standardized Measurement Approach (SMA). Operational risk capital is derived under the SMA through the combination of two components: a so-called “Business Indicator Component” and a “Loss Component.” The Business Indicator Component, primarily reflective of various income statement elements (i.e., a modified gross income indicator), is calculated as the sum of the three-year average of its components. The Loss Component reflects the operational loss exposure of a banking organization that can be inferred from internal loss experience, and is based on a 10-year average.

To reduce excessive variability with respect to risk-weighted assets, and to therefore enhance the comparability of risk-based capital ratios, the final rule establishes a floor requirement that is to be applied to total risk-weighted assets. More specifically, the risk-weighted assets that banks must use to determine compliance with risk-based capital requirements

must be calculated as the maximum of (i) total risk-weighted assets calculated using the approaches that the bank has supervisory approval to use in accordance with the Basel III capital framework (including both standardized and internally-modeled based approaches), and (ii) 72.5% of the total risk-weighted assets, calculated using only standardized approaches.

Lastly, the final rule revises the design and calibration of the Basel III leverage ratio (similar to the U.S. Basel III Supplementary Leverage ratio). Among the revisions are those with respect to the exposure measure (i.e., the denominator of the ratio) in relation to the treatment of derivative exposures, provisions, and off-balance sheet exposures.

Although the U.S. banking agencies subsequently issued a statement announcing support for these finalized Basel III reforms, further indicating that they will “consider how to appropriately apply these revisions,” significant uncertainty nonetheless currently exists with regard to the manner and timeframe in which these Basel III capital reforms will be implemented in the U.S.

Pillar 3 Disclosure Requirements—Consolidated and

Enhanced Framework

In March 2017, the Basel Committee issued a final rule

that adopts further revisions arising from the second phase of its review of the “Pillar 3” disclosure requirements, and which builds on the initial revisions from phase one of the review, which were finalized in January 2015.

The final rule consolidates all existing Basel Committee disclosure requirements into the Pillar 3 framework, with these constituting the disclosure requirements regarding the composition of capital, leverage ratio, Liquidity Coverage Ratio, Net Stable Funding Ratio, indicators for measuring the global systemic importance of banks, Countercyclical Capital Buffer, interest rate risk in the banking book, and remuneration. Moreover, the final rule introduces enhancements to the Pillar 3 framework, in part, by incorporating a “dashboard” of a banking organization’s key regulatory capital and liquidity metrics. The final rule also sets forth revisions and additions to the Pillar 3 framework resulting from ongoing reforms to the regulatory capital framework, including incorporating disclosure requirements arising from the Financial Stability Board’s total loss-absorbing capacity (TLAC) regime applicable to global systemically important banks (GSIBs), and revised disclosure requirements for market risk attributable to the revised market risk framework.

The Basel Committee announced in the final rule that it had commenced the third phase of its review of “Pillar 3” disclosure requirements, which will build further upon the revisions arising from the second phase of its review. Among other requirements, the third phase will include development of any disclosure requirements arising from the finalization of the Basel III post-crisis regulatory reforms.

Citi is currently subject to the Advanced Approaches disclosure requirements, as well as those with respect to market risk, under the U.S. Basel III rules. The U.S. banking agencies may revise the nature and extent of these disclosure


requirements in the future, as a result of the Basel Committee’s revised Pillar 3 disclosure requirements.

Regulatory Treatment of Accounting Provisions for Expected Credit Losses—Interim Approach and Transitional Arrangements

In March 2017, the Basel Committee issued a final rule that retains, for an interim period, the current Basel III treatment, under both the Standardized Approach and Internal Ratings-Based Approaches, applicable to accounting provisions for credit losses. Such measure is in recognition of the promulgation by both the International Accounting Standards Board and more recently the U.S. Financial Accounting Standards Board of new accounting pronouncements (IFRS 9, “

Financial Instruments

,” and ASU No. 2016-13, “

Financial Instruments—Credit Losses

,” respectively) regarding the impairment of financial assets and adoption of provisioning standards which incorporate forward-looking assessments in the estimation of expected credit losses, which represents a substantial departure from the recognition of credit losses under the current incurred loss model. Measuring the impairment of loans and other financial assets under expected credit loss models may result in earlier recognition of, and higher accounting provisions for, credit losses, and consequently may increase volatility in regulatory capital. The current Basel III treatment is being retained so as to afford the Basel Committee additional time in which to thoroughly consider and develop a permanent regulatory capital treatment with respect to accounting provisions for expected credit losses.

Moreover, the final rule provides for optional transitional arrangements, which may be availed by jurisdictions, that would permit banking organizations to more evenly absorb the potentially significant adverse impact on regulatory capital arising from the recognition of higher expected credit loss provisions. The final rule also establishes standards with which these transitional arrangements must comply.

The U.S. banking agencies may revise the Basel III rules in the future in conjunction with the adoption by U.S. banking organizations of the current expected credit loss model as set forth under ASU 2016-13.

Revised Assessment Framework for Global Systemically Important Banks

In March 2017, the Basel Committee issued a consultative document which proposes revisions to the framework for assessing the global systemic importance of banks. The current framework employed by the Basel Committee as to the identification of GSIBs and the assessment of a surcharge is based primarily on quantitative measurement indicators underlying five equally weighted broad categories of systemic importance: (i) size, (ii) interconnectedness, (iii) cross-jurisdictional activity, (iv) substitutability/financial institution infrastructure, and (v) complexity. With the exception of size, each of the other categories is composed of multiple indicators, amounting to 12 indicators in total.

The proposal, which reflects the results of the Basel Committee’s planned initial review, sets forth several modifications to its GSIB framework, the most significant of

which for Citi would be the removal of the existing cap on the substitutability/financial institution infrastructure category. Among the other changes proposed by the Basel Committee and estimated to be of lesser impact to Citi, would be the introduction within the substitutability/financial institution infrastructure category of a trading volume indicator, accompanied by an equivalent reduction in the current weighting of the existing underwriting indicator. Moreover, the Basel Committee’s proposed requirement to expand the scope of consolidation to include exposures of insurance subsidiaries within the size, interconnectedness, and complexity categories would raise the global aggregate of these respective measures of systemic importance to which all GSIBs are subject, and as a result it is estimated that Citi would benefit on a relative basis vis-a-vis certain other GSIBs, given that its insurance subsidiaries are presently consolidated under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and for regulatory purposes. Aside from these proposed modifications, the Basel Committee is also separately seeking feedback on the potential for a new indicator regarding short-term wholesale funding.

In contrast, a U.S. bank holding company that is designated a GSIB under the Federal Reserve Board’s rule is required, on an annual basis, to calculate a surcharge using two methods, and is subject to the higher of the resulting two surcharges. The first method (“method 1”) is based on the same five broad categories of systemic importance resident under the Basel Committee’s framework to identify a GSIB and derive a surcharge. Under the second method (“method 2”), the substitutability category is replaced with a quantitative measure intended to assess the extent of a GSIB’s reliance on short-term wholesale funding.

Accordingly, if the Federal Reserve Board were to adopt the Basel Committee’s proposed revisions with respect to the U.S. GSIB framework, Citi’s method 1 GSIB surcharge could potentially increase, while its method 2 GSIB surcharge would remain unchanged. Further, while it is currently estimated that under these circumstances method 2 would remain Citi’s binding constraint for GSIB surcharge purposes, nonetheless an increase in Citi’s method 1 GSIB surcharge could impact the extent to which Citi satisfies certain TLAC minimum requirements in the future.

Revisions to the Securitization Framework

In July 2017, the Basel Committee issued two consultative documents: one which establishes criteria for identifying “simple, transparent, and comparable” (STC) short-term securitizations, and another which provides for an alternative, and potentially preferential, regulatory capital treatment for short-term securitizations identified as STC. The Basel Committee had previously issued criteria solely for identifying STC securitizations in July 2015, and also previously issued an alternative regulatory capital treatment for STC securitizations in July 2016. The July 2017 consultative documents, however, introduce identification criteria and regulatory capital treatments that are uniquely tailored to short-term securitizations, with a focus on exposures related to asset-backed commercial paper conduits.


The U.S. banking agencies may revise the regulatory capital treatment of STC short-term securitizations in the future, based upon any revisions adopted by the Basel Committee.

Identification and Management of Step-in Risk

In October 2017, the Basel Committee issued final guidelines regarding the identification and management of so-called “step-in risk,” which is defined as “the risk that a bank decides to provide financial support to an unconsolidated entity that is facing stress, in the absence of, or in excess of, any contractual obligations to provide such support.” The guidelines establish a framework to be used by banks for conducting a self-assessment of step-in risk, which would also be reported to each bank’s respective national supervisors. The self-assessment of step-in risk should consider the risk characteristics of certain unconsolidated entities, as well as the bank’s relationship to such entities. The framework, however, does not require any additional regulatory capital or liquidity charges beyond the current Basel III rules.

The Basel Committee expects the guidelines to be enacted by member jurisdictions no later than 2020. The U.S. banking agencies may issue guidelines regarding the identification and measurement of step-in risk in the future, as a result of the Basel Committee’s guidelines.


Tangible Common Equity, Tangible Book Value Per Share, Book Value Per Share and Returns on Equity

Tangible common equity (TCE), as defined by Citi, represents common equity less goodwill and other intangible assets (other than MSRs). Other companies may calculate TCE in a different manner. TCE, tangible book value per share and returns on average TCE are non-GAAP financial measures. Citi believes these capital metrics provide alternative measures of capital strength and performance and are commonly used by investors and industry analysts.
