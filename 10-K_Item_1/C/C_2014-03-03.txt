Item 1. Business

OVERVIEW

Citigroup’s history dates back to the founding of Citibank in 1812. Citigroup’s original corporate predecessor was incorporated in 1988 under the laws of the State of Delaware. Following a series of transactions over a number of years, Citigroup Inc. was formed in 1998 upon the merger of Citicorp and Travelers Group Inc.

Citigroup is a global diversified financial services holding company, whose businesses provide consumers, corporations, governments and institutions with a broad range of financial products and services, including consumer banking and credit, corporate and investment banking, securities brokerage, transaction services and wealth management. Citi has approximately 200 million customer accounts and does business in more than 160 countries and jurisdictions.

At December 31, 2013, Citi had approximately 251,000 full-time employees, compared to approximately 259,000 full-time employees at December 31, 2012.

Citigroup currently operates, for management reporting purposes, via two primary business segments: Citicorp, consisting of Citi’s

Global Consumer Banking

businesses and

Institutional Clients Group

; and Citi Holdings, consisting of businesses and portfolios of assets that Citigroup has determined are not central to its core Citicorp businesses.  For a further description of the business segments and the products and services they provide, see “Citigroup Segments” below, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Throughout this report, “Citigroup,” “Citi” and “the Company” refer to Citigroup Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries.

Please see “Risk Factors” and "Forward-Looking Statements" below for a discussion of the most significant risks and uncertainties that could impact Citigroup’s businesses, financial condition and results of operations.


As described above, Citigroup is managed pursuant to the following segments:

*

Effective in the first quarter of 2014, certain business activities within

Securities and Banking

and

Transaction Services

will be realigned and aggregated as

Banking

and

Markets and Securities Services

components within the

ICG

segment. The change is due to the realignment of the management structure within the

ICG

segment and will have no impact on any total segment-level information. Citi intends to release a revised Quarterly Financial Data Supplement reflecting this realignment prior to the release of first quarter of 2014 earnings information

.

The following are the four regions in which Citigroup operates. The regional results are fully reflected in the segment results above.


MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION

AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Overview

2013—Steady Progress on Execution Priorities and Strategy Despite Continued Challenging Operating Environment

2013 represented a continued challenging operating environment for Citigroup in several respects, including:

•

changing expectations regarding the Federal Reserve Board’s tapering of quantitative easing and the impact of this uncertainty on the markets, trading environment and customer activity;

•

the increasing costs of legal settlements across the financial services industry as Citi continued to work through its legacy legal issues; and

•

a continued low interest rate environment.

These issues significantly impacted Citi’s results of operations, particularly during the second half of 2013.  Despite these challenges, however, Citi made progress on its execution priorities as identified in early 2013, including:

•

Efficient resource allocation, including disciplined expense management—During 2013, Citi completed the significant repositioning actions announced in the fourth quarter of 2012, which resulted in the exit of markets that do not fit Citi’s strategy and contributed to the reduction in its operating expenses year-over-year (see discussion below).

•

Continued focus on the wind down of Citi Holdings and getting Citi Holdings closer to “break even”—Citi Holdings’ assets declined by $39 billion, or 25%, during 2013, and the net loss for this segment improved by approximately 49% (see discussion below).  Citi also was  able to resolve certain of its legacy legal issues during 2013, including entering into agreements with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac relating to residential mortgage representation and warranty repurchase matters.

•

Utilization of deferred tax assets (DTAs)—Citi utilized approximately $2.5 billion of its DTAs during 2013, including $700 million in the fourth quarter.

While making good progress on these initiatives in 2013, Citi expects the operating environment in 2014 to remain challenging.  Short-term interest rates likely will remain low for some time, and thus spread compression could continue to impact most of Citi’s major geographies during the year. (As used throughout this Form 10-K, spread compression refers to the reduction in net interest revenue as a percentage of loans or deposits, as applicable, driven by either lower yields on interest-earning assets or higher costs to fund such assets, or a combination thereof). Given the current litigation and regulatory environment, Citi expects its legal and related expenses will likely remain elevated in 2014. There continues to be uncertainty regarding tapering by the Federal Reserve

Board and its impact on the markets, including the emerging markets, and global trading environment.  In addition, despite an improved economic environment in 2013, there continues to be questions about the sustainability and pace of ongoing improvement in various markets. Finally, Citi continues to face significant regulatory changes, uncertainties and costs in the U.S. and non-U.S. jurisdictions in which it operates.  For a more detailed discussion of these and other risks that could impact Citi’s businesses, results of operations and financial condition during 2014, see “Risk Factors” below.

Despite these ongoing challenges, however, Citi remains highly focused on the continued execution of the priorities discussed above and its strategy, which continues to be to wind down Citi Holdings as soon as practicable in an economically rational manner and leverage its unique global network to:

•

be a leading provider of financial services to the world’s largest multi-national corporations and investors; and

•

be the preeminent bank for the emerging affluent and affluent consumers in the world’s largest urban centers.

2013 Summary Results

Citigroup

Citigroup reported net income of $13.7 billion and diluted earnings per share of $4.35 in 2013, compared to $7.5 billion and $2.44 per share, respectively, in 2012.  In 2013, results included a credit valuation adjustment (CVA) on derivatives (counterparty and own-credit), net of hedges, and debt valuation adjustment (DVA) on Citi’s fair value option debt of  a pretax loss of $342 million ($213 million after-tax)

as Citi’s credit spreads tightened during the year, compared to a pretax  loss of $2.3 billion ($1.4 billion after-tax) in 2012.  Results in the third quarter of 2013 also included a $176 million tax benefit, compared to a $582 million tax benefit in the third quarter of 2012, each of which related to the resolution of certain tax audit items and were recorded in

Corporate/Other

.  In addition, 2013 results included a $189 million after-tax benefit related to the divestiture of Credicard, Citi’s non-Citibank branded cards and consumer finance business in Brazil (Credicard), recorded in

Corporate/Other

(see Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements).  Citigroup’s 2012 results included a pretax loss of $4.6 billion ($2.9 billion after-tax) related to the sale of minority investments (for additional information, see “

Corporate/Other

” below), as well as approximately $1.0 billion of fourth quarter 2012 pretax repositioning charges ($653 million after-tax).

Excluding the items above, Citi’s net income was $13.5 billion, or $4.30 per diluted share in 2013, up 11% compared to $11.9 billion, or $3.86 per share, in the prior year, as higher revenues, lower operating expenses and lower net credit losses were partially offset by a lower net loan loss reserve release and a higher effective tax rate in 2013 (see Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements).  (Citi’s results of operations excluding the impact of CVA/DVA, the impact of the Credicard divestiture, the impact of minority investments,


the repositioning charges in the fourth quarter of 2012 and the impact of the tax benefits, each as discussed above, are non-GAAP financial measures.  Citi believes the presentation of its results of operations excluding these impacts provides a more meaningful depiction of the underlying fundamentals of its businesses.)

Citi’s revenues, net of interest expense, were $76.4 billion in 2013, up 10% versus the prior year.  Excluding CVA/DVA and the impact of minority investments in 2012, revenues were $76.7 billion, up 1%, as revenues in Citi Holdings increased 22% compared to the prior year, while revenues in Citicorp were broadly unchanged.  Net interest revenues of $46.8 billion were unchanged versus the prior year, largely driven by continued spread compression in

Transaction Services

in Citicorp, offset by improvements in Citi Holdings, principally reflecting lower funding costs.  Excluding CVA/DVA and the impact of minority investments in 2012, non-interest revenues of $29.9 billion were up 2% from the prior year, principally driven by higher revenues in

Securities and Banking, Latin America Regional Consumer Banking (RCB)

and

Transaction Services

in Citicorp, as well as the absence of repurchase reserve builds for representation and warranty claims in Citi Holdings. The increase was partially offset by a decline in mortgage origination revenues, due to significantly lower U.S. mortgage refinancing activity in

North America

RCB

, particularly in the second half of 2013.

Operating Expenses

Citigroup expenses decreased 3% versus the prior year to $48.4 billion.  In 2013, Citi incurred legal and related costs of $3.0 billion, compared to $2.8 billion in the prior year.  Excluding legal and related costs, the repositioning charges in the fourth quarter of 2012 and the impact of foreign exchange translation into U.S. dollars for reporting purposes (FX translation), which lowered reported expenses by approximately $600 million in 2013 compared to 2012, operating expenses remained relatively unchanged at $45.4 billion compared to $45.5 billion

in the prior year.  (Citi’s results of operations excluding the impact of FX translation are non-GAAP financial measures.  Citigroup believes the presentation of its results of operations excluding the impact of FX translation is a more meaningful depiction of the underlying fundamentals of its businesses impacted by FX translation.)

Citicorp’s expenses were $42.5 billion, down 5% from the prior year, primarily reflecting efficiency savings and lower legal and related costs and repositioning charges, partially offset by volume-related expenses and ongoing investments in the businesses.  In addition, as disclosed on February 28, 2014, Citicorp’s expenses in the fourth quarter of 2013 were impacted as a result of a fraud discovered in Banco Nacional de Mexico (Banamex), a Citi subsidiary in Mexico.  The fraud increased fourth quarter of 2013 operating expenses in

Transaction Services

by an estimated $400 million, with an offset to compensation expense of approximately $40 million associated with the Banamex variable compensation plan.  For further information, see “

Institutional Clients Group—Transaction Services

” below and Note 29 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Citi Holdings expenses increased 13% year-over-year to $5.9 billion, primarily due to higher legal and related expenses, partially offset by the continued decline in assets and the resulting decline in operating expenses.

Credit Costs and Allowance for Loan Losses

Citi’s total provisions for credit losses and for benefits and claims of $8.5 billion declined 25% from the prior year.  Net credit losses of $10.5 billion were down 26% from 2012.  Consumer net credit losses declined 27% to $10.3 billion, reflecting improvements in the

North America

mortgage portfolio within Citi Holdings,

as well as

North America

Citi-branded cards and Citi retail services portfolios in Citicorp.  Corporate net credit losses decreased 10% year-over-year to $201 million, driven primarily by continued credit improvement in

Securities and Banking

in Citicorp.

The net release of allowance for loan losses and unfunded lending commitments was $2.8 billion in 2013, 27% lower than 2012.  Citicorp’s net reserve release declined 66% to $736 million, primarily due to a lower reserve release in

North America

Citi-branded cards and Citi retail services and volume-related loan loss reserve builds in international

Global Consumer Banking (GCB)

.  Citi Holdings net reserve release increased 27% to $2.0 billion, substantially all of which related to the

North America

mortgage portfolio.  $2.6 billion of the $2.8 billion net reserve release related to Consumer lending, with the remainder applicable to Corporate.

Citigroup’s total allowance for loan losses was $19.6 billion at year-end 2013, or 2.98% of total loans, compared to $25.5 billion, or 3.92%, at the end of the prior year.  The decline in the total allowance for loan losses reflected the continued wind down of Citi Holdings and overall continued improvement in the credit quality of the loan portfolios.

The Consumer allowance for loan losses was $17.1 billion, or 4.35% of total Consumer loans, at year-end 2013, compared to $22.7 billion, or 5.57% of total loans, at year-end 2012.  Total non-accrual assets fell to $9.4 billion, a 22% reduction compared to year-end 2012.  Corporate non-accrual loans declined 18% to $1.9 billion, while Consumer non-accrual loans declined 23% to $7.0 billion, both reflecting continued credit improvement.

Capital

Citigroup’s Tier 1 Capital and Tier 1 Common ratios were 13.7% and 12.6% as of December 31, 2013, respectively, compared to 14.1% and 12.7% as of December 31, 2012.  Citi’s estimated Tier 1 Common ratio under Basel III was 10.6% at year-end 2013, up from an estimated 8.7% at year-end 2012.  Citigroup’s estimated Basel III Supplementary Leverage ratio for the fourth quarter 2013 was 5.4%. (For additional information on Citi’s estimated Basel III Tier 1 Common ratio, Supplementary Leverage ratio and related components, see “Risk Factors—Regulatory Risks” and “Capital Resources” below.)

Citicorp

Citicorp net income increased 11% from the prior year to $15.6 billion.  The increase largely reflected a lower impact of CVA/DVA and lower repositioning charges, partially offset by


higher provisions for income taxes.  CVA/DVA, recorded in

Securities and Banking

,

was a negative $345 million in 2013, compared to negative $2.5 billion in the prior year (for a summary of CVA/DVA by business within

Securities and Banking

for 2013 and comparable periods, see “

Institutional Clients Group

” below).  Results in the third quarter of 2013 also included the $176 million tax benefit in 2013, compared to the $582 million tax benefit in the third quarter of 2012, and the $189 million after-tax benefit related to the divestiture of Credicard.  Citicorp’s full year 2012 results included a pretax loss of $53 million ($34 million after-tax) related to the sale of minority investments as well as $951 million of pretax repositioning charges in the fourth quarter of 2012 ($604 million after-tax).

Excluding these items, Citicorp’s net income was $15.4 billion, down 1% from the prior year, as lower operating expenses and lower net credit losses were largely offset by a lower net loan loss reserve release and a higher effective tax rate in 2013.

Citicorp revenues, net of interest expense, increased 3% from the prior year to $71.8 billion.  Excluding CVA/DVA and the impact of minority investments, Citicorp revenues were $72.2 billion in 2013, relatively unchanged from 2012.

GCB

revenues of $38.2 billion declined 2% versus the prior year.

North America GCB

revenues declined 6% to $19.8 billion, and international

GCB

revenues (consisting of

Asia RCB

,

Latin America RCB

and

EMEA RCB

) increased 1% year-over-year to $18.4 billion.  Excluding the impact of FX translation, international

GCB

revenues rose 3% year-over-year, driven by 7% revenue growth in

Latin America RCB

, partially offset by a 1% revenue decline in both

EMEA RCB

and

Asia RCB

.

Securities and Banking

revenues were $23.0 billion in 2013, up 15% from the prior year.  Excluding CVA/DVA,

Securities and Banking

revenues were $23.4 billion, or 4% higher than the prior year.

Transaction Services

revenues were $10.6 billion, down 1% from the prior year, but relatively unchanged excluding the impact of FX translation (for the impact of FX translation on 2013 results of operations for each of

EMEA RCB, Latin America RCB, Asia RCB

and

Transaction Services

, see the table accompanying the discussion of each respective business’ results of operations below).

Corporate/Other

revenues, excluding the impact of minority investments, increased to $77 million from $17 million in the prior year, mainly reflecting hedging gains.

In

North America RCB

, the revenue decline was driven by lower mortgage origination revenues due to the significant decline in U.S. mortgage refinancing activity, particularly in the second half of the year, partially offset by higher revenues in Citi retail services, mostly driven by the Best Buy portfolio acquisition in the third quarter of 2013.

North America RCB

average deposits of $166 billion grew 8% year-over-year and average retail loans of $43 billion grew 3%.  Average card loans of $107 billion declined 2%, driven by increased payment rates resulting from ongoing consumer deleveraging, while card purchase sales of $240 billion increased 3% versus the prior year.  For additional information on the results of operations of

North America RCB

for 2013, see “

Global Consumer Banking

” below.

Year-over-year, international

GCB

average deposits declined 2%, while average retail loans increased 6%, investment sales increased 15%, average card loans increased 3%, and international card purchase sales increased 7%, all excluding Credicard and the impact of FX translation.  The decline in

Asia RCB

revenues, excluding the impact of FX translation, reflected the continued impact of spread compression, regulatory changes in certain markets and the ongoing repositioning of Citi’s franchise in Korea.  For additional information on the results of operations of

Asia RCB

for 2013, see “

Global Consumer Banking—Asia Regional Consumer Banking

” below.

In

Securities and Banking

, fixed income markets revenues of $13.1 billion, excluding CVA/DVA, declined 7% from the prior year, primarily reflecting industry-wide weakness in rates and currencies, partially offset by strong performance in credit-related and securitized products and commodities.  Equity markets revenues of $3.0 billion in 2013, excluding CVA/DVA, were 22% above the prior year driven primarily by market share gains, continued improvement in cash and derivative trading performance and a more favorable market environment.  Investment banking revenues rose 8% from the prior year to $4.0 billion, principally driven by higher revenues in equity underwriting and advisory, partially offset by lower debt underwriting revenues.  Lending revenues of $1.2 billion increased 40% from the prior year, driven by lower mark-to-market losses on hedges related to accrual loans due to less significant credit spread tightening versus 2012.  Excluding the mark-to-market on hedges related to accrual loans, core lending revenues decreased 4%, primarily due to increased hedge premium costs and moderately lower loan balances, partially offset by higher spreads.  Private Bank revenues of $2.5 billion increased 4% from the prior year, excluding CVA/DVA, with growth across all regions and products, particularly in managed investments and capital markets.

Securities and Banking

for 2013, see “

Institutional Clients Group—Securities and Banking

” below.

In

Transaction Services,

growth from higher deposit balances, trade loans and fees from increased market volumes was offset by continued spread compression.  Excluding the impact of FX translation, Securities and Fund

Services revenues increased 4%, as growth in settlement volumes and assets under custody were partially offset by spread compression related to deposits.  Treasury and Trade Solutions revenues decreased 1% excluding the impact of FX translation, as the ongoing impact of spread compression globally was partially offset by higher balances and fee growth.  For additional information on the results of operations of

Transaction Services

for 2013, see “

Institutional Clients Group

—

Transaction Services

” below.

Citicorp end-of-period loans increased 6% year-over-year to $573 billion, with 2% growth in Consumer loans and 11% growth in Corporate loans.

Citi Holdings

Citi Holdings’ net loss was $1.9 billion in 2013 compared to a $6.5 billion net loss in 2012.  The decline in the net loss year-over-year was primarily driven by the absence of the 2012


pretax loss of $4.7 billion ($2.9 billion after-tax) related to the Morgan Stanley Smith Barney joint venture (MSSB).  Excluding the 2012 MSSB loss, $77 million ($49 million after-tax) of repositioning charges in the fourth quarter 2012 and CVA/DVA (positive $3 million in 2013 compared to positive $157 million in 2012), Citi Holdings net loss of $1.9 billion in 2013 improved 49% from a net loss of $3.7 billion in the prior year.  The improvement in the net loss was due to significantly lower provisions for credit losses and higher revenue, partially offset by the increase in expenses driven by higher legal and related costs, as discussed above.

Citi Holdings revenues increased to $4.5 billion, compared to a negative $792 million in the prior year.  Excluding the 2012 MSSB loss and CVA/DVA, Citi Holdings revenues were $4.5 billion in 2013 compared to $3.7 billion in the prior year.  Net interest revenues increased 22% year-over-year to $3.2 billion, largely driven by lower funding costs.  Non-interest revenues, excluding the 2012 MSSB loss and CVA/DVA, increased 21% to $1.4 billion, primarily driven by lower asset marks and the lower repurchase reserve builds, partially offset by lower consumer revenues and gains on asset sales.

Citi Holdings assets declined 25% year-over-year to $117 billion as of year-end 2013, and represented approximately 6% of total Citi’s GAAP assets and 19% of its estimated risk-weighted assets under Basel III (based on the “Advanced Approaches” for determining risk-weighted assets).

NA RCB

’s 983 retail bank branches as of December 31, 2013 are largely concentrated in the greater metropolitan areas of New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Chicago, Miami, Washington, D.C., Boston, Philadelphia, Dallas, Houston, San Antonio and Austin.

At December 31, 2013,

NA RCB

had approximately 12.0 million customer accounts, $44.1 billion of retail banking loans and $170.2 billion of deposits.  In addition,

NA RCB

had approximately 113.9 million Citi-branded and Citi retail services credit card accounts, with $116.8 billion in outstanding card loan balances, including approximately 13.0 million credit card accounts and $7 billion of loans added in September 2013 as a result of the acquisition of Best Buy’s U.S. credit card portfolio.

NM Not meaningful


2013 vs. 2012

Net income

decreased 14%, mainly driven by lower revenues and lower loan loss reserve releases, partially offset by lower net credit losses and expenses.

Revenues

decreased 6% primarily due to lower retail banking revenues.  Retail banking revenues of $5.4 billion declined 20% due to lower mortgage origination revenues driven by the significantly lower U.S. mortgage refinancing activity, particularly during the second half of 2013 due to higher interest rates.  In addition, retail banking continued to experience ongoing spread compression in the deposit portfolios within the consumer and commercial banking businesses.  Partially offsetting the spread compression was growth in average deposits (8%), average commercial loans (15%) and average retail loans (3%).  While Citi believes mortgage revenues may have broadly stabilized as of year-end 2013, retail banking revenues will likely continue to be negatively impacted in 2014 by the lower mortgage origination revenues and spread compression in the deposit portfolios.

Cards revenues increased 1%.  In Citi-branded cards, revenues were unchanged at $8.2 billion as continued improvement in net interest spreads, reflecting higher yields as promotional balances represented a smaller percentage of the portfolio total as well as lower funding costs, were offset by a 5% decline in average loans.  Citi-branded cards net interest revenue increased 1%, reflecting the higher yields and lower cost of funds, partially offset by the decline in average loans and a continued increased payment rate from consumer deleveraging.  Citi-branded cards non-interest revenue declined 5% due to higher affinity rebates.

Citi retail services revenues increased 3% primarily due to the acquisition of the Best Buy portfolio, partially offset by declining non-interest revenues, driven by improving credit and the resulting impact on contractual partner payments.  Citi retail services net interest revenues increased 6% driven by a 4% increase in average loans, primarily due to the Best Buy U.S. portfolio acquisition, although net interest spreads declined as the percentage of promotional balances within the portfolio increased and could continue to increase into 2014.  Total card purchase sales of $240 billion increased 3% from the prior year, with 3% growth in Citi-branded cards and 5% growth in retail services. Citi expects cards revenues could continue to be negatively impacted by higher payment rates for consumers, reflecting the relatively slow economic recovery and deleveraging as well as Citi’s shift to higher credit quality borrowers.

Expenses

decreased 3%, primarily due to lower legal and related costs and repositioning savings, partially offset by higher

mortgage origination costs in the first half of 2013 and expenses in cards as a result of the Best Buy portfolio acquisition during the second half of the year.

Provisions

increased 7%, as lower net credit losses in the Citi-branded cards and Citi retail services portfolios were offset by continued lower loan loss reserve releases ($1.0 billion in 2013 compared to $2.4 billion in 2012), primarily related to cards, as well as reserve builds for new loans originated in the Best Buy portfolio during the latter part of 2013, which are expected to continue into 2014.

2012 vs. 2011

Net income

increased 18%, mainly driven by higher mortgage revenues in retail banking and a decline in net credit losses, partially offset by a reduction in loan loss reserve releases.

Revenues

increased 5%, driven by a 38% increase in retail banking mortgage revenues resulting from the high level of U.S. refinancing activity as well as higher margins resulting from the shift to retail as compared to third-party origination channels.  Excluding mortgages, revenue from the retail banking business was essentially unchanged, as volume growth and improved mix in the deposit and lending portfolios within the consumer and commercial portfolios were offset by significant spread compression.

Cards revenues declined 4%. In Citi-branded cards, both average loans and net interest revenue declined year-over-year, reflecting continued increased payment rates resulting from consumer deleveraging and the impact of the look-back provisions of The Credit Card Accountability Responsibility and Disclosure Act (CARD Act).  In Citi retail services, net interest revenues improved slightly but were offset by declining non-interest revenues, driven by improving credit and the resulting impact on contractual partner payments.

Expenses

increased 2%, primarily due to increased mortgage origination costs resulting from the higher retail channel mortgage volumes and $100 million of repositioning charges in the fourth quarter of 2012 as well as higher legal and related costs, partially offset by lower expenses in cards.

Provisions

decreased 14%, due to a 29% decline in net credit losses, primarily in the cards portfolios, partly offset by lower loan loss reserve releases ($2.4 billion in 2012 compared to $4.2 billion in 2011).

2013 vs. 2012

Net income

of $48 million compared to a net loss of $36 million in 2012 as lower expenses and lower net credit losses were partially offset by lower revenues, primarily due to the sales of Citi’s consumer operations in Turkey and Romania during 2013.

Revenues

decreased 1%, mainly driven by the lower revenues resulting from the sales of the consumer operations referenced above, partially offset by higher volumes in core markets and a gain on sale related to the Turkey sale.  Net interest revenue decreased 5%, due to continued spread compression in cards and an 8% decrease in average cards loans, primarily due to the sales in Turkey and Romania, partially offset by growth in average retail loans of 13%. Interest rate caps on credit cards, particularly in Poland, the continued liquidation of a higher yielding non-strategic retail banking portfolio and the continued low interest rate environment were the main contributors to the lower net interest spreads.  Citi expects continued regulatory changes, including caps on interchange rates, and spread compression to continue to negatively impact revenues in this business during 2014.  Non-interest revenue increased 6%, mainly reflecting higher investment fees and card fees due to increased sales volume and the gain on sale related to Turkey, partially offset by lower revenues due to the sales in Turkey and Romania.  Cards purchase sales decreased 4% and investment sales decreased 5% due to the sales in Turkey and Romania.  Excluding the impact of these divestitures, cards purchase sales increased 9% and investment sales increased 12%.

Expenses

declined 6%, primarily due to repositioning savings as well as lower repositioning charges, partially offset by higher volume-related expenses and continued investment spending on new internal operating platforms.

Provisions

declined 49% due to a 35% decrease in net credit losses largely resulting from the sales in Turkey and Romania and a net credit recovery in the second quarter 2013.  Net credit losses also continued to reflect stabilizing credit quality and Citi’s strategic move toward lower-risk customers.

2012 vs. 2011

The

net loss

of $36 million compared to net income of $80 million in 2011 and was mainly due to higher expenses and lower loan loss reserve releases, partially offset by higher revenues.

Revenues

increased 2%, with growth across the major products, particularly in Russia. Year-over-year, cards purchase sales increased 12%, investment sales increased 15% and retail loan volume increased 17%.  Revenue growth year-over-year was partly offset by the absence of Akbank T.A.S. (Akbank), Citi’s equity investment in Turkey, which was moved to

Corporate/Other

in the first quarter of 2012. Net interest revenue increased 18%, driven by the absence of Akbank investment funding costs and growth in average deposits of 5%, average retail loans of 16% and average cards loans of 6%, partially offset by spread compression.  Interest rate caps on credit cards, particularly in Turkey and Poland, the continued liquidation of the higher yielding non-strategic retail banking portfolio and the continued low interest rate environment were the main contributors to the lower net interest spreads.  Non-interest revenue decreased 20%, mainly reflecting the absence of Akbank.

Expenses

increased 13%, primarily due to $57 million of fourth quarter of 2012 repositioning charges in Turkey, Romania and Pakistan and the impact of continued investment spending on new internal operating platforms during 2012.

Provisions

increased $43 million due to lower loan loss reserve releases, partially offset by lower net credit losses across most countries.  Net credit losses decreased 36% due to the ongoing improvement in credit quality and the move toward lower-risk customers.


LATIN AMERICA REGIONAL CONSUMER BANKING

Latin America

as well as Banco Nacional de Mexico, or Banamex, Mexico’s second-largest bank, with nearly 1,700 branches. At December 31, 2013,

Latin America RCB

2013 vs. 2012

Net income

decreased 4% as higher credit costs, higher expenses and a higher effective tax rate (see Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements) were partially offset by higher revenues.

Revenues

increased 7%, primarily due to volume growth in retail banking and cards, partially offset by continued spread compression.  Net interest revenue increased 4% due to increased volumes, partially offset by spread compression.    Non-interest revenue increased 12%, primarily due to higher fees from increased business volumes in retail and cards.  Retail banking revenues increased 5% as average loans increased 12%, investment sales increased 13% and average deposits increased 3%.  Cards revenues increased 11% as average loans increased 10% and purchase sales increased 13%, excluding the impact of Credicard (see Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements).  Citi expects revenues in

Latin America RCB

could continue to be negatively impacted by spread compression during 2014, particularly in Mexico.

Expenses

increased 2% due to increased volume-related costs, mandatory salary increases in certain countries and higher regulatory costs, partially offset by lower repositioning charges and higher repositioning savings.

Provisions

increased 25%, primarily due to higher net credit losses as well as a higher loan loss reserve build.  Net credit losses increased 25%, primarily in the Mexico cards and personal loan portfolios, reflecting both volume growth and portfolio seasoning, which Citi expects to continue into 2014.  The loan loss reserve build increased 50%, primarily due to an increase in reserves in Mexico related to the top three Mexican homebuilders, with the remainder due to portfolio growth and seasoning and the impact of potential losses related to hurricanes in the region during September 2013.

During 2013, homebuilders in Mexico began to experience financial difficulties, primarily due to, among other things, decreases in government subsidies, new government policies promoting vertical housing and an overall renewed government emphasis on urban planning. The loan loss reserve build related to the Mexican homebuilders in 2013 was driven by deterioration in the financial and operating conditions of these companies and decreases in the value of Citi’s collateral securing its loans.  Citi’s outstanding loans to the top three homebuilders totaled $251 million at year-end 2013.  Citi continues to monitor the performance of its Mexico homebuilder clients, as well as the value of its collateral, to determine whether additional reserves or charge-offs may be required in future periods.

Going into 2014, absent any significant market developments, including further deterioration in Citi’s Mexican homebuilders clients or losses from the hurricanes in 2013, Citi expects net credit losses and reserve builds to be in line with portfolio growth and seasoning.

Latin America RCB

from foreign exchange controls, see “Managing Global Risk—Country and Cross-Border Risk—Cross-Border Risk” below.

2012 vs. 2011

Net income

declined 6% as higher revenues were offset by higher credit costs and expenses.

Revenues

increased 8%, primarily due to revenue growth in Mexico and higher volumes, mostly related to personal loans and credit cards.  Net interest revenue increased 9% due to increased volumes, partially offset by continued spread compression.  Non-interest revenue increased 6%, primarily due to increased business volumes in the private pension fund and insurance businesses.

Expenses

increased 7%, primarily due to $131 million of repositioning charges in the fourth quarter of 2012, higher volume-driven expenses and increased legal and related costs.

Provisions

increased 50%, primarily due to increased loan loss reserve builds driven by underlying business volume growth, primarily in Mexico and Colombia.  In addition, net credit losses increased in the retail portfolios, primarily in Mexico, reflecting volume growth.


ASIA REGIONAL CONSUMER BANKING

Asia Regional Consumer Banking (Asia RCB)

provides traditional banking and Citi-branded card services to retail customers and small- to mid-size businesses, with the largest Citi presence in Korea, Australia, Singapore, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Japan, India, Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand and the Philippines.

At December 31, 2013,

Asia RCB

had 553 retail branches, approximately 16.8 million customer accounts, $71.6 billion in retail banking loans and $101.4 billion in deposits. In addition, the business had approximately 16.6 million Citi-branded card accounts with $19.1 billion in outstanding loan balances.

Citi believes the presentation of Asia RCB’s results excluding the impact of FX translation is a more meaningful depiction of the underlying fundamentals of the business. For a reconciliation of certain of these metrics to the reported results, see the table above.

2013 vs. 2012

Net income

decreased 12%, primarily due to a higher effective tax rate (see  Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements) and lower revenues, partially offset by lower expenses.

Revenues

decreased 1%, as lower net interest revenue was partially offset by higher non-interest revenue.  Net interest revenue declined 5%, primarily driven by continued spread compression and the repositioning of the franchise in Korea (see discussion below). Average retail deposits declined 4% resulting from continued efforts to rebalance the deposit portfolio mix.  Average retail loans increased 3% (11% excluding Korea).  Non-interest revenue increased 7%, mainly driven by 22% growth in investment sales volume, despite a decrease in volumes in the second half of the year due to investor sentiment, reflecting overall market uncertainty.  Cards purchase sales grew 7%, with growth across the region.  Despite lower overall revenues in 2013, several key markets within the region experienced revenue growth, including Hong Kong, India, Thailand and China, partially offset by regulatory changes in the region, particularly Korea as well as Indonesia, Australia and Taiwan.

Citi expects regulatory changes and spread compression to continue to have an adverse impact on

Asia RCB

revenues during 2014.  In addition, consistent with its strategy to concentrate its consumer banking operations in major metropolitan areas and focus on high quality consumer segments, Citi is in an ongoing process to reposition its consumer franchise in Korea to improve its operating efficiency and returns.  While revenues in Korea could begin to stabilize in early 2014, this market could continue to have a negative impact on year-over-year revenue comparisons for

Asia RCB

through 2014.

Expenses

declined 3%, as lower repositioning charges and efficiency and repositioning savings were partially offset by increased investment spending, particularly investments in China cards.

Provisions

increased 5%, reflecting a higher loan loss reserve build due to volume growth in China, Hong Kong, India and Singapore as well as regulatory requirements in Korea, partially offset by lower net credit losses.  Despite this increase, overall credit quality in the region remained stable during the year.

2012 vs. 2011

Net income

decreased 5% primarily due to higher expenses.

Revenues

were unchanged year-over-year. Net interest revenue decreased 3%, as the benefit of higher loan and deposit balances was offset by spread compression, mainly in retail lending. Spread compression continued to reflect improvements in the customer risk profile, stricter underwriting criteria and the regulatory changes in Korea where policy actions, including rate caps and other initiatives, were implemented to slow the growth of consumer credit in that market, thus impacting volume growth, lending rates and fees. Non-interest revenue increased 6%, reflecting growth in cards purchase sales, partially offset by a decrease in revenue from foreign exchange products.  Despite the continued spread compression and regulatory changes in the region, the underlying business metrics continued to grow, with average retail loans up 6% and average card loans up 2%.

Expenses

increased 5%, primarily due to approximately $78 million of repositioning charges in the fourth quarter of 2012, largely in Korea, and increased investment spending, including China cards and branches, higher volume-driven expenses and increased regulatory costs.

Provisions

increased 1%, primarily due to lower loan loss reserve releases, which was partially offset by lower net credit losses.  Net credit losses continued to improve, declining 2% due to the ongoing improvement in credit quality.

2013 vs. 2012

Net income

increased 45%. Excluding negative $345 million of CVA/DVA (see table below), net income increased 12%, primarily driven by higher revenues and lower expenses, partially offset by a higher effective tax rate (see  Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements).

Revenues

increased 15%. Excluding CVA/DVA:

•

Revenues

increased 4%, reflecting higher revenues in equity markets, investment banking and the Private Bank, partially offset by lower revenues in fixed income markets.  Overall, Citi’s wallet share continued to improve in most major products, while maintaining what Citi believes to be a disciplined risk appetite for the changing market environment during 2013.

•

Fixed income markets revenues decreased 7%, primarily reflecting industry-wide weakness in rates and currencies, partially offset by strong performance in credit-related and securitized products and commodities.  Rates and currencies performance was lower compared to a strong 2012 that benefited from increased client revenues and a more liquid market environment, particularly in

EMEA

.  2013 results also reflected a general slowdown in client activity exacerbated by uncertainty, particularly in the latter part of 2013, around the tapering of quantitative easing as well as geopolitical issues.  Credit-related and securitized products results reflected increased client activity driven by improved market conditions and demand for spread products.  In addition, while not generally material to overall fixed income markets revenues, lower revenues from Citi Capital Advisors (CCA) during 2013 also contributed to the decline in fixed income markets revenue year-over-year, as Citi continued to wind down this business.

•

Equity markets revenues increased 22%, primarily due to market share gains, continued improvement in cash and derivative trading performance and a more favorable market environment.

•

Investment banking revenues increased 8%, reflecting gains in overall investment banking wallet share.  Advisory revenues increased 19%, reflecting an improvement in wallet share, despite a contraction in the overall M&A market wallet.  Equity underwriting revenues increased 51%, driven by improved wallet share and increased market activity, particularly initial public offerings.  Debt underwriting revenues decreased 6%, primarily due to lower bond underwriting fees and a decline in wallet share during the year.

•

Lending revenues increased 40%, driven by lower mark-to-market losses on hedges related to accrual loans (see table below) due to less significant credit spread tightening versus 2012.  Excluding the mark-to-market losses on hedges related to accrual loans, core lending revenues decreased 4%, primarily due to increased hedge premium costs and moderately lower loan balances, partially offset by higher spreads.  Citi expects demand for Corporate loans to remain muted in the current market environment.

•

Private Bank revenues increased 4%, with growth across all regions and products, particularly in managed investments, where growth reflected both higher client assets under management and increased placement fees, as well as in capital markets.  Revenue growth in lending and deposits, primarily driven by growth in client volumes, was partially offset by continued spread compression.

Expenses

decreased 4%, primarily reflecting repositioning savings, the impact of lower performance-based compensation, lower repositioning charges and the impact of FX translation, partially offset by higher legal and related costs and volume-related expenses.

Provisions

decreased $115 million, primarily reflecting higher loan loss reserve releases, partially offset by an increase in the provision for unfunded lending commitments in the Corporate loan portfolio.

2012 vs. 2011

Net income

decreased 10%. Excluding negative $2.5 billion CVA/DVA (see table below), net income increased 56%, primarily driven by an increase in revenues and decrease in expenses.

Revenues

decreased 8%. Excluding CVA/DVA:

•

Revenues

increased 13%, reflecting higher revenues in most major

S&B

businesses. Overall, Citi gained wallet share during 2012 in most major products and regions, while maintaining what it believed to be a disciplined risk appetite for the market environment.

•

Fixed income markets revenues increased 28%, reflecting strong performance in rates and currencies and higher revenues in credit-related and securitized products.  These results reflected an improved market environment and more balanced trading flows, particularly in the second half of 2012.  Rates and currencies performance reflected strong client and trading results in G-10 FX, G-10 rates and Citi’s local markets franchise.  Credit products, securitized markets and municipals products experienced improved trading results, particularly in the second half of 2012, compared to the prior-year period.  Citi’s position serving corporate clients for markets products also contributed to the strength and diversity of client flows.

•

Equity markets revenues increased 1%, due to improved derivatives performance as well as the absence of proprietary trading losses in 2011, partially offset by lower cash equity volumes that impacted the industry as a whole.  Citi’s improved performance in derivatives reflected improved trading and continued progress in capturing additional client wallet share.

•

Investment banking revenues increased 10%, reflecting increases in debt underwriting and advisory revenues, partially offset by lower equity underwriting revenues. Debt underwriting revenues rose 18%, driven by increases in investment grade and high yield bond issuances. Advisory revenues increased 4%, despite the overall reduction in market activity during the year.  Equity


underwriting revenues declined 7%, driven by lower levels of market and client activity.

•

Lending revenues decreased 48%, driven by the mark-to-market losses on hedges related to accrual loans (see table below).  The loss on lending hedges, compared to a gain in the prior year, resulted from credit spreads narrowing during 2012.  Excluding the mark-to-market losses on hedges related to accrual loans, core lending revenues increased 35%, primarily driven by growth in the Corporate loan portfolio and improved spreads in most regions.

•

Private Bank revenues increased 8%, driven by growth in client assets as a result of client acquisition and development efforts in Citi’s targeted client segments. Deposit volumes, investment assets under management and loans all increased, while pricing and product mix optimization initiatives offset underlying spread compression across products.

Expenses

decreased 4%.  Excluding repositioning charges of $349 million in 2012 (including $237 million in the fourth quarter of 2012) compared to $267 million in 2011, expenses also decreased 4%, driven by efficiency savings from ongoing re-engineering programs and lower compensation costs.

Provisions

increased 5% to $122 million, primarily reflecting lower loan loss reserve releases, partially offset by lower net credit losses, both due to portfolio stabilization.

The table below summarizes pretax gains (losses) related to changes in CVA/DVA and hedges on accrual loans for the periods indicated.

2013 vs. 2012

Net income

decreased 12%, primarily due to higher expenses and a higher effective tax rate (see  Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements), partially offset by lower credit costs.

Revenues

were unchanged as growth from higher deposit balances, trade loans and fees from higher market volumes was offset by continued spread compression.  Treasury and Trade Solutions revenues decreased 1%, as the ongoing impact of spread compression globally was partially offset by higher balances and fee growth.  Treasury and Trade Solutions average deposits increased 7% and average trade loans increased 22%, including the impact of the consolidation of approximately $7 billion of trade loans during the second quarter of 2013.  Securities and Fund Services revenues increased 4%, as settlement volumes increased 15% and assets under custody increased 10%, partially offset by spread compression related to deposits.  Despite the overall underlying volume growth, Citi expects spread compression will continue to negatively impact

Transaction Services

net interest revenues in the near term.

Expenses

increased $311 million.  The increase was due to an estimated $360 million charge in the fourth quarter of 2013 related to a fraud discovered in Banamex in February 2014.  Specifically, as more fully described in Citi’s Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 28, 2014, as of December 31, 2013, Citi, through Banamex, had extended approximately $585 million of short-term credit to Oceanografia S.A. de C.V. (OSA), a Mexican oil services company, through an accounts receivable financing program. OSA had been a key supplier to Petr

ó

leos Mexicanos (Pemex), the Mexican state-owned oil company, although, in February 2014, OSA was suspended from being awarded new Mexican government contracts.  Pursuant to the program, Banamex extended credit to OSA to finance accounts receivables due from Pemex.  In February 2014, Citi discovered that credit had been extended to OSA based on fraudulent accounts receivable documentation. The estimated $360 million charge in the fourth quarter of 2013 resulted from the difference between the $585 million Citi had recorded as owed by Pemex to Citi as of December 31, 2013, and an estimated $185 million that Citi currently believes is owed by Pemex, with an offset to compensation expense of approximately $40 million associated with the Banamex variable compensation plan.  Excluding the charge related to the fraud in the fourth quarter of 2013, expenses were unchanged as volume-related growth and increased financial transaction taxes in

EMEA

, which are expected to continue in future periods, were offset by efficiency savings, lower repositioning charges and lower legal and related costs.

Provisions

decreased by 54% due to lower credit costs.  As discussed above, Citi currently believes it is owed approximately $185 million by Pemex pursuant to the Banamex accounts receivable financing program with OSA.

In addition, as of December 31, 2013, Citi, through Banamex, had approximately $33 million in either direct obligations of OSA or standby letters of credit issued on OSA’s behalf.  Citi continues to review the events arising from or relating to the fraud and their potential impacts. Based on its continued review, Citi will determine whether all or any portion of the $33 million of direct loans made to OSA and the remaining approximately $185 million of accounts receivable due from Pemex may be impaired.  Any such impairment would negatively impact provisions in

Transaction Services

in future periods.

(for additional information on Citi’s deposits, see “Managing Global Risk—Market Risk—Funding and Liquidity” below).

2012 vs. 2011

Net income

increased 9%, reflecting growth in revenues, partially offset by higher expenses and credit costs.

Revenues

increased 5% as higher trade loan and deposit balances were partially offset by continued spread compression and lower market volumes.  Treasury and Trade Solutions revenues were up 8%, driven by growth in trade as end-of-period trade loans grew 24%.  Cash management revenues also grew, reflecting growth in deposit balances and fees, partially offset by continued spread compression due to the continued low interest rate environment.  Securities and Fund Services revenues decreased 2%, primarily driven by lower market volumes as well as spread compression on deposits.

Expenses

increased 2%.  Excluding repositioning charges of $134 million in 2012 (including $95 million in the fourth quarter of 2012) compared to $60 million in 2011, expenses were unchanged, primarily driven by incremental investment spending and higher legal and related costs, offset by efficiency savings.

Average deposits and other customer liabilities grew 14%, driven by focused deposit building activities as well as continued market demand for U.S. dollar deposits.

decreased $772 million to $1.1 billion, primarily due to lower expenses and the $189 million after-tax benefit from the sale of Credicard (see “Executive Summary” above and Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements), partially offset by a lower tax benefit.

Revenues

increased $7 million, driven by hedging gains, partially offset by lower revenue from sales of available-for-sale (AFS) securities in 2013.

Expenses

decreased 39%, largely driven by lower legal and related costs and repositioning charges.

2012 vs. 2011

The

Net loss

increased by $1.1 billion, primarily due to a decrease in revenues and an increase in expenses, particularly repositioning charges and legal and related expenses.

Revenues

decreased $692 million, driven by a lower gain on the sale of minority investments in 2012 as compared to 2011 (a net pretax gain of $54 million in 2012 compared to $199 million in 2011), as well as lower investment yields on Citi’s Treasury portfolio and the negative impact of hedging activities.  In 2012, the sale of minority investments included pretax gains of $1.1 billion and $542 million on the sales of Citi’s remaining stake in Housing Development Finance Corporation Ltd. (HDFC) and its stake in Shanghai Pudong Development Bank, respectively, offset by a pretax impairment charge relating to Akbank of $1.2 billion and the net pretax loss of $424 million related to the sale of a 10.1% stake in Akbank (for additional information on Citi’s remaining interest in Akbank, see Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements).  The 2011 pretax gain of $199 million related to the partial sale of Citi’s minority interest in HDFC.

Expenses

increased by $923 million, largely driven by higher legal and related costs as well as higher repositioning charges, including $253 million in the fourth quarter of 2012.


CITI HOLDINGS

Citi Holdings contains businesses and portfolios of assets that Citigroup has determined are not central to its core Citicorp businesses.  As of December 31, 2013, Citi Holdings assets were approximately $117 billion, a decrease of 25% year-over-year. The decline in assets of $39 billion from December 31, 2012 was composed of approximately $19 billion of loan and other asset sales and $20 billion of run-off, pay-downs and charge-offs.  As of December 31, 2013, Citi Holdings represented approximately 6% of Citi’s GAAP assets and 19% of its estimated risk-weighted assets under Basel III (based on the “Advanced Approaches” for determining risk-weighted assets).

As of December 31, 2013, Consumer assets in Citi Holdings were approximately $104 billion, or approximately 89% of Citi Holdings assets. Of the Consumer assets, approximately $73 billion, or 70%, consisted of

North America

residential mortgages (residential first mortgages and home equity loans), including Consumer mortgages originated by Citi’s legacy CitiFinancial

North America

business (approximately $12 billion, or 16%, of the $73 billion as of December 31, 2013).

NM Not meaningful

2013 vs. 2012

The

Net loss

decreased by 71% to $1.9 billion.  CVA/DVA was positive $3 million in 2013, compared to positive $157 million in 2012. 2012 also included the pretax loss of $4.7 billion ($2.9 billion after-tax) related to the sale of the Morgan Stanley Smith Barney joint venture (MSSB) to Morgan Stanley.  Excluding CVA/DVA in both periods and the 2012 MSSB loss, the net loss decreased to $1.9 billion from a net loss of $3.7 billion in 2012, due to significantly lower provisions for credit losses and higher revenues, partially offset by higher expenses.

Revenues

increased to $4.5 billion, primarily due to the absence of the 2012 MSSB loss.  Excluding CVA/DVA in both periods and the 2012 MSSB loss, revenues increased 22%,

primarily driven by lower funding costs and lower residential mortgage repurchase reserve builds for representation and warranty claims.  The repurchase reserve builds were $470 million in 2013, compared to $700 million in 2012 (for additional information on Citi’s repurchase reserve, see “Managing Global Risk—Credit Risk—Citigroup Residential Mortgages—Representations and Warranties Repurchase Reserve” below).  Net interest revenues increased 22%, primarily due to the lower funding costs.  Excluding the CVA/DVA in both periods and 2012 MSSB loss, non-interest revenues increased 21% to $1.4 billion, primarily driven by lower asset marks and the lower repurchase reserve builds, partially offset by lower consumer revenues and gains on asset sales.


Expenses

increased 13%, primarily due to higher legal and related costs ($2.6 billion in 2013 compared to $1.2 billion in 2012), driven largely by legacy private-label securitization and other mortgage-related issues, partially offset by lower overall assets.  Excluding legal and related costs, expenses declined 19% versus 2012.  During 2013, approximately one-third of Citi Holdings’ expenses, excluding legal and related costs, consisted of mortgage-related expenses.  Citi expects that the sale of mortgage servicing rights (MSRs) announced in January 2014 should benefit mortgage expenses in Citi Holdings during 2014 (see “Managing Global Risk—Credit Risk—Mortgage Servicing Rights” below). While Citi may seek to execute similar sales in the future, such sales often require investor and other approvals and could also be subject to regulatory review.

Provisions

decreased 66%, driven by the absence of incremental net credit losses relating to the national mortgage settlement and those required by OCC guidance during 2012 (see discussion below), as well as improved credit in

North America

mortgages and overall lower asset levels.

Loan loss reserve releases increased 31% to $2 billion, which included a loan loss reserve release of approximately $2.2 billion related to the

North America

mortgage portfolio, partially offset by losses on asset sales.  Loan loss reserves related to the

North America

mortgage portfolio were utilized to offset a substantial portion of the

North America

mortgage portfolio net credit losses during 2013.

2012 vs. 2011

The

Net loss

increased by 56% to $6.5 billion, primarily due to the 2012 MSSB loss.  CVA/DVA was positive $157 million, compared to positive $74 million in 2011.  Excluding CVA/DVA in both periods and the 2012 MSSB loss, the net loss decreased to $3.7 billion compared to a net loss of $4.2 billion in 2011, as lower revenues were partially offset by lower expenses, lower provisions and a tax benefit on the sale of a business in 2012.

Revenues

decreased $7.1 billion to negative $792 million, primarily due to the 2012 MSSB loss.  Excluding CVA/DVA in both periods and the 2012 MSSB loss, revenues decreased 40%, primarily due to lower loan balances driven by continued asset sales, divestitures and run-off and higher funding costs related to MSSB assets, the absence of private equity marks and lower gains on sales.

Expenses

decreased 19%, driven by lower volumes and divestitures and slightly lower legal and related costs.

Provisions

decreased 19%, driven primarily by improved credit in

North America

mortgages and lower volumes and divestitures, partially offset by lower loan loss reserve releases.  Net credit losses decreased by 32% to $5.8 billion, primarily reflecting improvements in

North America

mortgages and despite being impacted by incremental mortgage charge-offs of approximately $635 million required by OCC guidance regarding the treatment of mortgage loans where the borrower has gone through Chapter 7 bankruptcy and approximately $370 million related to previously deferred principal balances on modified mortgages related to anticipated forgiveness of principal in connection with the national mortgage settlement.  In addition, net credit losses in

2012 were negatively impacted by an additional aggregate amount of $146 million related to the national mortgage settlement (see “Managing Global Risk—Credit Risk—National Mortgage Settlement” below).

Japan Consumer Finance

In 2008, Citi decided to exit its Japan Consumer Finance business and has liquidated approximately 92% of the portfolio since that time.  While the portfolio has been significantly reduced, Citi continues to monitor various aspects of this legacy business relating to the charging of “gray zone” interest, including customer defaults, refund claims and litigation, as well as financial, legislative, regulatory, judicial and other political developments.  Gray zone interest represents interest at rates that are legal but for which claims may not be enforceable.

As of December 31, 2013, Citi’s Japan Consumer Finance business had approximately $278 million in outstanding loans that currently charge or have previously charged interest rates in the gray zone, compared to approximately $709 million as of December 31, 2012.  However, Citi could also be subject to refund claims on previously outstanding loans that charged gray zone interest and thus could be subject to losses on loans in excess of these amounts.

At December 31, 2013, Citi’s reserves related to customer refunds in the Japan Consumer Finance business were $434 million, compared to $736 million at December 31, 2012.  The decrease in the reserve year-over-year primarily resulted from the significant liquidation of the portfolio, payments made to customers and a continuing reduction in the population of current and former customers who are eligible to make refund claims.

Citi continues to monitor and evaluate developments relating to the charging of gray zone interest and the potential impact to both currently and previously outstanding loans in this legacy business as well as its reserves related thereto.  The potential amount of losses and their impact on Citi is subject to significant uncertainty and continues to be difficult to predict.

Payment Protection Insurance (PPI)

The alleged mis-selling of PPI by financial institutions in the U.K. has been, and continues to be, the subject of intense review and focus by U.K. regulators, particularly the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) (formerly the Financial Services Authority). The FCA has found certain problems across the industry with how these products were sold, including customers not realizing that the cost of PPI premiums was being added to their loan or PPI being unsuitable for the customer.

PPI is designed to cover a customer’s loan repayments if certain events occur, such as long-term illness or unemployment. Prior to 2008, certain of Citi’s legacy U.K. consumer finance businesses, primarily CitiFinancial Europe plc and Canada Square Operations Ltd (formerly Egg Banking plc), engaged in the sale of PPI. While Citi has sold a significant portion of these businesses, and the remaining businesses are in the process of wind down, Citi generally remains subject to customer complaints for, and retains the


potential liability relating to, the sale of PPI by these businesses.

In 2011, the FCA required all firms engaged in the sale of PPI in the U.K. to review their historical sales processes for PPI. In addition, the FCA is requiring all such firms to contact proactively any customers who may have been mis-sold PPI after January 2005 and invite them to have their individual sale reviewed (Customer Contact Exercise).  Citi currently expects to complete the Customer Contact Exercise by the end of the first half of 2014.  Additionally, while Citi is not required to contact customers proactively for the sale of PPI prior to January 2005, it is still subject to customer complaints and redress for those sales.

Redress, whether as a result of customer complaints pursuant to the required Customer Contact Exercise, or for the sale of PPI prior to January 2005, generally involves the repayment of premiums and the refund of all applicable contractual interest together with compensatory interest of 8%. Citi estimates that the number of PPI policies sold after January 2005 (across all applicable Citi businesses in the U.K.) was approximately 417,000, for which premiums totaling approximately $490 million were collected. As noted above, however, Citi also remains subject to customer complaints on the sale of PPI prior to January 2005 and, thus, it could be subject to customer complaints substantially higher than this amount.

During 2013, Citi increased its PPI reserves by approximately $123 million ($83 million of which was recorded in Citi Holdings and $40 million of which was recorded in

Corporate/Other

for discontinued operations), including a $62 million reserve increase in the fourth quarter of 2013 ($30 million of which was recorded in Citi Holdings and $32 million of which was recorded in

Corporate/Other

for discontinued operations).  The increase for the full year 2013 compared to an increase of $266 million during 2012.  While the overall level of claims generally decreased during the second half of 2013, the increase in the reserves both during 2013 and in the fourth quarter of 2013 was primarily due to an increase in the rate of response to the Customer Contact Exercise as well as a continued elevated level of customer complaints on the sale of PPI prior to January 2005, which Citi believes is largely as a result of the continued regulatory focus and increased customer awareness of PPI issues across the industry.  During 2013, Citi paid $203 million of PPI claims, which were charged against the reserve, resulting in a year-end PPI reserve of $296 million (compared to $376 million as of December 31, 2012).

Citi believes the number of PPI complaints, the amount of refunds and the impact on Citi could remain volatile and are subject to continued significant uncertainty.


BALANCE SHEET REVIEW

The following sets forth a general discussion of the changes in certain of the more significant line items of Citi’s Consolidated Balance Sheet. For additional information on Citigroup’s liquidity resources, including its deposits, short-term and long-term debt and secured financing transactions, see “Managing Global Risk—Market Risk—Funding and Liquidity” below.

ASSETS

Cash and Deposits with Banks

Cash and deposits with banks is composed of both

Cash and due from banks

and

Deposits with banks. Cash and due from banks

includes (i) cash on hand at Citi’s domestic and overseas offices, and (ii) non-interest-bearing balances due from banks, including non-interest-bearing demand deposit accounts with correspondent banks, central banks (such as the Federal Reserve Bank), and other banks or depository institutions for normal operating purposes.

Deposits with banks

includes interest-bearing balances, demand deposits and time deposits held in or due from banks (including correspondent banks, central banks and other banks or depository institutions) maintained for, among other things, normal operating and regulatory reserve requirement purposes.

During 2013, cash and deposits with banks increased 43%, driven by a $67 billion, or 65%, increase in

Deposits with banks

, reflecting the growth in Citi’s deposits during the year (for additional information, see “Managing Global Risk—Market Risk—Funding and Liquidity” below).  Sequentially, cash and deposits with banks decreased 3%, primarily driven by net loan growth and higher net trading account assets within

Securities and Banking,

as trading

account liabilities decreased by more then trading account assets

,

as discussed below,

partially offset by higher deposits in

Transaction Services

and sales related to the continued reduction of Citi Holdings assets.

Average cash balances were $204 billion in the fourth quarter of 2013, compared to $180 billion in the third quarter of 2013.

Federal Funds Sold and Securities Borrowed or Purchased Under Agreements to Resell (Reverse Repos)

Federal funds sold consist of unsecured advances to third parties of excess balances in reserve accounts held at the Federal Reserve Bank. For the full year and fourth quarter of 2013, Citi’s federal funds sold were not significant.

Reverse repos and securities borrowed decreased 6% quarter-over-quarter, primarily due to a reduction in trading in the Markets businesses within

Securities and Banking

as counterparties became more cautious during the second half of 2013 as they reacted to potential tapering by the Federal Reserve Board and possible U.S. government default.

For further information regarding these balance sheet categories, see Note 11

to the Consolidated Financial Statements.


Trading Account Assets

Trading account assets

declined during the second half of 2013 due to declines in client activity in Rates and Currencies in the Markets businesses within

Securities and Banking

, as referenced above. Average trading account assets were $239 billion in the fourth quarter of 2013, compared to $246 billion in the third quarter of 2013.

For further information on Citi’s trading account assets, see Note 13

to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Investments

Investments

generally remained stable during 2013, as a slight increase in foreign government securities was offset by declines in mortgage-backed securities to reduce the interest rate risk profile and U.S. Treasury and agency securities.

For further information regarding investments, see Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Loans

Loans

represent the largest asset category of Citi’s balance sheet. Citi’s total loans, net of unearned income, were $665 billion at December 31, 2013, compared to $658 billion at September 30, 2013 and $655 billion at December 31, 2012. The impact of foreign exchange translation reduced loan balances by $8 billion year-over-year and by $1 billion quarter-over-quarter.  Additionally, approximately $3 billion of loans were moved to

Discontinued operations

during the second quarter of 2013 as a result of the agreement to sell  Credicard.  Throughout this section, the discussion of loans excludes the impact of foreign exchange translation, and excludes Credicard loans for the fourth quarter of 2012 and the third quarter of 2013.

Excluding these items, Citi’s loans increased 3% from the prior-year period and 1% quarter-over-quarter, as demand from consumer and corporate customers continued to be supported by the economic recovery, partially offset by the continued wind down of Citi Holdings. At year-end 2013, Consumer and Corporate loans represented 59% and 41%, respectively, of Citi’s total loans.

Citicorp loans increased 8% year-over-year, with growth in both the Consumer and Corporate loan portfolios.  Consumer loans grew 5% from the prior-year period. In

North America

, Consumer loans grew 4% from the prior-year period, primarily reflecting the addition of the approximately $7 billion of credit card loans as a result of the acquisition of the Best Buy portfolio in the third quarter of 2013. Internationally, Consumer loans increased 7% from the prior-year period, led by growth in Mexico, Hong Kong and India, offset by the ongoing repositioning efforts in Korea.

Corporate loans grew 12% from the prior-year period, with 12% growth in

Asia

, 7% growth in

EMEA

and 17% growth in

North America

, which included the consolidation of a $7 billion trade loan portfolio in

Transaction Services

during the second quarter of 2013. Private Bank loans increased 14% year-over-year, with the most significant growth in

Asia

and

North America

.

Transaction Services

loans grew 16% compared to the prior-year period, including the trade loan consolidation as well as origination growth in trade finance

throughout the year. Corporate loans, excluding trade loans, grew 10% from the prior-year period.

Citi Holdings loans declined 20% year-over-year,  primarily due to continued run-off and asset sales.

During the fourth quarter of 2013, average loans of $659 billion yielded an average rate of 7.0%, compared to $645 billion and 7.0% respectively, in the third quarter of 2013.

For further information on Citi’s loan portfolios, see generally “Managing Global Risk—Market Risk—Funding and Liquidity” below and Note 15

to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Other Assets

Other assets

consist of brokerage receivables, goodwill, intangibles and mortgage servicing rights, in addition to other assets (including, among other items, loans held-for-sale, deferred tax assets, equity-method investments, interest and fees receivable, premises and equipment, certain end-user derivatives in a net receivable position, repossessed assets and other receivables).

During the fourth quarter of 2013, other assets decreased 2% primarily due to the sale of Credicard, which was reported in

Discontinued operations

. Year-over-year, other assets declined 9% primarily due to a reduction in Citi’s deferred tax assets and loans held-for-sale as well as FX translation.

LIABILITIES

Deposits

For a discussion of Citi’s deposits, see “Managing Global Risk —Market Risk—Funding and Liquidity” below.

Federal Funds Purchased and Securities Loaned or Sold Under Agreements to Repurchase (Repos)

Federal funds purchased consist of unsecured advances of excess balances in reserve accounts held at the Federal Reserve Bank from third parties. For the full year and fourth quarter of 2013, Citi’s federal funds purchased were not significant.

For further information on Citi’s secured financing transactions, see “Managing Global Risk—Market Risk—Funding and Liquidity” below. See also Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on these balance sheet categories.

Trading Account Liabilities

During the fourth quarter of 2013,

Trading account liabilities

decreased by 11%, due to lower inventory in

Securities and Banking

businesses, which was aligned with the corresponding decrease in reverse repos and trading account assets discussed above. Average

Trading account liabilities

were $66 billion, compared to $71 billion in the third quarter of 2013, primarily due to lower average

Securities and Banking

volumes.

For further information on Citi’s

Trading account liabilities

, see Note 13

to the Consolidated Financial Statements.


Debt

For further information on Citi’s long-term and short-term debt borrowings, see “Managing Global Risk—Market Risk—Funding and Liquidity” below and Note 18

to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Other Liabilities

Other liabilities

consist of brokerage payables and other liabilities (including, among other items, accrued expenses and other payables, deferred tax liabilities, certain end-user derivatives in a net payable position, and reserves for legal claims, taxes, repositioning, unfunded lending commitments, and other matters).

During 2013,

Other liabilities

decreased 10%, primarily due to a decrease in brokerage payables and normal business fluctuations.


Segment Balance Sheet

(1)

(1)

The supplemental information presented in the table above reflects Citigroup’s consolidated GAAP balance sheet by reporting segment as of

December 31, 2013

. The respective segment information depicts the assets and liabilities managed by each segment as of such date. While this presentation is not defined by GAAP, Citi believes that these non-GAAP financial measures enhance investors’ understanding of the balance sheet components managed by the underlying business segments, as well as the beneficial inter-relationships of the asset and liability dynamics of the balance sheet components among Citi’s business segments.

(2)

Consolidating eliminations for total Citigroup and Citigroup parent company assets and liabilities are recorded within the

Corporate/Other

segment.

(3)

The total stockholders’ equity and the majority of long-term debt of Citigroup reside in the Citigroup parent company Consolidated Balance Sheet. See Notes 18 and 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Citigroup allocates stockholders’ equity and long-term debt to its businesses through inter-segment allocations as shown above.


OFF-BALANCE-SHEET ARRANGEMENTS

Citigroup enters into various types of off-balance-sheet arrangements in the ordinary course of business. Citi’s involvement in these arrangements can take many different forms, including without limitation:

•

purchasing or retaining residual and other interests in unconsolidated special purpose entities, such as credit card receivables and mortgage-backed and other asset-backed securitization entities;

•

holding senior and subordinated debt, interests in limited and general partnerships and equity interests in other unconsolidated special purpose entities;

•

providing guarantees, indemnifications, loan commitments, letters of credit and representations and warranties; and

•

entering into operating leases for property and equipment.

Citi enters into these arrangements for a variety of business purposes. The securitization arrangements offer investors access to specific cash flows and risks created through the securitization process. The securitization arrangements also assist Citi and Citi’s customers in monetizing their financial assets at more favorable rates than Citi or the customers could otherwise obtain.

The table below shows where a discussion of Citi’s various off-balance-sheet arrangements may be found in this Form 10-K. In addition, see “Significant Accounting Policies and Significant Estimates—Securitizations” below as well as Notes 1, 22 and 27 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Types of Off-Balance-Sheet Arrangements Disclosures in this Form 10-K


CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS

The following table includes information on Citigroup’s contractual obligations, as specified and aggregated pursuant to SEC requirements.

Purchase obligations consist of those obligations to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding on Citi. For presentation purposes, purchase obligations are included in the table below through the termination date of the respective agreements, even if the contract is renewable. Many of the purchase agreements for

goods or services include clauses that would allow Citigroup to cancel the agreement with specified notice; however, that impact is not included in the table below (unless Citigroup has already notified the counterparty of its intention to terminate the agreement).

Other liabilities

reflected on Citigroup’s Consolidated Balance Sheet include obligations for goods and services that have already been received, uncertain tax positions and other liabilities that have been incurred and will ultimately be paid in cash.

(1)

For additional information about long-term debt obligations, see “Managing Global Risk—Market Risk—Funding and Liquidity” below and Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

(2)

Contractual obligations related to interest payments on long-term debt are calculated by applying the weighted average interest rate on Citi’s outstanding long-term debt as of December 31, 2013 to the contractual payment obligations on long-term debt for each of the periods disclosed in the table. At December 31, 2013, Citi’s overall weighted average contractual interest rate for long-term debt was

3.58%

.

(3)

Includes accounts payable and accrued expenses recorded in

Other liabilities

on Citi’s Consolidated Balance Sheet. Also includes discretionary contributions for 2014 for Citi’s non-U.S. pension plans and the non-U.S. postretirement plans, as well as employee benefit obligations accounted for under SFAS 87 (ASC 715), SFAS 106 (ASC 715) and SFAS 112 (ASC 712).


CAPITAL RESOURCES

Overview

Capital is used principally to support assets in Citi’s businesses and to absorb credit, market and operational losses. Citi primarily generates capital through earnings from its operating businesses. Citi may augment its capital through issuances of common stock, perpetual preferred stock and equity issued through awards under employee benefit plans, among other issuances. During 2013, Citi issued approximately $4.3 billion of noncumulative perpetual preferred stock, resulting in a total of approximately $6.7 billion outstanding as of December 31, 2013.

Citi has also previously augmented its regulatory capital through the issuance of trust preferred securities, although the treatment of such instruments as regulatory capital will largely be phased out under the final U.S. Basel III rules (Final Basel III Rules) (see “Regulatory Capital Standards Developments” below). Accordingly, Citi has continued to redeem certain of its trust preferred securities in contemplation of such future phase out (see “Managing Global Risk—Market Risk—Funding and Liquidity

—

Long-Term Debt” below).

Further, changes in regulatory and accounting standards as well as the impact of future events on Citi’s business results, such as corporate and asset dispositions, may also affect Citi’s capital levels.

Citigroup’s capital management framework is designed to ensure that Citigroup and its principal subsidiaries maintain sufficient capital consistent with each entity’s respective risk profile and all applicable regulatory standards and guidelines. Citi assesses its capital adequacy against a series of internal quantitative capital goals, designed to evaluate the Company’s capital levels in expected and stressed economic environments. Underlying these internal quantitative capital goals are strategic capital considerations, centered on preserving and building financial strength. Senior management, with oversight from the Board of Directors, is responsible for the capital assessment and planning process, which is integrated into Citi’s capital plan, as part of the Federal Reserve Board’s Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) process. Implementation of the capital plan is carried out mainly through Citigroup’s Asset and Liability Committee, with oversight from the Risk Management and Finance Committee of Citigroup’s Board of Directors. Asset and liability committees are also established globally and for each significant legal entity, region, country and/or major line of business.

Current Regulatory Capital Guidelines

Citigroup Capital Resources Under Current Regulatory Guidelines

Citigroup is subject to the risk-based capital guidelines issued by the Federal Reserve Board which currently constitute the Basel I credit risk capital rules and also the final (revised) market risk capital rules (Basel II.5). Commencing with 2014, Citi’s regulatory capital ratios will reflect, in part, the implementation of certain aspects of the Final Basel III Rules, such as those related to the transitioning toward qualifying capital components, including the application of regulatory capital adjustments and deductions. In addition, effective with the second quarter of 2014, Citi will begin applying the Basel III Advanced Approaches rules. For additional information regarding the implementation of the Final Basel III Rules, see “Regulatory Capital Standards Developments” below.

Historically, capital adequacy has been measured, in part, based on two risk-based capital ratios, the Tier 1 Capital and Total Capital (Tier 1 Capital + Tier 2 Capital) ratios. Tier 1 Capital consists of the sum of “core capital elements,” such as qualifying common stockholders’ equity, as adjusted, qualifying perpetual preferred stock, qualifying noncontrolling interests, and qualifying trust preferred securities, principally reduced by goodwill, other disallowed intangible assets, and disallowed deferred tax assets. Total Capital also includes “supplementary” Tier 2 Capital elements, such as qualifying subordinated debt and a limited portion of the allowance for credit losses. Both measures of capital adequacy are stated as a percentage of risk-weighted assets.

In 2009, the U.S. banking regulators developed a supervisory measure of capital termed “Tier 1 Common,” which is defined as Tier 1 Capital less non-common elements, including qualifying perpetual preferred stock, qualifying noncontrolling interests, and qualifying trust preferred securities. Until January 1, 2015, the Federal Reserve Board has retained this definition of Tier 1 Common Capital for CCAR purposes, which differs substantially from the more restrictive definition under the Final Basel III Rules. Moreover, the presentation of Tier 1 Common Capital and related ratio in the tables that follow, labeled “Current Regulatory Guidelines”, are also consistent in derivation with this supervisory definition.


Citigroup’s risk-weighted assets are principally derived from application of the risk-based capital guidelines related to the measurement of credit risk. Pursuant to these guidelines, on balance sheet assets and the credit equivalent amount of certain off-balance-sheet exposures (such as financial guarantees, unfunded lending commitments, letters of credit and derivatives) are assigned to one of several prescribed risk-weight categories based upon the perceived credit risk associated with the obligor or, if relevant, the guarantor, the nature of the collateral, or external credit ratings. Risk-weighted assets also incorporate a measure for market risk on covered trading account positions and foreign exchange and commodity positions whether or not carried in the trading account. Excluded from risk-weighted assets are any assets, such as goodwill and deferred tax assets, to the extent required to be deducted from regulatory capital.

Citigroup is also subject to a Leverage ratio requirement, a non-risk-based measure of capital adequacy, which is defined as Tier 1 Capital as a percentage of quarterly adjusted average total assets.

To be “well capitalized” under current federal bank regulatory agency definitions, a bank holding company must have a Tier 1 Capital ratio of at least 6%, a Total Capital ratio of at least 10%, and not be subject to a Federal Reserve Board directive to maintain higher capital levels. In addition, the Federal Reserve Board currently expects bank holding companies to maintain a minimum Leverage ratio of 3% or 4%, depending on factors specified in its regulations.

Citigroup Capital Ratios Under Current Regulatory Guidelines

(1)

Risk-weighted assets for purposes of the Tier 1 Common, Tier 1 Capital and Total Capital ratios are calculated based on Basel I credit risk capital rules and final (revised) market risk capital rules (Basel II.5) effective on January 1, 2013.

(2)

Risk-weighted assets for purposes of the Tier 1 Common, Tier 1 Capital and Total Capital ratios are calculated based on Basel I credit risk and market risk capital rules.

As indicated in the table above, Citigroup was “well capitalized” under current federal bank regulatory agency definitions as of December 31, 2013 and December 31, 2012.


Components of Citigroup Capital Under Current Regulatory Guidelines

(1)

Issuance costs of $93 million related to preferred stock outstanding at December 31, 2013 are excluded from common stockholders’ equity and netted against preferred stock in accordance with Federal Reserve Board regulatory reporting requirements, which differ from those under U.S. GAAP.

(2)

Tier 1 Capital excludes net unrealized gains (losses) on available-for-sale (AFS) debt securities and net unrealized gains on AFS equity securities with readily determinable fair values, in accordance with current risk-based capital guidelines. Further, in arriving at Tier 1 Capital, banking organizations are required to deduct net unrealized losses on AFS equity securities with readily determinable fair values, net of tax. Banking organizations are permitted to include in Tier 2 Capital up to 45% of net unrealized pretax gains on AFS equity securities with readily determinable fair values.

(3)

In addition, includes the net amount of unamortized loss on held-to-maturity (HTM) securities.

Of Citi’s approximately $52.8 billion of net deferred tax assets at December 31, 2013, approximately $10.9 billion of such assets were includable in regulatory capital pursuant to current risk-based capital guidelines, while approximately $39.4 billion of such assets exceeded the limitation imposed by these guidelines and were deducted in arriving at Tier 1 Capital. Citi’s approximately $2.5 billion of other net deferred tax assets primarily represented deferred tax assets related to the regulatory capital adjustments for defined benefit plans liability, unrealized gains (losses) on AFS securities and cash flow hedges, partially offset by deferred tax liabilities related to the deductions for goodwill and certain other intangible assets, which are permitted to be excluded prior to deriving the amount of net deferred tax assets subject to limitation under the guidelines.

Includes risk-weighted credit equivalent amounts, net of applicable bilateral netting agreements, of approximately $61 billion for interest rate, commodity, equity, foreign exchange and credit derivative contracts as of December 31, 2013, compared with approximately $62 billion as of December 31, 2012. Credit risk-


weighted assets also include those deriving from certain other off-balance-sheet exposures, such as financial guarantees, unfunded lending commitments and letters of credit, and reflect deductions such as for certain intangible assets and any excess allowance for credit losses.

Citigroup Capital Rollforward Under Current Regulatory Guidelines

(1)

Primarily represents an increase in additional paid-in capital related to employee benefit plans.

(2)

Citi issued approximately $1.5 billion and approximately $4.3 billion of qualifying perpetual preferred stock during the three months and twelve months ended December 31, 2013, respectively. These issuances were partially offset by both redemptions and the netting of issuance costs, which in the aggregate were $34 million and $187 million for the three months and twelve months ended December 31, 2013, respectively. For U.S. GAAP purposes, issuance costs of $34 million and $93 million for the three months and twelve months ended December 31, 2013, respectively, were netted against additional paid-in capital.

(3)

The net increase for the year ended December 31, 2013 reflects, in part, an increase in the portion of the allowance for credit losses eligible for inclusion in Tier 2 Capital resulting from an increase in gross risk-weighted assets due to the adoption of Basel II.5.

Capital Resources of Citigroup’s Subsidiary U.S. Depository Institutions Under Current Regulatory Guidelines

Citigroup’s subsidiary U.S. depository institutions are also subject to risk-based capital guidelines issued by their respective primary federal bank regulatory agencies, which are similar to the guidelines of the Federal Reserve Board. The following table sets forth the capital tiers, risk-weighted assets, quarterly adjusted average total assets and capital ratios under current regulatory guidelines for Citibank, N.A., Citi’s primary subsidiary U.S. depository institution, as of December 31, 2013 and December 31, 2012.

(1)    Risk-weighted assets for purposes of the Tier 1 Common, Tier 1 Capital and Total Capital ratios are calculated based on Basel I credit risk capital rules and final (revised) market risk capital rules (Basel II.5) effective on January 1, 2013.

Impact of Changes on Citigroup and Citibank, N.A. Capital Ratios Under Current Regulatory Guidelines

The following table presents the estimated sensitivity of Citigroup’s and Citibank, N.A.’s capital ratios to changes of $100 million in Tier 1 Common Capital, Tier 1 Capital and Total Capital (numerator), and changes of $1 billion in risk-weighted assets or quarterly adjusted average total assets (denominator) as of December 31, 2013. This information is

provided for the purpose of analyzing the impact that a change in Citigroup’s or Citibank, N.A.’s financial position or results of operations could have on these ratios. These sensitivities only consider a single change to either a component of capital, risk-weighted assets, or quarterly adjusted average total assets. Accordingly, an event that affects more than one factor may have a larger basis point impact than is reflected in this table.

Citigroup Broker-Dealer Subsidiaries

At December 31, 2013, Citigroup Global Markets Inc., a U.S. broker-dealer registered with the SEC that is an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Citigroup, had net capital, computed in accordance with the SEC’s net capital rule, of $5.4 billion, which exceeded the minimum requirement by $4.5 billion.

In addition, certain of Citi’s other broker-dealer subsidiaries are subject to regulation in the countries in which they do business, including requirements to maintain specified levels of net capital or its equivalent. Citigroup’s other broker-dealer subsidiaries were in compliance with their capital requirements at December 31, 2013.

Basel III

For additional information on Citi’s estimated Basel III ratios, see “Risk Factors

Regulatory Risks” below.

Tier 1 Common Ratio

Citi’s estimated Basel III Tier 1 Common ratio was 10.6% at December 31, 2013, compared to 10.5% at September 30, 2013 and 8.7% at December 31, 2012 (all based on the “Advanced Approaches” for determining total risk-weighted assets).

The marginal increase quarter-over-quarter in Citi’s estimated Basel III Tier 1 Common ratio reflected continued growth in Tier 1 Common Capital resulting from quarterly net income and further DTA utilization of approximately $700 million (see “Significant Accounting Policies and Significant Estimates

—

Income Taxes” below), the effect of which was largely offset by higher risk-weighted assets, principally driven by an increase in estimated operational risk-weighted assets. Citi increased its estimate of operational risk-weighted assets during the fourth quarter due to an ongoing review, refinement and enhancement of its Basel III models, as well as in consideration of the evolving regulatory and litigation environment within the banking industry.

The significant year-over-year increase in Citi’s estimated Basel III Tier 1 Common ratio was primarily due to net income and other improvements to Tier 1 Common Capital, including a sizable reduction in Citi’s minority investments principally resulting from the sale of Citi’s remaining interest in the MSSB joint venture as well as approximately $2.5 billion utilization of DTAs, which was partially offset by additional net losses in AOCI and, to a lesser extent, share repurchases and dividends.

On February 21, 2014, the Federal Reserve Board announced that Citi was approved to exit the “parallel run” period regarding the application of the Basel III Advanced Approaches in the calculation of risk-weighted assets, effective for the second quarter of 2014. One of the stipulations for such approval is that Citi further increase its estimated operational risk-weighted assets to $288 billion from $232 billion as of December 31, 2013, reflecting ongoing developments regarding the overall banking industry operating environment. The pro forma impact of the required higher operational risk-weighted assets would have been a decrease of approximately 50 basis points in Citi’s estimated Basel III Tier 1 Common ratio at December 31, 2013 to approximately 10.1%.

(2)

Calculated based on the proposed U.S. Basel III rules, and with full implementation assumed for capital components (i.e., an effective date of January 1, 2019), except for qualifying trust preferred securities that fully phase-out of Tier 2 Capital by January 1, 2022.

(3)

(7)

Of Citi’s approximately $52.8 billion of net deferred tax assets at December 31, 2013, approximately $12.2 billion of such assets were includable in regulatory capital pursuant to the Final Basel III Rules, while approximately $40.6 billion of such assets were excluded in arriving at Tier 1 Common Capital. Comprising the excluded net deferred tax assets was an aggregate of approximately $41.8 billion of net deferred tax assets arising from net operating loss, foreign tax credit and general business credit carry-forwards as well as temporary differences that were deducted from Tier 1 Common Capital. In addition, approximately $1.2 billion of net deferred tax liabilities, primarily consisting of deferred tax liabilities associated with goodwill and certain other intangible assets, partially offset by deferred tax assets related to cash flow hedges, are permitted to be excluded prior to deriving the amount of net deferred tax assets subject to deduction under these rules. Separately, under the Final Basel III Rules, goodwill and these other intangible assets are deducted net of associated deferred tax liabilities in arriving at Tier 1 Common Capital, while Citi’s current cash flow hedges and the related deferred tax effects are not required to be reflected in regulatory capital.

(8)

Aside from MSRs, reflects DTAs arising from temporary differences and significant common stock investments in unconsolidated financial institutions.

Supplementary Leverage Ratio

Citigroup’s estimated Basel III Supplementary Leverage ratio was 5.4% for the fourth quarter of 2013, compared to an estimated 5.1% for the third quarter.

The quarter-over-quarter ratio improvement was primarily due to an increase in Tier 1 Capital arising largely from quarterly net income, as well as a decrease in Total Leverage Exposure substantially resulting from lower on-balance-sheet assets.

The Supplementary Leverage ratio represents the average for the quarter of the three monthly ratios of Tier 1 Capital to Total Leverage Exposure (i.e., the sum of the ratios calculated for October, November and December, divided by three). Total Leverage Exposure is the sum of: (i) the carrying value of all on-balance-sheet assets less applicable Tier 1 Capital deductions; (ii) the potential future exposure on derivative contracts; (iii) 10% of the notional amount of unconditionally cancellable commitments; and (iv) the full notional amount of certain other off-balance sheet exposures (e.g., other commitments and contingencies).

Citi’s estimated Basel III Tier 1 Common ratio and estimated Basel III Supplementary Leverage ratio and certain related components are non-GAAP financial measures. Citigroup believes these ratios and their components provide useful information to investors and others by measuring Citigroup’s progress against future regulatory capital standards.

Regulatory Capital Standards Developments

Basel II.5

In June 2012, the U.S. banking agencies released final (revised) market risk capital rules (Basel II.5), which became effective on January 1, 2013. Subsequently, in December 2013, the Federal Reserve Board amended Basel II.5 by conforming such rules to certain elements of the Final Basel III Rules, as well as incorporating additional clarifications. These Basel II.5 revisions have not had a material impact on the measurement of Citi’s market risk-weighted assets.

Separately, in October 2013, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (Basel Committee) issued a new proposal with respect to its ongoing review of regulatory capital standards applicable to the trading book of banking organizations. The proposal, which is more definitive than the initial version published in May 2012, would significantly revise the current market risk capital framework, as well as address previously known shortcomings in the Basel II.5 rules. Among the more significant of the proposed revisions are those related to (i) strengthening and clarifying the boundary between trading book and banking book positions; (ii) incorporating certain modifications to the standardized approach to the calculation of risk-weighted assets; (iii) redesigning internal regulatory capital models; and (iv) expanding the scope and granularity of public disclosures. The Basel Committee has also initiated, in parallel, a quantitative impact study in an effort to assess the implications arising from the proposal. Timing as to finalization of the Basel Committee proposal, and the potential future impact on U.S. banking organizations, such as Citi, are uncertain.

Basel III

Overview

In July 2013, the U.S. banking agencies released the Final Basel III Rules, which comprehensively revise the regulatory capital framework for substantially all U.S. banking organizations and incorporate relevant provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act.

The Final Basel III Rules raise the quantity and quality of regulatory capital by formally introducing not only Tier 1 Common Capital and mandating it be the predominant form of regulatory capital, but also by narrowing the definition of qualifying capital elements at all three regulatory capital tiers (i.e., Tier 1 Common Capital, Additional Tier 1 Capital, and Tier 2 Capital) as well as imposing broader and more constraining regulatory capital adjustments and deductions. Moreover, these rules establish both a fixed and a discretionary capital buffer, which would be available to absorb losses in advance of any potential impairment of regulatory capital below the stated minimum risk-based capital ratio requirements.

For so-called “Advanced Approaches” banking organizations (generally those with consolidated total assets of at least $250 billion or consolidated total on-balance-sheet foreign exposures of at least $10 billion), which includes Citi and Citibank, N.A., the Final Basel III Rules are required to be adopted effective January 1, 2014, with the exception of the “Standardized Approach” for deriving risk-weighted assets, which becomes effective January 1, 2015. However, in order to minimize the effect of adopting these new requirements on U.S. banking organizations and consequently potentially also global economies, the Final Basel III Rules contain several differing, largely multi-year transition provisions (i.e., “phase-ins” and “phase-outs”) with respect to the stated minimum Tier 1 Common and Tier 1 Capital ratio requirements, substantially all regulatory adjustments and deductions, non-qualifying Tier 1 and Tier 2 Capital instruments (such as trust preferred securities), and the capital buffers. All of these transition provisions, with the exception of the phase-out of non-qualifying trust preferred securities from Tier 2 Capital, will be fully implemented by January 1, 2019 (i.e., hereinafter “fully phased-in”).

Risk-Based Capital Ratios

Under the Final Basel III Rules, when fully phased in by January 1, 2019, Citi will be required to maintain stated minimum Tier 1 Common, Tier 1 Capital and Total Capital ratios of 4.5%, 6% and 8%, respectively, and will be subject to substantially higher effective minimum ratio requirements due to the imposition of an additional 2.5% Capital Conservation Buffer and a surcharge of at least 2% as a global systemically important bank (G-SIB). Accordingly, Citi currently anticipates that its effective minimum Tier 1 Common, Tier 1 Capital and Total Capital ratio requirements as of January 1, 2019 will be at least 9%, 10.5% and 12.5%, respectively.

Further, the Final Basel III Rules implement the “capital floor provision” of the so-called “Collins Amendment” of the Dodd-Frank Act. This provision requires Advanced Approaches banking organizations to calculate each of the


three risk-based capital ratios under both the Standardized Approach starting on January 1, 2015 (or, for 2014, prior to the effective date of the Standardized Approach, the existing Basel I and Basel II.5 capital rules) and the Advanced Approaches and publicly report the lower (most conservative) of each of the resulting capital ratios. The Standardized Approach and the Advanced Approaches primarily differ in the composition and calculation of total risk-weighted assets, as well as in the definition of Total Capital.

Advanced Approaches banking organizations such as Citi and Citibank, N.A. are required, however, to participate in, and must receive Federal Reserve Board and OCC approval to exit a parallel run period with respect to the calculation of Advanced Approaches risk-weighted assets prior to being able to comply with the capital floor provision of the Collins Amendment. During such period, the publicly reported ratios of Advanced Approaches banking organizations (and the ratios against which compliance with the regulatory capital framework is to be measured) would consist of only those risk-based capital ratios calculated under the Basel I and Basel II.5 capital rules (or, after January 1, 2015, under the Standardized Approach). During the parallel run period, Advanced Approaches banking organizations are required to report their risk-based capital ratios under the Advanced Approaches only to their primary federal banking regulator, which for Citi is the Federal Reserve Board. Upon exiting parallel run, an Advanced Approaches banking organization would then be required to publicly report (and would be measured for compliance against) the lower of each of the risk-based capital ratios calculated under the capital floor provision of the Collins Amendment, as set forth above.

On

February 21, 2014, the Federal Reserve Board and OCC granted permission for Citi and Citibank, N.A., respectively, to exit the parallel run period and to begin applying the Advanced Approaches framework in the calculation and public reporting of risk-based capital ratios, effective with the second quarter of 2014. Such approval is subject to Citi’s satisfactory compliance with certain commitments regarding the implementation of the Advanced Approaches rule, as well as general ongoing qualification requirements.

Capital Buffers

The Final Basel III Rules establish a 2.5% Capital Conservation Buffer applicable to substantially all U.S. banking organizations and, for Advanced Approaches banking organizations, a potential additional Countercyclical Capital Buffer of up to 2.5%. An Advanced Approaches banking organization’s Countercyclical Capital Buffer would be derived based upon the weighted average of the Countercyclical Capital Buffer requirements, if any, in those national jurisdictions in which the banking organization has private sector credit exposures. Moreover, the Countercyclical Capital Buffer would be invoked upon a determination by the U.S. banking agencies that the market is experiencing excessive aggregate credit growth, and would be an extension of the Capital Conservation Buffer (i.e., an aggregate combined buffer of potentially between 2.5% and 5%). While Advanced Approaches banking organizations may draw on the

Capital Conservation Buffer and, if invoked, the Countercyclical Capital Buffer, to absorb losses during periods of financial or economic stress, restrictions on earnings distributions (e.g., dividends, equity repurchases, and discretionary executive bonuses) would result, with the degree of such restrictions greater based upon the extent to which the buffer is drawn upon.

Under the Final Basel III Rules, the Capital Conservation Buffer for Advanced Approaches banking organizations, as well as the Countercyclical Capital Buffer, if invoked, must be calculated in accordance with the Collins Amendment, and thus be based on a comparison of each of the three reportable risk-based capital ratios as determined under both the Advanced Approaches and the Standardized Approach (or, for 2014, the existing Basel I and Basel II.5 capital rules) and the stated minimum required ratios for each (i.e., 4.5% Tier 1 Common, 6% Tier 1 Capital and 8% Total Capital), with the reportable Capital Conservation Buffer (and, if applicable, also the Countercyclical Capital Buffer) being the smallest of the three differences. Both of these buffers, which are to be comprised entirely of Tier 1 Common Capital, are to be phased in incrementally from January 1, 2016 through January 1, 2019.

G-SIB Surcharge

In July 2013, the Basel Committee issued an update of its G-SIB framework, incorporating a number of revisions relative to the original rules published in November 2011. Among the revisions are selected refinements to the methodology for assessing global systemic importance, clarifications related to the imposition of additional Tier 1 Common Capital surcharges, and certain public disclosure requirements.

Under the Basel Committee rules, the methodology for assessing G-SIBs is based primarily on quantitative measurement indicators underlying five equally weighted broad categories of systemic importance: (i) size; (ii) global (cross-jurisdictional) activity; (iii) interconnectedness; (iv) substitutability/financial institution infrastructure; and (v) complexity. With the exception of size, each of the other categories are comprised of multiple indicators also of equal weight, and amounting to 12 in total. The initial G-SIB surcharge, which is to be comprised entirely of Tier 1 Common Capital, ranges from 1% to 2.5% of risk-weighted assets. Moreover, under the Basel Committee’s rules, the G-SIB surcharge will be introduced in parallel with the Basel III Capital Conservation Buffer and, if applicable, any Countercyclical Capital Buffer, commencing phase-in on January 1, 2016 and becoming fully effective on January 1, 2019.

Separately, the Final Basel III Rules do not address G-SIBs. Nonetheless, the Federal Reserve Board is required by the Dodd-Frank Act to issue rules establishing a quantitative risk-based capital surcharge for financial institutions deemed to be systemically important and posing risk to market-wide financial stability, such as Citi, and the Federal Reserve Board has indicated that it intends for these rules to be consistent with the Basel Committee’s G-SIB rules. Although no such rules have yet been proposed by the Federal Reserve Board,


Citi anticipates that it will likely be subject to at least a 2% initial additional Tier 1 Common Capital surcharge.

Regulatory Capital Adjustments and Deductions

Substantially all of the regulatory capital adjustments and deductions required under the Final Basel III Rules are to be applied in arriving at Tier 1 Common Capital.

Assets required to be fully deducted from Tier 1 Common Capital include, in part, goodwill (both standalone and embedded) and identifiable intangible assets (other than MSRs), net assets of certain defined benefit pension plans, and DTAs arising from tax credit and net operating loss carry-forwards. Additionally, DTAs arising from temporary differences, significant investments in the common stock of unconsolidated financial institutions, and MSRs are subject to potential partial deduction under the so-called “threshold deductions” (i.e., the portions of these assets that individually and, in the aggregate, initially exceed 10% and subsequently collectively exceed 15%, respectively, of adjusted Tier 1 Common Capital). Furthermore, any assets required to be deducted from regulatory capital are also excluded from risk-weighted assets, as well as adjusted average total assets and Total Leverage Exposure for leverage ratio purposes.

The Final Basel III Rules also require that principally all of  the components of AOCI be fully reflected in Tier 1 Common Capital, including net unrealized gains and losses on all AFS securities and adjustments to defined benefit plan liabilities. Conversely, the rules permit the exclusion of net gains and losses on cash flow hedges included in AOCI related to the hedging of items not recognized at fair value on a banking organization’s balance sheet. Moreover, an Advanced Approaches banking organization must adjust its Tier 1 Common Capital for the cumulative change in the fair value of financial liabilities attributable to the change in the banking organization’s own creditworthiness. Apart from Tier 1 Common Capital effects, the minimum regulatory capital requirements of insurance underwriting subsidiaries are required to be deducted equally from both Additional Tier 1 Capital and Tier 2 Capital.

The impact of these regulatory capital adjustments and deductions, with the exception of goodwill, which is required to be deducted in full commencing January 1, 2014, are generally to be phased in incrementally at 20% annually beginning on January 1, 2014, with full implementation by January 1, 2018.

Non-Qualifying Trust Preferred Securities

As for non-qualifying capital instruments, the Final Basel III Rules require that Advanced Approaches banking organizations phase-out from Tier 1 Capital trust preferred securities issued prior to May 19, 2010 by January 1, 2016 (other than certain grandfathered trust preferred securities), with 50% of these non-qualifying capital instruments includable in Tier 1 Capital in 2014 and 25% includable in 2015. The carrying value of trust preferred securities excluded from Tier 1 Capital may be included in full in Tier 2 Capital during those two years (i.e., 50% and 75% in 2014 and 2015, respectively), but must be phased out of Tier 2 Capital by January 1, 2022 (declining in 10% annual increments starting

at 60% in 2016). Moreover, under the Final Basel III Rules, any nonconforming Tier 2 Capital instruments issued prior to May 19, 2010 will also be required to be phased out by January 1, 2016, with issuances after May 19, 2010 required to be excluded entirely from Tier 2 Capital as of January 1, 2014.

Standardized Approach Risk-Weighted Assets

The Standardized Approach for determining risk-weighted assets is applicable to substantially all U.S. banking organizations, including Citi and Citibank, N.A. and, as of January 1, 2015, will replace the existing regulatory capital rules governing the calculation of risk-weighted assets.  Although the mechanics of calculating risk-weighted assets remains largely unchanged from Basel I, the Standardized Approach incorporates heightened risk sensitivity for calculating risk-weighted assets for certain on-balance-sheet assets and off-balance-sheet exposures, including those to foreign sovereign governments and banks, corporate and securitization exposures, and counterparty credit risk on derivative contracts. Total risk-weighted assets under the Standardized Approach exclude risk-weighted assets arising from operational risk, require more limited approaches in measuring risk-weighted assets for securitization exposures, and apply the standardized risk weights to arrive at credit risk-weighted assets. As required under the Dodd-Frank Act, the Standardized Approach relies on alternatives to external credit ratings in the treatment of certain exposures.

Advanced Approaches Risk-Weighted Assets

The Advanced Approaches for determining risk-weighted assets amends the U.S. Basel II capital guidelines for calculating risk-weighted assets. Total risk-weighted assets under the Advanced Approaches would include not only  Advanced Approaches in calculating credit and operational risk-weighted assets, but also market risk-weighted assets. Primary among the Basel II modifications are those related to the treatment of counterparty credit risk, as well as substantial revisions to the securitization exposure framework. As with the Standardized Approach, and as mandated by the Dodd-Frank Act, all references to, and reliance on, external credit ratings in deriving risk-weighted assets for various types of exposures are removed.

Leverage Ratios

Under the Final Basel III Rules, Advanced Approaches banking organizations are also required to calculate two leverage ratios, a “Tier 1” Leverage ratio and a “Supplementary” Leverage ratio. The Tier 1 Leverage ratio is a modified version of the current U.S. Leverage ratio and reflects the more restrictive Basel III definition of Tier 1 Capital in the numerator, but with the same current denominator consisting of average total assets less amounts deducted from Tier 1 Capital. The Supplementary Leverage ratio significantly differs from the Tier 1 Leverage ratio by also including certain off-balance-sheet exposures within the denominator of the ratio. Citi, as with substantially all U.S. banking organizations, will be required to maintain a minimum Tier 1 Leverage ratio of 4% effective January 1, 2014. Advanced Approaches banking organizations will be


required to maintain a stated minimum Supplementary Leverage ratio of 3% commencing on January 1, 2018, but must commence publicly disclosing this ratio on January 1, 2015.

In July 2013, subsequent to the release of the Final Basel III Rules, the U.S. banking agencies also issued a notice of proposed rulemaking which would amend the Final Basel III Rules to impose on the eight largest U.S. bank holding companies (currently identified as G-SIBs by the Financial Stability Board, which includes Citi) a 2% leverage buffer in addition to the stated 3% minimum Supplementary Leverage ratio requirement. The leverage buffer would operate in a manner similar to that of the Capital Conservation Buffer, such that if a banking organization failed to exceed the 2% requirement it would be subject to increasingly onerous restrictions (depending upon the extent of the shortfall) regarding capital distributions and discretionary executive bonus payments. Accordingly, the proposal would effectively raise the Supplementary Leverage ratio requirement to 5%. Additionally, the proposed rules would require that insured depository institution subsidiaries of these bank holding companies, such as Citibank, N.A., maintain a minimum Supplementary Leverage ratio of 6% to be considered “well capitalized” under the revised prompt corrective action framework established by the Final Basel III Rules. If adopted as proposed, Citi and Citibank, N.A. would need to be compliant with these higher effective minimum ratio requirements on January 1, 2018.

Separately, in January 2014, the Basel Committee adopted revisions which substantially modify its original rules in relation to the measurement of exposures for derivatives, securities financing transactions (SFTs), and most off-balance-sheet commitments and contingencies, all of which are included in the denominator of the Basel III Leverage ratio (the equivalent of the U.S. Supplementary Leverage ratio). Under the revised rules, banking organizations will be permitted limited netting of SFTs with the same counterparty and allowed to apply cash variation margin to reduce derivative exposures, both of which are subject to certain specific conditions, as well as cap written credit derivative exposures. Moreover, the credit conversion factors to be applied to certain off-balance-sheet exposures have been reduced from 100% to those applicable under the Basel III Standardized Approach for determining credit risk-weighted assets.  The Basel Committee will also continue to monitor banking organizations’ Basel III Leverage ratios on a semiannual basis in order to assess whether any further revisions, including the calibration of the ratio, are deemed necessary prior to the incorporation of any final adjustments by January 1, 2017. Accordingly, the U.S. banking agencies may further revise the Supplementary Leverage ratio in the future based upon the current and any further revisions adopted by the Basel Committee.

Prompt Corrective Action Framework

The Final Basel III Rules revise the Prompt Corrective Action (PCA) regulations in certain respects. In general, the PCA regulations direct the U.S. banking agencies to enforce increasingly strict limitations on the activities of insured depository institutions that fail to meet certain regulatory capital thresholds. The revised PCA framework contains five categories of capital adequacy as measured by risk-based capital and leverage ratios: (i) “well capitalized;” (ii) “adequately capitalized;” (iii) “undercapitalized;” (iv) “significantly undercapitalized;” and (v) “critically undercapitalized.”

Additionally, the U.S. banking agencies revised the PCA regulations to accommodate a new minimum Tier 1 Common ratio requirement for substantially all categories of capital adequacy (other than critically undercapitalized), increase the minimum Tier 1 Capital ratio requirement at each category, and introduce for Advanced Approaches insured depository institutions the Supplementary Leverage ratio as a metric, but only for the “adequately capitalized” and “undercapitalized” categories. These revisions will become effective on January 1, 2015, with the exception of the Supplementary Leverage ratio for Advanced Approaches insured depository institutions, for which January 1, 2018 is the effective date. Accordingly, beginning January 1, 2015, an insured depository institution, such as Citibank, N.A., would need minimum Tier 1 Common, Tier 1 Capital, Total Capital, and Tier 1 Leverage ratios of 6.5% (a new requirement), 8% (a 2% increase over the current requirement), 10%, and 5%, respectively, to be considered “well capitalized.”

Disclosure Requirements

The Final Basel III Rules formally establish extensive qualitative and quantitative public disclosure requirements for substantially all U.S. banking organizations, as well as additional disclosures specifically required of Advanced Approaches banking organizations. The required disclosures are intended to provide transparency with respect to such regulatory capital aspects as capital structure, capital adequacy, capital buffers, credit risk, securitizations, operational risk, equities and interest rate risk. Qualitative disclosures that typically remain unchanged each quarter may be disclosed annually, however, any significant changes must be provided in the interim. Alternatively, quantitative disclosures must be provided quarterly. An Advanced Approaches banking organization is required to comply with the Advanced Approaches disclosures after exiting parallel run, unless it has not exited by the first quarter of 2015, in which case an Advanced Approaches banking organization is required to provide the disclosures set forth under the Standardized Approach until parallel run has been exited.


Volcker Rule

In December 2013, the U.S. banking agencies, along with the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, issued final rules to implement the so-called “Volcker Rule” of the Dodd-Frank Act (Final Volcker Rule). Aside from provisions which prohibit “banking entities” (i.e., insured depository institutions and their affiliates) from engaging in short-term proprietary trading, the Final Volcker Rule also imposes limitations on the extent to which banking entities are permitted to invest in certain “covered funds” (e.g., hedge funds and private equity funds) and requires that such investments be fully deducted from Tier 1 Capital. While the initial period within which banking entities have to become compliant with the covered fund investment provisions extends to July 21, 2015, the timing as to the required Tier 1 Capital deduction, as well as the expected incorporation of this requirement into the Final Basel III Rules, are currently uncertain.

Tangible Common Equity, Tangible Book Value Per Share and Book Value Per Share

Tangible common equity (TCE), as currently defined by Citi, represents common equity less goodwill and other intangible assets (other than MSRs). Other companies may calculate TCE in a different manner. TCE, tangible book value per share and book value per share are non-GAAP financial measures. Citi believes these capital metrics provide useful information, as they are used by investors and industry analysts.
