Item 1. Business

OVERVIEW

Citigroup’s history dates back to the founding of the City Bank of New York in 1812. Citigroup’s original corporate predecessor was incorporated in 1988 under the laws of the State of Delaware. Following a series of transactions over a number of years, Citigroup Inc. was formed in 1998 upon the merger of Citicorp and Travelers Group Inc.

Citigroup is a global diversified financial services holding company, whose businesses provide consumers, corporations, governments and institutions with a broad range of financial products and services, including consumer banking and credit, corporate and investment banking, securities brokerage, trade and securities services and wealth management. Citi has approximately 200 million customer accounts and does business in more than 160 countries and jurisdictions.

At December 31, 2014, Citi had approximately 241,000 full-time employees, compared to approximately 251,000 full-time employees at December 31, 2013.

Citigroup currently operates, for management reporting purposes, via two primary business segments: Citicorp, consisting of Citi’s

Global Consumer Banking

businesses and

Institutional Clients Group

; and Citi Holdings, consisting of businesses and portfolios of assets that Citigroup has determined are not central to its core Citicorp businesses.  For a further description of the business segments and the products and services they provide, see “Citigroup Segments” below, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and Note


to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Throughout this report, “Citigroup,” “Citi” and “the Company” refer to Citigroup Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries.

Certain reclassifications, including a realignment of certain businesses, have been made to the prior periods’ financial statements to conform to the current period’s presentation. For information on certain recent such reclassifications, see Note


to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Please see “Risk Factors” below for a discussion of the most significant risks and uncertainties that could impact Citigroup’s businesses, financial condition and results of operations.


As described above, Citigroup is managed pursuant to the following segments:

*

As previously announced, Citigroup intends to exit its consumer businesses in 11 markets and its consumer finance business in Korea in

GCB

and certain businesses in

ICG

.  Effective in the first quarter of 2015, these businesses will be reported as part of Citi Holdings. For additional information, see “Executive Summary,” “

Global Consumer Banking

” and “

Institutional Clients Group

” below.  Citi intends to release a revised Quarterly Financial Data Supplement reflecting this realignment prior to the release of its first quarter of 2015 earnings information.

The following are the four regions in which Citigroup operates. The regional results are fully reflected in the segment results above.


MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION

AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Steady Progress on Execution Priorities Despite Continued Challenging Operating Environment

As discussed further throughout this Form 10-K, Citi’s 2014 results reflected a continued challenging operating environment for Citi and its businesses in several respects, including:

•

the impact of macroeconomic uncertainty on the markets, trading environment and customer activity, particularly during the latter part of the year;

•

significant costs associated with legal settlements as Citi resolved its significant legacy legal issues and continued to work through its outstanding legal matters;

•

uneven global economic growth; and

•

a continued low interest rate environment.

In addition, as part of its execution priorities to improve its efficiency and reduce expenses, Citi incurred higher repositioning costs during the year, which also impacted its 2014 results of operations.

Despite these difficult decisions and challenges, Citi continued to make progress on its execution priorities in 2014, including:

•

Efficient resource allocation and disciplined expense management:  As noted above, Citi continued to take actions to simplify and streamline the organization as well as improve productivity.  As part of these efforts, Citi announced strategic actions to exit its consumer businesses in certain international markets in

Global Consumer Banking

(

GCB)

and certain businesses in

Institutional Clients Group (ICG)

to focus on those markets and businesses where it believes it has the greatest scale, growth potential and ability to provide meaningful returns to its shareholders.

•

Wind down of Citi Holdings:  Citi continued to wind down Citi Holdings, including reducing its assets by $19 billion, or 16%, from year end 2013.

•

Utilization of deferred tax assets (DTAs): Citi utilized approximately $3.3 billion in DTAs during 2014 (for additional information, see “Income Taxes” below).

While making progress on these initiatives in 2014, Citi expects the operating environment in 2015 to remain challenging.  Regulatory changes and requirements continue to create uncertainties for Citi and its businesses.  While the U.S. economy continues to improve, it remains susceptible to global events and volatility.  The economic and fiscal situations of several European countries remain fragile, and geopolitical tensions in the region have added to the uncertainties.   Although most emerging market economies continue to grow, growth has slowed in some markets and these economies are also susceptible to outside macroeconomic events and challenges.  The frequency with which legal and regulatory proceedings are initiated against

financial institutions, and the severity of the remedies sought in these proceedings, has increased substantially over the past several years, including 2014.  Financial institutions also remain a target for an increasing number of cybersecurity attacks.  For a more detailed discussion of these and other risks that could impact Citi’s businesses, results of operations and financial condition during 2015, see each respective business’ results of operations, “Risk Factors” and “Managing Global Risk” below.

While Citi may not be able to completely control these and other factors affecting its operating environment in 2015, it will remain focused on its execution priorities, as described above, and remains committed to achieving its 2015 financial targets for Citicorp’s operating efficiency ratio and Citigroup’s return on assets.

2014 Summary Results

Citigroup

Citigroup reported net income of $7.3 billion or $2.20 per diluted share, compared to $13.7 billion or $4.35 per share in 2013.  In 2014, Citi’s results included negative $390 million (negative $240 million after-tax) of CVA/DVA, compared to negative $342 million (negative $213 million after-tax) in 2013 (for additional information, including Citi’s adoption of funding valuation adjustments, or FVA, in 2014, see Note 25 to the Consolidated Financial Statements).  Citi’s results in 2014 also included a charge of $3.8 billion ($3.7 billion after-tax) related to the mortgage settlement announced in July 2014 regarding certain of Citi’s legacy residential mortgage-backed securities and CDO activities, recorded in Citi Holdings.  Results in 2014 further included a tax charge of  approximately $210 million related to corporate tax reforms enacted in two states, compared to a tax benefit of $176 million in 2013 related to the resolution of certain tax audit items, both recorded in

Corporate/Other

.  In addition, Citi’s 2013 results included a net fraud loss in Mexico of $360 million ($235 million after-tax) recorded in

ICG,

and a $189 million after-tax benefit related to the divestiture of Credicard, Citi’s non-Citibank branded cards and consumer finance business in Brazil (Credicard), recorded in

Corporate/Other

.

Excluding these items, Citi reported net income of $11.5 billion in 2014, or $3.55 per diluted share, compared to $13.8 billion, or $4.37 per share, in the prior year. The 16%   decrease from 2013 was driven by higher expenses, a lower net loan loss reserve release and a higher effective tax rate due primarily to non-deductible legal and related expenses incurred during the year (for additional information, see Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements), partially offset by increased revenues in Citi Holdings and a decline in net credit losses.  (Citi’s results of operations excluding the impacts of CVA/DVA, the mortgage settlement, the tax items, the net fraud loss and the Credicard divestiture are non-GAAP financial measures.  Citi believes the presentation of its results of operations excluding these impacts provides a more


meaningful depiction for investors of the underlying fundamentals of its businesses.)

Citi’s revenues, net of interest expense, were $76.9 billion in 2014, up 1% versus the prior year.  Excluding CVA/DVA, revenues were $77.3 billion, also up 1% from 2013, as revenues rose 28% in Citi Holdings, partially offset by a 1% decline in Citicorp.  Net interest revenues of $48.0 billion were 3% higher than 2013, mostly driven by lower funding costs.  Excluding CVA/DVA, non-interest revenues were $29.3 billion, down 2% from 2013, driven by lower revenues in

ICG

and

GCB

in Citicorp, partially offset by higher non-interest revenues in Citi Holdings.

Expenses

Citigroup expenses increased 14% versus 2013 to $55.1 billion.  Excluding the impact of the mortgage settlement in 2014 and the net fraud loss in 2013, operating expenses increased 7% versus the prior year to $51.3 billion driven by higher legal and related expenses ($5.8 billion compared to $3.0 billion in the prior year) and repositioning costs ($1.6 billion compared to $590 million in the prior year).

Excluding the legal and related expenses, net fraud loss in 2013, repositioning charges and the impact of foreign exchange translation into U.S. dollars for reporting purposes (FX translation), which lowered reported expenses by approximately $503 million in 2014 compared to 2013, expenses were roughly unchanged at $43.9 billion as repositioning savings, expense reductions in Citi Holdings and other productivity initiatives were fully offset by the impact of higher regulatory and compliance and volume-related costs. (Citi’s results of operations excluding the impact of legal and related expenses, repositioning charges and FX translation are non-GAAP financial measures.  Citi believes the presentation of its results of operations excluding these impacts provides a more meaningful depiction for investors of the underlying fundamentals of its businesses.)

Excluding the impact of the net fraud loss in 2013, Citicorp’s expenses were $47.3 billion, up 12% from the prior year, primarily reflecting higher legal and related expenses, largely in

Corporate/Other

($4.8 billion compared to $432 million in 2013), higher repositioning costs ($1.6 billion compared to $547 million in 2013), higher regulatory and compliance costs and higher volume-related costs, partially offset by efficiency savings.  Excluding the impact of the mortgage settlement in 2014, Citi Holdings’ expenses were $4.0 billion, down 34% from 2013, reflecting lower legal and related expenses as well as the ongoing decline in Citi Holdings’ assets.

Credit Costs and Allowance for Loan Losses

Citi’s total provisions for credit losses and for benefits and claims of $7.5 billion declined 12% from 2013.  Excluding the impact of the mortgage settlement in 2014, total provisions for credit losses and for benefits and claims declined 13% to $7.4 billion versus the prior year.  Net credit losses of $9.0 billion were down 14% versus the prior year.  Consumer net credit losses declined 15% to $8.7 billion, reflecting continued improvements in the

North America

mortgage portfolio within Citi Holdings,

as well as

North America

Citi-branded cards and Citi retail services in Citicorp.  Corporate net credit losses increased 43% to $288 million in 2014.  Corporate net credit losses in 2014 included approximately $113 million of incremental net credit losses related to the Pemex supplier program in Mexico (for additional information regarding the Pemex supplier program, see “

Institutional Clients Group

” below).

The net release of allowance for loan losses and unfunded lending commitments was $2.3 billion in 2014.  Excluding the impact of the mortgage settlement in 2014, the net release of allowance for loan losses and unfunded lending commitments was $2.4 billion in 2014 compared to a $2.8 billion release in the prior year.  Citicorp’s net reserve release increased to $1.4 billion from $736 million in 2013 due to higher reserve releases in

North America GCB

and

ICG

, reflecting improved credit trends

.

Citi Holdings’ net reserve release, excluding the impact of the mortgage settlement in 2014, decreased 53% to $958 million, primarily due to lower releases related to the

North America

mortgage portfolio (which also had lower net credit losses).

Citigroup’s total allowance for loan losses was $16.0 billion at year end, or 2.50% of total loans, compared to $19.6 billion, or 2.97%, at the end of 2013.  The decline in the total allowance for loan losses reflected the continued wind down of Citi Holdings and overall continued improvement in the credit quality of Citi’s loan portfolios.  The consumer allowance for loan losses was $13.6 billion, or 3.68% of total consumer loans, at year end, compared to $17.1 billion, or 4.34% of total loans, at the end of 2013.  The consumer 90+ days past due delinquencies were $4.6 billion, or 1.27% of consumer loans, at year end, a decline from $5.7 billion or 1.49% of loans in the prior year.  Total non-accrual assets fell to $7.4 billion, a 22% reduction compared to 2013.  Corporate non-accrual loans declined 38% to $1.2 billion, while Consumer non-accrual loans declined 17% to $5.9 billion, both reflecting the continued improvement in credit trends.

Capital

Despite the challenging operating environment and elevated legal and related expenses during 2014, Citi was able to maintain its regulatory capital, primarily through net income and the further reduction of its DTAs.  Citigroup’s Basel III Tier 1 Capital and Common Equity Tier 1 Capital ratios, on a fully implemented basis, were 11.5% and 10.6% as of December 31, 2014, respectively, compared to 11.3% and 10.6% as of December 31, 2013 (all based on the Advanced Approaches for determining risk-weighted assets).  Citigroup’s estimated Basel III Supplementary Leverage ratio as of December 31, 2014 was 6.0% compared to 5.4% as of


December 31, 2013, each based on the revised final U.S. Basel III rules.  For additional information on Citi’s capital ratios and related components, see “Capital Resources” below.

Citicorp

Citicorp net income decreased 32% from the prior year to $10.7 billion.  CVA/DVA, recorded in

ICG

,

was negative $343 million (negative $211 million after-tax) in 2014, compared to negative $345 million (negative $214 million after-tax) in the prior year (for a summary of CVA/DVA by business within

ICG

, see “

Institutional Clients Group

” below).

Excluding CVA/DVA as well as the impact of the net fraud loss in Mexico, the tax items and the divestiture of Credicard noted above, Citicorp’s net income was $11.1 billion, down 29% from the prior year, as higher expenses, a higher effective tax rate and lower revenues were partially offset by continued improvement in credit costs.

Citicorp revenues, net of interest expense, decreased 1% from the prior year to $71.1 billion.  Excluding CVA/DVA, Citicorp revenues were $71.4 billion in 2014, also down 1% from the prior year.

GCB

revenues of $37.8 billion decreased 1% versus the prior year.

North America GCB

revenues declined 1% to $19.6 billion driven by lower retail banking revenues, partially offset by higher revenues in Citi-branded cards and Citi retail services.  Retail banking revenues declined 9% to $4.9 billion versus the prior year, primarily reflecting lower mortgage origination revenues and spread compression in the deposits portfolios, partially offset by volume-related growth and gains from branch sales during the year.  Citi-branded cards revenues of $8.3 billion were up 1% versus the prior year as purchase sales grew and an improvement in spreads driven by a reduction in promotional rate balances mostly offset the impact of lower average loans.  Citi retail services revenues increased 4% to $6.5 billion, mainly reflecting the impact of the Best Buy portfolio acquisition in September 2013, partially offset by continued declines in fee revenues primarily reflecting higher yields and improving credit and the resulting increase in contractual partner payments.

North America GCB

average deposits of $171 billion grew 3% year-over-year and average retail loans of $46 billion grew 9%.  Average card loans of $110 billion increased 2%, and purchase sales of $252 billion increased 5% versus the prior year.  For additional information on the results of operations of

North America GCB

for 2014, see “

Global Consumer Banking—North America GCB

” below.

International

GCB

revenues (consisting of

EMEA GCB

,

Latin America GCB

and

Asia GCB

) decreased 2% versus the prior year to $18.1 billion.  Excluding the impact of FX translation, international

GCB

revenues rose 2% from the prior year, driven by 4% growth in

Latin America GCB

and 1% growth in

Asia GCB

, partially offset by a 1% decline in

EMEA GCB

(for the impact of FX translation on 2014 results of operations for each of

EMEA GCB, Latin America GCB

and

Asia GCB

, see the table accompanying the discussion of each respective business’ results of operations below).  The growth in international

GCB

revenues, excluding the impact of FX translation, mainly reflected volume growth in all regions

,

partially offset by spread compression, the ongoing impact of regulatory changes and the repositioning of Citi’s franchise in

Korea

,

as well as market exits in

EMEA GCB

in 2013.  For additional information on the results of operations of

EMEA GCB, Latin America GCB

and

Asia GCB

for 2014,

see “

Global Consumer Banking

” below. Year-over-year, international

GCB

average deposits increased 2%, average retail loans increased 7%, investment sales increased 8%, average card loans increased 2% and card purchase sales increased 5%, all excluding the impact of Credicard’s results in the prior year period and FX translation.

ICG

revenues were $33.3 billion in 2014, down 1% from the prior year.  Excluding CVA/DVA,

ICG

revenues were $33.6 billion, also down 1% from the prior year.

Banking

revenues of $17.0 billion, excluding CVA/DVA and the impact of mark-to-market gains/(losses) on hedges related to accrual loans within corporate lending (see below), increased 5% from the prior year, primarily reflecting growth in investment banking, corporate lending and private bank revenues.  Investment banking revenues increased 7% versus the prior year, driven by an 11% increase in advisory revenues to $949 million and an 18% increase in equity underwriting to $1.2 billion.  Debt underwriting revenues of $2.5 billion were largely unchanged from 2013.  Private bank revenues, excluding CVA/DVA, increased 7% to $2.7 billion from the prior year, driven by increased client volumes and growth in investment and capital markets products, partially offset by spread compression.  Corporate lending revenues rose 52% to $1.9 billion, including $116 million of mark-to-market gains on hedges related to accrual loans compared to a $287 million loss in the prior year.  Excluding the mark-to-market impact on hedges related to accrual loans in both periods, corporate lending revenues rose 15% versus the prior year to $1.7 billion, primarily reflecting growth in average loans and improved funding costs.  Treasury and trade solutions revenues increased by 1% versus the prior year to $7.9 billion as volume and fee growth was largely offset by the impact of spread compression globally.

Markets and securities services

revenues of $16.5 billion, excluding CVA/DVA, decreased 8% from the prior year.  Fixed income markets revenues of $11.8 billion, excluding CVA/DVA, decreased 11% from the prior year, reflecting weakness across rates and currencies, credit markets and municipals due to challenging trading conditions, partially offset by increased securitized products and commodities revenues.  The first half of 2013 included a strong performance in rates and currencies, driven in part by the impact of quantitative easing globally.  Equity markets revenues of $2.8 billion, excluding CVA/DVA, declined 1% versus the prior year, mostly reflecting weakness in cash equities in

EMEA

driven by volatility in Europe, partially offset by strength in prime finance.  Securities services revenues of $2.3 billion increased 3% versus the prior year primarily due to increased volumes, assets under custody and overall client activity.  For additional information on the results of operations of

ICG

for 2014, see “

Institutional Clients Group

” below.

Corporate/Other

revenues decreased to $47 million from $121 million in the prior year, driven mainly by lower revenues from sales of available-for-sale securities as well as hedging activities.  For additional information on the results of


operations of

Corporate/Other

in 2014, see “

Corporate/Other

” below.

Citicorp end-of-period loans were roughly unchanged at $572 billion, with 1% growth in corporate loans offset by a 2% decline in consumer loans.  Excluding the impact of FX translation, Citicorp loans grew 3%, with 4% growth in corporate loans and 2% growth in consumer loans.

Citi Holdings

Citi Holdings’ net loss was $3.4 billion in 2014 compared to a net loss of $1.9 billion in 2013.  CVA/DVA

was negative $47 million (negative $29 million after-tax) in 2014, compared to positive $3 million (positive $1 million after-tax) in the prior year. Excluding the impact of CVA/DVA and the mortgage settlement in 2014, Citi Holdings’ net income was $385 million, reflecting lower expenses, higher revenues and lower net credit losses, partially offset by a lower net loan loss reserve release.

Citi Holdings’ revenues increased 27% to $5.8 billion from the prior year.  Excluding CVA/DVA, Citi Holdings’ revenues increased 28% to $5.9 billion from the prior year.  Net interest revenues increased 11% year-over-year to $3.5 billion, largely driven by lower funding costs.  Non-interest revenues, excluding CVA/DVA, increased 68% to $2.3 billion from the prior year, primarily driven by higher gains on assets sales and the absence of repurchase reserve builds for representation and warranty claims in 2014.  For additional information on the results of operations of Citi Holdings in 2014, see “Citi Holdings” below.

Citi Holdings’ assets were $98 billion, 16% below the prior year, and represented approximately 5% of Citi’s total GAAP assets and 14% of its risk-weighted assets under Basel III as of year end (based on the Advanced Approaches for determining risk-weighted assets).

CITICORP

Citicorp is Citigroup’s global bank for consumers and businesses and represents Citi’s core franchises. Citicorp is focused on providing best-in-class products and services to customers and leveraging Citigroup’s unparalleled global network, including many of the world’s emerging economies. Citicorp is physically present in approximately 100 countries, many for over 100 years, and offers services in over 160 countries and jurisdictions. Citi believes this global network provides a strong foundation for servicing the broad financial services needs of its large multinational clients and for meeting the needs of retail, private banking, commercial, public sector and institutional clients around the world.

Citicorp consists of the following operating businesses:

Global Consumer Banking

(which consists of consumer banking in

North America, EMEA, Latin America

and

Asia

) and

Institutional Clients Group

(which includes

Banking

and

Markets and securities services

). Citicorp also includes

Corporate/Other

.  At December 31, 2014, Citicorp had $1.7 trillion of assets and $889 billion of deposits, representing 95% of Citi’s total assets and 99% of Citi’s total deposits, respectively.

NM Not meaningful


GLOBAL CONSUMER BANKING

Global Consumer Banking (GCB)

consists of Citigroup’s four geographical consumer banking

businesses that provide traditional banking services to retail customers through retail banking, commercial banking, Citi-branded cards and Citi retail services (for additional information on these businesses, see “Citigroup Segments” above).

GCB

is a globally diversified business with 3,280 branches in 35 countries around the world as of December 31, 2014.  For the year ended December 31, 2014,

GCB

had $399 billion of average assets and $331 billion of average deposits.

GCB

’s overall strategy is to leverage Citi’s global footprint and seek to be the preeminent bank for the emerging affluent and affluent consumers in large urban centers.  In credit cards and in certain retail markets, Citi serves customers in a somewhat broader set of segments and geographies.

Consistent with its strategy to continue to optimize its branch footprint and further concentrate its presence in major metropolitan areas, during 2014, Citi announced that it intends to exit its consumer businesses in the following markets: Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Nicaragua, Panama and Peru (in

Latin America

); Japan, Guam and its consumer finance business in Korea (in

Asia

); and the Czech Republic, Egypt and Hungary (in

EMEA

).  Citi expects to substantially complete its exit from these businesses by the end of 2015.  These consumer businesses, consisting of $28 billion of assets, $7 billion of consumer loans and $3 billion of deposits (excluding approximately $21 billion of deposits reclassified to held-for-sale as a result of Citi’s agreement in December 2014 to sell its Japan retail banking business) as of December 31, 2014, contributed approximately $1.6 billion of revenues, $1.4 billion of expenses and a net loss of $40 million in 2014, with the loss primarily attributable to repositioning and other actions directly related to the exit plans.  These businesses will be reported as part of Citi Holdings beginning in the first quarter of 2015.  For additional information, see “Executive Summary” above and “

Latin America GCB

NORTH AMERICA GCB

North America GCB

provides traditional banking and Citi-branded cards and Citi retail services to retail customers and small to mid-size businesses in the U.S.

North America GCB

’s 849 retail bank branches as of December 31, 2014 are largely concentrated in the greater metropolitan areas of New York, Chicago, Miami, Washington, D.C., Boston, Los Angeles and San Francisco.

At December 31, 2014,

North America GCB

had approximately 11.7 million retail banking customer accounts, $46.8 billion of retail banking loans and $171.4 billion of deposits.  In addition,

North America GCB

had approximately 111.7 million Citi-branded and Citi retail services credit card accounts, with $114.0 billion in outstanding card loan balances.

NM Not meaningful


2014 vs. 2013

Net income

increased by 13% due to lower net credit losses, higher loan loss reserve releases and lower expenses, partially offset by lower revenues.

Revenues

decreased 1%, with lower revenues in retail banking, partially offset by higher revenues in Citi-branded cards and Citi retail services.  Net interest revenue increased 3% primarily due to an increase in average loans in Citi retail services driven by the Best Buy portfolio acquisition in September 2013 and continued volume growth in retail banking, which more than offset lower average loans in Citi-branded cards.  Non-interest revenue decreased 22%, driven by lower mortgage origination revenues due to significantly lower U.S. mortgage refinancing activity and a continued decline in revenues in Citi retail services, primarily reflecting improving credit and the resulting impact on contractual partner payments, partially offset by a 5% increase in total card purchase sales to $252 billion and gains during the year from branch sales (approximately $130 million).

Retail banking revenues of $4.9 billion decreased 9% due to the lower mortgage origination revenues and spread compression in the deposit portfolios, which began to abate during the latter part of the year, partially offset by continued volume-related growth and the gains from branch sales.   Consistent with

GCB

’s strategy, during 2014,

NA GCB

closed or sold over 130 branches (a 14% decline from the prior year), with announced plans to sell or close an additional 60 branches in early 2015.  Average loans of $46 billion increased 9% and average deposits of $171 billion increased 3%.

Cards revenues increased 2% as average loans of $110 billion increased 3% versus 2013.  In Citi-branded cards, revenues increased 1% as a 4% increase in purchase sales and higher net interest spreads, driven by the continued reduction of promotional balances in the portfolio, mostly offset lower average loans (3% decline from 2013).  The decline in average loans was driven primarily by the reduction in promotional balances, and to a lesser extent, increased customer payment rates during the year.  In addition, while the business experienced modest full rate loan growth during 2014, growth in full rate loan balances began to slow during the latter part of the year.  Combined with the continued reduction in promotional balances,

NA GCB

could experience pressure on full rate loan growth during 2015.

Citi retail services revenues increased 4% primarily due to a 12% increase in average loans driven by the Best Buy acquisition, partially offset by continued declines in fee revenues primarily reflecting higher yields and improving credit and the resulting increase in contractual partner payments.  Citi retail services revenues also benefited from lower funding costs, partially offset by a decline in net interest spreads due to a higher percentage of promotional balances within the portfolio.  Purchase sales in Citi retail services increased 7% from 2013, driven by the acquisition of the Best Buy portfolio.

With respect to both cards portfolios, as widely publicized, U.S. gas prices declined during 2014, particularly in the fourth quarter.  The decline in gas prices has negatively impacted purchase sales in the fuel portfolios, particularly in Citi retail services, and consumer savings from lower gas

prices may not result in higher spending in other spend categories.

NA GCB

will continue to monitor trends in this area going into 2015.

Expenses

decreased 2% as ongoing cost reduction initiatives were partially offset by higher repositioning charges, increased investment spending and an increase in Citi retail services expenses due to the impact of the Best Buy portfolio acquisition.  Cost reduction initiatives included the ongoing repositioning of the mortgage business due to the decline in mortgage refinancing activity, as well as continued rationalization of the branch footprint, including reducing the number of overall branches, as discussed above.

Provisions

decreased 18% due to lower net credit losses (9%) and higher loan loss reserve releases (21%).  Net credit losses declined in Citi-branded cards (down 14% to $2.2 billion) and in Citi retail services (down 2% to $1.9 billion).  The loan loss reserve release increased to $1.2 billion due to the continued improvement in Citi-branded cards, partially offset by a lower loan loss reserve release in Citi retail services due to reserve builds for new loans originated in the Best Buy portfolio.  Given the improvement in credit within the cards portfolios during 2014,

NA GCB

would not expect to see similar levels of loan loss reserve releases in 2015.

2013 vs. 2012

Net income

decreased 14%, mainly driven by lower revenues and lower loan loss reserve releases, partially offset by lower net credit losses and expenses.

Revenues

decreased 6% primarily due to lower retail banking revenues.  The decline in retail banking revenues was primarily due to lower mortgage origination revenues driven by the significantly lower U.S. mortgage refinancing activity and ongoing spread compression in the deposit portfolios, partially offset by growth in average deposits, average commercial loans and average retail loans.

Cards revenues increased 1%.  In Citi-branded cards, revenues were unchanged as continued improvement in net interest spreads, reflecting higher yields as promotional balances represented a smaller percentage of the portfolio total as well as lower funding costs, were offset by a decline in average loans.  Citi retail services revenues increased 3% primarily due to the acquisition of the Best Buy portfolio, partially offset by improving credit and the resulting impact on contractual partner payments.

Expenses

decreased 3%, primarily due to lower legal and related costs and repositioning savings, partially offset by higher

mortgage origination costs and expenses in cards as a result of the Best Buy portfolio acquisition.

Provisions

increased 7%, as lower net credit losses in the Citi-branded cards and Citi retail services portfolios were offset by lower loan loss reserve releases ($1.0 billion in 2013 compared to $2.4 billion in 2012), primarily related to cards, as well as reserve builds for new loans originated in the Best Buy portfolio.


EMEA GCB

EMEA GCB

provides traditional banking and Citi-branded card services to retail customers and small to mid-size businesses, primarily in Central and Eastern Europe and the Middle East. The countries in which

EMEA GCB

has the largest presence are Poland, Russia and the United Arab Emirates.

At December 31, 2014,

EMEA GCB

had 137 retail bank branches with approximately 3.1 million retail banking customer accounts, $5.4 billion in retail banking loans, $12.8 billion in deposits, and 2.0 million Citi-branded card accounts with $2.2 billion in outstanding card loan balances.

For a reconciliation of certain of these metrics to the reported results, see the table above.

2014 vs. 2013

Net income

declined $58 million to a net loss of $27 million as higher credit costs and lower revenues were partially offset by lower expenses.

Revenues

decreased 1%, driven by lower revenues resulting from the sales of Citi’s consumer operations in Turkey and Romania during 2013, spread compression and the absence of the prior-year gain related to the Turkey sale, largely offset by volume growth.  Net interest revenue was roughly unchanged as spread compression was offset by growth in average retail loans.  Non-interest revenue decreased 4%, mainly reflecting lower revenues due to the sales of the consumer operations in Turkey and Romania, partially offset by higher investment fees due to increased sales of higher spread investment products.

Retail banking revenues increased 2%, primarily due to increases in investment sales (3%), average deposits (5%) and average retail loans (11%), partially offset by the impact of the sales of the consumer operations in Turkey and Romania.  Cards revenues declined 6%, primarily due to spread compression, interest rate caps, particularly in Poland, and the impact of the sales of the consumer operations in Turkey and Romania.  Continued regulatory changes, including caps on interchange rates in Poland, and spread compression will likely continue to negatively impact revenues in

EMEA GCB

in 2015.

Expenses

decreased 1%, primarily due to the impact of the sales of the consumer operations in Turkey and Romania and efficiency savings, which were largely offset by higher repositioning charges, continued investment spending on new internal operating platforms and volume-related expenses.

Provisions

increased 98% to $87 million driven by a loan loss reserve build mainly related to Citi’s consumer business in Russia due to the ongoing economic situation in Russia (as discussed below), partially offset by a 1% decline in net credit losses.

Russia

Citi’s ability to grow its consumer business in Russia has been negatively impacted by actions Citi has taken to mitigate its risks and exposures in response to the ongoing political instability, such as limiting its exposure to additional credit risk.  In addition, the ongoing economic situation in Russia, coupled with consumer overleveraging in the market, has negatively impacted consumer credit, particularly delinquencies in the

Russian card and personal installment loan portfolios (which totaled $1.2 billion as of December 31, 2014, or 0.4% of total

GCB

loans), and Citi currently expects these trends could continue into 2015.  Citi has taken these trends into consideration in determining its allowance for loan loss reserves.  Any further actions Citi may take to mitigate its exposures or risks, or the imposition of additional sanctions (such as asset freezes) involving Russia or against Russian entities, business sectors, individuals or otherwise, could further negatively impact the results of operations of

EMEA GCB

.  For additional information on Citi’s exposures in Russia, see “Managing Global Risk—Country and Cross-Border Risk” below.

2013 vs. 2012

Net income

of $31 million compared to a net loss of $56 million in 2012 as lower expenses and lower net credit losses were partially offset by lower revenues, primarily due to the impact of the sales of Citi’s consumer operations in Turkey and Romania.

Revenues

decreased 2%, mainly driven by the lower revenues resulting from the sales of the consumer operations in Turkey and Romania, partially offset by higher volumes in core markets and a gain related to the Turkey sale.

Retail banking revenues decreased 1%, driven by the sales of the consumer operations in Turkey and Romania, partially offset by increases in average deposits (1%) and average retail loans (13%) as well as the gain related to the Turkey sale.  Cards revenues declined 4%, primarily due to spread compression and interest rate caps, particularly in Poland, and an 8% decrease in average cards loans, primarily due to the sales of the consumer operations in Turkey and Romania.

Expenses

declined 6%, primarily due to repositioning savings as well as lower repositioning charges, partially offset by higher volume-related expenses and continued investment spending on new internal operating platforms.

Provisions

declined 53% due to a 37% decrease in net credit losses largely resulting from the impact of the sales of the consumer operations in Turkey and Romania and a net credit recovery in the second quarter 2013.


LATIN AMERICA GCB

Latin America GCB

provides traditional banking and Citi-branded card services to retail customers and small to mid-size businesses, with the largest presence in Mexico and Brazil.

Latin America GCB

includes branch networks throughout

Latin America

as well as Banco Nacional de Mexico, or Banamex, Mexico’s second-largest bank, with 1,542 branches as of December 31, 2014.  As previously announced, in the fourth quarter of 2014, Citi entered into an agreement to sell its consumer business in Peru (for additional information, see “Executive Summary” and “

Global Consumer Banking

At December 31, 2014,

Latin America GCB

had 1,829 retail branches, with approximately 31.5 million retail banking customer accounts, $27.7 billion in retail banking loans and $45.5 billion in deposits.  In addition, the business had approximately 8.8 million Citi-branded card accounts with $10.9 billion in outstanding loan balances.

2014 vs. 2013

Net income

decreased 3% as higher expenses and credit costs were partially offset by higher revenues.

Revenues

increased 4%, primarily due to volume growth and spread and fee growth in Mexico, partially offset by continued spread compression in the region and slower overall economic growth in certain

Latin America

markets, including Mexico and Brazil.  Net interest revenue increased 4% due to increased volumes and stable spreads in Mexico, partially offset by the ongoing spread compression in other

Latin America

markets.  Non-interest revenue increased 3%, primarily due to higher fees from increased volumes in retail banking and cards.

Retail banking revenues increased 3% as average loans increased 6%, investment sales increased 19% and average deposits increased 6%, partially offset by lower spreads in Brazil and Colombia.  Cards revenues increased 6% as average loans increased 5% and purchase sales increased 1%, excluding the impact of Credicard’s results in the prior year period (for additional information, see Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements).  The increase in cards revenues was partially offset by lower economic growth and slowing cards purchase sales in Mexico due to the previously disclosed fiscal reforms enacted in 2013 in Mexico, which included, among other things, higher income and other taxes that negatively impacted consumer behavior and spending.  Citi expects these trends, as well as spread compression, could continue to negatively impact revenues in

Latin America GCB

in 2015.

Expenses

increased 5%, primarily due to mandatory salary increases in certain countries, higher legal and related costs, increased repositioning charges and higher technology spending, partially offset by productivity and repositioning savings.

Provisions

increased 7%, primarily due to higher net credit losses, which were partially offset by a lower loan loss reserve build.  Net credit losses increased 22%, driven by portfolio growth and continued seasoning in the Mexico cards portfolio.  Net credit losses were also impacted by both the slower economic growth and fiscal reforms in Mexico (as discussed above) as well as a $71 million charge-off in the fourth quarter of 2014 related to Citi’s homebuilder exposure in Mexico, which was offset by a related release of previously established loan loss reserves and thus neutral to the cost of credit.  The continued impact of the fiscal reforms and economic slowdown in Mexico is likely to cause net credit losses in

Latin America GCB

to remain elevated.

Net income

decreased 9% as higher credit costs, higher expenses and a higher effective tax rate were partially offset by higher revenues.

Revenues

increased 7%, primarily due to volume growth in retail banking and cards, partially offset by spread compression.  Retail banking revenues increased 5% as average loans increased 12%, investment sales increased 13% and average deposits increased 2%.  Cards revenues increased 10% as average loans increased 10% and purchase sales increased 12%, excluding the impact of Credicard’s results.

Expenses

increased 3% due to increased volume-related costs, mandatory salary increases in certain countries and higher regulatory costs, partially offset by lower repositioning charges and higher repositioning savings.

Provisions

increased 25%, primarily due to higher net credit losses as well as a higher loan loss reserve build.  Net credit losses increased 25%, primarily in the Mexico cards and personal loan portfolios, reflecting both volume growth and portfolio seasoning.  The loan loss reserve build increased 52%, primarily due to an increase in reserves in Mexico related to the top three Mexican homebuilders, with the remainder due to portfolio growth and seasoning and the impact of potential losses related to hurricanes in the region during September 2013.


ASIA GCB

Asia GCB

provides traditional banking and Citi-branded card services to retail customers and small to mid-size businesses, with the largest Citi presence in Korea, Singapore, Australia, Hong Kong, Taiwan, India, Japan, Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand and the Philippines as of December 31, 2014.  As previously announced, Citi entered into an agreement in December 2014 to sell its retail banking business in Japan (for additional information, see “Executive Summary” and “

Global Consumer Banking

Net income

decreased 9%, primarily due to higher expenses, partially offset by lower credit costs and higher revenues.

Revenues

increased 1%, as higher non-interest revenue was partially offset by a decline in net interest revenue.  Non-interest revenue increased 5%, primarily driven by higher fee revenues (largely due to the previously disclosed distribution agreement that commenced during the first quarter of 2014), partially offset by a decline in investment sales revenues.  Net interest revenue declined 2%, driven by the ongoing impact of regulatory changes, continued spread compression and the repositioning of the franchise in Korea.

Retail banking revenues increased 2%, due to the higher insurance fee revenues, partially offset by lower investment sales revenues and the repositioning of the franchise in Korea.  Investment sales revenues decreased 2%, due to weaker investor sentiment reflecting overall market trends and strong prior year performance, particularly in the first half of 2013.  Citi expects investment sales revenues will continue to reflect the overall capital markets environment in the region, including seasonal trends.  Average retail deposits increased 1% (2% excluding Korea) and average retail loans increased 7% (9% excluding Korea).

Cards revenues decreased 1%, due to the impact of regulatory changes, particularly in Korea, Indonesia and Singapore, spread compression and customer deleveraging, largely offset by a 2% increase in average loans and a 5% increase (8% excluding Korea) in purchase sales driven by growth in China, India, Singapore and Hong Kong.

While repositioning in Korea continued to have a negative impact on year-over-year revenue comparisons in

Asia GCB

, revenues in Korea largely stabilized in the second half of 2014.  Citi expects spread compression and regulatory changes in several markets across the region will continue to have a negative impact on

Asia GCB

revenues in 2015.

Expenses

increased 9%, primarily due to higher repositioning charges in Korea, investment spending and volume-related growth, partially offset by higher efficiency savings.

Provisions

decreased 17%, primarily due to higher loan loss reserve releases. Overall credit quality remained stable across the region during 2014.

Net interest revenue declined 5%, primarily driven by spread compression and the repositioning of the franchise in Korea.  Non-interest revenue increased 7%, mainly driven by growth in investment sales volume, despite a decrease in volumes in the second half of the year due to investor sentiment, reflecting overall market uncertainty.  Retail banking revenues decreased 3%, primarily driven by spread compression and the impact of regulatory changes, partially offset by a 12% increase in investment sales revenues.  Cards revenues increased 2%, as cards purchase sales increased 7% with growth across the region, partially offset by the continued impact of regulatory changes and customer deleveraging.

Expenses

declined 3%, as lower repositioning charges and efficiency and repositioning savings were partially offset by increased investment spending, particularly in China cards.

INSTITUTIONAL CLIENTS GROUP

Institutional Clients Group (ICG)

provides corporate, institutional, public sector and high-net-worth clients around the world with a full range of wholesale banking products and services, including fixed income and equity sales and trading, foreign exchange, prime brokerage, derivative services, equity and fixed income research, corporate lending, investment banking and advisory services, private banking, cash management, trade finance and securities services.

ICG

transacts with clients in both cash instruments and derivatives, including fixed income, foreign currency, equity and commodity products.

ICG

revenue is generated primarily from fees and spreads associated with these activities.

ICG

earns fee income for assisting clients in clearing transactions, providing brokerage and investment banking services and other such activities.  Revenue generated from these activities is recorded in

Commissions and fees

and

Investment banking

. In addition, as a market maker,

ICG

facilitates transactions, including holding product inventory to meet client demand, and earns the differential between the price at which it buys and sells the products.  These price differentials and the unrealized gains and losses on the inventory are recorded in

Principal transactions

.  Interest income earned on inventory and loans held less interest paid to customers on deposits is recorded as

Net interest revenue

.  Revenue is also generated from transaction processing and assets under custody and administration.

ICG

’s international presence is supported by trading floors in approximately 80 countries and a proprietary network in over 95 countries and jurisdictions.  At December 31, 2014,

ICG

had approximately $1.0 trillion of assets and $559 billion of deposits, while two of its businesses, securities services and issuer services, managed approximately $16.2 trillion of assets under custody compared to $14.3 trillion at the end of 2013.

As previously announced, Citi intends to exit certain businesses in

ICG

, including hedge fund services within

Securities services

, the prepaid cards business in

Treasury and trade solutions

, certain transfer agency operations and wealth management administration.  These businesses, consisting of approximately $4 billion of assets and deposits as of December 31, 2014, contributed approximately $460 million of revenues, $600 million of operating expenses and a net loss of $80 million in 2014, with roughly half of the pre-tax loss primarily attributable to repositioning and other actions directly related to the exit plans.  These businesses will be reported as part of Citi Holdings beginning in the first quarter of 2015.  For additional information, see “Executive Summary” above.


ICG Revenue Details—Excluding CVA/DVA and Gain/(Loss) on Loan Hedges

Hedges on accrual loans reflect the mark-to-market on credit derivatives used to economically hedge the corporate loan accrual portfolio. The fixed premium costs of these hedges are netted against the corporate lending revenues to reflect the cost of credit protection.

(2)

2014 includes the impact of a one-time pretax charge of $430 million related to the implementation of funding valuation adjustments (FVA) on derivatives in the third quarter of 2014.  For additional information, see Note

•

Investment banking

revenues increased 7%, reflecting a stronger overall market environment and improved wallet share with

The decline in overall wallet share was primarily driven by equity and debt underwriting and reflected market fragmentation.  Advisory revenues increased 11%, reflecting the increased target client activity and an expansion of the overall M&A market.

Equity underwriting revenues increased 18% largely in line with overall growth in market fees.  Debt underwriting revenues were largely unchanged.

•

Treasury and trade solutions

revenues increased 1%, as continued higher deposit balances, fee growth and trade activity were partially offset by the impact of spread compression globally.  End-of-period deposit balances were unchanged, but increased 3% excluding the impact of FX translation, largely driven by

Fixed income markets

revenues decreased 11%, driven by a decrease in rates and currencies revenues, partially offset by increased securitized products and commodities revenues.  Rates and currencies revenues declined due to historically muted levels of volatility, uncertainties around Russia and Greece and lower client activity in the first half of 2014.  In addition, the first half of 2013 included a strong performance in rates and currencies, driven in part by the impact of quantitative easing globally. Municipals and credit markets revenues declined due to challenging trading conditions resulting from macroeconomic uncertainties, particularly in the fourth quarter of 2014.  These declines were partially offset by increased securitized products and commodities revenues, largely in

North America

Excluding the impact of the net fraud loss, expenses increased 1%, as higher repositioning charges and legal and related expenses as well as increased regulatory and compliance costs were partially offset by efficiency savings and lower performance-based compensation.

Provisions

decreased 27%, primarily reflecting an improvement in the provision for unfunded lending commitments in the corporate loan portfolio, partially offset by higher net credit losses and a lower loan loss reserve release driven by the overall economic environment.  Net credit losses increased 52%, largely related to the Petróleos Mexicanos (Pemex) supplier program in the first quarter of 2014 (for additional information, see Citi’s Form 8-K filed with the SEC on February 28, 2014) as well as write-offs related to a specific counterparty.

CITI HOLDINGS

Citi Holdings contains businesses and portfolios of assets that Citigroup has determined are not central to its core Citicorp businesses.  Consistent with this determination, as previously announced, beginning in the first quarter of 2015, Citi’s consumer operations in 11 markets, as well as the consumer finance business in Korea, and certain businesses in

ICG

, will be reported as part of Citi Holdings (see “Executive Summary,” “

As of December 31, 2014, Citi Holdings assets were approximately $98 billion, a decrease of 16% year-over-year and 5% from September 30, 2014.  The decline in assets of $5 billion from September 30, 2014 primarily consisted of divestitures and run-off.  As of December 31, 2014, consumer assets in Citi Holdings were approximately $87 billion, or approximately 89% of Citi Holdings assets.  Of the consumer assets, approximately $59 billion, or 68%, consisted of

North America

mortgages (residential first mortgages and home equity loans), including consumer mortgages originated by Citi’s legacy CitiFinancial

North America

business (approximately $10 billion, or 17%, of the $59 billion as of December 31, 2014).  As of December 31, 2014, Citi Holdings represented approximately 5% of Citi’s GAAP assets and 14% of its risk-weighted assets under Basel III (based on the Advanced Approaches for determining risk-weighted assets).

(1)

2014 includes the impact of a one-time pretax charge of $44 million related to the implementation of funding valuation adjustments (FVA) on derivatives in the third quarter of 2014.  For additional information, see Note


to the Consolidated Financial Statements.  FVA is included within CVA for presentation purposes.

NM Not meaningful


The discussion of the results of operations for Citi Holdings below excludes the impact of CVA/DVA for all periods presented.  Presentations of the results of operations, excluding the impact of CVA/DVA, are non-GAAP financial measures.  Citi believes the presentation of Citi Holdings’ results excluding the impact of CVA/DVA is a more meaningful depiction of the underlying fundamentals of the business.  For a reconciliation of these metrics to the reported results, see the table above.

2014 vs. 2013

The

net loss

increased by $1.4 billion to $3.3 billion, largely due to the impact of the mortgage settlement in July 2014 (see “Executive Summary” above), partially offset by higher revenues and lower cost of credit.  Excluding the mortgage settlement, net income increased by $2.3 billion to $385 million, primarily due to lower expenses, higher revenues and lower net credit losses, partially offset by a lower net loan loss reserve release.

Revenues

increased 28%, primarily driven by gains on asset sales, including the sales of the consumer operations in Greece and Spain in the third quarter of 2014, lower funding costs and the absence of residential mortgage repurchase reserve builds for representation and warranty claims in 2014, partially offset by losses on the redemption of debt associated with funding Citi Holdings assets.

Expenses

increased 29%, principally reflecting higher legal and related costs ($4.7 billion compared to $2.6 billion in 2013) due to the mortgage settlement, partially offset by lower expenses driven by the ongoing decline in assets.  Excluding the impact of the mortgage settlement, expenses declined 34%, primarily driven by lower legal and related costs ($986 million compared to $2.6 billion in 2013) as well as the ongoing decline in assets.

Provisions

decreased 18%, driven by lower net credit losses, partially offset by a lower net loss reserve release.  Excluding the impact of the mortgage settlement, provisions declined 22%, driven by a 46% decline in net credit losses primarily due to continued improvements in

North America

mortgages and overall lower asset levels.  The net reserve release decreased 56% to $903 million, primarily due to lower releases related to the

North America

mortgage portfolio, partially offset by lower losses on asset sales.  Excluding the impact of the mortgage settlement, the net reserve release decreased 53%.  Loan loss reserves related to the

North America

mortgage portfolio were utilized to nearly fully offset net credit losses in the portfolio in 2014.

2013 vs. 2012

The

net loss

decreased by 71% to $1.9 billion.  2012 included the pretax loss of $4.7 billion ($2.9 billion after-tax) related to the sale of the Morgan Stanley Smith Barney joint venture (MSSB) to Morgan Stanley.  Excluding the MSSB loss, the net loss decreased to $1.9 billion from a net loss of $3.8 billion in 2012, due to significantly lower provisions for credit losses and higher revenues, partially offset by higher expenses.

Revenues

increased to $4.6 billion, primarily due to the absence of the MSSB loss.  Excluding the MSSB loss, revenues increased 23%, primarily driven by lower funding costs and lower residential mortgage repurchase reserve builds for representation and warranty claims ($470 million, compared to $700 million in 2012).

Expenses

increased 13%, primarily due to higher legal and related costs ($2.6 billion in 2013 compared to

$1.2 billion in 2012), driven largely by legacy private-label securitization and other mortgage-related issues, partially offset by lower overall assets.  Excluding legal and related costs, expenses declined 18% versus 2012.

Provisions

decreased 66%, driven by the absence of incremental net credit losses relating to the national mortgage settlement and those required by Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) guidance during 2012 (for additional information, see Note


to the Consolidated Financial Statements), as well as improved credit in

North America

mortgages and overall lower asset levels.  Loan loss reserve releases increased 27% to $2 billion, which included a loan loss reserve release of approximately $2.2 billion related to the

North America

mortgage portfolio, partially offset by losses on asset sales.

Japan Consumer Finance

In 2008, Citi decided to exit its Japan Consumer Finance business and has liquidated approximately 95% of the portfolio since that time.  As of December 31, 2014, Citi’s Japan Consumer Finance business had approximately $151 million in outstanding loans that currently charge or have previously charged interest rates in the “gray zone” (interest at rates that are legal but may not be enforceable and thus may subject Citi to customer refund claims), compared to approximately $278 million as of December 31, 2013.  Although the portfolio has largely been liquidated, Citi could be subject to refund claims on previously outstanding loans that charged gray zone interest and thus could be subject to losses on loans in excess of these amounts.

At December 31, 2014, Citi’s reserves related to customer refunds in the Japan Consumer Finance business were $442 million, compared to $434 million at December 31, 2013.  The increase in the total reserve year-over-year primarily resulted from net reserve builds in 2014 ($248 million compared to $28 million in 2013) due to less than expected declines in customer refund claims, partially offset by payments made to customers and a continuing reduction in the population of current and former customers who are eligible to make refund claims.

Citi continues to monitor and evaluate trends and developments relating to the charging of gray zone interest, including customer defaults, refund claims and litigation, and financial, legislative, regulatory, judicial and other political developments, as well as the potential impact to both currently and previously outstanding loans in this legacy business and its reserves related thereto.  Citi could be subject to additional losses as a result of these developments and the impact on Citi is subject to uncertainty and continues to be difficult to predict.


BALANCE SHEET REVIEW

The following sets forth a general discussion of the changes in certain of the more significant line items of Citi’s Consolidated Balance Sheet. For a description of and additional information on each of these balance sheet categories, see Notes


,


,


,


and


to the Consolidated Financial Statements. For additional information on Citigroup’s liquidity resources, including its deposits, short-term and long-term debt and secured financing transactions, see “Managing Global Risk—Market Risk—Funding and Liquidity Risk” below.

ASSETS

Cash and Deposits with Banks

Cash and deposits with banks decreased from the prior-year period as Citi continued to grow its investment portfolio to manage its interest rate position and deploy its excess liquidity. Average cash balances were $182 billion in the fourth quarter of 2014 compared to $204 billion in the fourth quarter of 2013.

Federal Funds Sold and Securities Borrowed or Purchased Under Agreements to Resell (Reverse Repos)

The decline in reverse repos and securities borrowing transactions from the prior-year period was due to the impact of FX translation and continued optimization of Citi’s secured lending (for additional information, see “Managing Global Risk—Market Risk—Funding and Liquidity Risk”

below), partially offset by increased short trading in the

Markets and securities services

businesses within

ICG.

Trading Account Assets

Trading account assets increased from the prior-year period, as increased market volatility, particularly in rates and currencies within

Markets and securities services

within

ICG

, increased the carrying value of Citi’s derivatives positions. Average trading account assets were $309 billion in the fourth quarter of 2014 compared to $292 billion in the fourth quarter of 2013.

Investments

The increase in investments year-over-year reflected Citi’s continued deployment of its excess cash (as discussed above) by investing in available-for-sale securities, particularly in U.S. treasuries.


Loans

The impact of FX translation on Citi’s reported loans was a negative $17 billion versus the prior-year period and negative $10 billion sequentially.

Excluding the impact of FX translation, Citi’s loans decreased 1% from the prior-year period, as 3% loan growth in Citicorp was offset by the continued declines in Citi Holdings. Consumer loans grew 2% year-over-year, driven by 4% growth internationally. Corporate loans grew 4% year-over-year. Traditional corporate lending balances grew 4%, with growth in

North America

driven by higher client transaction activity.  Treasury and trade solutions loans decreased 8%, as Citi maintained trade origination volumes while reducing lower spread assets and increasing asset sales to optimize returns.  Private bank and markets loans increased 16%, led by growth in the

North America

private bank, contributing to the revenue growth in that business. Citi Holdings loans decreased 21% year-over-year, mainly due to continued runoff and asset sales in the

North America

mortgage portfolio as well as the sales of the Greece and Spain consumer operations in the third quarter of 2014.

Sequentially, loans were relatively unchanged,

excluding the impact of FX translation, as the decline in Citi Holdings loans was offset by continued growth in Citicorp, driven by consumer loans.

During the fourth quarter of 2014, average loans of $651 billion yielded an average rate of 6.7%, compared to $659 billion and 6.7% in the third quarter of 2014 and $659 billion and 7.0% in the fourth quarter of 2013.

For further information on Citi’s loan portfolios, see “Managing Global Risk—Credit Risk” and “— Country Risk” below.

Other Assets

The fluctuations in other assets during the periods presented were largely changes in brokerage receivables driven by normal business activities.

LIABILITIES

Deposits

For a discussion of Citi’s deposits, see “Managing Global Risk—Market Risk—Funding and Liquidity Risk” below.

Federal Funds Purchased and Securities Loaned or Sold Under Agreements to Repurchase (Repos)

Citi’s federal funds purchased were not significant for the periods presented. The decrease in repos and securities lending transactions was due to the impact of FX translation and the continued optimization of secured funding.

For further information on Citi’s secured financing transactions, see “Managing Global Risk—Market Risk—Funding and Liquidity” below.

Trading Account Liabilities

The increase in trading account liabilities from the prior-year period was consistent with and driven by the increase in trading account assets, as discussed above.  Average trading account liabilities were $147 billion during the fourth quarter of 2014, compared to $112 billion in the fourth quarter of 2013.

Debt

For information on Citi’s long-term and short-term debt borrowings, see “Managing Global Risk—Market Risk—Funding and Liquidity Risk” below.

Other Liabilities

The increase in other liabilities from the prior-year period was driven by the reclassification to held-for-sale of approximately $21 billion of deposits as a result of Citi’s entry into an agreement in December 2014 to sell its Japan retail banking business, as well as changes in the levels of brokerage payables driven by normal business activities.

OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS

Citigroup enters into various types of off balance sheet arrangements in the ordinary course of business. Citi’s involvement in these arrangements can take many different forms, including without limitation:

•

purchasing or retaining residual and other interests in unconsolidated special purpose entities, such as credit card receivables and mortgage-backed and other asset-backed securitization entities;

•

holding senior and subordinated debt, interests in limited and general partnerships and equity interests in other unconsolidated special purpose entities;

•

providing guarantees, indemnifications, loan commitments, letters of credit and representations and warranties; and

•

entering into operating leases for property and equipment.

Citi enters into these arrangements for a variety of business purposes. For example, securitization arrangements offer investors access to specific cash flows and risks created through the securitization process. Securitization arrangements also assist Citi and Citi’s customers in monetizing their financial assets and securing financing at more favorable rates than Citi or the customers could otherwise obtain.

The table below shows where a discussion of Citi’s various off balance sheet arrangements may be found in this Form 10-K. In addition, see Notes 1,


and


to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS

The following table includes information on Citigroup’s contractual obligations, as specified and aggregated pursuant to SEC requirements.

(1)

For additional information about long-term debt obligations, see “Managing Global Risk—Market Risk—Funding and Liquidity” below and Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

(2)

Contractual obligations related to interest payments on long-term debt for 2015—2019 are calculated by applying the December 31, 2014 weighted- average interest rate (3.34%) on average outstanding long-term debt to the average remaining contractual obligations on long-term debt for each of those years. The “Thereafter” interest payments on long-term debt for the remaining years to maturity (for 2020—2098) are calculated by applying interest rates on the remaining contractual obligations on long-term debt for each of those years.

(3)

Purchase obligations consist of obligations to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding on Citi. For presentation purposes, purchase obligations are included in the table above through the termination date of the respective agreements, even if the contract is renewable. Many of the purchase agreements for goods or services include clauses that would allow Citi to cancel the agreement with specified notice; however, that impact is not included in the table above (unless Citi has already notified the counterparty of its intention to terminate the agreement).

(4)

Other liabilities

reflected on Citigroup’s Consolidated Balance Sheet includes accounts payable, accrued expenses, uncertain tax positions and other liabilities that have been incurred and will ultimately be paid in cash; legal reserve accruals are not included in the table above. Also includes discretionary contributions in 2015 for Citi’s non-U.S. pension plans and the non-U.S. postretirement plans, as well as employee benefit obligations accounted for under SFAS 87 (ASC 715), SFAS 106 (ASC 715) and SFAS 112 (ASC 712).


CAPITAL RESOURCES

Overview

Capital is used principally to support assets in Citi’s businesses and to absorb credit, market and operational losses. Citi primarily generates capital through earnings from its operating businesses. Citi may augment its capital through issuances of common stock, noncumulative perpetual preferred stock and equity issued through awards under employee benefit plans, among other issuances. During 2014, Citi continued to raise capital through noncumulative perpetual preferred stock issuances amounting to approximately $3.7 billion, resulting in a total of approximately $10.5 billion outstanding as of December 31, 2014.

Further, Citi’s capital levels may also be affected by changes in regulatory and accounting standards as well as the impact of future events on Citi’s business results, such as corporate and asset dispositions.

Capital Management

Citigroup’s capital management framework is designed to ensure that Citigroup and its principal subsidiaries maintain sufficient capital consistent with each entity’s respective risk profile and all applicable regulatory standards and guidelines. Citi assesses its capital adequacy against a series of internal quantitative capital goals, designed to evaluate the Company’s capital levels in expected and stressed economic environments. Underlying these internal quantitative capital goals are strategic capital considerations, centered on preserving and building financial strength. Senior management, with oversight from Citigroup’s Board of Directors, is responsible for the capital assessment and planning process, which is integrated into Citi’s capital plan. Implementation of the capital plan is carried out mainly through Citigroup’s Asset and Liability Committee, with oversight from the Risk Management Committee of Citigroup’s Board of Directors. Asset and liability committees are also established globally and for each significant legal entity, region, country and/or major line of business.

Current Regulatory Capital Standards

Overview

Citi is subject to regulatory capital standards issued by the Federal Reserve Board which, commencing with 2014, constitute the substantial adoption of the final U.S. Basel III rules (Final Basel III Rules), such as those governing the composition of regulatory capital (including the application of regulatory capital adjustments and deductions) and, initially for the second quarter of


in conjunction with the granting of permission by the Federal Reserve Board to exit parallel reporting, approval to apply the Basel III Advanced Approaches framework in deriving risk-based capital ratios. Further, the Final Basel III Rules implement the “capital floor provision” of the so-called “Collins Amendment” of the Dodd-Frank Act, which requires Advanced Approaches banking organizations, such as Citi and Citibank, N.A., upon exiting parallel reporting, to calculate each of the three risk-based capital ratios (Common Equity Tier 1 Capital, Tier 1 Capital and Total Capital) under both the Standardized Approach starting on January 1, 2015 (or, for 2014, prior to the effective date of the Standardized Approach, the Basel I credit risk and Basel II.5 market risk capital rules, subsequently referred to in this section as the Basel III 2014 Standardized Approach) and the Advanced Approaches and publicly report (as well as measure compliance against) the lower of each of the resulting capital ratios.

Under the Final Basel III Rules, Citi, as with principally all U.S. banking organizations, is also required to maintain a minimum Tier 1 Leverage ratio of 4% commencing in 2014. The Tier 1 Leverage ratio, a non-risk-based measure of capital adequacy, is defined as Tier 1 Capital as a percentage of quarterly adjusted average total assets less amounts deducted from Tier 1 Capital.

Basel III Transition Arrangements

The Final Basel III Rules contain several differing, largely multi-year transition provisions (i.e., “phase-ins” and “phase-outs”) with respect to the stated minimum Common Equity Tier 1 Capital and Tier 1 Capital ratio requirements, substantially all regulatory capital adjustments and deductions, non-qualifying Tier 1 and Tier 2 Capital instruments (such as non-grandfathered trust preferred securities and certain subordinated debt issuances), and the capital buffers. All of these transition provisions, with the exception of the phase-out of non-qualifying trust preferred securities from Tier 2 Capital, will be fully implemented by January 1, 2019 (full implementation).


The following chart sets forth the transitional progression to full implementation by January 1, 2019 of  the regulatory capital components (i.e., inclusive of the mandatory 2.5% Capital Conservation Buffer and at least a 2% global systemically important bank holding company (GSIB) surcharge, but exclusive of the potential imposition of an additional Countercyclical Capital Buffer) comprising the effective minimum risk-based capital ratios.

Basel III Transition Arrangements: Minimum Risk-Based Capital Ratios

(1)    The Final Basel III Rules do not address GSIBs. The transitional progression reflected in the chart above is consistent with the phase-in arrangement under the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision’s (Basel Committee) GSIB rules, which would subject Citi to at least a 2% GSIB surcharge. In December 2014, however, the Federal Reserve Board issued a notice of proposed rulemaking which would impose risk-based capital surcharges upon U.S. bank holding companies that are identified as GSIBs, including Citi. As of December 31, 2014, Citi estimates its GSIB surcharge under the Federal Reserve Board’s proposal would be 4%, compared to at least 2% under the Basel Committee requirements. For additional information regarding the Federal Reserve Board’s proposed rule, see “Regulatory Capital Standards Developments” below.


The following chart presents the transition arrangements (phase-in and phase-out) under the Final Basel III Rules for significant regulatory capital adjustments and deductions relative to Citi.

Basel III Transition Arrangements: Significant Regulatory Capital Adjustments and Deductions

(1)

Includes the phase-in of Common Equity Tier 1 Capital deductions for all intangible assets other than goodwill and mortgage servicing rights (MSRs); and excess over 10%/15% limitations for deferred tax assets (DTAs) arising from temporary differences, significant common stock investments in unconsolidated financial institutions and MSRs. Goodwill (including goodwill “embedded” in the valuation of significant common stock investments in unconsolidated financial institutions) is fully deducted in arriving at Common Equity Tier 1 Capital commencing January 1, 2014. The amount of other intangible assets, aside from MSRs, not deducted in arriving at Common Equity Tier 1 Capital are risk-weighted at 100%, as are the excess over the 10%/15% limitations for DTAs arising from temporary differences, significant common stock investments in unconsolidated financial institutions and MSRs prior to full implementation of the Final Basel III Rules. Upon full implementation, the amount of temporary difference DTAs, significant common stock investments in unconsolidated financial institutions and MSRs not deducted in arriving at Common Equity Tier 1 Capital are risk-weighted at 250%.

(2)

Includes the phase-in of Common Equity Tier 1 Capital deductions related to DTAs arising from net operating loss, foreign tax credit and general business credit carry-forwards and defined benefit pension plan net assets; and the phase-in of the Common Equity Tier 1 Capital adjustment for cumulative unrealized net gains (losses) related to changes in fair value of financial liabilities attributable to Citi’s own creditworthiness.

(3)

To the extent Additional Tier 1 Capital is not sufficient to absorb regulatory capital adjustments and deductions, such excess is to be applied against Common Equity Tier 1 Capital.

(4)

Includes the phase-out from Common Equity Tier 1 Capital of adjustments related to unrealized gains (losses) on available-for-sale (AFS) debt securities; unrealized gains on AFS equity securities; unrealized gains (losses) on held-to-maturity (HTM) securities included in AOCI; and defined benefit plans liability adjustment.

Citigroup’s Capital Resources Under Current Regulatory Standards

During 2014, Citi was required to maintain stated minimum Common Equity Tier 1 Capital, Tier 1 Capital and Total Capital ratios of 4%, 5.5% and 8%, respectively. Furthermore, to be “well capitalized” under current federal bank regulatory agency definitions, a bank holding company must have a Tier 1 Capital ratio of at least 6%, a Total Capital ratio of at least 10%, and not be subject to a Federal Reserve Board directive to maintain higher capital levels.

The following table sets forth the capital tiers, risk-weighted assets, quarterly adjusted average total assets and capital ratios under current regulatory standards (reflecting Basel III Transition Arrangements) for Citi as of

December 31, 2014

and

December 31, 2013

.


Citigroup Capital Components and Ratios Under Current Regulatory Standards (Basel III Transition Arrangements)

Pro forma presentation based on application of the Final Basel III Rules consistent with current period presentation.

(2)

Basel III 2014 Standardized Approach which reflects the application of the Basel I credit risk and Basel II.5 market risk capital rules.

(3)

Under the Advanced Approaches framework eligible credit reserves that exceed expected credit losses are eligible for inclusion in Tier 2 Capital to the extent the excess reserves do not exceed 0.6% of credit risk-weighted assets, which differs from the Standardized Approach in which the allowance for credit losses is includable in Tier 2 Capital up to 1.25% of credit risk-weighted assets, with any excess allowance for credit losses being deducted in arriving at credit risk-weighted assets.

(4)

Tier 1 Leverage ratio denominator.

(5)

As of

December 31, 2014

and

December 31, 2013

, Citi’s reportable Common Equity Tier 1 Capital, Tier 1 Capital, and Total Capital ratios were the lower derived under the Basel III Advanced Approaches framework.

As indicated in the table above, Citigroup’s capital ratios at

December 31, 2014

were in excess of the stated minimum requirements under the Final Basel III Rules. In addition, Citi was also “well capitalized” under current federal bank regulatory agency definitions as of December 31, 2014 and

December 31, 2013

.

(2)

Issuance costs of $124 million and $93 million related to preferred stock outstanding at

December 31, 2014

and

December 31, 2013

, respectively, are excluded from common stockholders’ equity and netted against preferred stock in accordance with Federal Reserve Board regulatory reporting requirements, which differ from those under U.S. GAAP.

(3)

In addition, includes the net amount of unamortized loss on held-to-maturity (HTM) securities. This amount relates to securities that were previously transferred from AFS to HTM, and non-credit related factors such as changes in interest rates and liquidity spreads for HTM securities with other-than-temporary impairment.

(4)

The transition arrangements for significant regulatory capital adjustments and deductions impacting Common Equity Tier 1 Capital and/or Additional    Tier 1 Capital are set forth above in the table entitled “Basel III Transition Arrangements: Significant Regulatory Capital Adjustments and Deductions.”

(5)

Common Equity Tier 1 Capital is adjusted for accumulated net unrealized gains (losses) on cash flow hedges included in AOCI that relate to the hedging of items not recognized at fair value on the balance sheet.

(6)

The cumulative impact of changes in Citigroup’s own creditworthiness in valuing liabilities for which the fair value option has been elected and own-credit valuation adjustments on derivatives are excluded from Common Equity Tier 1 Capital, in accordance with the Final Basel III Rules.

(7)

Includes goodwill “embedded” in the valuation of significant common stock investments in unconsolidated financial institutions.

(8)

Of Citi’s approximately $49.5 billion of net DTAs at

December 31, 2014

, approximately $25.5 billion of such assets were includable in regulatory capital pursuant to the Final Basel III Rules, while approximately $24.0 billion of such assets were excluded in arriving at regulatory capital. Comprising the excluded net DTAs was an aggregate of approximately $25.6 billion of net DTAs arising from net operating loss, foreign tax credit and general business credit carry-forwards as well as temporary differences, of which $14.4 billion were deducted from Common Equity Tier 1 Capital and $11.2 billion were deducted from Additional Tier 1 Capital. In addition, approximately $1.6 billion of net DTLs, primarily consisting of DTLs associated with goodwill and certain other intangible assets, partially offset by DTAs related to cash flow hedges, are permitted to be excluded prior to deriving the amount of net DTAs subject to deduction under these rules. Separately, under the Final Basel III Rules, goodwill and these other intangible assets are deducted net of associated DTLs in arriving at Common Equity Tier 1 Capital, while Citi’s current cash flow hedges and the related deferred tax effects are not required to be reflected in regulatory capital.

(9)

Aside from MSRs, reflects DTAs arising from temporary differences and significant common stock investments in unconsolidated financial institutions.

(10)

Represents Citigroup Capital XIII trust preferred securities, which are permanently grandfathered as Tier 1 Capital under the Final Basel III Rules, as well as 50% of non-grandfathered trust preferred securities. The remaining 50% of non-grandfathered trust preferred securities are eligible for inclusion in Tier 2 Capital during 2014 in accordance with the transition arrangements for non-qualifying capital instruments under the Final Basel III Rules.

(11)

50% of the minimum regulatory capital requirements of insurance underwriting subsidiaries must be deducted from each of Tier 1 Capital and Tier 2 Capital.

(12)

Under the transition arrangements of the Final Basel III Rules, non-qualifying subordinated debt issuances which consist of those with a fixed-to-floating rate step-up feature where the call/step-up date has not passed are eligible for 50% inclusion in Tier 2 Capital during 2014, with the threshold based upon the aggregate outstanding principal amounts of such issuances as of January 1, 2014.

(13)

Advanced Approaches banking organizations are permitted to include in Tier 2 Capital eligible credit reserves that exceed expected credit losses to the extent that the excess reserves do not exceed 0.6% of credit risk-weighted assets.

(14)

Risk-weighted assets at December 31, 2013 are presented on a pro forma basis, assuming the application of the Final Basel III Rules consistent with current period presentation, including the resultant impact on credit risk-weighted assets.

(15)

Under the Final Basel III Rules, credit risk-weighted assets during the transition period reflect the effects of transitional arrangements related to regulatory capital adjustments and deductions and, as a result, will differ from credit risk-weighted assets derived under full implementation of the rules.

(16)

During 2014, Citi’s operational risk-weighted assets were increased by $81 billion, of which $56 billion was in conjunction with the granting of permission by the Federal Reserve Board to exit the parallel run period and commence applying the Basel III Advanced Approaches framework, effective with the second quarter of 2014. Further, an additional $25 billion was recognized during the last six months of 2014, reflecting an evaluation of ongoing events in the banking industry.

,  respectively, which were partially offset by the netting of issuance costs of $31 million and $7 million during those periods.

Citigroup Risk-Weighted Assets Rollforward (Basel III Advanced Approaches with Transition Arrangements)

(1)

Total risk-weighted assets at the beginning of the period (i.e., as of December 31, 2013) are presented on a pro forma basis to reflect application of the Final Basel III Rules related to the effect of transition arrangements on regulatory capital components, consistent with current period presentation.

(2)    Reflects the effect of adjusting credit risk-weighted assets at the beginning of the period from a Basel I basis to a Basel III Advanced Approaches basis; adjusting market risk-weighted assets from a Basel II.5 basis to a Basel III Advanced Approach basis; and including operational risk-weighted assets as required under the Basel III Advanced Approaches rules.

(3)

Retail exposures decreased from year-end 2013, driven by reduction in loans and commitments, sale of consumer businesses in Spain and Greece and the impact of FX translation, offset by enhancements to credit risk models.

(4)

Wholesale exposures decreased from September 30, 2014, driven by model parameter updates and reductions in loans and commitments. The increase from year-end 2013 was driven by enhancements to credit risk models.

(5)

OTC derivatives decreased from September 30, 2014, driven by model parameter updates. The increase from year-end 2013 was largely due to enhancements to credit risk models, partially offset by model parameter updates.

Basel III (Full Implementation)

Citigroup’s Capital Resources Under Basel III  (Full Implementation)

Citi currently anticipates that its effective minimum Common Equity Tier 1 Capital, Tier 1 Capital and Total Capital ratio requirements under the Final Basel III Rules, on a fully implemented basis, will be at least 9%, 10.5% and 12.5%, respectively. However, Citi’s effective minimum ratio requirements will be higher if the Federal Reserve Board’s GSIB surcharge rule were to be adopted as proposed.

Further, under the Final Basel III Rules, Citi must also comply with a 4% minimum Tier 1 Leverage ratio requirement and an effective 5% minimum Supplementary Leverage ratio requirement.

The following table sets forth the capital tiers, risk-weighted assets, quarterly adjusted average total assets and capital ratios under the Final Basel III Rules for Citi, assuming full implementation, as of

Common Equity Tier 1 Capital Ratio

Citi’s Common Equity Tier 1 Capital ratio was 10.6% at December 31, 2014, unchanged from that estimated as of December 31, 2013 (both based on application of the Advanced Approaches for determining total risk-weighted assets). The ratio remained stable year-over-year as the growth in Common Equity Tier 1 Capital largely reflecting net income of $7.3 billion and the favorable effects attributable to DTA utilization of approximately $3.3

billion, was offset by a decline in

Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)

, and higher credit and operational risk-weighted assets.


Components of Citigroup Capital Under Basel III (Advanced Approaches with Full Implementation)

(1)

Issuance costs of $124 million and $93 million related to preferred stock outstanding at

December 31, 2014

and

December 31, 2013

, respectively, are excluded from common stockholders’ equity and netted against preferred stock in accordance with Federal Reserve Board regulatory reporting requirements, which differ from those under U.S. GAAP.

(2)

Common Equity Tier 1 Capital is adjusted for accumulated net unrealized gains (losses) on cash flow hedges included in AOCI that relate to the hedging of items not recognized at fair value on the balance sheet.

(3)

The cumulative impact of changes in Citigroup’s own creditworthiness in valuing liabilities for which the fair value option has been elected and own-credit valuation adjustments on derivatives are excluded from Common Equity Tier 1 Capital, in accordance with the Final Basel III Rules.

(4)

Includes goodwill “embedded” in the valuation of significant common stock investments in unconsolidated financial institutions.

(5)

Of Citi’s approximately $49.5 billion of net DTAs at

December 31, 2014

, approximately $15.2 billion of such assets were includable in regulatory capital pursuant to the Final Basel III Rules, while approximately $34.3 billion of such assets were excluded in arriving at Common Equity Tier 1 Capital. Comprising the excluded net DTAs was an aggregate of approximately $35.9 billion of net DTAs arising from net operating loss, foreign tax credit and general business credit carry-forwards as well as temporary differences that were deducted from Common Equity Tier 1 Capital. In addition, approximately $1.6 billion of net DTLs, primarily consisting of DTLs associated with goodwill and certain other intangible assets, partially offset by DTAs related to cash flow hedges, are permitted to be excluded prior to deriving the amount of net DTAs subject to deduction under these rules. Separately, under the Final Basel III Rules, goodwill and these other intangible assets are deducted net of associated DTLs in arriving at Common Equity Tier 1 Capital, while Citi’s current cash flow hedges and the related deferred tax effects are not required to be reflected in regulatory capital.

(6)

Aside from MSRs, reflects DTAs arising from temporary differences and significant common stock investments in unconsolidated financial institutions.

During 2014, Citi’s operational risk-weighted assets were increased by $81 billion, of which $56 billion was in conjunction with the granting of permission by the Federal Reserve Board to exit the parallel run period and commence applying the Basel III Advanced Approaches framework, effective with the second quarter of 2014. Further, an additional $25 billion was recognized during the last six months of 2014, reflecting an evaluation of ongoing events in the banking industry.

Total risk-weighted assets under the Basel III Advanced Approaches increased from year-end 2013 largely due to the previously mentioned increases in operational risk-weighted assets throughout 2014 as well as enhancements to Citi’s credit risk models, partially offset by model parameter updates, the impact of FX translation and the ongoing decline in Citi Holdings assets.

Total risk-weighted assets under the Basel III Standardized Approach increased during 2014 substantially due to an increase in credit risk-weighted assets attributable to an increase in derivative exposures and corporate lending products within the

. Citi’s operational risk-weighted assets were further increased by $12.5 billion during each of the third and fourth quarters of 2014, reflecting an evaluation of ongoing events in the banking industry.

Supplementary Leverage Ratio

Under the Final Basel III Rules, Advanced Approaches banking organizations, including Citi and Citibank, N.A., are also required to calculate a Supplementary Leverage ratio, which significantly differs from the Tier 1 Leverage ratio by also including certain off-balance sheet exposures within the denominator of the ratio (Total Leverage Exposure).

In September 2014, the U.S. banking agencies adopted revisions to the Final Basel III Rules (Revised Final Basel III Rules) with respect to the definition of Total Leverage Exposure as well as the frequency with which certain components of the Supplementary Leverage ratio are calculated. As revised, the Supplementary Leverage ratio represents end of period Tier 1 Capital to Total Leverage Exposure, with the latter defined as the sum of the daily average of on-balance sheet assets for the quarter and the average of certain off-balance sheet exposures calculated as of the last day of each month in the quarter, less applicable Tier 1 Capital deductions.

Under the Revised Final Basel III Rules, the definition of Total Leverage Exposure has been modified from that of the Final Basel III Rules in certain respects, such as by permitting limited netting of repo-style transactions (i.e., qualifying repurchase or reverse repurchase and securities  borrowing or lending transactions) with the same counterparty and allowing for the application of cash variation margin to reduce derivative exposures, both of which are subject to certain specific conditions, as well as by distinguishing and expanding the measure of exposure for written credit derivatives. Moreover, the credit conversion factors (CCF) to be applied to certain off-balance sheet exposures have been conformed to those under the Basel III Standardized Approach for determining credit risk-weighted assets, with the exception of the imposition of a 10% CCF floor.

Consistent with the Final Basel III Rules, Advanced Approaches banking organizations will be required to disclose the Supplementary Leverage ratio commencing January 1, 2015. Further, U.S. GSIBs and their subsidiary


insured depository institutions, including Citi and Citibank, N.A., will be subject to enhanced Supplementary Leverage ratio standards. The enhanced Supplementary Leverage ratio standards establish a 2% leverage buffer for U.S. GSIBs in addition to the stated 3% minimum Supplementary Leverage ratio requirement in the Final Basel III Rules. If a U.S. GSIB failed to exceed the 2% leverage buffer, it would be subject to increasingly onerous restrictions (depending upon the extent of the shortfall) regarding capital distributions and discretionary executive bonus payments. Accordingly, U.S. GSIBs are effectively subject to a 5% minimum Supplementary Leverage ratio requirement. Additionally, the final rule requires that

insured depository institution subsidiaries of U.S. GSIBs, including Citibank, N.A., maintain a Supplementary Leverage ratio of 6% to be considered “well capitalized” under the revised prompt corrective action framework established by the Final Basel III Rules. Citi and Citibank, N.A. are required to be compliant with these higher effective minimum ratio requirements on January 1, 2018.

The following table sets forth Citi’s estimated Basel III Supplementary Leverage ratio and related components, under the Revised Final Basel III Rules, for the three months ended December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013.

(6)

Repo-style transactions include repurchase or reverse repurchase transactions and securities borrowing or securities lending transactions.

Citigroup’s estimated Basel III Supplementary Leverage ratio under the Revised Final Basel III Rules was 6.0% for the fourth quarter of 2014, unchanged from the third quarter of 2014, and increased from 5.4% for the fourth quarter of 2013 (on a pro forma basis to conform to current period presentation). Citi’s estimated Basel III Supplementary Leverage ratio remained unchanged quarter-over-quarter as the Tier 1 Capital benefits resulting from preferred stock issuances and a decrease in goodwill were offset by a decrease in

Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)

, with Total Leverage Exposure also remaining substantially unchanged. The growth in the ratio from the fourth quarter of 2013 was principally driven by an increase in Tier 1 Capital attributable largely to net income of $7.3 billion, approximately $3.3 billion of DTA utilization and approximately $3.7 billion of perpetual preferred stock issuances, offset in part by a reduction in

Accumulated

other comprehensive income (loss)

and a marginal increase in Total Leverage Exposure.

Citibank, N.A.’s estimated Basel III Supplementary Leverage ratio under the Revised Final Basel III Rules was 6.3% for the fourth quarter of 2014, unchanged from the third quarter of 2014 and, on a pro forma basis, from the fourth quarter of 2013. Tier 1 Capital benefits resulting from quarterly and annual net income and DTA utilization were largely offset by an increase in Total Leverage Exposure and a reduction in

Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)

and, for the year only, cash dividends paid by Citibank, N.A. to its parent, Citicorp, and  which were subsequently remitted to Citigroup.


Regulatory Capital Standards Developments

GSIB Surcharge

In December 2014, the Federal Reserve Board issued a notice of proposed rulemaking which would impose risk-based capital surcharges upon U.S. bank holding companies that are identified as GSIBs, including Citi. Under the

Federal Reserve Board’s proposed rule, consistent with the Basel Committee’s methodology, identification as a GSIB would be based primarily on quantitative measurement indicators underlying five equally weighted broad categories of systemic importance: (i) size, (ii) interconnectedness, (iii) cross-jurisdictional activity, (iv) substitutability, and (v) complexity. With the exception of size, each of the other categories are comprised of multiple indicators also of equal weight, and amounting to 12 indicators in total.

A U.S. banking organization that is designated a GSIB under the proposed methodology would calculate a surcharge using two methods and would be subject to the higher of the resulting two surcharges. The first method (“method 1”) would be based on the same five broad categories of systemic importance used to identify a GSIB,  whereas under the second method (“method 2”) the substitutability indicator would be replaced with a measure intended to assess the extent of a GSIB’s reliance on short-term wholesale funding. As proposed, given that the calculation under method 2 involves, in part, the doubling of the indicator scores related to size, interconnectedness, cross-jurisdictional activity and complexity, method 2 would generally result in higher surcharges as compared to method 1.

Estimated GSIB surcharges under the proposed rule, which would be required to be comprised entirely of Common Equity Tier 1 Capital, would initially range from 1.0% to 4.5% of total risk-weighted assets. Moreover, the GSIB surcharge would be an extension of the Capital Conservation Buffer and, if invoked, any Countercyclical Capital Buffer, and would result in restrictions on earnings distributions (e.g., dividends, equity repurchases, and discretionary executive bonuses) should the surcharge be drawn upon to absorb losses during periods of financial or economic stress, with the degree of such restrictions based upon the extent to which the surcharge is drawn.

Under the proposal, like that of the Basel Committee’s rule, the GSIB surcharge would be introduced in parallel with the Capital Conservation Buffer and, if applicable, any Countercyclical Capital Buffer, commencing phase-in on January 1, 2016 and becoming fully effective on January 1, 2019.

As of December 31, 2014, Citi estimates its GSIB surcharge under the Federal Reserve Board’s proposal would be 4%, compared to at least 2% under the Basel Committee requirements.

For additional information regarding the Federal Reserve Board’s GSIB surcharge proposal, as well as the Financial Stability Board’s total loss-absorbing capacity, or TLAC, consultative document, see “Risk Factors—Regulatory Risks” and “Managing Global Risk—Market Risk—Funding and Liquidity Risk” below.


Tangible Common Equity, Tangible Book Value Per Share and Book Value Per Share

Tangible common equity (TCE), as currently defined by Citi, represents common equity less goodwill and other intangible assets (other than MSRs). Other companies may calculate TCE in a different manner. TCE and tangible book value per share are non-GAAP financial measures. Citi believes these capital metrics provide useful information, as they are used by investors and industry analysts.
