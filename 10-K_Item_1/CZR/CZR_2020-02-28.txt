Master Lease

The Master Lease provides for the lease of land, buildings, structures and other improvements on the land (including barges and riverboats), easements and similar appurtenances to the land and improvements relating to the operation of the leased properties. Our properties that are currently subject to the Master Lease are Trop AC, Laughlin, Greenville, Baton Rouge and Evansville. The Master Lease provides for an initial term of fifteen years with no purchase option. At our option, the Master Lease may be extended for up to four five-year renewal terms beyond the initial 15-year term. If we elect to renew the term of the Master Lease, the renewal will be effective as to all, but not less than all, of the leased property then subject to the Master Lease. We do not have the ability to terminate its obligations under the Master Lease prior to its expiration without GLPI’s consent. The obligations of the tenant under the Master Lease are guaranteed by ERI.

The rent payable under the Master Lease is comprised of “Base Rent” and “Percentage Rent.” Base rent is the sum of:

•Building Base Rent: a fixed component equal to $60.9 million during the first year of the Master Lease, and thereafter escalated annually by 2%, subject to a cap that would cause the preceding year’s adjusted revenue to rent ratio for the properties in the aggregate not to fall below 1.20:1.00 for the first five years of the Master Lease and 1.80:1.00 thereafter; plus

•Land Base Rent: a fixed component equal to $13.4 million, subject to adjustment in the event of the termination of the Master Lease with respect to any of the leased properties.

The percentage rent payable under the Master Lease is adjusted every two years based on the actual net revenues of the leased properties during the two-year period then ended. The initial variable rent percentage, which is fixed for the first two years from the Master Lease inception, is $13.4 million per year. The actual percentage increase is based on actual performance and may change materially.

The Master Lease is commonly known as a triple net lease. Accordingly, in addition to rent, we are required to pay the following, among other things: (i) lease payments to the underlying ground lessor for properties that are subject to ground leases; (ii) facility maintenance costs; (iii) all insurance premiums for insurance with respect to the leased properties and the business conducted on the leased properties; (iv) taxes levied on or with respect to the leased properties (other than taxes on the income of the lessor); and (v) all utilities and other services necessary or appropriate for the leased properties and the business conducted on the leased properties.






The foregoing summary of the Master Lease is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Master Lease, which has been filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.Under the prior lease accounting standard, itwasaccounted for as a failed sale-leasebackwith afinancing obligation equal to the fair value of the leased real estate assets and liabilities acquired in purchase accounting. Upon adoption of ASC 842 (see Note 3),the Company re-evaluated the Master Lease and determined this existing failed sale-leaseback transaction will continue to be accounted for as a financing obligation.

Betting, Online Gaming and Development Opportunities

William Hill

In September 2018, we entered into a 25-year agreement, which became effective January 29, 2019, with William Hill PLC and William Hill US, its U.S. subsidiary (together, “William Hill”) pursuant to which the Company (i) granted to William Hill the right to conduct betting activities in retail channels and under the Company’s first skin and third skin for online channels with respect to the Company’s current and future properties located in the United States and the territories and possessions of the United States, including Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands and (ii) agreed that William Hill will have the right to conduct real money online gaming activities utilizing the Company’s second skin available with respect to properties in such territories.Pursuant to the terms of the agreement, in January 2019 the Company received a 20% ownership interest in William Hill US as well as 13.4 million ordinary shares of William Hill PLC, which carry certain time restrictions on when they can be sold. Additionally, the Company receives a profit share from the operations of betting and other gaming activities associated with the Company’s properties. “Skin” in the context of this agreement refers to Eldorado’s ability to grant to William Hill an online channel that allows William Hill to operate online casino and sports gaming activities in reliance on, and utilizing the benefit of, any licenses granted to Eldorado or its subsidiaries.






The Stars Group

In November 2018, we entered into a 20-year agreement with The Stars Group Inc. (“TSG”) pursuant to which we agreed to provide TSG with options to obtain access to our second skin for online sports wagering and third skin for real money online gaming and poker, in each case with respect to our properties in the United States. Under the terms of the agreement, we will receive a revenue share from the operation of the applicable verticals by TSG under our licenses. Pursuant to the terms of the TSG agreement, we received 1.1 million TSG common shares valued at approximately $18.6 million and an additional $5.0 million in TSG common shares became payable to us upon TSG’s exercise of its first option, which shares we received in the fourth quarter of 2019. In December 2019 we sold approximately 0.5 million of our TSG common shares at the request of William Hill and in accordance with the terms of our William Hill agreement. We may also receive additional TSG common shares in the future based on TSG net gaming revenue generated in our markets.

Pompano Joint Venture

In April 2018, we entered into a joint venture with Cordish Companies (“Cordish”) to master plan and develop a mixed-use entertainment and hospitality destination expected to be located on unused land adjacent to the casino and racetrack at our Pompano property.  As the managing member, Cordish will operate the business and manage the development, construction, financing, marketing, leasing, maintenance and day-to-day operation of the various phases of the project. Additionally, Cordish will be responsible for the development of the master plan for the project with our input and will submit it for our review and approval. We and Cordish have made cash contributions of $500,000 each and could be required to make additional contributions to a maximum of $2.0 million ($1.0 million per member) at the request of the managing member. We have agreed to contribute approximately 130 to 200 acres of land to the joint venture for the project. As of December 31, 2019, we have contributed approximately 23 acres to the joint venture at an approximate fair value of $6.6 million. While we hold a 50% variable interest in the joint venture, we are not the primary beneficiary; as such the investment in the joint venture is accounted for using the equity method. We participate evenly with Cordish in the profits and losses of the joint venture, which is included in income (loss) from unconsolidated affiliates on the Consolidated Statements of Income.

Competition

The gaming industry is characterized by an increasingly high degree of competition and competition is intense in most of the markets in which we operate.  We compete with a variety of gaming operations, including land-based casinos, dockside casinos, riverboat casinos, casinos located on racing tracks and casinos located on Native American reservations as well as other forms of legalized gaming such as video gaming terminals (VGTs) at bars, restaurants and truck stops. We also compete, to a lesser extent, with other forms of legalized gaming and entertainment such as online gambling, bingo, pull tab games, card parlors, sports books, fantasy sports websites, “cruise-to-nowhere” operations, pari-mutuel or telephonic betting on horse racing and dog racing, state-sponsored lotteries, jai-alai, and, in the future, may compete with gaming at other venues. In addition, we compete more generally with other forms of entertainment for the discretionary spending of our customers.  Certain of our competitors are large gaming companies with greater name recognition and marketing and financial resources.  In some instances, particularly in the case of Native American casinos, our competitors pay lower taxes or no taxes.  These factors create additional challenges for us in competing for customers and accessing cash flow or financing to fund improvements for our casino and entertainment product that enable us to remain competitive.

Governmental Gaming Regulations

The gaming and racing industries are highly regulated, and we must maintain our licenses and pay gaming taxes to continue our operations. We are subject to extensive regulation under laws, rules and supervisory procedures primarily in the jurisdictions where our facilities are located or docked. These laws, rules and regulations generally concern the responsibility, financial stability and characters of the owners, managers, and persons with financial interests in the gaming operations. If additional gaming regulations are adopted in a jurisdiction in which we operate, such regulations could impose restrictions or costs that could have a significant adverse effect on us. From time to time, various proposals have been introduced in legislatures of jurisdictions in which we have operations that, if enacted, could adversely affect the tax, regulatory, operational or other aspects of the gaming industry and us. We do not know whether or when such legislation will be enacted. Gaming companies are currently subject to significant state and local taxes and fees in addition to normal federal and state corporate income taxes, and such taxes and fees are subject to increase at any time. Any material increase in these taxes or fees could adversely affect us.






Some jurisdictions, including those in which we are licensed, empower their regulators to investigate participation by licensees in gaming outside their jurisdiction and require access to periodic reports respecting those gaming activities. Violations of laws in one jurisdiction could result in disciplinary action in other jurisdictions.

Under provisions of gaming laws in jurisdictions in which we have operations, and under our organizational documents, certain of our securities are subject to restriction on ownership which may be imposed by specified governmental authorities. The restrictions may require a holder of our securities to dispose of the securities or, if the holder refuses, or is unable, to dispose of the securities, we may be required to repurchase the securities.

A more detailed description of the regulations to which we are subject is contained in Exhibit 99.1 to this Annual Report on Form 10‑K, which is incorporated herein by reference.

Reporting and Record‑Keeping Requirements

We are required periodically to submit detailed financial and operating reports and furnish any other information about us and our subsidiaries that gaming authorities may require. We are required to maintain a current stock ledger that may be examined by gaming authorities at any time. If any securities are held in trust by an agent or by a nominee, the record holder may be required to disclose the identity of the beneficial owner to gaming authorities. A failure to make such disclosure may be grounds for finding the record holder unsuitable. Gaming authorities may, and in certain jurisdictions do, require certificates for our securities to bear a legend indicating that the securities are subject to specified gaming laws.

Taxation

Gaming companies are typically subject to significant taxes and fees in addition to normal federal, state and local income taxes, and such taxes and fees are subject to increase at any time. We pay substantial taxes and fees with respect to our operations. From time to time, federal, state, local and provincial legislators and officials have proposed changes in tax laws, or in the administration of such laws, affecting the gaming industry. It is not possible to determine with certainty the likelihood of changes in tax laws or in the administration of such laws.

Internal Revenue Service Regulations

The Internal Revenue Service requires operators of casinos located in the United States to file information returns for U.S. citizens, including names and addresses of winners, for keno, bingo and slot machine winnings in excess of stipulated amounts. The Internal Revenue Service also requires operators to withhold taxes on some keno, bingo and slot machine winnings of nonresident aliens. We are unable to predict the extent to which these requirements, if extended, might impede or otherwise adversely affect operations of, and/or income from, the other games.

Regulations adopted by the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network of the Treasury Department (“FINCEN”) and the Nevada Gaming Authorities require the reporting of currency transactions in excess of $10,000 occurring within a gaming day, including identification of the patron by name and social security number. This reporting obligation began in May 1985 and may have resulted in the loss of gaming revenues to jurisdictions outside the United States which are exempt from the ambit of these regulations. In addition to currency transaction reporting requirements, suspicious financial activity is also required to be reported to FINCEN.

Other Laws and Regulations

Our businesses are subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations in addition to gaming regulations. These laws and regulations include, but are not limited to, restrictions and conditions concerning alcoholic beverages, food service, smoking, environmental matters, employees and employment practices, currency transactions, taxation, zoning and building codes, and marketing and advertising. Such laws and regulations could change or could be interpreted differently in the future, or new laws and regulations could be enacted. Material changes, new laws or regulations, or material differences in interpretations by courts or governmental authorities could adversely affect our operating results.

The sale of alcoholic beverages is subject to licensing, control and regulation by applicable local regulatory agencies. All licenses are revocable and are not transferable. The agencies involved have full power to limit, condition, suspend or revoke any license, and any disciplinary action could, and revocation would, have a material adverse effect upon our operations.






Intellectual Property

We use a variety of trade names, service marks, trademarks, patents and copyrights in our operations and believe that we have all the licenses necessary to conduct our continuing operations. We have registered several service marks, trademarks, patents and copyrights with the United States Patent and Trademark Office or otherwise acquired the licenses to use those which are material to conduct our business. We also own patents relating to unique casino games. We file copyright applications to protect our creative artworks, which are often featured in property branding, as well as our distinctive website content.

Seasonality

Casino, hotel and racing operations in our markets are subject to seasonal variation. Seasonal weather conditions can frequently adversely affect transportation routes to each of our properties and may cause flooding and other effects that result in the closure of our properties. As a result, unfavorable seasonal conditions could have a material adverse effect on our operations.

Environmental Matters

Employees and Labor Relations

As of December 31, 2019, we had approximately 15,500 employees. As of such date, we had 18 collective bargaining agreements covering approximately 3,100 employees.Five collective bargaining agreements are scheduled to expire in 2020, and we are currently renegotiating one collective bargaining agreement that has expired.There can be no assurance that we will be able to extend or enter into replacement agreements. If we are able to extend or enter into replacement agreements, there can be no assurance as to whether the terms will be on comparable terms to the existing agreements.
