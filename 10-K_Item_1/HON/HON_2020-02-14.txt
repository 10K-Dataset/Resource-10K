Competition

We are subject to competition in substantially all product and service areas. Some of our key competitors are:

•Aerospace: Garmin, Safran, Thales, and United Technologies

•Honeywell Building Technologies: Johnson Controls, Schneider Electric, Siemens and United Technologies

•Performance Materials and Technologies: Albemarle, BASF, Dupont, Emerson Electric, Schneider Electric, Siemens, Sinopec and Yokogawa

•Safety and Productivity Solutions: 3M, Kion Group, Mine Safety Appliances (MSA), TE Connectivity, and Zebra Technologies

Our businesses compete on a variety of factors such as price, quality, reliability, delivery, customer service, performance, applied technology, product innovation and product recognition. Brand identity, service to customers and quality are important competitive factors for our products and services, and there is considerable price competition. Other competitive factors include breadth of product line, research and development efforts and technical and managerial capability. While our competitive position varies among our products and services, we believe we are a significant competitor in each of our major product and service classes. Many of our competitors have substantial financial resources and significant technological capabilities. In addition, some of our products compete with the captive component divisions of OEMs.

U.S. Government Sales

Sales to the U.S. Government (principally by Aerospace), acting through its various departments and agencies and through prime contractors, amounted to $4,057 million, $3,403 million and $3,203 million in2019,2018and2017, which included sales to the U.S. Department of Defense, as a prime contractor and subcontractor, of $3,491 million, $2,832 million and $2,546 million in2019,2018and2017. We do not expect our overall operating results to be significantly affected by any proposed changes in2020federal defense spending due principally to the varied mix of the government programs which impact us (OEMs’ production, engineering development programs, aftermarket spares and repairs and overhaul programs), as well as our diversified commercial businesses.










International Operations

We engage in manufacturing, sales, service and research and development (R&D) globally. U.S. exports and non-U.S. manufactured products are significant to our operations. U.S. exports comprised 15% of our total sales in2019, 13% in2018and 12% in2017. Non-U.S. manufactured products and services, mainly in Europe and Asia, were 40% of our total sales in2019, 43% in2018and 44% in2017.

Information related to risks attendant to our foreign operations is included in Item 1A. Risk Factors under the caption “Macroeconomic and Industry Risks.”

Backlog

Our backlog represents the estimated remaining value of work to be performed under firm contracts. Backlog is equal to our remaining performance obligations under the contracts that meet the guidance on revenue from contracts with customers as discussed in Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Backlog was$25,612million and $24,850 million at December 31,2019and2018. We expect to recognize approximately57%of our remaining performance obligations as revenue in2020, and the remaining balance thereafter.

Raw Materials

The principal raw materials used in our operations are readily available. Although we occasionally experience disruption in raw materials supply, we experienced no significant problems in the purchase of key raw materials or commodities in2019. We are not dependent on any one supplier for a material amount of our raw materials.

Prices of certain key raw materials, including copper, fluorspar, tungsten salts, ethylene, aluminum, and molybdenum in Performance Materials and Technologies and nickel, steel, titanium and other metals in Aerospace, are expected to fluctuate. We offset raw material cost increases with formula or long-term supply agreements, price increases and hedging activities where feasible. We do not presently anticipate that a shortage of raw materials will cause any material adverse impacts during2020.

Patents, Trademarks, Licenses and Distribution Rights

Our segments are not dependent upon any single patent or related group of patents, or any licenses or distribution rights. In our judgment, our intellectual property rights are adequate for the conduct of our business. We believe that, in the aggregate, the rights under our patents, trademarks and licenses are generally important to our operations, but we do not consider any individual patent, trademark or any licensing or distribution rights related to a specific process or product to be of material importance in relation to our total business.










Environment

We are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign government requirements regarding protection of human health and the environment. Our policies, practices and procedures are designed to prevent unreasonable risk of environmental damage, and of resulting financial liability, in connection with our business. Some risk of environmental damage is, however, inherent in some of our operations and products, as it is with other companies engaged in similar businesses.

We engage in the handling, manufacturing, use and disposal of many substances classified as hazardous by one or more regulatory agencies. Our policies, practices and procedures are designed to prevent unreasonable risk of environmental damage and personal injury, and that our handling, manufacture, use and disposal of these substances meet or exceed environmental and safety laws and regulations. It is possible that future knowledge or other developments, such as improved capability to detect substances in the environment or increasingly strict environmental laws and standards and enforcement policies, could bring into question our current or past handling, manufacture, use or disposal of these substances.

Among other environmental requirements, we are subject to the federal Superfund and similar state and foreign laws and regulations, under which we have been designated as a potentially responsible party that may be liable for cleanup costs associated with current and former operating sites and various hazardous waste sites, some of which are on the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s National Priority List. While there is a possibility that a responsible party might be unable to obtain appropriate contribution from other responsible parties, we do not anticipate having to bear significantly more than our proportional share in multi-party situations taken as a whole.

We do not believe that Federal, State and local provisions regulating the discharge of materials into the environment, or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment, or any existing or pending climate change legislation, regulation, or international treaties or accords are reasonably likely to have a material effect in the foreseeable future on the Company’s business. We will continue to monitor emerging developments in this area.

Employees

We have approximately 113,000 employees at December 31,2019, of whom approximately 44,000 are located in the United States.
