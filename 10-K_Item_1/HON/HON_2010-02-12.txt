Aerospace Sales

Our sales to aerospace customers were 35 percent of our total sales in each of 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Our sales to commercial aerospace original equipment manufacturers were 7, 9 and 10 percent of our total sales in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. In addition, our sales to commercial
  aftermarket customers of aerospace products and services were 10, 11 and 11 percent of our total sales in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Our Aerospace results of operations can be impacted by various industry and economic conditions. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors.”




U.S. Government Sales

Sales
    to the U.S. Government (principally by our Aerospace segment), acting through
    its various departments and agencies and through prime contractors, amounted
    to $4,288, $4,240 and $4,011 million in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively,
    which included sales to the U.S. Department of Defense, as a prime contractor
    and subcontractor, of $3,455, $3,412 and $3,192 million in 2009, 2008 and
    2007, respectively. U.S. defense spending increased in 2009 and is also expected
    to increase in 2010. We do not expect to be significantly affected by any
    proposed changes in 2010 federal spending due principally to the varied mix
    of the government programs which impact us (OEM production, engineering development
    programs, aftermarket spares and repairs and overhaul programs). Our contracts
    with the U.S. Government are subject to audits, investigations, and termination
    by the government. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors.”

Backlog

Our total backlog at December 31, 2009 and 2008 was $13,182 and $12,972 million, respectively. We anticipate that approximately $9,339 million of the 2009 backlog will be filled in 2010. We believe that backlog is not necessarily a reliable indicator of our future sales because a substantial portion of the
  orders constituting this backlog may be canceled at the customer’s option.

Competition

We are subject to active competition in substantially all product and service areas. Competition is expected to continue in all geographic regions. Competitive conditions vary widely among the thousands of products and services provided by us, and vary by country. Depending on the particular customer or
  market involved, our businesses compete on a variety of factors, such as price, quality, reliability, delivery, customer service, performance, applied technology, product innovation and product recognition. Brand identity, service to customers and quality are generally important competitive factors for our products
  and services, and there is considerable price competition. Other competitive factors for certain products include breadth of product line, research and development efforts and technical and managerial capability. While our competitive position varies among our products and services, we believe we are a
  significant competitor in each of our major product and service classes. However, a number of our products and services are sold in competition with those of a large number of other companies, some of which have substantial financial resources and significant technological capabilities. In addition, some of our
  products compete with the captive component divisions of original equipment manufacturers. See Item 1A “Risk Factors” for further discussion.

International Operations

We are engaged in manufacturing, sales, service and research and development mainly in the United States, Europe, Canada, Asia and Latin America. U.S. exports and foreign manufactured products are significant to our operations. U.S. exports comprised 12, 10 and 10 percent of our total sales in 2009,
  2008 and 2007, respectively. Foreign manufactured products and services, mainly in Europe, were 39 percent of our total sales in 2009, 2008 and 2007.

Approximately 18 percent of total 2009 sales of Aerospace-related products and services were exports of U.S. manufactured products and systems and performance of services such as aircraft repair and overhaul. Exports were principally made to Europe, Canada, Asia and Latin America. Foreign
  manufactured products and systems and performance of services comprised approximately 15 percent of total 2009 Aerospace sales. The principal manufacturing facilities outside the U.S. are in Europe, with less significant operations in Canada, Mexico and Asia.

Approximately 2 percent of total 2009 sales of Automation and Control Solutions products were exports of U.S. manufactured products. Foreign manufactured products and performance of services accounted for 57 percent of total 2009 Automation and Control Solutions sales. The principal manufacturing
  facilities outside the U.S. are in Europe with less significant operations in Asia and Canada.




Approximately 31 percent of total 2009 sales of Specialty Materials products and services were exports of U.S. manufactured products. Exports were principally made to Asia and Latin America. Foreign manufactured products and performance of services comprised 25 percent of total 2009 Specialty
  Materials sales. The principal manufacturing facilities outside the U.S. are in Europe, with less significant operations in Asia and Canada.

Exports of U.S. manufactured products comprised 1 percent of total 2009 sales of Transportation Systems products. Foreign manufactured products accounted for 68 percent of total 2009 sales of Transportation Systems. The principal manufacturing facilities outside the U.S. are in Europe, with less
  significant operations in Asia and Latin America.

Financial information including net sales and long-lived assets related to geographic areas is included in Note 24 of Notes to Financial Statements in “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data”. Information regarding the economic, political, regulatory and other risks associated with international
  operations is included in “Item 1A. Risk Factors.”

Raw Materials

The
    principal raw materials used in our operations are generally readily available.
    We experienced no significant problems in the purchase of key raw materials
    and commodities in 2009. We are not dependent on any one supplier for a material
    amount of our raw materials, except related to phenol, a raw material used
    in our Specialty Materials segment. We purchase phenol under a supply agreement
  with one supplier.

The
    costs of certain key raw materials, including natural gas, benzene (the key
    component in phenol), ethylene, fluorspar and sulfur in our Specialty Materials
    business, steel, nickel, other metals and ethylene glycol in our Transportation
    Systems business, and nickel, titanium and other metals in our Aerospace
    business, are expected to remain volatile. In addition, in 2009 certain large
    long-term fixed supplier price agreements expired, primarily relating to
    components used by our Aerospace business, which in the aggregate, subjected
    us to higher volatility in certain component costs. We will continue to attempt
    to offset raw material cost increases with formula or long-term supply agreements,
    price increases and hedging activities where feasible. We do not anticipate
    that a shortage of raw materials will cause any material adverse impacts
    during 2010. See “Item
    1A. Risk Factors” for further discussion.

We are highly dependent on our suppliers and subcontractors in order to meet commitments to our customers. In addition, many major components and product equipment items are procured or subcontracted on a single-source basis with a number of domestic and foreign companies. We maintain a
  qualification and performance surveillance process to control risk associated with such reliance on third parties. While we believe that sources of supply for raw materials and components are generally adequate, it is difficult to predict what effects shortages or price increases may have in the future. Furthermore,
  the inability of these suppliers to meet their quality and/or delivery commitments to us, due to bankruptcy, natural disasters or any other reason, may result in significant costs and delay, including those in connection with the required recertification of parts from new suppliers with our customers or regulatory
  agencies.

Patents, Trademarks, Licenses and Distribution Rights

Our segments are not dependent upon any single patent or related group of patents, or any licenses or distribution rights. We own, or are licensed under, a large number of patents, patent applications and trademarks acquired over a period of many years, which relate to many of our products or
  improvements to those products and which are of importance to our business. From time to time, new patents and trademarks are obtained, and patent and trademark licenses and rights are acquired from others. We also have distribution rights of varying terms for a number of products and services produced by
  other companies. In our judgment, those rights are adequate for the conduct of our business. We believe that, in the aggregate, the rights under our patents, trademarks and licenses are generally important to our operations, but we do not consider any patent, trademark or related




group of patents, or any licensing or distribution rights related to a specific process or product, to be of material importance in relation to our total business. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors” for further discussion.

We have registered trademarks for a number of our products and services, including Honeywell, Aclar, Ademco, Autolite, Bendix, Enovate, Fire-Lite, FRAM, Garrett, Hand Held, Holts, Jurid, Metrologic, MK, North, Notifier, Novar, Prestone, Redex, RMG, Simoniz, Spectra, System Sensor and UOP.

Research and Development

Our research activities are directed toward the discovery and development of new products, technologies and processes and the development of new uses for existing products. The Company has research and development activities in the U.S., Europe, India and China.

Research and development (R&D) expense totaled $1,330, $1,543 and $1,459 million in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The decrease in R&D expense in 2009 compared to 2008 of 14 percent was consistent with our 15 percent decrease in net sales. However, as a percentage of sales, R&D increased to 4.3
  percent in 2009 compared to 4.2 percent in 2008. The increase as a percentage of sales was driven by lower sales, product, design and development costs in Automation and Control Solutions and Specialty Materials as well as expenditures on the development of turbocharging systems for new platforms,
  partially offset by lower R&D expense in Aerospace primarily due to major program completions. The increase in R&D expense in 2008 compared to 2007 of 6 percent was mainly due to additional product, design and development costs in Automation and Control Solutions, increased expenditures on the
  development of products for new aircraft platforms and increased expenditures on the development of turbocharging systems for new platforms. Customer-sponsored (principally the U.S. Government) R&D activities amounted to an additional $852, $903 and $881 million in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively.

Environment

We are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign government requirements regulating the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment. It is our policy to comply with these requirements, and we believe that, as a general matter, our policies,
  practices and procedures are properly designed to prevent unreasonable risk of environmental damage, and of resulting financial liability, in connection with our business. Some risk of environmental damage is, however, inherent in some of our operations and products, as it is with other companies engaged in
  similar businesses.

We are and have been engaged in the handling, manufacture, use and disposal of many substances classified as hazardous by one or more regulatory agencies. We believe that, as a general matter, our policies, practices and procedures are properly designed to prevent unreasonable risk of environmental
  damage and personal injury, and that our handling, manufacture, use and disposal of these substances are in accord with environmental and safety laws and regulations. It is possible, however, that future knowledge or other developments, such as improved capability to detect substances in the environment or
  increasingly strict environmental laws and standards and enforcement policies, could bring into question our current or past handling, manufacture, use or disposal of these substances.

Among other environmental requirements, we are subject to the federal superfund and similar state and foreign laws and regulations, under which we have been designated as a potentially responsible party that may be liable for cleanup costs associated with current and former operating sites and various
  hazardous waste sites, some of which are on the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s Superfund priority list. Although, under some court interpretations of these laws, there is a possibility that a responsible party might have to bear more than its proportional share of the cleanup costs if it is unable to obtain
  appropriate contribution from other responsible parties, we have not had to bear significantly more than our proportional share in multi-party situations taken as a whole.




We do not believe that existing or pending climate change legislation, regulation, or international treaties or accords are reasonably likely to have a material effect in the foreseeable future on the Company’s business or markets that it serves, nor on its results of operations, capital expenditures or financial position. We will continue to monitor emerging developments in this area.

Further information, including the current status of significant environmental matters and the financial impact incurred for remediation of such environmental matters, if any, is included in “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” in Note 21 of Notes to
  Financial Statements in “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” and in “Item 1A. Risk Factors.”

Employees

We have approximately 122,000 employees at December 31, 2009, of which approximately 54,000 were located in the United States.
