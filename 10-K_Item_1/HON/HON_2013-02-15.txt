Aerospace Sales

Our sales to aerospace customers were 32, 31, and 33 percent of our total sales in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Our sales to commercial aerospace original equipment manufacturers were 7, 6, and 6 percent of our total sales in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. In addition, our sales to commercial
  aftermarket customers of aerospace products and services were 12, 11, and 11 percent of our total sales in 2012, 2011 and 2010. Our Aerospace results of operations can be impacted by various industry and economic conditions. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors.”

U.S. Government Sales

Sales to the U.S. Government (principally by our Aerospace segment), acting through its various departments and agencies and through prime contractors, amounted to $4,109, $4,276 and $4,354 million in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively, which included sales to the U.S. Department of Defense, as a
  prime contractor and subcontractor, of $3,273, $3,374 and $3,500 million in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Base U.S. defense spending (excludes Overseas Contingent Operations) was essentially flat in 2012 compared to 2011 (see Item 7 Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
  Results of Operations). Due to anticipated lower U.S. Government spending levels mandated by the Budget Control Act (sequestration), we expect a slight decline in our defense and space revenue in 2013. We do not expect our overall operating results to be significantly affected by any proposed changes in
  2013 federal defense spending due principally to the varied mix of the




government programs which impact us (OEM production, engineering development programs, aftermarket spares and repairs and overhaul programs), increases in direct foreign defense and space market sales, as well as our diversified commercial businesses. Our contracts with the U.S. Government are
  subject to audits, investigations, and termination by the government. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors.”

Backlog

Our total backlog at December 31, 2012 and 2011 was $16,807 and $16,160 million, respectively. We anticipate that approximately $12,102 million of the 2012 backlog will be filled in 2013. We believe that backlog is not necessarily a reliable indicator of our future sales because a substantial portion of the
  orders constituting this backlog may be canceled at the customer’s option.

Competition

We are subject to active competition in substantially all product and service areas. Competition is expected to continue in all geographic regions. Competitive conditions vary widely among the thousands of products and services provided by us, and vary by country. Our businesses compete on a variety of
  factors, such as price, quality, reliability, delivery, customer service, performance, applied technology, product innovation and product recognition. Brand identity, service to customers and quality are important competitive factors for our products and services, and there is considerable price competition. Other
  competitive factors include breadth of product line, research and development efforts and technical and managerial capability. While our competitive position varies among our products and services, we believe we are a significant competitor in each of our major product and service classes. A number of our
  products and services are sold in competition with those of a large number of other companies, some of which have substantial financial resources and significant technological capabilities. In addition, some of our products compete with the captive component divisions of original equipment manufacturers. See
  Item 1A “Risk Factors” for further discussion.

International Operations

We are engaged in manufacturing, sales, service and research and development globally. U.S. exports and foreign manufactured products are significant to our operations. U.S. exports comprised 14, 12 and 11 percent of our total sales in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Foreign manufactured products
  and services, mainly in Europe and Asia, were 41, 43 and 42 percent of our total sales in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively.

Approximately 20 percent of total 2012 sales of Aerospace-related products and services were exports of U.S. manufactured products and systems and performance of services such as aircraft repair and overhaul. Exports were principally made to Europe, Canada, Asia and Latin America. Foreign
  manufactured products and systems and performance of services comprised approximately 16 percent of total 2012 Aerospace sales. The principal manufacturing facilities outside the U.S. are in Europe, with less significant operations in Canada and Asia.

Approximately 3 percent of total 2012 sales of Automation and Control Solutions products and services were exports of U.S. manufactured products. Foreign manufactured products and performance of services accounted for 57 percent of total 2012 Automation and Control Solutions sales. The principal
  manufacturing facilities outside the U.S. are in Europe and Asia, with less significant operations in Canada and Australia.

Approximately 35 percent of total 2012 sales of Performance Materials and Technologies products and services were exports of U.S. manufactured products. Exports were principally made to Asia and Latin America. Foreign manufactured products and performance of services comprised 22 percent of total
  2012 Performance Materials and Technologies sales. The principal manufacturing facilities outside the U.S. are in Europe, with less significant operations in Asia.

Approximately 3 percent of total 2012 sales of Transportation Systems products were exports of U.S. manufactured products. Foreign manufactured products accounted for 83 percent of total 2012




sales of Transportation Systems. The principal manufacturing facilities outside the U.S. are in Europe, with less significant operations in Asia and Australia.

Financial information including net sales and long-lived assets related to geographic areas is included in Note 25 of Notes to Financial Statements in “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data”. Information regarding the economic, political, regulatory and other risks associated with international
  operations is included in “Item 1A. Risk Factors.”

Raw Materials

The principal raw materials used in our operations are generally readily available. Although we occasionally experience disruption in raw materials supply, we experienced no significant problems in the purchase of key raw materials and commodities in 2012. We are not dependent on any one supplier for a
  material amount of our raw materials, except related to R240 (a key component in foam blowing agents), a raw material used in our Performance Materials and Technologies segment.

The costs of certain key raw materials, including cumene, fluorspar, perchloroethylene, R240, natural gas, sulfur and ethylene in our Performance Materials and Technologies business, nickel, steel and other metals in our Transportation Systems business, and nickel, titanium and other metals in our
  Aerospace business, are expected to continue to fluctuate. We will continue to attempt to offset raw material cost increases with formula or long-term supply agreements, price increases and hedging activities where feasible. We do not presently anticipate that a shortage of raw materials will cause any material
  adverse impacts during 2013. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors” for further discussion.

Patents, Trademarks, Licenses and Distribution Rights

Our segments are not dependent upon any single patent or related group of patents, or any licenses or distribution rights. We own, or are licensed under, a large number of patents, patent applications and trademarks acquired over a period of many years, which relate to many of our




products or improvements to those products and which are of importance to our business. From time to time, new patents and trademarks are obtained, and patent and trademark licenses and rights are acquired from others. We also have distribution rights of varying terms for a number of products and services
  produced by other companies. In our judgment, those rights are adequate for the conduct of our business. We believe that, in the aggregate, the rights under our patents, trademarks and licenses are generally important to our operations, but we do not consider any patent, trademark or related group of patents,
  or any licensing or distribution rights related to a specific process or product, to be of material importance in relation to our total business. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors” for further discussion.

We have registered trademarks for a number of our products and services, including Honeywell, Aclar, Ademco, Bendix, BW, Callidus, Enovate, Esser, Fire-Lite, Garrett, Genetron, Gent, Howard Leight, Jurid, Matrikon, Maxon, MK, North, Notifier, Novar, RMG, Silent Knight, Solstice, Spectra, System
  Sensor, Trend, Tridium and UOP.

Research and Development

Our research activities are directed toward the discovery and development of new products, technologies and processes, and the development of new uses for existing products and software applications. The Company’s principal research and development activities are in the U.S., India, Europe and China.

Research and development (R&D) expense totaled $1,847, $1,799 and $1,450 million in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The increase in R&D expense of 3 percent in 2012 compared to 2011 was mainly due to increased expenditures on the development of new technologies to support existing and new
  aircraft platforms in our Aerospace segment and new product development in our Automation and Control Solutions and Performance Materials Technologies segments. The increase in R&D expense of 24 percent in 2011 compared to 2010 was mainly due to increased expenditures on the development of new
  technologies to support existing and new aircraft platforms in our Aerospace segment, the development of turbocharging systems for new diesel and gas applications in our Transportation Systems segment and new product development in our Automation and Control Solutions segment. R&D as a percentage of
  sales was 4.9, 4.9 and 4.5 percent in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Customer-sponsored (principally the U.S. Government) R&D activities amounted to an additional $835, $867 and $874 million in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively.

Environment

We are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign government requirements regulating the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment. It is our policy to comply with these requirements, and we believe that, as a general matter, our policies,
  practices and procedures are properly designed to prevent unreasonable risk of environmental damage, and of resulting financial liability, in connection with our business. Some risk of environmental damage is, however, inherent in some of our operations and products, as it is with other companies engaged in
  similar businesses.

We are and have been engaged in the handling, manufacture, use and disposal of many substances classified as hazardous by one or more regulatory agencies. We believe that, as a general matter, our policies, practices and procedures are properly designed to prevent unreasonable risk of environmental
  damage and personal injury, and that our handling, manufacture, use and disposal of these substances are in accord with environmental and safety laws and regulations. It is possible, however, that future knowledge or other developments, such as improved capability to detect substances in the environment or
  increasingly strict environmental laws and standards and enforcement policies, could bring into question our current or past handling, manufacture, use or disposal of these substances.

Among other environmental requirements, we are subject to the federal superfund and similar state and foreign laws and regulations, under which we have been designated as a potentially responsible party that may be liable for cleanup costs associated with current and former operating sites and various
  hazardous waste sites, some of which are on the U.S. Environmental Protection




Agency’s Superfund priority list. Although, under some court interpretations of these laws, there is a possibility that a responsible party might have to bear more than its proportional share of the cleanup costs if it is unable to obtain appropriate contribution from other responsible parties, to date we have not had to
  bear significantly more than our proportional share in multi-party situations taken as a whole.

We do not believe that existing or pending climate change legislation, regulation, or international treaties or accords are reasonably likely to have a material effect in the foreseeable future on the Company’s business or markets that it serves, nor on its results of operations, capital expenditures or financial
  position. We will continue to monitor emerging developments in this area.

Further information, including the current status of significant environmental matters and the financial impact incurred for remediation of such environmental matters, if any, is included in “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” in Note 22
  Commitments and Contingencies of Notes to Financial Statements in “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” and in “Item 1A. Risk Factors.”

Employees

We have approximately 132,000 employees at December 31, 2012, of which approximately 52,000 were located in the United States.
