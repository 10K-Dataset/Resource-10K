ITEM 1. BUSINESS





General



We provide scheduled air transportation for passengers and cargo throughout the United States and around the world. Our global route network gives us a presence in every major domestic and international market. Our route network is centered around the hub system we operate at airports in Amsterdam, Atlanta, Cincinnati, Detroit, Memphis, Minneapolis-St. Paul, New York-JFK, Paris-Charles de Gaulle, Salt Lake City and Tokyo-Narita. Each of these hub operations includes flights that gather and distribute traffic from markets in the geographic region surrounding the hub to domestic and international cities and to other hubs. Our network is supported by a fleet of aircraft that is varied in terms of size and capabilities, giving us flexibility to adjust aircraft to the network.



Other key characteristics of our route network include:



•our alliances with foreign airlines, including our membership in SkyTeam, a global airline alliance;



•our transatlantic joint venture with Air France-KLM and Alitalia;



•our domestic marketing alliance with Alaska Airlines, which expands our west coast service; and



•agreements with multiple domestic regional carriers, which operate as Delta Connection, including our wholly-owned subsidiary, Comair, Inc.



We are incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware. Our principal executive offices are located at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport in Atlanta, Georgia. Our telephone number is (404) 715-2600 and our Internet address is www.delta.com. Information contained on this website is not part of, and is not incorporated by reference in, this Form 10-K.



International Alliances



We have bilateral and multilateral marketing alliances with foreign airlines to improve our access to international markets. These arrangements can include codesharing, reciprocal frequent flyer program benefits, shared or reciprocal access to passenger lounges, joint promotions, common use of airport gates and ticket counters, ticket office co-location and other marketing agreements. These alliances often present opportunities in other areas, such as airport ground handling arrangements and aircraft maintenance insourcing.



Our international codesharing agreements enable us to market and sell seats to an expanded number of international destinations. Under international codesharing arrangements, we and a foreign carrier each publish our respective airline designator codes on a single flight operation, thereby allowing us and the foreign carrier to offer joint service with one aircraft, rather than operating separate services with two aircraft. These arrangements typically allow us to sell seats on a foreign carrier's aircraft that are marketed under our designator code and permit the foreign airline to sell seats on our aircraft that are marketed under the foreign carrier's designator code.



We have international codeshare arrangements with Aeroméxico, Air France, Air Nigeria, Alitalia, Aeroflot, China Airlines, China Eastern, China Southern, CSA Czech Airlines, KLM Royal Dutch Airlines, Korean Air, Olympic Air, Royal Air Maroc, VRG Linhas Aéreas (operating as GOL), Vietnam Airlines, Virgin Australia and WestJet Airlines (and some affiliated carriers operating in conjunction with some of these airlines).



SkyTeam. In addition to our marketing alliance agreements with individual foreign airlines, we are a member of the SkyTeam global airline alliance. The other members or prospective members of SkyTeam are Aeroflot, Aeroméxico, Air Europa, Air France, Alitalia, China Airlines, China Eastern, China Southern, CSA Czech Airlines, Kenya Airways, KLM, Korean Air, Tarom and Vietnam Airlines. Aerolineas Argentinas, Garuda Indonesia, Middle East Airlines, Saudi Arabian Airlines and Xiamen Airlines each have announced their formal intent to join SkyTeam within the next two years.One goal of SkyTeam is to link the route networks of the member airlines, providing opportunities for increased connecting traffic while offering enhanced customer service through mutual codesharing arrangements, reciprocal frequent flyer and lounge programs and coordinated cargo operations.












Transatlantic joint venture. In addition to being members in SkyTeam with Air France and KLM, both of which are subsidiaries of the same holding company, and Alitalia, we have a transatlantic joint venture agreement with these carriers. This agreement provides for the sharing of revenues and costs on transatlantic routes, as well as coordinated pricing, scheduling and product development on included routes. Pursuant to this joint venture, we, Air France-KLM and Alitalia operate an extensive transatlantic network, primarily on routes between North America and Europe, and secondarily on routes between North America and Africa, the Middle East and India, and routes between Europe and Central America and several countries in northern South America.



Transpacific joint venture with Virgin Australia Airlines. In June 2011, we and Virgin Australia Airlines received approval of antitrust immunity for our transpacific alliance. Antitrust immunity will allow us to implement a proposed joint venture that will expand the reach of Delta and Virgin Australia between the United States and Australia and the South Pacific. The alliance will create a network able to serve thousands of city-pairs in North America and the South Pacific. Alone, we serve only Sydney in Australia and Virgin Australia flies only to Los Angeles in the United States. The antitrust immunized alliance will allow the airlines to fully cooperate on network planning and distribution to deliver a more attractive and competitive service for customers.



Enhanced commercial agreements with Latin American Carriers.In 2011, we entered into separate agreements with Grupo Aeroméxico, S.A.B. de C.V., the parent company of Aeroméxico, and GOL Linhas Aéreas Inteligentes, S.A, the parent company of GOL, for a strategic equity investment in each company and an exclusive commercial relationship with their carriers. We believe this will secure our long-term position in the important and expanding Latin markets of Mexico and Brazil, respectively. The agreements provide for expansion of codesharing, additional alignment of service attributes offered to frequent flyer members of our Sky Miles program and the other carriers' programs, and additional cooperation for selling activities. The expanded relationship with Aeroméxico also contemplates the establishment of a joint-venture maintenance, repair and overhaul facility in Guadalajara, Mexico.



Domestic Alliances



We have entered into a marketing alliance with Alaska Airlines, which includes mutual codesharing and reciprocal frequent flyer and airport lounge access arrangements. Our alliance agreement with Alaska Airlines provides for extensive cooperation with respect to our west coast presence.



We also have frequent flyer and reciprocal lounge agreements with Hawaiian Airlines, and codesharing agreements with American Eagle Airlines (“American Eagle”) and Hawaiian Airlines. These marketing relationships are designed to permit the carriers to retain their separate identities and route networks while increasing the number of domestic and international connecting passengers using the carriers' route networks.



Regional Carriers



We have air service agreements with multiple domestic regional air carriers that feed traffic to our route system by serving passengers primarily in small-and medium-sized cities. These arrangements enable us to increase the number of flights we have available in certain locations and to better match capacity with demand. Approximately21%of our passenger revenue in 2011 was related to flying by regional air carriers.



Through our regional carrier program, we have contractual arrangements with ten regional carriers to operate regional jet and, in certain cases, turbo-prop aircraft using our “DL” designator code. In addition to our wholly-owned subsidiary, Comair, we have contractual arrangements with: ExpressJet Airlines, Inc. (formerly, Atlantic Southeast Airlines, Inc.) and SkyWest Airlines, Inc., both subsidiaries of SkyWest, Inc.; Chautauqua Airlines, Inc. and Shuttle America Corporation, both subsidiaries of Republic Airways Holdings, Inc.; Pinnacle Airlines, Inc. and Mesaba Aviation, Inc. ("Mesaba"), both subsidiaries of Pinnacle Airlines Corp. ("Pinnacle"); Compass Airlines, Inc. ("Compass") and GoJet Airlines, LLC, both subsidiaries of Trans States Holdings, Inc. ("Trans States"); and American Eagle.












With the exception of American Eagle and a portion of the flights operated for us by SkyWest Airlines as described below, these agreements are capacity purchase arrangements, under which we control the scheduling, pricing, reservations, ticketing and seat inventories for the regional carriers' flights operating under our “DL” designator code, and we are entitled to all ticket, cargo, mail and in-flight and ancillary revenues associated with these flights. We pay those airlines an amount, as defined in the applicable agreement, which is based on a determination of their cost of operating those flights and other factors intended to approximate market rates for those services. These capacity purchase agreements are long-term agreements, usually with initial terms of at least 10 years, which grant us the option to extend the initial term. Certain of these agreements provide us the right to terminate the entire agreement, or in some cases remove some of the aircraft from the scope of the agreement, for convenience at certain future dates.



Our arrangement with American Eagle, limited to certain flights operated to and from the Los Angeles International Airport, as well as a portion of the flights operated for us by SkyWest Airlines, are structured as revenue proration agreements. These proration agreements establish a fixed dollar or percentage division of revenues for tickets sold to passengers traveling on connecting flight itineraries.





Frequent Flyer Program



Our SkyMiles®frequent flyer program is designed to retain and increase traveler loyalty by offering incentives to travel on Delta. The SkyMiles program allows program members to earn mileage for travel awards by flying on Delta, Delta's regional carriers and other participating airlines. Mileage credit may also be earned by using certain services offered by program participants, such as credit card companies, hotels and car rental agencies. In addition, individuals and companies may purchase mileage credits. Miles will not expire, but are subject to all program rules. We reserve the right to terminate the program with six months advance notice, and to change the program's terms and conditions at any time without notice.



SkyMiles program mileage credits can be redeemed for air travel on Delta and participating airlines, for membership in our Delta Sky Clubs®and for other program participant awards. Mileage credits are subject to certain transfer restrictions and travel awards are subject to capacity-controlled seating. In2011, program members redeemed more than 275 billion miles in the SkyMiles program for 12 million award redemptions. During this period, 8.2% of revenue miles flown on Delta were from award travel.





Other Businesses



Cargo



Through the strength of our global network, our cargo operations are able to connect all of the world's major freight gateways. We generate cargo revenues in domestic and international markets primarily through the use of cargo space on regularly scheduled passenger aircraft. We are a member of SkyTeam Cargo, a global airline cargo alliance, whose other members are Aeromexico Cargo, Air France Cargo, Alitalia Cargo, CSA Czech Airlines Cargo, KLM Cargo and Korean Air Cargo. SkyTeam Cargo offers a global network spanning six continents, provides customers a consistent international product line and permits its members to improve their efficiency and effectiveness in the marketplace.



Delta TechOps, Delta Global Services, MLT Vacations and Delta Private Jets



We have several other businesses arising from our airline operations, including aircraft maintenance, repair and overhaul (“MRO”), staffing services for third parties, vacation wholesale operations and our private jet operations. Our MRO operation, known as Delta TechOps, is the largest airline MRO in North America. In addition to providing maintenance and engineering support for our fleet of approximately775aircraft, Delta TechOps serves more than 150 aviation and airline customers from around the world. Delta TechOps employs approximately 9,600 maintenance professionals and is one of the most experienced MRO providers in the world. Our staffing services business, Delta Global Services, provides staffing services, professional security, training services and aviation solutions to approximately 150 customers. Our vacation wholesale business, MLT Vacations, is one of the largest providers of vacation packages in the United States. Our private jet operations, Delta Private Jets, provides aircraft charters, aircraft management and programs allowing members to purchase flight time by the hour. In 2011, the total revenue from these businesses was approximately $900 million.














Distribution and Expanded Product Offerings



Our tickets are sold through various distribution channels including telephone reservations, delta.com, global distribution systems and online travel agencies. An increasing number of our tickets are sold through delta.com, which reduces our distribution costs and gives us closer contact with our customers. We expect to launch a new delta.com platform in 2012, which we expect will result in additional purchases of tickets through that channel.



We are transforming distribution from a commodity approach to a differentiated and merchandised approach. We expect that the merchandising initiatives we are implementing, primarily through delta.com, will generate additional revenue opportunities for us and will improve the experience of our customers. Our plan is to provide our customers with opportunities to purchase what they value, such as first class upgrades, economy comfort seating, WiFi access and SkyClub passes. We also expect to benefit from increased traffic on delta.com through a combination of advertising revenue and sales of third party merchandise and services such as car rentals, hotels, and trip insurance.





Fuel



Our results of operations are significantly impacted by changes in the price and availability of aircraft fuel. The following table shows our aircraft fuel consumption and costs.

YearGallons Consumed(1)(Millions)Cost(1)(2)(Millions)Average Price Per Gallon(1)(2)Percentage of Total Operating Expense(1)20113,856$11,783$3.0636%20103,823$8,901$2.3330%20093,853$8,291$2.1529%



(1)Includes the operations of our contract carriers under capacity purchase agreements.

(2)Includes fuel hedge gains (losses) under our fuel hedging program of$420 million,$(89) millionand$(1.4) billionfor 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.



Our aircraft fuel purchase contracts do not provide material protection against price increases or assure the availability of our fuel supplies. We purchase most of our aircraft fuel under contracts that establish the price based on various market indices. We also purchase aircraft fuel on the spot market, from off-shore sources and under contracts that permit the refiners to set the price.



In an effort to manage our exposure to changes in aircraft fuel prices, we actively manage our fuel price risk through a hedging program intended to provide an offset against increases in jet fuel prices. This fuel hedging program utilizes several different contract and fuel commodity types, which are used together to create a risk mitigating hedge portfolio.



We are currently able to obtain adequate supplies of aircraft fuel, but it is impossible to predict the future availability or price of aircraft fuel. Weather-related events, natural disasters, political disruptions or wars involving oil-producing countries, changes in government policy concerning aircraft fuel production, transportation or marketing, changes in aircraft fuel production capacity, environmental concerns and other unpredictable events may result in fuel supply shortages and fuel price increases in the future.





Competition



The airline industry is highly competitive, marked by significant competition with respect to routes, fares, schedules (both timing and frequency), services, products, customer service and frequent flyer programs. The industry is going through a period of transformation through consolidation, both domestically and internationally, and changes in international alliances. Consolidation in the airline industry and changes in international alliances have altered and will continue to alter the competitive landscape in the industry by resulting in the formation of airlines and alliances with increased financial resources, more extensive global networks and altered cost structures. In addition, other network carriers have also significantly reduced their costs over the last several years including through restructuring and bankruptcy reorganization. American Airlines has recently filed for bankruptcy protection, which may enable it to substantially reduce its costs. Our ability to compete effectively depends, in part, on our ability to maintain a competitive cost structure.












Domestic



Our domestic operations are subject to competition from both traditional network and discount carriers, some of which may have lower costs than we do and provide service at low fares to destinations served by us. In particular, we face significant competition at our domestic hub airports in Atlanta, Cincinnati, Detroit, Memphis, Minneapolis-St. Paul, New York-JFK and Salt Lake City either directly at those airports or at the hubs of other airlines that are located in close proximity to our hubs. We also face competition in smaller to medium-sized markets from regional jet operators.



International



Our international operations are subject to competition from both domestic and foreign carriers. Through alliance and other marketing and codesharing agreements with foreign carriers, U.S. carriers have increased their ability to sell international transportation, such as services to and beyond traditional European and Asian gateway cities. Similarly, foreign carriers have obtained increased access to interior U.S. passenger traffic beyond traditional U.S. gateway cities through these relationships. In particular, alliances formed by domestic and foreign carriers, including SkyTeam, the Star Alliance (among United Air Lines, Continental Airlines, Lufthansa German Airlines, Air Canada and others) and the oneworld alliance (among American Airlines, British Airways, Qantas and others) have significantly increased competition in international markets. The adoption of liberalized Open Skies Aviation Agreements with an increasing number of countries around the world, including in particular the Open Skies Treaties that the U.S. has with the Member States of the European Union and Japan, could significantly increase competition among carriers serving those markets.



Several joint ventures among U.S. and foreign carriers, including our transatlantic joint venture with Air France-KLM and Alitalia, have received grants of antitrust immunity allowing the participating carriers to coordinate schedules, pricing, sales and inventory. Other joint ventures that have received anti-trust immunity include a transatlantic alliance among United, Continental, Air Canada and Lufthansa, a transpacific joint venture among United, Continental and All Nippon Airways, a transatlantic joint venture among American, British Airways and Iberia, and a transpacific joint venture between American and Japan Air Lines.





Regulatory Matters



The Department of Transportation (“DOT”) and the Federal Aviation Administration (the “FAA”) exercise regulatory authority over air transportation in the U.S. The DOT has authority to issue certificates of public convenience and necessity required for airlines to provide domestic air transportation. An air carrier that the DOT finds fit to operate is given authority to operate domestic and international air transportation (including the carriage of passengers and cargo). Except for constraints imposed by regulations regarding “Essential Air Services,” which are applicable to certain small communities, airlines may terminate service to a city without restriction.



The DOT has jurisdiction over certain economic and consumer protection matters, such as unfair or deceptive practices and methods of competition, advertising, denied boarding compensation, baggage liability and disabled passenger transportation. The DOT also has authority to review certain joint venture agreements between major carriers and engages in regulation of economic matters such as slot transactions. The FAA has primary responsibility for matters relating to the safety of air carrier flight operations, including airline operating certificates, control of navigable air space, flight personnel, aircraft certification and maintenance and other matters affecting air safety.



Authority to operate international routes and international codesharing arrangements is regulated by the DOT and by the governments of the foreign countries involved. International certificate authorities are also subject to the approval of the U.S. President for conformance with national defense and foreign policy objectives.



The Transportation Security Administration and the U.S. Customs and Border Protection, each a division of the Department of Homeland Security, are responsible for certain civil aviation security matters, including passenger and baggage screening at U.S. airports and international passenger prescreening prior to entry into or departure from the U.S.



Airlines are also subject to various other federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations. For example, the U.S. Department of Justice has jurisdiction over airline competition matters. The U.S. Postal Service has authority over certain aspects of the transportation of mail. Labor relations in the airline industry, as discussed below, are generally governed by the Railway Labor Act. Environmental matters are regulated by various federal, state, local and foreign governmental entities. Privacy of passenger and employee data is regulated by domestic and foreign laws and regulations.












Fares and Rates



Airlines set ticket prices in all domestic and most international city pairs with minimal governmental regulation, and the industry is characterized by significant price competition. Certain international fares and rates are subject to the jurisdiction of the DOT and the governments of the foreign countries involved. Many of our tickets are sold by travel agents, and fares are subject to commissions, overrides and discounts paid to travel agents, brokers and wholesalers.



Route Authority



Our flight operations are authorized by certificates of public convenience and necessity and also by exemptions and limited-entry frequency awards issued by the DOT. The requisite approvals of other governments for international operations are controlled by bilateral agreements (and a multilateral agreement in the case of the U.S. and the European Union) with, or permits or approvals issued by, foreign countries. Because international air transportation is governed by bilateral or other agreements between the U.S. and the foreign country or countries involved, changes in U.S. or foreign government aviation policies could result in the alteration or termination of such agreements, diminish the value of our international route authorities or otherwise affect our international operations. Bilateral agreements between the U.S. and various foreign countries served by us are subject to renegotiation from time to time. The U.S. government has negotiated “open skies” agreements with many countries, which allow unrestricted access between the U.S. and the foreign markets. These agreements include separate agreements with the European Union and Japan.



Certain of our international route authorities are subject to periodic renewal requirements. We request extension of these authorities when and as appropriate. While the DOT usually renews temporary authorities on routes where the authorized carrier is providing a reasonable level of service, there is no assurance this practice will continue in general or with respect to a specific renewal. Dormant route authorities may not be renewed in some cases, especially where another U.S. carrier indicates a willingness to provide service.



Airport Access



Operations at four major domestic airports and certain foreign airports served by us are regulated by governmental entities through allocations of “slots” or similar regulatory mechanisms which limit the rights of carriers to conduct operations at those airports. Each slot represents the authorization to land at or take off from the particular airport during a specified time period.



In the U.S., the FAA currently regulates the allocation of slots, slot exemptions, operating authorizations, or similar capacity allocation mechanisms at Reagan National in Washington, D.C. and LaGuardia, John F. Kennedy International Airport (“JFK”) and Newark in the New York City area. Our operations at these airports generally require the allocation of slots or analogous regulatory authorizations. Similarly, our operations at Tokyo's Narita and Haneda Airports, London's Gatwick and Heathrow airports and other international airports are regulated by local slot coordinators pursuant to the International Air Transport Association's Worldwide Scheduling Guidelines and applicable local law. We currently have sufficient slots or analogous authorizations to operate our existing flights, and we have generally been able to obtain the rights to expand our operations and to change our schedules. There is no assurance, however, that we will be able to do so in the future because, among other reasons, such allocations are subject to changes in governmental policies.



Environmental Matters



Emissions. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (the “EPA”) is authorized to regulate aircraft emissions and has historically implemented emissions control standards previously adopted by the International Civil Aviation Organization (“ICAO”). Our aircraft comply with existing EPA standards as applicable by engine design date. The ICAO has adopted two additional aircraft engine emissions standards, the first of which is applicable to engines certified after December 31, 2007, and the second of which is applicable to engines certified after December 31, 2013. On July 6, 2011, the EPA issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking that proposes to adopt these two ICAO aircraft engine emissions standards, but the EPA has not yet issued the final regulation.












Concern about aviation environmental issues, including climate change and greenhouse gases, has led to taxes on our operations in the United Kingdom and in Germany, both of which have levied taxes directly on our customers. We may face additional regulation of aircraft emissions in the United States and abroad and become subject to further taxes, charges or additional requirements to obtain permits or purchase allowances or emission credits for greenhouse gas emissions in various jurisdictions. This could result in taxation or permitting requirements from multiple jurisdictions for the same operations. Ongoing bilateral discussions between the United States and other nations as well as discussions at the ICAO Assembly and Conference of the Parties, most recently in Durbin in December 2011, may lead to international treaties or other actions focusing on reducing greenhouse gas emissions from aviation.



The European Union has required its member states to implement regulations including aviation in its Emissions Trading Scheme (“ETS”). Under these regulations, any airline with flights originating or landing in the European Union are subject to the ETS and, beginning in 2012, are required to purchase emissions allowances if the airline exceeds the number of free allowances allocated to it under the ETS. We expect that this system will impose significant costs on our operations in the European Union. Numerous countries, including the U.S., and airline groups continue to oppose the European Union ETS.



Cap and trade restrictions have also been proposed in the United States. In addition, other legislative or regulatory action, including by the EPA, to regulate greenhouse gas emissions is possible. In particular, the EPA has found that greenhouse gases threaten the public health and welfare, which could result in regulation of greenhouse gas emissions from aircraft. In the event that legislation or regulation is enacted in the U.S. or in the event similar legislation or regulation is enacted in jurisdictions other than the European Union where we operate or where we may operate in the future, it could result in significant costs for us and the airline industry. In addition to direct costs, such regulation may have a greater effect on the airline industry through increases in fuel costs that could result from fuel suppliers passing on increased costs that they incur under such a system. We are monitoring and evaluating the potential impact of such legislative and regulatory developments.



We seek to minimize the impact of carbon emissions from our operations through reductions in our fuel consumption and other efforts. We have reduced the fuel needs of our aircraft fleet through the retirement and replacement of certain elements of our fleet and with newer, more fuel efficient aircraft. In addition, we have implemented fuel saving procedures in our flight and ground support operations that further reduce carbon emissions. We are also supporting efforts to develop alternative fuels and efforts to modernize the air traffic control system in the U.S., as part of our efforts to reduce our emissions and minimize our impact on the environment.



Noise. The Airport Noise and Capacity Act of 1990 recognizes the rights of operators of airports with noise problems to implement local noise abatement programs so long as such programs do not interfere unreasonably with interstate or foreign commerce or the national air transportation system. This statute generally provides that local noise restrictions on Stage 3 aircraft first effective after October 1, 1990, require FAA approval. While we have had sufficient scheduling flexibility to accommodate local noise restrictions in the past, our operations could be adversely impacted if locally-imposed regulations become more restrictive or widespread.



Other Environmental Matters. We have been identified by the EPA as a potentially responsible party (a “PRP”) with respect to certain Superfund Sites, and entered into consent decrees or settlements regarding some of these sites. Our alleged disposal volume at each of these sites was small or was consideredde minimiswhen compared to the total contributions of all PRPs at each site. We are aware of soil and/or ground water contamination present on our current or former leaseholds at several domestic airports. To address this contamination, we have a program in place to investigate and, if appropriate, remediate these sites. Although the ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be predicted with certainty, we believe that the resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements.



We are also subject to various other federal, state and local laws governing environmental matters, including the management and disposal of chemicals, waste and hazardous materials, protection of surface and subsurface waters, and regulation of air emissions and aircraft drinking water.



Civil Reserve Air Fleet Program



We participate in the Civil Reserve Air Fleet program (the “CRAF Program”), which permits the U.S. military to use the aircraft and crew resources of participating U.S. airlines during airlift emergencies, national emergencies or times of war. We have agreed to make available under the CRAF Program a portion of our international long-range aircraft during the contract period ending September 30, 2012.We have also committed aircraft to international short-range requirements. The CRAF Program has only been activated twice since it was created in 1951.












Employee Matters



Railway Labor Act



Our relations with labor unions in the U.S. are governed by the Railway Labor Act. Under the Railway Labor Act, a labor union seeking to represent an unrepresented craft or class of employees is required to file with the National Mediation Board (the “NMB”) an application alleging a representation dispute, along with authorization cards signed by at least 35% of the employees in that craft or class. The NMB then investigates the dispute and, if it finds the labor union has obtained a sufficient number of authorization cards, conducts an election to determine whether to certify the labor union as the collective bargaining representative of that craft or class. A labor union will be certified as the representative of the employees in a craft or class if more than 50% of votes cast are for that union. A certified labor union would commence negotiations toward a collective bargaining agreement with the employer.



Under the Railway Labor Act, a collective bargaining agreement between an airline and a labor union does not expire, but instead becomes amendable as of a stated date. Either party may request that the NMB appoint a federal mediator to participate in the negotiations for a new or amended agreement. If no agreement is reached in mediation, the NMB may determine, at any time, that an impasse exists and offer binding arbitration. If either party rejects binding arbitration, a 30-day “cooling off” period begins. At the end of this 30-day period, the parties may engage in “self help,” unless the U.S. President appoints a Presidential Emergency Board (“PEB”) to investigate and report on the dispute. The appointment of a PEB maintains the “status quo” for an additional 60 days. If the parties do not reach agreement during this period, the parties may then engage in “self help.” “Self help” includes, among other things, a strike by the union or the imposition of proposed changes to the collective bargaining agreement by the airline. Congress and the President have the authority to prevent “self help” by enacting legislation that, among other things, imposes a settlement on the parties.



Collective Bargaining



As ofDecember 31, 2011, we had approximately78,400full-time equivalent employees. Approximately16%of these employees were represented by unions, including the following domestic employee groups.

All of our agreements with workgroups at our airline subsidiary, Comair, are currently amendable. Comair is in discussions with representatives of the respective unions and we cannot predict the outcome of those discussions.



Labor unions periodically engage in organizing efforts to represent various groups of our employees, including at our airline subsidiary, that are not represented for collective bargaining purposes.



Completion of Merger Integration



Integration of a number of the workgroups following our merger with Northwest Airlines (including pilots, aircraft maintenance technicians, dispatchers, meteorologists, simulator technicians, and office and clerical staff) has been completed. Completion of the integration of other workgroups (including flight attendants, airport employees and reservations employees) will be completed during 2012 following the final resolution of representation issues during the latter part of 2011. The flight attendants, airport employees and reservations employees each rejected representation by unions.
