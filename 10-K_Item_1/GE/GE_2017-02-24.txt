COMPETITIVE CONDITIONS AND ENVIRONMENT

In all of our global business activities, we encounter aggressive and able competition. In many instances, the competitive climate is characterized by changing technology that requires continuing research and development. With respect to manufacturing operations, we believe that, in general, we are one of the leading firms in most of the major industries in which we participate. The businesses in which GE Capital engages are subject to competition from various types of financial institutions, including commercial banks, investment banks, leasing companies, independent finance companies, finance companies associated with manufacturers and insurance and reinsurance companies.

As a diverse global company, we are affected by world economies, instability in certain regions, commodity prices, such as the price of oil, and foreign currency volatility. Other factors impacting our business include:

·

product development cycles for many of our products are long and product quality and efficiency are critical to success,

·

research and development expenditures are important to our business and

·

many of our products are subject to a number of regulatory standards.

These factors are discussed throughout MD&A.


OUR EMPLOYEES AND EMPLOYEE RELATIONS

At year-end 2016, General Electric Company and consolidated affiliates employed approximately 295,000 persons, of whom approximately 104,000 were employed in the United States. For further information about employees, see the Other Financial Data section within the MD&A.

In June 2015, we negotiated new four-year collective bargaining agreements with most of our U.S unions. These agreements continue to provide employees with good wages and benefits while addressing competitive realities facing the Company.
