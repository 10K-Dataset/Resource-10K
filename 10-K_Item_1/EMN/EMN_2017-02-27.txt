CHEMICAL INTERMEDIATES SEGMENT



•Overview



The CI segment leverages large scale and vertical integration from the cellulose and acetyl, olefins, and alkylamines streams to support our specialty operating segments with advantaged cost positions. The CI segment sells excess intermediates beyond our specialty needs for use in markets such as industrial chemicals and processing, building and construction, health and wellness, and agrochemicals. Certain products are also used internally by other operating segments of the Company.In 2016, the CI segment had sales revenue of$2.5 billion,28percent of Eastman's total sales. Key technology platforms include acetyls, oxos, plasticizers, polyesters, and alkylamines.



The CI segment product lines benefit from competitive cost positions primarily resulting from the use of and access to lower cost raw materials, the Company's scale, technology, and operational excellence. Examples include coal used in the production of cellulose and acetyl stream product lines, feedstocks used in the production of olefin derivative product lines such as oxo alcohols and plasticizers, and ammonia and methanol used to manufacture methylamines. In addition to a competitive cost position, the plasticizers business should continue to benefit from the growth in relative use of non-phthalate rather than phthalate plasticizers in the United States, Canada, and Europe.



Several CI segment product lines are affected by cyclicality, most notably in the olefin and acetyl-based businesses. See "Eastman Chemical Company General Information - Manufacturing Streams". This cyclicality is caused by periods of supply and demand imbalance, when either incremental capacity additions are not offset by corresponding increases in demand, or when demand exceeds existing supply. While management continues to take steps to reduce the impact of the trough of these cycles, future results are expected to occasionally fluctuate due both to general economic conditions and industry supply and demand.

•Strategy



To maintain and enhance its status as a low cost producer and optimize earnings, the CI segment continuously focuses on cost control, operational efficiency, and capacity utilization. This includes focusing on products used internally by other downstream operating segments, thereby supporting growth in specialty product lines throughout the Company. Through the CI segment, the Company has leveraged the advantage of its highly integrated manufacturing facilities. For example, the Kingsport, Tennessee manufacturing facility allows for the production of acetic anhydride and other acetyl derivatives from coal rather than natural gas or other petroleum feedstocks. At the Longview, Texas manufacturing facility, Eastman uses its proprietary oxo-technology in one of the world's largest single-site, oxo butyraldehyde manufacturing facilities to produce a wide range of alcohols and other derivative products utilizing local propane and ethane supplies, as well as purchased propylene. The Pace, Florida manufacturing facility using ammonia and methanol feedstocks is the largest methylamine production site in the world. These integrated facilities, combined with large scale production processes and a continuous focus on additional process improvements, allow the CI segment product lines to remain cost competitive and, for some products, cost-advantaged over competitors.



In 2016, the Company announced that as part of its strategy to increase emphasis on specialty businesses and products it is pursuing strategic options to divest or otherwise monetize its excess ethylene capacity position and certain commodity olefin intermediates product lines. Eastman will retain its cost-advantaged integrated position to propylene which supports specialty derivatives throughout the Company. This process is expected to continue through first half 2017.



In 2012, the Company entered into an agreement with Enterprise Products Partners L.P. to purchase propylene from a planned propane dehydrogenation plant to further improve the Company's long-term competitive cost position. This plant is expected to be operational in 2017. Prior to completion of the plant, the Company continues to benefit from a propylene market contract with an advantaged cost position for purchased propylene.





FIBERS SEGMENT



•Overview



In the Fibers segment, Eastman manufactures and sells Estron®acetate tow and Estrobond®triacetin plasticizers for use primarily in the manufacture of cigarette filters; Estron®natural (undyed) and Chromspun®solution-dyed acetate yarns for use in apparel, home furnishings, and industrial fabrics; and cellulose acetate flake and acetyl raw materials for other acetate fiber producers.Eastman is one of the world's two largest suppliers of acetate tow and has been a market leader in the manufacture and sale of acetate tow since it began production in the early 1950s. The Company is the world's largest producer of acetate yarn and has been in this business for over 75 years. In 2016, the Fibers segment had sales revenue of$1.0 billion,11percent of Eastman's total sales.



The largest 12 Fibers segment customers account for approximately 80 percent of the segment's 2016 sales revenue and include multinational as well as regional cigarette producers, fabric manufacturers, and other acetate fiber producers.



The Company's long history and experience in the fibers markets are reflected in the Fibers segment's operating expertise, both within the Company and in support of its customers' processes. The Fibers segment's knowledge of the industry and of customers' processes allows it to assist its customers in maximizing their processing efficiencies, promoting repeat sales, and mutually beneficial, long-term customer relationships.



The Company's fully integrated fiber manufacturing process employs unique technology that allows it to use a broad range of high-purity wood pulps for which the Company has dependable sources of supply.



Contributing to profitability in the Fibers segment is the limited number of competitors and significant barriers to entry. These barriers include, but are not limited to, high capital costs for integrated manufacturing facilities.












The Fibers segment's competitive strengths include a reputation for high-quality products, technical expertise, large scale vertically-integrated processes, reliability of supply, balanced acetate flake supply for Fibers products, a reputation for customer service excellence, and a customer base characterized by strategic long-term customer relationships. The Company continues to capitalize and build on these strengths to further improve the strategic position of its Fibers segment. The principal methods of competition include maintaining the Company's large-scale vertically integrated manufacturing process from acetyl raw materials, reliability of supply, product quality, and sustaining long-term customer relationships. Despite continued challenging acetate tow market conditions, including additional industry capacity and lower capacity utilization rates, management expects continued strong Fibers segment cash flow.

•Strategy



In the Fibers segment, Eastman continues to leverage its strong customer relationships and industry knowledge to maintain a leading industry position in the global market. Eastman's Fibers segment benefits from a state-of-the-art, world class, acetate flake production facility at the Kingsport, Tennessee site which is supplied from Eastman's vertically integrated coal gasification facility. Eastman's total global acetate tow capacity is approximately 180,000 metric tons, not including the Company's participation in an acetate tow joint venture manufacturing facility in China. The Company also benefits from the Kingsport, Tennessee tow production facility being the largest and most integrated acetate tow site in the world. The Company supplies 100 percent of the acetate flake raw material to the China manufacturing joint venture from the Company's manufacturing facility in Kingsport, Tennessee which the Company recognizes in sales revenue. The Company recognizes earnings in the joint venture through its equity investment, reported in "Other (income) charges, net" in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings, Comprehensive Income and Retained Earnings in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report.



The Company intends to continue to make use of its capabilities in fibers technology to maintain a strong focus on incremental product and process improvements, with the goals of meeting customers' evolving needs and further improving the segment's manufacturing process efficiencies.



The Fibers segment R&D efforts focus on serving existing customers, developing new applications and markets, and reducing cost. These R&D efforts assist acetate tow customers in the effective use of the segment's products and customers' product development efforts. Additionally, these efforts are focused on developing new products and exploring new market applications, leveraging experience innovating cellulosics products to offset declining demand in the tobacco industry, optimizing asset productivity, and working with suppliers to reduce costs.



As a result of challenging market conditions for acetate tow, the Company closed its Workington, UK acetate tow manufacturing facility in 2015. Following an increase in flake capacity at the Kingsport, Tennessee site in 2015, the Fibers segment could supply all its acetate tow and yarn spinning capacity from this low cost flake asset. In order to fully utilize the increased capacity and reduce fixed costs, the Company sold its 50 percent interest in Primester, which manufactures cellulose acetate at the Company's Kingsport, Tennessee site in June 2016.

For sales by customer location by business segments, see "Business Segments". For sales revenue by geographic areas, seeNote 20, "Segment Information", to the Company's consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report and "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Sales by Customer Location" in Part II, Item 7 of this Annual Report. For long-lived assets by geographic areas, seeNote 20, "Segment Information", to the Company's consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report.



Seasonality and Cyclicality



The Company's earnings are typically higher in second and third quarters, and cash flows from operations are typically highest in the second half of the year due to seasonal demand based on general economic activity in the Company's key markets as described in "Business Segments". Results in the AM segment are typically weaker in fourth quarter due to seasonal downturns in key markets.



The intermediates product lines ofthe CI segment and the coatings and inks product lines of the AFP segment are impacted by the cyclicality of key end products and markets, while other operating segments are more sensitive to global economic conditions. Supply and demand dynamics determine profitability at different stages of business cycles and global economic conditions affect the length of each cycle.












Despite sensitivity to global economic conditions, many of the products of each operating segment are expected to continue to provide an overall stable foundation for earnings growth.



Sales, Marketing, and Distribution



The Company markets and sells products primarily through a global marketing and sales organization which has a presence in the United States and approximately 30 other countries selling into more than 100 countries around the world. Eastman's strategy is to target industries and applications where the Company can develop products and service offerings to provide differentiated value that address current and future customer needs. Management considers both customer-facing capabilities and technical expertise to be critical for success. Our strategic marketing approach and capabilities leverage the Company's insights about trends, markets, and customers to drive development of specialty product and service offerings. Through a highly skilled and specialized sales force that is capable of providing differentiated product solutions, Eastman strives to be the preferred supplier in the Company's targeted markets.



The Company's products are also marketed through indirect channels, which include distributors and contract representatives.

Eastman purchases approximately 75 percent of its key raw materials and energy through different contract mechanisms, generally of two to five years in initial duration with renewal or cancellation options for each party. Most of these agreements do not require the Company to purchase materials or energy if its operations are reduced or idle. The cost of raw materials and energy is generally based on market price at the time of purchase, and Eastman uses derivative financial instruments for certain of its key raw materials to mitigate the impact of market price fluctuations. Key raw materials include cellulose, propane, paraxylene, propylene, methanol, polyvinyl alcohol, and a wide variety of precursors for specialty organic chemicals. Key purchased energy sources include natural gas, coal, and electricity. The Company has multiple suppliers for most key raw materials and energy and uses quality management principles, such as the establishment of long-term relationships with suppliers and on-going performance assessment and benchmarking, as part of its supplier selection process. When appropriate, the Company purchases raw materials from a single source supplier to maximize quality and cost improvements, and has developed contingency plans designed to minimize the potential impact of any supply disruptions from single source suppliers.



While temporary shortages of raw materials and energy may occasionally occur, these items are generally sufficiently available to cover current and projected requirements. However, their continuous availability and cost are subject to unscheduled plant interruptions occurring during periods of high demand, domestic and world market conditions, changes in government regulation, natural disasters, war or other outbreak of hostilities or terrorism or other political factors, or breakdown or degradation of transportation infrastructure. Eastman's operations or products have in the past, and may in the future, be adversely affected by these factors. See "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Risk Factors" in Part II Item 7 of this Annual Report. The Company's raw material and energy costs as a percent of total cost of operations were approximately 40 percent in 2016. For additional information about raw materials, see Exhibit 99.02 "Product and Raw Material Information" of this Annual Report.



Manufacturing Streams



Integral to Eastman's strategy for growth is leveraging its heritage of expertise and innovation in cellulose and acetyl, olefins, polyester, and alkylamine chemistries in key markets, including transportation, building and construction, consumables, tobacco, and agriculture. For each of these chemistries, Eastman has developed and acquired a combination of assets and technologies that are operated within four manufacturing "streams".












•In the cellulose and acetyl stream, the Company begins with coal which is gasified in the presence of oxygen in its coal gasification facility. The resulting synthesis gas is converted into a number of chemicals including methanol, methyl acetate, acetic acid, and acetic anhydride. In the long-term, the Company's ability to use coal is considered to be a raw material cost advantage. Cellulose derivative manufacturing at the Company begins with natural polymers, sourced from managed forests, which, when combined with acetyl and olefin chemicals, provide differentiated product lines. Cellulose and acetyl stream products include but are not limited to, cellulose fibers, plastics, and esters. The major end markets for products from the cellulose and acetyl stream include coatings, displays, and tobacco.



•In the olefins stream, the Company begins primarily with propane and ethane, which are cracked into the "olefin" chemicals ethylene and propylene in three cracking units at its facility in Longview, Texas. The Company purchases additional propylene for use at its Longview facility and other facilities outside the United States. Propylene derivative products are used in a variety of items such as paints and coatings, automotive safety glass, and non-phthalate plasticizers. Ethylene derivative products are converted for end uses in the food industry, health and beauty products, detergents, and automotive products. Historically, periodic additions of large blocks of capacity have caused profit margins of light olefins to expand and contract, resulting in "ethylene" or "olefins" cycles. The Company believes it is positioned to be less impacted by these cycles than more commodity based producers due to its diverse derivatives products and focus on more specialty markets.



•In the polyester stream, the Company begins with purchased paraxylene and produces purified terephthalic acid ("PTA") and dimethyl terephthalate ("DMT") for polyesters and copolyesters. PTA or DMT is then reacted with various glycols, which the Company either makes or purchases, along with other raw materials (some of which the Company makes and are proprietary) to produce copolyesters. The Company believes that this backward integration of polyester manufacturing is a competitive advantage, giving Eastman a low cost position, as well as a more reliable intermediate supply. In addition, Eastman can add specialty monomers to copolyesters to provide clear, tough, chemically resistant product characteristics. As a result, the Company's copolyesters effectively compete with materials such as polycarbonate and acrylic.



•In the alkylamines stream, the Company begins with ammonia and alcohols (C1 - C6) to produce methylamines and higher alkylamines, which can then be further reacted with other chemicals to produce alkylamine derivatives. The Company's alkylamines products are primarily used in agriculture, water treatment, consumables, animal nutrition and oil and gas end markets. The Company is recognized as one of the leading global producers of alkylamines. Methylamines are manufactured by reacting methanol with ammonia in a catalytic reactor. Three different methylamines are produced: mono methylamine ("MMA"), di methylamine ("DMA") and tri methylamine ("TMA"). The reaction circumstances (pressure, temperature, catalysts, etc.) and reactant ratios determine the ratio of the three products which are purified by distillation and used as building blocks to produce downstream derivatives or sold externally to merchant customers. The term higher alkylamines refers to amines produced with C2-C6 alcohols (ethyl, n butyl, n propyl, isopropyl and cyclohexyl amines). The manufacturing process for higher alkylamines is similar to that for methylamines, as ammonia is combined with various alcohols in catalytic reactors and subsequently distilled. The use of different alcohols results in the creation of different higher alkylamines which are used both internally to produce derivatives or sold externally to the merchant market.



The Company leverages its expertise and innovation in cellulose and acetyl, olefins, polyester and alkylamine chemistries, and technologies, to meet demand and create new uses and opportunities for the Company's products in key markets. Through integration and optimization across these streams, the Company is able to create unique and differentiated products that have a performance advantage over competitive materials.



Capital Expenditures



Capital expenditures were $626 million, $652 million, and $593 million in 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively. Capital expenditures in 2016 were primarily for AFP and AM segment expansions in Kuantan, Malaysia, an AM segment expansion of Eastman Tritan®copolyester capacity in Kingsport, Tennessee, and Longview, Texas site modernization projects. The Company expects that 2017 capital spending will be approximately $575 million.



Employees



Eastman employs approximately 14,000 men and women worldwide. Approximately 10 percent of the total worldwide labor force is represented by collective labor agreements, mostly outside the United States.












Customers



Eastman has an extensive customer base and, while it is not dependent on any one customer, loss of certain top customers could adversely affect the Company until such business is replaced. The top 100 customers accounted for approximately 55 percent of the Company's 2016 sales revenue. No single customer accounted for 10 percent or more of the Company's consolidated sales revenue during 2016.



Intellectual Property and Trademarks



While the Company's intellectual property portfolio is an important Company asset which it expands and vigorously protects globally through a combination of patents that expire at various times, trademarks, copyrights, and trade secrets, neither its business as a whole nor any particular operating segment is materially dependent upon any one particular patent, trademark, copyright, or trade secret. As a producer of a broad range of advanced materials, specialty additives, chemicals, and fibers, Eastman owns over 700 active United States patents and more than 1,800 active foreign patents, expiring at various times over several years, and also owns over 5,000 active worldwide trademark applications and registrations. Eastman continues to actively protect its intellectual property. As the laws of many countries do not protect intellectual property to the same extent as the laws of the United States, Eastman cannot ensure that it will be able to adequately protect its intellectual property assets outside the United States. See "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Risk Factors" in Part II Item 7 of this Annual Report.



The Company pursues opportunities to license proprietary technology to third parties in areas where it has determined competitive impact to its businesses will be minimal. These arrangements typically are structured to require payments at significant project milestones such as signing, completion of design, and start-up.



Research and Development



For 2016, 2015, and 2014, Eastman's R&D expenses totaled$219 million,$242 million, and $227 million, respectively. The Company manages certain growth initiatives and costs at the corporate level, including certain R&D costs not allocated to any one operating segment. The Company uses a stage-gating process, which is a disciplined decision making framework for evaluating targeted opportunities, with a number of projects at various stages of development. As projects meet milestones, additional amounts are spent on those projects.The Company continues to explore and invest in R&D initiatives that are aligned with macro trends in sustainability, consumerism, and energy efficiency such as high performance materials and advanced cellulosics. An example of such an initiative is the Eastman microfiber technology platform which leverages the Company's core competency in polyesters, spinning capability, and in-house application expertise, for use in a wide range of applications including liquid and air filtration, high strength packaging in nonwovens, and performance apparel in textiles.In 2016, the Company shifted some R&D resources from process technology efforts into application development efforts which focused on new product introductions and increased growth related spend. Plans have been developed to increase future spending on select R&D programs.



Environmental



The Company's cash expenditures related to environmental protection and improvement were$267 million, $290 million, and $319 million, in 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively, and include operating costs associated with environmental protection equipment and facilities, engineering costs, and construction costs. These cash expenditures include environmental capital expenditures of approximately$45 million, $52 million, and $69 million in 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively.



Eastman is subject to significant and complex laws, regulations, and legal requirements relating to the use, storage, handling, generation, transportation, emission, discharge, disposal, and remediation of, and exposure to, hazardous and non-hazardous substances and wastes in all of the countries in which it does business. These health, safety, and environmental considerations are a priority in the Company's planning for all existing and new products and processes. The Health, Safety, Environmental and Security Committee of Eastman's Board of Directors oversees the Company's policies and practices concerning health, safety, and the environment and its processes for complying with related laws and regulations, and monitors related matters.












The Company's policy is to operate its plants and facilities in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations such that it protects the environment and the health and safety of its employees and the public. The Company intends to continue to make expenditures for environmental protection and improvements in a timely manner consistent with its policies and with the technology available. In some cases, applicable environmental regulations such as those adopted under the Clean Air Act, Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, and related actions of regulatory agencies, determine the timing and amount of environmental costs incurred by the Company. Likewise, any new legislation or regulations related to greenhouse gas emissions and energy could impact the timing and amount of environmental costs incurred by the Company.



The Company accrues environmental costs when it is probable that the Company has incurred a liability at a contaminated site and the amount can be reasonably estimated. In some instances, the amount cannot be reasonably estimated due to insufficient information, particularly as to the nature and timing of future expenditures. In these cases, the liability is monitored until such time that sufficient information exists. With respect to a contaminated site, the amount accrued reflects liabilities expected to be paid out within approximately 30 years and the Company's assumptions about remediation requirements at the contaminated site, the nature of the remedy, the outcome of discussions with regulatory agencies and other potentially responsible parties at multi-party sites, and the number and financial viability of other potentially responsible parties. Changes in the estimates on which the accruals are based, unanticipated government enforcement action, or changes in health, safety, environmental, and chemical control regulations, and testing requirements could result in higher or lower costs.



The Company does not currently expect near term environmental capital expenditures arising from requirements of environmental laws and regulations to materially impact the Company's planned level of annual capital expenditures for environmental control facilities.Other matters concerning health, safety, and the environment are discussed in "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" in Part II Item 7 and in Note 1, "Significant Accounting Policies"; Note 13, "Environmental Matters and Asset Retirement Obligations"; and Note 22, "Reserve Rollforwards" to the Company's consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report.



Backlog



On December 31, 2016 and 2015, Eastman's backlog of firm sales orders represented less than 10 percent of the Company's total consolidated revenue for the year. These orders are primarily short-term and all orders are expected to be filled in the following year. The Company manages its inventory levels to control the backlog of products depending on customers' needs. In areas where the Company is the single source of supply, or competitive forces or customers' needs dictate, the Company may carry additional inventory to meet customer requirements.
