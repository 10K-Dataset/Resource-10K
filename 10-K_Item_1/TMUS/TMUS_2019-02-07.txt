We continue to invest and innovate in these areas to deliver our customers the best value in the industry. Everything we do is powered by our nationwide 4G Long-Term Evolution (“LTE”) network, and we are rapidly preparing for the next generation of 5G services. Going forward, it is this network that will allow us to deliver innovative new products and services with the same customer focused and industry disrupting mentality that has redefined wireless service in the United States.











History



T-Mobile USA, Inc. (“T-Mobile USA”), a Delaware corporation, was formed in 1994 as VoiceStream Wireless PCS (“VoiceStream”), a subsidiary of Western Wireless Corporation (“Western Wireless”). VoiceStream was spun off from Western Wireless in 1999, acquired by Deutsche Telekom AG (“DT”) in 2001 and renamed T-Mobile USA, Inc. in 2002.



In 2013, T-Mobile US, Inc., a Delaware corporation, was formed through the business combination of T-Mobile USA and MetroPCS Communications, Inc. (“MetroPCS”). The business combination was accounted for as a reverse acquisition with T-Mobile USA as the accounting acquirer. Accordingly, T-Mobile USA’s historical financial statements became the historical financial statements of the combined company.



In September 2018, we announced the rebranding of our prepaid brand, MetroPCS, as Metro™ by T-Mobile.



Business



We provide wireless services to79.7 millionpostpaid, prepaid and wholesale customers and generate revenue by providing affordable wireless communication services to these customers, as well as a wide selection of wireless devices and accessories. Our most significant expenses relate to acquiring and retaining high-quality customers, providing a full range of devices, compensating employees, and operating and expanding our network. We provide service, devices and accessories across our flagship brands, T-Mobile and Metro by T-Mobile, through our owned and operated retail stores, as well as through our websites (www.T-Mobile.com and www.MetroPCS.com) and customer care channels. In addition, we sell devices to dealers and other third-party distributors for resale through independent third-party retail outlets and a variety of third-party websites. The information on our websites is not part of this Form 10-K. SeeItem 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operationsfor additional information.



In 2018, we completed the acquisition of television innovator Layer3 TV, Inc. (“Layer3 TV”). This transaction represented an opportunity to acquire a complementary service to our existing wireless service to advance our video strategy. For more information, seeNote 2 – Business Combinationsof theNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.



On April 29, 2018, we entered into the Business Combination Agreement with Sprint to merge in an all-stock transaction. The combined company will be named “T-Mobile,” and as a result of the Merger, is expected to be able to rapidly launch a nationwide 5G network, accelerate innovation and increase competition in the U.S. wireless, video and broadband industries. The Merger is subject to regulatory approvals and certain other customary closing conditions. We expect to receive regulatory approval in the first half of 2019. For more information regarding our Business Combination Agreement, seeNote 2 – Business Combinationsof theNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Network



We continue to expand the footprint and increase the capacity of our network to better serve our customers. Our advancements in network technology and our spectrum resources ensure we can continue to increase the capabilities of our 4G LTE network as we prepare for our nationwide deployment of 5G.



Spectrum Growth



We provide wireless communication services utilizing mid-band spectrum licenses, such as Advanced Wireless Services (“AWS”) and Personal Communications Service (“PCS”), and low-band spectrum licenses utilizing our 600 MHz and 700 MHz spectrum.



•We owned an average of110MHz of spectrum nationwide as ofDecember 31, 2018, comprised of an average of31MHz in the 600 MHz band,10MHz in the 700 MHz band,29MHz in the 1900 MHz PCS band and40MHz in the AWS band. We also own millimeter wave spectrum that comprises an average of264 MHzcovering over110 millionpoints of presence (“POPs”) in the 28 GHz band and105 MHzcovering nearly45 millionPOPs in the 39 GHz band.









We will evaluate future spectrum purchases in current and upcoming auctions and in the secondary market to augment our current spectrum position.



•As ofDecember 31, 2018, we owned a nationwide average of31MHz of 600 MHz low-band spectrum. We now own approximately41MHz of low-band spectrum (600 MHz and 700 MHz), covering100%of the U.S.

•We are building out 5G across the US, including deployment insixof the top 10 markets, including New York and Los Angeles, in 2018. This network will be ready for the introduction of the first standards-based 5G smartphones in 2019. We plan on the delivery of a nationwide standards-based network next year.

•In 2018, we entered into two multi-year contracts that will support the deployment of a nationwide 5G network. In July 2018, we and Nokia entered into a multi-year$3.5 billioncontract for Nokia to provide us with complete end-to-end 5G technology, software and services. In September 2018, we and Ericsson announced a multi-year$3.5 billioncontract in which Ericsson will provide us with the latest 5G New Radio hardware and software compliant with 3rdGeneration Partnership Project (“3GPP”) standards.

•We have started deployment of 600 MHz spectrum on an aggressive schedule. As ofDecember 31, 2018, we were live in more than2,700cities and towns in43states and Puerto Rico covering hundreds of thousands of square miles. Combining 600 and 700 MHz spectrum, we have deployed low band spectrum to301 millionPOPs.

•We have actively engaged with broadcasters to accelerate the Federal Communications Commission (“FCC”) spectrum clearance timelines, entering into95agreements with several parties. These agreements are expected to, in aggregate, accelerate clearing, bringing the total clearing target to approximately272 millionPOPs by year-end 2019. As ofDecember 31, 2018, we had cleared approximately135 millionPOPs. We remain committed to assisting broadcasters occupying 600 MHz spectrum to move to new frequencies.

•We currently have29devices compatible with 600 MHz including the latest iPhone generation.

•We expect our 600 MHz spectrum holdings will be used to deploy America’s first nationwide standards-based 5G network next year. 600 MHz 4G LTE radios are software upgradeable to support 5G as it becomes available later this year.

•Over the last year, we have entered into and closed on various agreements for the acquisition and exchange of 700 MHz A-Block, AWS and PCS spectrum licenses. SeeNote 6 – Goodwill, Spectrum License Transactions and Other Intangible Assetsof theNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statementsfor further information.

•We intend to opportunistically acquire spectrum licenses in private party transactions and future FCC spectrum license auctions.



Network Coverage Growth



•We continue to expand our coverage breadth and, as of December 31, 2018, covered more than325 millionpeople with 4G LTE.

•As ofDecember 31, 2018, we had equipment deployed on approximately64,000macro towers and21,000distributed antenna system (“DAS”) and small cell sites. We remain on plan to roll out approximately20,000small cells through 2019.



Network Speed Leadership



We offer the fastest nationwide 4G LTE upload and download speeds in the United States. Thefourth quarter of2018is the20thconsecutive quarter we have led the industry in both categories based on the results of millions of user-generated speed tests.



Network Capacity Growth



We continue to expand our capacity through the re-farming of existing spectrum and implementation of new technologies including Voice over LTE (“VoLTE”), Carrier Aggregation, 4x4 multiple-input and multiple-output (“MIMO”), 256 Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (“QAM”) and Licensed Assisted Access (“LAA”).



•VoLTE comprised87%of total voice calls as ofDecember 31, 2018, compared to80%as ofDecember 31, 2017. Moving voice traffic to VoLTE frees up spectrum and allows for the transition of spectrum currently used for 2G and 3G to 4G LTE. We are leading the U.S. wireless industry in the rate of VoLTE adoption.

•Carrier aggregation is live for our customers in923markets. This advanced technology delivers superior speed and









performance by bonding multiple discrete spectrum channels together.

•4x4 MIMO is currently available in564markets. This technology effectively delivers twice the speed and incremental network capacity to customers by doubling the number of data paths between the cell site and a customer's device. We started deploying massive MIMO (FD-capable and 5G with future software upgrades) in selected locations in late 2018.

•We have rolled out 256 QAM in988markets. 256 QAM increases the number of bits delivered per transmission to enable faster speeds. We are the first carrier globally to have rolled out the combination of carrier aggregation, 4x4 MIMO and 256 QAM. This trifecta of standards has been rolled out to more than500markets.

•We have also started rolling out LAA, a technology which utilizes unlicensed 5 GHz spectrum to augment available bandwidth. The first LAA small cell went live in New York City in the fourth quarter of 2017 and the technology has since been rolled out to nearly1,700cell sites, the vast majority being small cells. Deployments of LAA have also commenced in28cities including Los Angeles, Philadelphia, Washington DC, Atlanta, Houston, Las Vegas, San Diego and New Orleans. In areas where LAA has been deployed, customers with capable handsets have observed real-life speeds in excess of500Mbps.

•In July 2018, we launched our Narrowband Internet of Things (“NB-IoT”) service nationwide, making us the first to launch NB-IoT in the U.S. and the first in the world to launch NB-IoT in the guard bands for improved efficiency. Built on the 3GPP standard, NB-IoT is a low power, wide area network LTE-advanced technology that provides a pathway to 5G Internet of Things and enables many comparable benefits like low power usage, long battery life and low device cost.



Competition



The wireless telecommunications industry is highly competitive. We are the

third

largest provider of postpaid service plans and the

largest



Employees



As ofDecember 31, 2018, we employed approximately52,000full-time and part-time employees, including network, retail, administrative and customer support functions.



Regulation



The FCC regulates many key aspects of our business, including licensing, construction, the operation and use of our network, modifications of our network, control and ownership of our licenses and authorizations, the sale, transfer and acquisition of certain licenses, domestic roaming arrangements and interconnection agreements, pursuant to its authority under the Communications Act of 1934, as amended (“Communications Act”). The FCC has a number of complex requirements and proceedings that affect our operations and that could increase our costs or diminish our revenues. For example, the FCC has rules regarding provision of 911 and E-911 services, porting telephone numbers, interconnection, roaming, internet openness or net neutrality, disabilities access, privacy and cybersecurity, consumer protection, and the universal service and Lifeline programs. Many of these and other issues are being considered in ongoing proceedings, and we cannot predict whether or how such actions will affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. Our ability to provide services and generate revenues could be harmed by adverse regulatory action or changes to existing laws and regulations. In addition, regulation of companies that offer competing services can impact our business indirectly.



Wireless communications providers must be licensed by the FCC to provide communications services at specified spectrum frequencies within specified geographic areas and must comply with the rules and policies governing the use of the spectrum as









adopted by the FCC. The FCC issues each license for a fixed period of time, typically 10-15 years depending on the particular licenses. While the FCC has generally renewed licenses given to operating companies like us, the FCC has authority to both revoke a license for cause and to deny a license renewal if a renewal is not in the public interest. Furthermore, we could be subject to fines, forfeitures and other penalties for failure to comply with FCC regulations, even if any such non-compliance was unintentional. In extreme cases, penalties can include revocation of our licenses. The loss of any licenses, or any related fines or forfeitures, could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.



Additionally, Congress’ and the FCC’s allocation of additional spectrum for broadband commercial mobile radio service (“CMRS”), which includes cellular, PCS, miscellaneous wireless services and specialized mobile radio, could significantly increase competition. We cannot assess the impact that any developments that may occur in the U.S. economy or any future spectrum allocations by the FCC may have on license values. FCC spectrum auctions and other market developments may adversely affect the market value of our licenses in the future. A significant decline in the value of our licenses could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the FCC periodically reviews its policies on how to evaluate carriers’ spectrum holdings. A change in these policies could affect spectrum resources and competition among us and other carriers.



Congress and the FCC have imposed limitations on foreign ownership of CMRS licensees that exceed 20% direct ownership or 25% indirect ownership. The FCC has ruled that higher levels of indirect foreign ownership, even up to 100%, are presumptively consistent with the public interest albeit subject to review. Consistent with that established policy, the FCC has issued a declaratory ruling authorizing up to 100% ownership of our Company by DT. This declaratory ruling, and our licenses, are conditioned on DT’s and the Company’s compliance with a network security agreement with the Department of Justice, the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Department of Homeland Security. Failure to comply with the terms of this agreement could result in fines, injunctions and other penalties, including potential revocation of our spectrum licenses.





In addition, the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) and other federal agencies have jurisdiction over some consumer protection and elimination and prevention of anticompetitive business practices with respect to the provision of non-common carrier services. Further, the FCC and the Federal Aviation Administration regulate the siting, lighting and construction of transmitter towers and antennae. Tower siting and construction are also subject to state and local zoning, as well as federal statutes regarding environmental and historic preservation. The future costs to comply with all relevant regulations are to some extent unknown and changes to regulations, or the applicability of regulations, could result in higher operating and capital expenses, or reduced revenues in the future.
