Business Overview and Strategy



Un-carrier Strategy



We are the Un-carrier. Through our Un-carrier strategy, we have disrupted the wireless communications services industry, by actively engaging with and listening to our customers and eliminating their existing pain points, including providing them with added value, an exceptional experience and implementing signature Un-carrier initiatives that have changed wireless for good. We ended annual service contracts, overages, unpredictable international roaming fees, data buckets and so much more. We are inspired by a relentless customer experience focus, consistently leading the wireless industry in customer care by delivering an excellent customer experience with our “Team of Experts,” which drives our record-high customer satisfaction levels while enabling operational efficiencies. Since the launch of the Un-carrier in 2013, approximately 53 million customers have joined the Un-carrier movement, and we will continue forward with our customer experience focus, determined to bring the Un-carrier to every potential customer in the United States.



Our network is the foundation of our success and everything we do is powered by our nationwide 4G Long-Term Evolution (“LTE”) network, which covers 327 million Americans (99% of the U.S. population) and our recently launched nationwide 5G network. We continue to expand the footprint and improve the quality of our network, providing outstanding wireless experiences for customers who will not have to compromise on quality and value. Going forward, it is this network that will allow us to deliver new, innovative products and services with the same customer experience focus and industry-disrupting mentality that has redefined the wireless communications services industry in the United States in the customers’ favor.



History



T-Mobile USA, Inc. (“T-Mobile USA”), a Delaware corporation, was formed in 1994 as VoiceStream Wireless PCS (“VoiceStream”), a subsidiary of Western Wireless Corporation (“Western Wireless”). VoiceStream was spun off from Western Wireless in 1999, acquired by Deutsche Telekom AG (“DT”) in 2001 and renamed T-Mobile USA, Inc. in 2002.



In 2013, T-Mobile US, Inc., a Delaware corporation, was formed through the business combination of T-Mobile USA and MetroPCS Communications, Inc. (“MetroPCS”). The business combination was accounted for as a reverse acquisition with T-Mobile USA as the accounting acquirer. Accordingly, T-Mobile USA’s historical financial statements became the historical financial statements of the combined company.



Proposed Sprint Transactions



On April 29, 2018, we entered into the Business Combination Agreement with Sprint to merge in an all-stock transaction at a fixed exchange ratio of 0.10256 shares of T-Mobile common stock for each share of Sprint common stock, or 9.75 shares of Sprint common stock for each share of T-Mobile common stock. If the Merger closes, the combined company will be named “T-Mobile,” and as a result of the Merger, is expected to be able to build upon our recently launched foundational 5G network of 600 MHz spectrum to deliver transformational broad, deep and nationwide 5G for all, accelerate innovation and increase competition in the U.S. wireless, video and broadband industries. If the Merger closes, we expect to be able to combine Sprint’s 2.5 GHz mid-band spectrum with our foundational layer of 5G and millimeter-wave spectrum, completing the “layer cake” of spectrum and providing customers with an unmatched 5G experience at lower prices.



The consummation of the Merger remains subject to certain closing conditions, as well as pending judicial and regulatory proceedings. We expect the Merger will be permitted to close in early 2020. For more information regarding our Business Combination Agreement, seeNote2– Business Combinationsof the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.



Business



We provide wireless services to 86.0 million postpaid, prepaid and wholesale customers and generate revenue by providing affordable wireless communications services to these customers, as well as a wide selection of wireless devices and accessories. Our most significant expenses relate to acquiring and retaining high-quality customers, providing a full range of devices, compensating employees, and operating and expanding our network. We provide service, devices and accessories across our flagship brands, T-Mobile and Metro by T-Mobile, through our owned and operated retail stores, as well as through our





websites (www.T-Mobile.com and www.metrobyt-mobile.com), T-Mobile app and customer care channels. In addition, we sell devices to dealers and other third-party distributors for resale through independent third-party retail outlets and a variety of third-party websites. The information on our websites is not part of this Form 10-K. SeeItem 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operationsfor additional information.



Customers



We provide wireless communications services to three primary categories of customers:



•Branded postpaid customers generally include customers who are qualified to pay after receiving wireless communications services utilizing phones, wearables, DIGITS or other connected devices which includes tablets and SyncUp DRIVE™;

•Branded prepaid customers generally include customers who pay for wireless communications services in advance. Our branded prepaid customers include customers of T-Mobile and Metro by T-Mobile; and

•Wholesale customers include Machine-to-Machine (“M2M”) and Mobile Virtual Network Operator (“MVNO”) customers that operate on our network but are managed by wholesale partners.



We generate the majority of our service revenues by providing wireless communications services to branded postpaid and branded prepaid customers. Our ability to acquire and retain branded postpaid and prepaid customers is important to our business in the generation of service revenues, equipment revenues and other revenues. In 2019, our service revenues generated by providing wireless communications services by customer category were:



•67% Branded postpaid customers;

•28% Branded prepaid customers; and

•5% Wholesale customers and Roaming and other services.



Starting with the three months ended March 31, 2020, we plan to discontinue reporting wholesale customers and instead focus on branded customers and wholesale revenues, which we consider more relevant than the number of wholesale customers given the expansion of M2M and Internet of Things (“IoT”) products.



All of our revenues for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017 were earned in the United States, including Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands.



Services and Products



We provide wireless communications services through a variety of service plan options. We also offer a wide selection of wireless devices, including smartphones, wearables, tablets and other mobile communication devices, which are manufactured by various suppliers.



Our primary service plan offering, which allows customers to subscribe for wireless communications services separately from the purchase of a device, is our signature Magenta plan (“Magenta”) and is packed with exclusive benefits, including unlimited talk, text and smartphone data on our network, free stuff, discounts, and more every week from T-Mobile Tuesdays and “Team of Experts,” our dedicated customer care team. Customers also have the ability to choose additional features for an additional cost on Magenta Plus.



We also offer an Essentials rate plan, for customers who want the basics, as well as specific rate plans to qualifying customers, including Unlimited 55+, Military, First Responder, and Business.



Our device options for qualifying customers on Magenta, and previously on T-Mobile ONE and Simple Choice plans, include:



•The option of financing all or a portion of the individual device or accessory purchase price at the time of sale over an installment period of up to 36 or 12 months, respectively, using an Equipment Installment Plan ("EIP");

•For qualifying customers who finance their initial device with an EIP, an option to enroll in our Just Upgrade My Phone (“JUMP!®”) program to later upgrade their device; and

•The option to lease a device over a period of up to 18 months and upgrade it for a new device up to one time per month with JUMP! On Demand™.







5G



•In December 2019, T-Mobile launched America’s first nationwide 5G network, including prepaid 5G with Metro by T-Mobile, covering more than 200 million people and more than 5,000 cities and towns across the United States with 5G. In addition, we introduced two new 600 MHz 5G capable superphones, the exclusive OnePlus 7T Pro 5G McLaren and the Samsung Galaxy Note10+ 5G and anticipate offering an industry-leading smartphone portfolio built to work on nationwide 5G in 2020. This 5G network is our foundational layer of 5G coverage on 600 MHz low-band spectrum.

•T-Mobile’s 5G network is not just bigger, it’s better. T-Mobile’s 5G is based on real, standards-based 5G and covers more than 60% of the population across more than 1 million square miles. T-Mobile’s 5G network works indoors and is available to anyone with a capable device.



Spectrum Position



We provide wireless communications services utilizing mid-band spectrum licenses, such as Advanced Wireless Services (“AWS”) and Personal Communications Service (“PCS”), low-band spectrum licenses utilizing our 600 MHz and 700 MHz spectrum, and mmWave spectrum.



•We owned an average of 111 MHz of spectrum nationwide as of December 31, 2019, not including mmWave spectrum. The spectrum comprises an average of 31 MHz in the 600 MHz band, 10 MHz in the 700 MHz band, 29 MHz in the 1900 MHz PCS band and 41 MHz in the AWS band.

•We have cleared 600 MHz spectrum covering approximately 275 million POPs as of December 31, 2019 and expect to clear the remaining 600 MHz spectrum POPs in 2020.

•We continue our deployment of LTE on 600 MHz spectrum using 5G-ready equipment. As of December 31, 2019, we were live with 4G LTE in nearly 8,900 cities and towns in 49 states and Puerto Rico covering 1.5 million square miles and 248 million POPs.

•Combining 600 and 700 MHz spectrum, we have deployed 4G LTE in low-band spectrum to 316 million POPs.

•Currently, more than 33 million devices on T-Mobile’s network are compatible with 600 MHz spectrum.

•On June 3, 2019, the Federal Communications Commission (“FCC”) announced the results of Auctions 101 (28 GHz spectrum) and 102 (24 GHz spectrum). In the combined auctions, T-Mobile spent $842 million to more than quadruple its nationwide average total mmWave spectrum holdings from 104 MHz to 471 MHz.

•We will evaluate future spectrum purchases in current and upcoming auctions and in the secondary market to further augment our current spectrum position. We are not aware of any such spectrum purchase options that come close to matching the efficiencies and synergies possible from the Merger.



Network Coverage Growth



•We continue to expand our coverage breadth and covered 327 million people with 4G LTE as of December 31, 2019;

•Our nationwide 5G network covered more than 200 million people as of December 31, 2019; and

•As of December 31, 2019, we had equipment deployed on approximately 66,000 macro cell sites and 25,000 small cell/distributed antenna system sites.



Network Capacity Growth



Due to industry spectrum limitations (especially in mid-band), we continue to make efforts to expand our capacity and increase the quality of our network through the re-farming of existing spectrum and implementation of new technologies including Voice over LTE (“VoLTE”), Carrier Aggregation, 4x4 multiple-input and multiple-output (“MIMO”), 256 Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (“QAM”) and Licensed Assisted Access (“LAA”).



•VoLTE comprised 90% of total voice calls in the fourth quarter of 2019, compared to 87% in the fourth quarter of 2018.

•Carrier aggregation is live for our customers in 969 markets as of December 31, 2019, up from 923 markets as of December 31, 2018.

•4x4 MIMO is currently available in 708 markets as of December 31, 2019, up from 564 markets as of December 31, 2018.





•Our customers have 256 QAM available across the Un-carrier's entire 4G LTE footprint.

•We are the first carrier globally to have rolled out the combination of carrier aggregation, 4x4 MIMO and 256 QAM. This trifecta of standards has been rolled out to 701 markets as of December 31, 2019, up from 549 markets as of December 31, 2018.

•LAA has been deployed to 30 cities including Atlanta, Austin, Chicago, Denver, Houston, Las Vegas, Los Angeles, Miami, New Orleans, New York, Philadelphia, Sacramento, San Diego, Seattle, and Washington DC.



Competition





Employees



As of December 31, 2019, we employed approximately 53,000 full-time and part-time employees, including network, retail, administrative and customer support functions.



Regulation



The FCC regulates many key aspects of our business, including licensing, construction, the operation and use of our network, modifications of our network, control and ownership of our licenses and authorizations, the sale, transfer and acquisition of certain licenses, domestic roaming arrangements and interconnection agreements, pursuant to its authority under the Communications Act of 1934, as amended (“Communications Act”). The FCC has a number of complex requirements that affect our operations and pending proceedings regarding additional or modified requirements that could increase our costs or diminish our revenues. For example, the FCC has rules regarding provision of 911 and E-911 services, porting telephone numbers, interconnection, roaming, internet openness or net neutrality, disabilities access, privacy and cybersecurity, consumer protection, and the universal service and Lifeline programs. Many of these and other issues are being considered in ongoing proceedings, and we cannot predict whether or how such actions will affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. Our ability to provide services and generate revenues could be harmed by adverse regulatory action or changes to existing laws and regulations. In addition, regulation of companies that offer competing services can impact our business indirectly.



Except for operations in certain unlicensed frequency bands, wireless communications services providers generally must be licensed by the FCC to provide communications services at specified spectrum frequencies within specified geographic areas and must comply with the rules and policies governing the use of the spectrum as adopted by the FCC. The FCC issues each license for a fixed period of time, typically 10-15 years depending on the particular licenses. While the FCC has generally renewed licenses given to operating companies like us, the FCC has authority to both revoke a license for cause and to deny a license renewal if a renewal is not in the public interest. Furthermore, we could be subject to fines, forfeitures and other penalties for failure to comply with FCC regulations, even if any such non-compliance was unintentional. In extreme cases, penalties can include revocation of our licenses. The loss of any licenses, or any related fines or forfeitures, could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.



Additionally, Congress’ and the FCC’s allocation of additional spectrum for broadband commercial mobile radio service (“CMRS”), which includes cellular, PCS, miscellaneous wireless services and specialized mobile radio, could significantly increase and intensify competition. We cannot assess the impact that any developments that may occur in the U.S. economy or any future spectrum allocations by the FCC may have on license values. FCC spectrum auctions and other market





developments may adversely affect the market value of our licenses in the future. A significant decline in the value of our licenses could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the FCC periodically reviews its policies on how to evaluate carriers’ spectrum holdings. A change in these policies could affect spectrum resources and competition among us and other carriers.



Congress and the FCC have imposed limitations on foreign ownership of CMRS licensees that exceed 20% direct ownership or 25% indirect ownership through an entity controlling the licensee. The FCC has ruled that higher levels of indirect foreign ownership, even up to 100%, are presumptively consistent with the public interest, but must be reviewed and approved. Consistent with that established policy, the FCC has issued a declaratory ruling authorizing up to 100% ownership of our Company by DT. This declaratory ruling, and our licenses, are conditioned on DT’s and the Company’s compliance with a network security agreement with the Department of Justice, the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Department of Homeland Security. Failure to comply with the terms of this agreement could result in fines, injunctions and other penalties, including potential revocation of our spectrum licenses.



While the Communications Act generally preempts state and local governments from regulating the entry of, or the rates charged by, wireless communications services providers, certain state and local governments regulate other terms and conditions of wireless service, including billing, termination of service arrangements and the imposition of early termination fees, advertising, network outages, the use of devices while driving, zoning and land use. Additionally, after the FCC’s adoption of the 2017 “Restoring Internet Freedom” (RIF) Order reclassifying broadband internet access services as Title I (non-common carrier services), a number of states have sought to impose state-specific net neutrality and privacy requirements on providers’ broadband services. The FCC ruling broadly preempted such state efforts, which are inconsistent with the FCC’s federal deregulatory approach. Recently, however, the DC Circuit issued a ruling largely upholding the RIF Order, but also vacating the portion of the ruling broadly preempting state/local net neutrality laws. The court left open the prospect that particular state laws could still unlawfully conflict with the FCC net neutrality rules and be preempted. A petition seeking rehearing of the decision has been filed. Court challenges to some of the state enactments also remain pending.



While most states are largely seeking to codify the repealed federal rules, there are differences in some states, notably California, which has passed separate privacy and net neutrality legislation. There are also efforts within Congress to pass federal legislation to codify uniform federal privacy and net neutrality requirements, while also ensuring the preemption of separate state requirements, including the California laws. If not rescinded, separate state requirements will impose significant business costs and could also result in increased litigation costs and enforcement risks. State authority over wireless broadband services will remain unsettled until final action by the courts or Congress.



In addition, the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) and other federal agencies have jurisdiction over some consumer protection and elimination and prevention of anticompetitive business practices with respect to the provision of non-common carrier services. Further, the FCC and the Federal Aviation Administration regulate the siting, lighting and construction of transmitter towers and antennae. Tower siting and construction are also subject to state and local zoning, as well as federal statutes regarding environmental and historic preservation. The future costs to comply with all relevant regulations are to some extent unknown and changes to regulations, or the applicability of regulations, could result in higher operating and capital expenses, or reduced revenues in the future.
