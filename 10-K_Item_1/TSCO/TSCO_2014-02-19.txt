Item 1.Business



Overview



Tractor Supply Company is the largest operator of retail farm and ranch stores in the United States and is focused on supplying the lifestyle needs of recreational farmers and ranchers and others who enjoy the rural lifestyle (which we refer to as the “Out Here” lifestyle), as well as tradesmen and small businesses.  We operate retail stores under the namesTractor Supply CompanyandDel’s Feed & Farm Supplyand operate a website under the nameTractorSupply.com.  Our stores are located primarily in towns outlying major metropolitan markets and in rural communities.



Tractor Supply Company has one reportable industry segment which is the retail sale of farm and ranch products.  AtDecember 28, 2013, we operated1,276retail farm and ranch stores in48states.  Our Tractor Supply stores typically range in size from15,000to19,000square feet of inside selling space along with additional outside selling space.  We use a standard15,500square foot design for most new built-to-suit locations.  In some smaller markets we use a12,500square foot format with slightly less inventory and lower occupancy costs than our prototype but with a similar product assortment.



Business Strategy



We believe our sales and earnings growth are the result of executing our business strategy, which includes the following key components:



Market Niche

We have identified a specialized market niche: supplying the lifestyle needs of recreational farmers and ranchers and others who enjoy the rural lifestyle, as well as tradesmen and small businesses.  By focusing our product assortment on these core customers, we believe we are differentiated from general merchandise, home center and other specialty retailers.  We cater to the rural lifestyle and often serve a market by being a trip consolidator for many basic maintenance needs for farm, ranch and rural customers.



Customers

Our customers are home, land, pet and livestock owners who generally have above average income and below average cost of living.  We seek to serve a customer base that primarily lives in towns outlying major metropolitan markets and in rural communities.  They are recreational farmers and ranchers and others who enjoy the rural lifestyle, as well as tradesmen and small businesses.



Customer Service

We are committed to providing our customers reliable product availability and a high level of in-store service through our motivated, well-trained store team members. We believe the ability of our store team members to provide friendly, responsive and seasoned advice helps our customers find the right products to satisfy their everyday needs in addition to the specialty items needed to complete their rural lifestyle projects.  Additionally, we maintain a customer solutions center located in Brentwood, Tennessee that can be reached via phone or email that supports our online and in-store customers and our store team members.  We believe this commitment to customer service promotes strong customer loyalty and repeat shopping.



We use a third party provider to measure our level of customer service.  This process allows customers to provide feedback on their shopping experience.  Based on the third party provider’s data, we consider our customer satisfaction scores to be among the best-in-class.  We critically evaluate the feedback we receive from our customers and implement improvements at the individual store level based on that feedback.



Store Personnel and Training

We seek to hire store team members with farming and ranching backgrounds, with particular emphasis on general maintenance, equine and welding.  We endeavor to staff our stores with courteous, highly motivated team members and devote considerable resources to training store team members, often in cooperation with our vendors.  Our training programs include:



•a management training program which covers all aspects of our store operations;

•structured training on customer service and selling skills;

•product knowledge and in-store training programs produced in conjunction with key vendors;

•frequent management skills training classes;

•semi-annual store manager meetings with vendor product presentations; and

•ongoing product information updates from our management headquarters, the Store Support Center.

Store Environment

Our stores are designed and managed to make shopping an enjoyable experience and to maximize sales and operating efficiencies.  Stores are strategically arranged to provide an open environment for optimal product placement and visual display.  In addition, these layouts allow for departmental space to be easily reallocated and visual displays to be changed for seasonal products and promotions.  Display and product placement information is sent to stores weekly to ensure quality and uniformity among the stores.  Informative signs are located throughout each store to assist customers with purchasing decisions and merchandise location.  These signs provide customers with a comparison of product qualities, clear pricing and useful information regarding product benefits and suggestions for appropriate accessories.  Our store layouts and visual displays afford our customers a feeling of familiarity and enhance the shopping experience.  Also, all of our store team members wear highly visible red vests, aprons or smocks with nametags, and our customer service and checkout counters are conveniently located.



Merchandising and Purchasing

We offer an extensive assortment of products for those seeking to enjoy theOut Herelifestyle.  Our broad product assortment and physical store size are tailored to meet the needs of our customers in various geographic markets. Our full line of product offerings is supported by a strong in-stock inventory position with an average of16,000to19,500products per store.  No one product accounted for more than10%of our sales during2013.  We offer the following comprehensive selection of merchandise:



•Equine, livestock, pet and small animal products, including items necessary for their health, care, growth and containment;

•Hardware, truck, towing and tool products;

•Seasonal products, including lawn and garden items, power equipment, gifts and toys;

•Work/recreational clothing and footwear; and

•Maintenance products for agricultural and rural use.



The following chart indicates the percentage of sales represented by each of our major product categories during fiscal2013,2012and2011:

Our buying team constantly reviews and updates our product assortment to respond to customer needs and to offer new, relevant products.  We are focused on providing key products that our customers use on a regular basis for their lifestyle and maintenance needs with emphasis on consumable, usable, edible (C.U.E.) products.  Examples of C.U.E product categories include, but are not limited to, livestock feed and bedding, pet food, lubricants, and various seasonal products, such as pest control and twine.



Our products are sourced through both domestic and international vendors.  Our business is not dependent upon any one vendor or particular group of vendors.  We purchase our products from a group of approximately800vendors, with no one vendor representing more than10%of our purchases during fiscal2013.  Approximately300core vendors accounted for90%of our purchases during fiscal2013.  We have not experienced any significant difficulty in obtaining satisfactory alternative sources of supply for our products, and we believe that adequate sources of supply exist at substantially similar costs for nearly all of our products.  We have no material long-term contractual commitments with any of our vendors.



Our buying team focuses on merchandise procurement, vendor line reviews and testing of new products and programs.  We also employ a dedicated inventory management team that focuses exclusively on all forecasting and replenishment functions, and a committed merchandise planning team that concentrates on assortment planning.  Through the combined efforts of these teams, we continue to improve our overall inventory productivity and in-stock position.

Intellectual Property

Our subsidiary, Tractor Supply Co. of Texas, LP (“TSCT”), owns registrations with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (“USPTO”) for various service marks includingTSC®,Tractor Supply Co.®,TSC Tractor Supply Co.®and the trapezium design for retail store services. We consider these service marks, and the accompanying goodwill and name recognition, to be valuable assets of our business. TSCT also owns several other service marks for retail services, some of which have been registered with the USPTO and some of which are the subject of applications for registration pending before the USPTO.



In addition to selling products that bear nationally-known manufacturer brands, we also sell products manufactured for us under a number of exclusive brands that we consider to be important to our business.  These exclusive brands are manufactured for us by a number of vendors and provide an alternative to the national brands, which helps provide value for our customers and positions us as a destination store.



Our exclusive brands represented approximately31%,25%and23%of our total sales in fiscal2013,2012and2011, respectively.  Our exclusive brands include:



•C.E. Schmidt®,Bit & Bridle®andBlue Mountain®(apparel and footwear)

•Countyline®(livestock, farm and ranch equipment)

•Groundwork®(lawn and garden supplies)

•Huskee®(outdoor power equipment)

•JobSmart®(tools)

•Producers Pride®andDumor®(livestock and horse feed and supplies)

•Red Shed®(gifts and collectibles)

•Redstone®(heating products)

•Retriever®,4health®andPaws 'n Claws®(pet foods and supplies)

•Royal Wing®(bird feed and supplies)

•Tractor Supply Co®(trailers, truck tool boxes and animal bedding)

•Traveller®(truck and automotive products)



The exclusive brands identified above have been registered with the USPTO for certain products and are the subject of applications for registration pending before the USPTO for other products.



Our trademark and service mark registrations have various expiration dates; however, provided that we continue to use the marks and renew the registrations in a timely manner, the registrations are potentially perpetual in duration.



We believe our intellectual property, which includes the trademarks and service marks identified above, together with certain trade names, domain names, copyrights and patents, has significant value and is an important component of our merchandising and marketing strategies.



Distribution

We currently operate a distribution network for supplying stores with merchandise, and in fiscal2013our stores received approximately71%of merchandise through this network while approximately29%of merchandise was shipped directly to the stores from our vendors.  We believe this flow facilitates the prompt and efficient distribution of merchandise to our stores in order to enhance sales and improve our inventory turnover rate.  Oursevendistribution centers, located in Georgia, Indiana, Kentucky, Maryland, Nebraska, Texas and Washington, represent total distribution capacity of3.9 millionsquare feet.  In2013, we completed construction on a new distribution center, a 684,000 square foot facility in Macon, Georgia, which includes an import center.  It replaced our 521,000 square foot leased distribution center in Braselton, Georgia and became operational in the third quarter of fiscal 2013.  We continue to improve the technology in our distribution centers, and currently four of oursevenfacilities utilize a new warehouse management system that provides for better movement of inventory through increased use of conveyors and automation.  We will continue to refine this new system and expect that it will be implemented in additional locations.



We select the locations of our distribution centers in an effort to minimize logistics costs and optimize the distance from distribution centers to our stores.  We manage our inbound and outbound transportation activity in-house through the use of a web-based transportation management system.  We utilize several common carriers for store deliveries.  We manage our transportation costs through carrier negotiations, the monitoring of transportation routes, and the scheduling of deliveries.

Marketing

We utilize an "everyday value price" philosophy to consistently offer our products at competitive prices complemented by strategically planned promotions throughout the year.  We regularly monitor prices at competing stores and adjust our prices as appropriate.



To drive store traffic and position ourselves as a destination store, we promote broad selections of merchandise with newspaper circulars, customer targeted direct mail and email and internet offerings.  Vendors frequently support these specific programs by offering temporary cost reductions, honoring coupons and funding gift card rebate programs.  Our vendors also provide assistance with product presentation and fixture design, brochures, support for in-store events, and point-of-purchase materials for customer education and product knowledge for our team members.



Multi-Channel

We communicate with our customers across multiple touch points including our stores, e-commerce website (TractorSupply.com), email and direct mail.  Our goal is to be available when and how our customers choose to engage with our brand.  Connecting with consumers online provides the opportunity to allow customers to shop at a time and place that fits their schedule while delivering enhanced product information, research and decision tools that support product selection and informational needs in specific subject areas.  We give our customers the ability to purchase products and have them shipped to one of our retail stores, their homes or offices.  We believe this capability further enhances customer service and extends our market to areas where our retail stores are not currently located.  Additionally, in 2013, we upgraded our e-commerce website to include the integration of order management, added extensive products offerings for vendor direct to customer drop shipments and transitioned to in-house warehouse fulfillment for products that we stock.



Management and Team Members

As ofDecember 28, 2013, we employed approximately10,200full-time and9,000part-time team members. We also employ additional part-time team members during peak periods.  We are not party to any collective bargaining agreements.



Our store operations are organized into eight regions.  Each region is led by a vice president of operations, and the region is further organized into districts, which are led by a district manager or area manager.  We have internal advisory boards, one comprised of store managers and the other comprised of district managers.  These groups bring a grassroots perspective to operational initiatives and generate chain-wide endorsement of proposed best-practice solutions.



All of our team members participate in one of various incentive programs, which provide the opportunity to receive additional compensation based upon team and/or Company performance. We also provide our eligible team members the opportunity to participate in an employee stock purchase plan and a 401(k) retirement savings plan (we contribute to the 401(k) retirement savings plan solely through a cash match of 100% of the employee’s elective contributions up to3%of eligible compensation plus50%of the employee’s elective contributions from3%to6%of eligible compensation).  Additionally, we share in the cost of health insurance provided to our team members, and team members receive a discount on merchandise purchased at our stores.



We encourage a promote-from-within environment when internal resources permit.  We also provide internal leadership development programs designed to mentor our high-potential team members for continued progress.  Our current team of district managers, area managers, and store managers have an average tenure of approximately six years.  Management believes internal promotions, coupled with the hiring of individuals with previous retail experience, will provide the management structure necessary to support our planned growth.



Continuous Improvement

We are committed to a continuous improvement program called Tractor Value System (“TVS”), which is our catalyst to drive change throughout our organization.  TVS is a business management system that emphasizes, through data analytics and team member engagement, a focus on continuous improvement.  Utilizing TVS, we improve processes by identifying and accepting the need for change of current practices to reduce costs, shorten lead times, and drive innovation.  We have implemented numerous continuous improvement projects (with team members from multiple areas of our business) to evaluate key operations and implement process changes.  Team members are empowered and expected to challenge current paradigms and improve processes.  Our management encourages the participation of all team members in decision-making, regularly solicits input and suggestions from our team members and incorporates suggestions into our improvement activities.



Management Information and Control Systems

We have invested considerable resources in our management information and control systems to support superior customer service, manage the purchase and distribution of our merchandise and improve our operating efficiencies.  Our key management information and control systems include a point-of-sale system, an e-commerce platform, a supply chain management and replenishment

system, a warehouse management system, a price optimization system, a vendor purchase order control system and a merchandise presentation system.  These systems are integrated through an enterprise resource planning (“ERP”) system.  This ERP system tracks merchandise from initial order through ultimate sale and interfaces with our financial systems.



We continue to evaluate and improve the functionality of our systems to maximize their effectiveness.  Such efforts include ongoing hardware and software evaluations, refreshes and upgrades to support optimal software configurations and application performance.  We plan to continue to upgrade our information technology and implement other efficiency-driving system enhancements (including the continued roll-out of a new warehouse management system to distribution centers, significant feature enhancements to our e-commerce platform, an enhanced demand planning system and store and support center hardware refreshes) in2014.  We will continue to strengthen the security of our information systems and support store and distribution center expansion.  These efforts are directed toward improving business processes and achieving the most efficient and effective use of systems to manage our operations while ensuring a secure and reliable environment.



Growth Strategy



Our current and long-term growth strategy is to:  (1) expand geographic market presence through opening new retail stores, (2) enhance financial performance through comparable store sales growth achieved through targeted merchandising programs with an “everyday value price” philosophy and supported by strong customer service, (3) enhance product margin through strategic product sourcing, inventory and markdown management, a strong exclusive brand offering, and optimization of product pricing and transportation costs, (4) leverage operating costs by focusing on opportunities for continuous improvement and elimination of waste in all of our processes, (5) expand market opportunities via e-commerce and internet-supported sales accomplished by improving our website product content and enhancing our customers’ online experience, and (6) expand through selective acquisition, as such opportunities arise, to enhance penetration into new and existing markets to complement organic growth.



Over the past five years we have experienced considerable sales growth, resulting in a compounded annual growth rate of approximately11.4%. We plan to open102to106new stores in2014, a selling square footage increase of approximately8%.  We opened102new stores in2013and93new stores in2012, selling square footage increases of approximately8.3%and7.9%, respectively.



We operated1,276retail farm and ranch stores in48states as ofDecember 28, 2013.  Given the size of the communities that we target, we believe that there is ample opportunity for new store growth in many existing and new markets. We have developed a proven method for selecting store sites and have identified over800additional markets for new Tractor Supply stores.  Approximately56%of our stores are in freestanding buildings and44%are located in strip shopping centers.  We lease approximately93%of our store sites and own the remaining7%of store sites.



Competition



We operate in a competitive retail industry. The principal competitive factors include location of stores, price and quality of merchandise, in-stock consistency, merchandise assortment and presentation, and customer service. We compete with general merchandise retailers, home center retailers, specialty and discount retailers, independently owned retail farm and ranch stores, numerous privately-held regional farm store chains and farm cooperatives, as well as internet-based retailers.  However, we believe we successfully differentiate ourselves from many of these retailers by focusing on our specialized market niche for customers living the rural lifestyle.  See further discussion of competition in 1A, "Risk Factors" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.



Seasonality and Weather



Our business is seasonal.  Historically, our sales and profits are the highest in the second and fourth fiscal quarters due to the sale of seasonal products. In past years, weather conditions, including unseasonably warm weather in winter months, and extreme weather conditions, including snow and ice storms, flood and wind damage, hurricanes, tornadoes, extreme rain and droughts, have affected our sales and results of operations both positively and negatively.  Our strategy is to remain flexible and react to extreme weather conditions by adjusting our merchandise assortments and redirecting inventories to stores affected by the weather conditions.  We experience our highest inventory and accounts payable balances during our first fiscal quarter for purchases of seasonal products to support the higher sales volume of the spring selling season and again during our third fiscal quarter to support the higher sales volume of the cold-weather selling season.

Stewardship and Compliance with Environmental Matters



Our operations are subject to numerous federal, state and local laws and regulations enacted or adopted regulating the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment.  We are committed to conducting business in an environmentally responsible manner.  This commitment impacts all areas of our business, including investments in store construction and maintenance, energy usage, supply chain, product selection, responsible packaging, recycling, and delivery of product knowledge to our customers.
