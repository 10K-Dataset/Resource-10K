    amounts)

Introduction

Newmont Mining Corporation is primarily a gold producer with
    significant assets or operations in the United States,
    Australia, Peru, Indonesia, Ghana, Canada, New Zealand and
    Mexico. At December 31, 2009, Newmont had proven and
    probable gold reserves of 91.8 million equity ounces and an
    aggregate land position of approximately 33,400 square
    miles (86,500 square kilometers). Newmont is also engaged
    in the production of copper, principally through its Batu Hijau
    operation in Indonesia and Boddington operation in Australia.
    Newmont Mining Corporation’s original predecessor
    corporation was incorporated in 1921 under the laws of Delaware.

Newmont’s corporate headquarters are in Greenwood Village,
    Colorado, USA. In this report, “Newmont,” the
    “Company,” “our” and “we” refer to
    Newmont Mining Corporation

and/or

our
    affiliates and subsidiaries.

In September 2009, the Company completed a two part public
    offering of $900 and $1,100 senior notes maturing on
    October 1, 2019 and October 1, 2039, respectively. Net
    proceeds from the 2019 and 2039 notes were $895 and $1,080,
    respectively. The 2019 notes pay interest semi-annually at a
    rate of 5.13% per annum and the 2039 notes pay semi-annual
    interest of 6.25% per annum.

In June 2009, the Company completed the acquisition of the
    remaining 33.33% interest in Boddington from AngloGold Ashanti
    Australia Limited (“AngloGold”). The valuation date
    for the transaction was January 1, 2009, and closing
    adjustments were made to reflect Newmont’s economic
    ownership from that date. Consideration for the acquisition
    consisted of $750 less an $8 closing adjustment paid in cash at
    closing, $240 paid in cash in December 2009, and a contingent
    royalty capped at $100, equal to 50% of the average realized
    operating margin (Revenue less

Costs applicable to sales

on a by-product basis), if any, exceeding $600 per ounce,
    payable quarterly on one-third of gold sales from Boddington
    beginning in the second quarter of 2010. See Item 1A, Risk
    Factors, Risks Related to Newmont Operations, below.

In February 2009, we issued $518 of convertible senior notes,
    maturing on February 15, 2012. The notes pay interest
    semi-annually at a rate of 3.00% per annum. The notes are
    convertible, at the holder’s option, equivalent to a
    conversion price of $46.25 per share of common stock.
    Additionally, on February 3, 2009, we issued
    34,500,000 shares of common stock at a price of $37.00,
    less an



underwriting discount of $1.17 per share. Net proceeds for the
    convertible senior notes and common stock offering were $504 and
    $1,234, respectively.

The February and September 2009 offerings were made pursuant to
    our automatic shelf registration statement on

Form S-3.

See Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
    Consolidated Financial Condition and Results of Operations.

Segment
    Information, Export Sales, etc.

Our operating segments include North America, South America,
    Asia Pacific and Africa. Our North America segment consists
    primarily of Nevada, La Herradura in Mexico and Hope Bay in
    Canada. Our South America segment consists primarily of
    Yanacocha and Conga in Peru. Our Asia Pacific segment consists
    primarily of Batu Hijau in Indonesia, Boddington in Australia
    and other smaller operations in Australia/New Zealand. Our
    Africa segment consists primarily of Ahafo and Akyem in Ghana.
    See Item 1A, Risk Factors, Risks Related to Newmont
    Operations, below and Note 31 to the Consolidated Financial
    Statements for information relating to our operating segments,
    domestic and export sales, and lack of dependence on a limited
    number of customers.

Products

Gold

General.

We had consolidated gold sales of
    6.5 million ounces (5.3 million equity ounces) in
    2009, 6.2 million ounces (5.2 million equity ounces)
    in 2008 and 6.1 million ounces (5.3 million equity
    ounces) in 2007. For 2009, 2008 and 2007, 83%, 88% and 78%,
    respectively, of our net revenues were attributable to gold. Of
    our 2009 consolidated gold sales, approximately 32% came from
    North America, 32% from South America, 28% from Asia Pacific and
    8% from Africa. References in this report to “equity
    ounces” or “equity pounds” mean that portion of
    gold or copper produced, sold or included in proven and probable
    reserves that is attributable to our ownership or economic
    interest.

Most of our net revenue comes from the sale of refined gold in
    the international market. The end product at our gold
    operations, however, is generally doré bars. Doré is
    an alloy consisting primarily of gold but also containing silver
    and other metals. Doré is sent to refiners to produce
    bullion that meets the required market standard of 99.95% gold.
    Under the terms of our refining agreements, the doré bars
    are refined for a fee, and our share of the refined gold and the
    separately-recovered silver are credited to our account or
    delivered to buyers. Gold sold from Batu Hijau in Indonesia and
    a portion of the gold from Boddington in Australia, Phoenix in
    Nevada and Yanacocha in Peru, is contained in a saleable
    concentrate containing other metals such as copper or silver.

Gold Uses.

Gold is generally used for
    fabrication or investment. Fabricated gold has a variety of end
    uses, including jewelry, electronics, dentistry, industrial and
    decorative uses, medals, medallions and official coins. Gold
    investors buy gold bullion, official coins and jewelry.

Gold Supply.

A combination of current mine
    production and draw-down of existing gold stocks held by
    governments, financial institutions, industrial organizations
    and private individuals make up the annual gold supply. Based on
    public information available for the years 2006 through 2009, on
    average, current mine production has accounted for approximately
    71% of the annual gold supply.

On February 17, 2010, the afternoon fixing gold price on
    the London Bullion Market was $1,119 per ounce and the spot
    market gold price on the New York Commodity Exchange was $1,120
    per ounce.

We generally sell our gold at the prevailing market price during
    the month in which the gold is delivered to the customer. We
    recognize revenue from a sale when the price is determinable,
    the gold has been delivered, the title has been transferred and
    collection of the sales price is reasonably assured.

Copper

General.

We had consolidated copper sales of
    507 million pounds (226 million equity pounds) in
    2009, 290 million pounds (130 million equity pounds)
    in 2008 and 428 million pounds (200 million equity
    pounds) in 2007. For 2009, 2008 and 2007, 17%, 12% and 22%,
    respectively, of our net revenues were attributable to copper.
    Copper production at Batu Hijau, in Indonesia, and Boddington,
    in Australia, is in the form of saleable concentrate that is
    sold to smelters for further treatment and refining. At
    December 31, 2009, we had a 35.44% ownership interest but
    reported a 52.44% economic interest in the Batu Hijau operation
    in Indonesia, which began production in 1999. Copper production
    began in 2009 at Boddington.

Copper Uses.

Refined copper is incorporated
    into wire and cable products for use in the construction,
    electric utility, communications and transportation industries.
    Copper is also used in industrial equipment and machinery,
    consumer products and a variety of other electrical and
    electronic applications and is also used to make brass. Copper
    substitutes include aluminum, plastics, stainless steel and
    fiber optics. Refined, or cathode, copper is also an
    internationally traded commodity.

Copper Supply.

A combination of current mine
    production and recycled scrap material make up the annual copper
    supply.

The copper price is quoted on
    the London Metal Exchange in terms of dollars per metric ton of
    high grade copper. The following table presents the dollar per

Source: London Metal Exchange

On February 17, 2010, the high grade copper closing price
    on the London Metal Exchange was $3.23 per pound. Our historic
    ability to sell copper at market prices was limited in some
    cases by hedging activities, more particularly described in
    Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Gold and
    Copper Processing Methods

Gold is extracted from naturally-oxidized ores by either heap
    leaching or milling, depending on the amount of gold contained
    in the ore, the amenability of the ore to treatment and related
    capital and operating costs. Higher grade oxide ores are
    generally processed through mills, where the ore is ground into
    a fine powder and mixed with water in slurry, which then passes
    through a

carbon-in-leach

circuit. Lower grade oxide ores are generally processed using
    heap leaching. Heap leaching consists of stacking crushed or

run-of-mine

ore on impermeable pads, where a weak cyanide solution is
    applied to the surface of the heap to dissolve the gold. In both
    cases, the gold-bearing solution is then collected and pumped to
    process facilities to remove the gold by collection on carbon or
    by zinc precipitation.

Gold contained in ores that are not naturally oxidized can be
    directly milled if the gold is amenable to cyanidation,
    generally known as free milling sulfide ores. Ores that are not
    amenable to cyanidation, known as refractory ores, require more
    costly and complex processing techniques than oxide or free
    milling ore. Higher-grade refractory ores are processed through
    either roasters or autoclaves. Roasters heat finely ground ore
    to a high temperature, burn off the carbon and oxidize the
    sulfide minerals that prevent efficient leaching. Autoclaves use
    heat, oxygen and pressure to oxidize sulfide ores.

Some sulfide ores may be processed through a flotation plant or
    by bio-milling. In flotation, ore is finely ground, turned into
    slurry, then placed in a tank known as a flotation cell.
    Chemicals are added to the slurry causing the gold-containing
    sulfides to attach to air bubbles and float to the top of the
    tank. The sulfides are removed from the cell and converted into
    a concentrate that can then be processed in an autoclave or
    roaster to recover the gold. Bio-milling incorporates patented
    technology that involves inoculation of suitable crushed ore on
    a leach pad with naturally occurring bacteria strains, which
    oxidize the sulfides over a period of time. The ore is then
    processed through an oxide mill.

At Batu Hijau, ore containing copper and gold is crushed to a
    coarse size at the mine and then transported from the mine via
    conveyor to a concentrator, where it is finely ground and then
    treated by



successive stages of flotation, resulting in a concentrate
    containing approximately 30% copper. The concentrate is
    dewatered and stored for loading onto ships for transport to
    smelters.

At Boddington, ore containing copper and gold is crushed to a
    coarse size at the mine and then transported via conveyor to a
    process plant, where it is further crushed and then finely
    ground as a slurry. The ore is initially treated by flotation
    which produces a copper/gold concentrate containing
    approximately 18% copper. Flotation concentrates are processed
    via a gravity circuit to recover fine liberated gold and then
    dewatered and stored for loading onto ships for transport to
    smelters. The flotation tailing has a residual gold content that
    is recovered in a

carbon-in-leach

circuit.

At Phoenix, a process similar to that followed at Boddington is
    used to process a concentrate containing approximately 20%
    copper, which is loaded onto rail cars for transport to the
    smelter.

Hedging
    Activities

Our strategy is to provide shareholders with leverage to changes
    in the gold and copper prices by selling our gold and copper
    production at current market prices. Consequently, we do not
    hedge our gold and copper sales. We continue to manage risks
    associated with commodity input costs, interest rates and
    foreign currencies using the derivative market.

For additional information, see Hedging in Item 7A,
    Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk, and
    Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Gold and Copper
    Reserves

At December 31, 2009 we had 91.8 million equity ounces
    of proven and probable gold reserves. We added 6.4 million
    equity ounces to proven and probable reserves, and depleted
    6.8 million equity ounces during 2009. We also added
    8.2 million equity ounces to proven and probable reserves
    through acquisitions and divested 1.0 million equity
    ounces. 2009 reserves were calculated at a gold price assumption
    of $800, A$1,000 or NZ$1,200 per ounce, respectively. A
    reconciliation of the changes in proven and probable gold
    reserves during the past three years follows:

In June 2009 reserves were increased by 6.7 million equity
    ounces through the acquisition of the remaining 33.33% interest
    in Boddington. In December 2009 our economic interest in
    reserves increased by 1.5 million equity ounces as a result
    of transactions with a noncontrolling partner at Batu Hijau,
    which increased our economic interest to 52.44%.

(2)

In November and December 2009 our ownership in Batu Hijau
    decreased from 45% to 35.44% as a result of the divestiture
    required under the Contract of Work. In July 2009 we sold the
    Kori Kollo operation in Bolivia.

At December 31, 2009 we had 9,120 million equity
    pounds of proven and probable copper reserves. We added
    400 million equity pounds to proven and probable reserves
    and depleted 310 million equity pounds during 2009. We also
    added 2,040 million equity pounds to proven and probable
    reserves through acquisitions and divested 790 million
    equity pounds. 2009 reserves were calculated at a copper price
    of $2.00 or A$2.40 per pound. A reconciliation of the changes in

In June 2009 reserves were increased by 640 million equity
    pounds through the acquisition of the remaining 33.33% interest
    in Boddington. In December 2009 our economic interest in
    reserves increased by 1,400 million equity pounds as a
    result of transactions with a noncontrolling partner at Batu
    Hijau, which increased our economic interest to 52.44%.

In November and December 2009 our ownership in Batu Hijau
    decreased from 45% to 35.44% as a result of the divestiture
    required under the Contract of Work.

Our exploration efforts are directed to the discovery of new
    mineralized material and converting it into proven and probable
    reserves. We conduct near-mine exploration around our existing
    mines and greenfields exploration in other regions globally.
    Near-mine exploration can result in the discovery of additional
    deposits, which may receive the economic benefit of existing
    operating, processing, and administrative infrastructures. In
    contrast, the discovery of new mineralization through
    greenfields exploration efforts will likely require capital
    investment to build a separate, stand-alone operation. We
    expensed $187 in 2009, $213 in 2008 and $177 in 2007 on

Exploration

.

For additional information, see Item 2, Properties, Proven
    and Probable Reserves.

Licenses and
    Concessions

Other than operating licenses for our mining and processing
    facilities, there are no third party patents, licenses or
    franchises material to our business. In many countries, however,
    we conduct our mining and exploration activities pursuant to
    concessions granted by, or under contract with, the host
    government. These countries include, among others, Australia,
    Canada, Ghana, Indonesia, Mexico, New Zealand and Peru. The
    concessions and contracts are subject to the political risks
    associated with foreign operations. See Item 1A, Risk
    Factors, Risks Related to Newmont, below. For a more detailed
    description of our Indonesian Contract of Work, see Item 2,
    Properties, below.

Condition of
    Physical Assets and Insurance

Our business is capital intensive and requires ongoing capital
    investment for the replacement, modernization or expansion of
    equipment and facilities. For more information, see Item 7,
    Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Consolidated
    Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Liquidity and
    Capital Resources, below.

We maintain insurance policies against property loss and
    business interruption and insure against risks that are typical
    in the operation of our business, in amounts that we believe to
    be reasonable. Such insurance, however, contains exclusions and
    limitations on coverage, particularly with respect to
    environmental liability and political risk. There can be no
    assurance that claims would be paid under such insurance
    policies in connection with a particular event. See
    Item 1A, Risk Factors, Risks Related to Newmont, below.



Environmental
    Matters

Our United States mining and exploration activities are subject
    to various federal and state laws and regulations governing the
    protection of the environment, including the Clean Air Act; the
    Clean Water Act; the Comprehensive Environmental Response,
    Compensation and Liability Act; the Emergency Planning and
    Community

Right-to-Know

Act; the Endangered Species Act; the Federal Land Policy and
    Management Act; the National Environmental Policy Act; the
    Resource Conservation and Recovery Act; and related state laws.
    These laws and regulations are continually changing and are
    generally becoming more restrictive. Our activities outside the
    United States are also subject to governmental regulations for
    the protection of the environment.

We conduct our operations so as to protect public health and the
    environment and believe our operations are in compliance with
    applicable laws and regulations in all material respects. Each
    operating mine has a reclamation plan in place that meets all
    applicable legal and regulatory requirements. We have made, and
    expect to make in the future, expenditures to comply with such
    laws and regulations. We have made estimates of the amount of
    such expenditures, but cannot precisely predict the amount of
    such future expenditures. Estimated future reclamation costs are
    based principally on legal and regulatory requirements. At
    December 31, 2009, $698 was accrued for reclamation costs
    relating to current or recently producing properties.

In addition to legal and regulatory compliance, we have
    developed programs to guide our company toward achieving
    environmental and sustainable development objectives. Evidencing
    our management’s commitment towards these objectives, in
    2008, we moved our corporate headquarters to an environmentally
    sustainable, LEED, gold-certified building. We are also
    committed to managing climate change risks and responsibly
    reduce our greenhouse gas emissions. We have reported our
    greenhouse gas emissions annually to the Carbon Disclosure
    Project since 2004, became a Founding Reporter on The Climate
    Registry in 2008 and have committed to publicly reporting our
    independently-verified greenhouse gas emissions in the future.
    As a result of our efforts, we continue to achieve milestones,
    such as being the first gold company listed on the Dow Jones
    Sustainability Index World and receiving International Cyanide
    Management Code certification at 100% of registered Newmont
    sites as of the end of 2009.

We are also involved in several matters concerning environmental
    obligations associated with former, primarily historic, mining
    activities. Generally, these matters concern developing and
    implementing remediation plans at the various sites. We believe
    that the related environmental obligations associated with these
    sites are similar in nature with respect to the development of
    remediation plans, their risk profile and the activities
    required to meet general environmental standards. Based upon our
    best estimate of our liability for these matters, $161 was
    accrued at December 31, 2009 for such obligations
    associated with properties previously owned or operated by us or
    our subsidiaries. These amounts are included in

Other current
    liabilities

and

Reclamation and remediation liabilities.

Depending upon the ultimate resolution of these matters,
    which is difficult to predict due to the legal and regulatory
    uncertainty of the related matters, we believe that it is
    reasonably possible that the liability for these matters could
    be as much as 148% greater or 3% lower, than the amount accrued
    at December 31, 2009. The amounts accrued for these matters
    are reviewed periodically based upon facts and circumstances
    available at the time. Changes in estimates are charged to costs
    and expenses in the period when estimates are revised.

For a discussion of the most significant reclamation and
    remediation activities, see Item 7, Management’s
    Discussion and Analysis of Consolidated Financial Condition and
    Results of Operations, and Notes 25 and 33 to the
    Consolidated Financial Statements, below.

Employees and
    Contractors

Approximately 14,500 people were employed by Newmont at
    December 31, 2009. In addition, approximately
    15,900 people were working as contractors in support of
    Newmont’s operations.
