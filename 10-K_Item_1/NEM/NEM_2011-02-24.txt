On February 3, 2011, Newmont and Fronteer Gold Inc.
    (“Fronteer”) announced that they entered into an
    agreement under which Newmont will acquire all of the
    outstanding common shares of Fronteer by way of a Plan of
    Arrangement (“Arrangement”). Under the Arrangement,
    shareholders of Fronteer will receive C$14.00 in cash and one
    common share in Pilot Gold Inc., a Canadian corporation, which
    will retain certain exploration assets of Fronteer, for each
    common share of Fronteer. The Arrangement will be subject to
    approval by at least 66% of the votes cast at a special meeting
    of Fronteer’s shareholders, expected to be held in April
    2011, and the subsequent approval of the Ontario Superior Court
    of Justice. The agreement also contains certain termination
    rights for both Newmont and Fronteer including a break fee of
    C$85 payable by Fronteer, if the transaction is not completed in
    certain specified circumstances. The transaction is expected to
    close in the second quarter of 2011 for approximately C$2,300.
    Fronteer owns, among other assets, the exploration stage Long
    Canyon project, which is located approximately one hundred miles
    from the Company’s existing infrastructure in Nevada and
    provides the potential for significant development and operating
    synergies.

Products

References in this report to attributable gold ounces or
    attributable copper pounds mean that portion of gold or copper
    produced, sold or included in proven and probable reserves based
    on our ownership

and/or

economic interest, unless otherwise noted.

Gold

General.

We had consolidated gold production
    of 6.5 million ounces (5.4 million ounces attributable
    to Newmont) in 2010, 6.5 million ounces (5.2 million
    ounces) in 2009 and 6.2 million ounces (5.2 million
    ounces) in 2008. Of our 2010 consolidated gold production,
    approximately 30% came from North America, 23% from South
    America, 39% from Asia Pacific and 8% from Africa.

For 2010, 2009 and 2008, 81%, 83% and 88%, respectively, of our

Sales

were attributable to gold. Most of our

Sales

comes from the sale of refined gold in the international
    market. The end product at our gold operations, however, is
    generally doré bars. Doré is an alloy consisting
    primarily of gold but also containing silver and other metals.
    Doré is sent to refiners to produce bullion that meets the
    required market standard of 99.95% gold. Under the terms of our
    refining agreements, the doré bars are refined for a fee,
    and our share of the refined gold and the separately-recovered
    silver are credited to our account or delivered to buyers. Gold
    sold from Batu Hijau in Indonesia and a portion of the gold from
    Boddington in Australia, Phoenix in Nevada and Yanacocha in
    Peru, is contained in a saleable concentrate containing other
    metals such as copper or silver.

Gold Uses.

Gold is generally used for
    fabrication or investment. Fabricated gold has a variety of end
    uses, including jewelry, electronics, dentistry, industrial and
    decorative uses, medals, medallions and official coins. Gold
    investors buy gold bullion, official coins and jewelry.

Gold Supply.

A combination of current mine
    production and draw-down of existing gold stocks held by
    governments, financial institutions, industrial organizations
    and private individuals make up the annual gold supply. Based on
    public information available for the years 2008 through 2010, on
    average, current mine production has accounted for approximately
    61% of the annual gold supply.

Gold Price.

On February 18, 2011, the afternoon fixing gold price on
    the London Bullion Market was $1,384 per ounce and the spot
    market gold price on the New York Commodity Exchange was
    $1,388 per ounce.

We generally sell our gold at the prevailing market price during
    the month in which the gold is delivered to the customer. We
    recognize revenue from a sale when the price is determinable,
    the gold has been delivered, the title has been transferred and
    collection of the sales price is reasonably assured.

Copper

General.

We had consolidated copper production
    of 600 million pounds (327 million pounds attributable
    to Newmont) in 2010, 504 million pounds (227 million
    pounds) in 2009 and 285 million pounds (128 million
    pounds) in 2008. Copper production is in the form of saleable
    concentrate that is sold to smelters for further treatment and
    refining. For 2010, 2009 and 2008, 19%, 17% and 12%,
    respectively, of our

Sales

were attributable to copper.

Copper Uses.

Refined copper is incorporated
    into wire and cable products for use in the construction,
    electric utility, communications and transportation industries.
    Copper is also used in industrial equipment and machinery,
    consumer products and a variety of other electrical and
    electronic applications and is also used to make brass. Copper
    substitutes include aluminum, plastics, stainless steel and
    fiber optics. Refined, or cathode, copper is also an
    internationally traded commodity.

Copper Supply.

A combination of current mine
    production and recycled scrap material make up the annual copper
    supply.

Copper Price.

The copper price is quoted on
    the London Metal Exchange in terms of dollars per metric ton of
    high grade copper. The following table presents the dollar per
    pound equivalent of the annual high, low and average daily

Source: London Metal Exchange

On February 18, 2011, the high grade copper closing price
    on the London Metal Exchange was $4.48 per pound.

We generally sell our copper based on the monthly average market
    price for the third month following the month in which the
    delivery to the customer takes place. We recognize revenue from
    a sale when the price is determinable, the concentrate has been
    loaded on a vessel, the title has been transferred and
    collection of the sales price is reasonably assured. For revenue
    recognition, we use a provisional price based on the average
    prevailing market price during the two week period prior to



completion of vessel loading. The copper concentrate is marked
    to market through earnings until final settlement.

Gold and
    Copper Processing Methods

Gold is extracted from naturally-oxidized ores by either heap
    leaching or milling, depending on the amount of gold contained
    in the ore, the amenability of the ore to treatment and related
    capital and operating costs. Higher grade oxide ores are
    generally processed through mills, where the ore is ground into
    a fine powder and mixed with water in slurry, which then passes
    through a

carbon-in-leach

circuit. Lower grade oxide ores are generally processed using
    heap leaching. Heap leaching consists of stacking crushed or

run-of-mine

ore on impermeable pads, where a weak cyanide solution is
    applied to the surface of the heap to dissolve the gold. In both
    cases, the gold-bearing solution is then collected and pumped to
    process facilities to remove the gold by collection on carbon or
    by zinc precipitation.

Gold contained in ores that are not naturally oxidized can be
    directly milled if the gold is amenable to cyanidation,
    generally known as free milling sulfide ores. Ores that are not
    amenable to cyanidation, known as refractory ores, require more
    costly and complex processing techniques than oxide or free
    milling ore. Higher-grade refractory ores are processed through
    either roasters or autoclaves. Roasters heat finely ground ore
    to a high temperature, burn off the carbon and oxidize the
    sulfide minerals that prevent efficient leaching. Autoclaves use
    heat, oxygen and pressure to oxidize sulfide ores.

Some sulfide ores may be processed through a flotation plant or
    by bio-milling. In flotation, ore is finely ground, turned into
    slurry, then placed in a tank known as a flotation cell.
    Chemicals are added to the slurry causing the gold-containing
    sulfides to attach to air bubbles and float to the top of the
    tank. The sulfides are removed from the cell and converted into
    a concentrate that can then be processed in an autoclave or
    roaster to recover the gold. Bio-milling incorporates patented
    technology that involves inoculation of suitable crushed ore on
    a leach pad with naturally occurring bacteria strains, which
    oxidize the sulfides over a period of time. The ore is then
    processed through an oxide mill.

At Batu Hijau, ore containing copper and gold is crushed to a
    coarse size at the mine and then transported from the mine via
    conveyor to a concentrator, where it is finely ground and then
    treated by successive stages of flotation, resulting in a
    concentrate containing approximately 26% to 31% copper. The
    concentrate is dewatered and stored for loading onto ships for
    transport to smelters.

At Boddington, ore containing copper and gold is crushed to a
    coarse size at the mine and then transported via conveyor to a
    process plant, where it is further crushed and then finely
    ground as a slurry. The ore is initially treated by flotation
    which produces a copper/gold concentrate containing
    approximately 18% copper. Flotation concentrates are processed
    via a gravity circuit to recover fine liberated gold and then
    dewatered and stored for loading onto ships for transport to
    smelters. The flotation tailing has a residual gold content that
    is recovered in a

carbon-in-leach

circuit.

Hedging
    Activities

Our strategy is to provide shareholders with leverage to changes
    in gold and copper prices by selling our gold and copper at
    current market prices and consequently, we do not hedge our gold
    and copper sales. We continue to manage certain risks associated
    with commodity input costs, interest rates and foreign
    currencies using the derivative market.

For additional information, see Hedging in Item 7A,
    Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk, and
    Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Gold and Copper
    Reserves

At December 31, 2010 we had 93.5 million ounces of
    proven and probable gold reserves attributable to Newmont. We
    added 8.2 million ounces to proven and probable reserves,
    and depleted



6.5 million ounces during 2010. We also added
    0.3 million ounces to proven and probable reserves through
    acquisitions and divested 0.3 million ounces. 2010 reserves
    were calculated at a gold price assumption of $950, A$1,100 or
    NZ$1,350 per ounce, respectively. A reconciliation of the
    changes in proven and probable gold reserves during the past
    three years follows:

Our exploration efforts are directed to the discovery of new
    mineralized material and converting it into proven and probable
    reserves. We conduct near-mine exploration around our existing
    mines and greenfields exploration in other regions globally.
    Near-mine exploration can result in the discovery of additional
    deposits, which may receive the economic benefit of existing
    operating, processing, and administrative infrastructures. In
    contrast, the discovery of new mineralization through
    greenfields exploration efforts will likely require capital
    investment to build a separate, stand-alone operation. Our

Exploration

expense was $218, $187 and $213 in 2010, 2009
    and 2008, respectively.

For additional information, see Item 2, Properties, Proven
    and Probable Reserves.

Licenses and
    Concessions

Other than operating licenses for our mining and processing
    facilities, there are no third party patents, licenses or
    franchises material to our business. In many countries, however,
    we conduct our mining and exploration activities pursuant to
    concessions granted by, or under contract with, the host



government. These countries include, among others, Australia,
    Canada, Ghana, Indonesia, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru and
    Suriname. The concessions and contracts are subject to the
    political risks associated with foreign operations. See
    Item 1A, Risk Factors, below. For a more detailed
    description of our Indonesian Contract of Work, see Item 2,
    Properties, below.

Condition of
    Physical Assets and Insurance

Our business is capital intensive and requires ongoing capital
    investment for the replacement, modernization or expansion of
    equipment and facilities. For more information, see Item 7,
    Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Consolidated
    Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Liquidity and
    Capital Resources, below.

We maintain insurance policies against property loss and
    business interruption and insure against risks that are typical
    in the operation of our business, in amounts that we believe to
    be reasonable. Such insurance, however, contains exclusions and
    limitations on coverage, particularly with respect to
    environmental liability and political risk. There can be no
    assurance that claims would be paid under such insurance
    policies in connection with a particular event. See
    Item 1A, Risk Factors, below.

Environmental
    Matters

Our United States mining and exploration activities are subject
    to various federal and state laws and regulations governing the
    protection of the environment, including the Clean Air Act; the
    Clean Water Act; the Comprehensive Environmental Response,
    Compensation and Liability Act; the Emergency Planning and
    Community

Right-to-Know

Act; the Endangered Species Act; the Federal Land Policy and
    Management Act; the National Environmental Policy Act; the
    Resource Conservation and Recovery Act; and related state laws.
    These laws and regulations are continually changing and are
    generally becoming more restrictive. Our activities outside the
    United States are also subject to governmental regulations for
    the protection of the environment.

We conduct our operations so as to protect public health and the
    environment and believe our operations are in compliance with
    applicable laws and regulations in all material respects. Each
    operating mine has a reclamation plan in place that meets all
    applicable legal and regulatory requirements. At
    December 31, 2010, $904 was accrued for reclamation costs
    relating to current or recently producing properties.

We are involved in several matters concerning environmental
    obligations associated with former, primarily historic, mining
    activities. Generally, these matters concern developing and
    implementing remediation plans at the various sites. Based upon
    our best estimate of our liability for these matters, $144 was
    accrued at December 31, 2010 for such obligations
    associated with properties previously owned or operated by us or
    our subsidiaries. The amounts accrued for these matters are
    reviewed periodically based upon facts and circumstances
    available at the time.

For a discussion of the most significant reclamation and
    remediation activities, see Item 7, Management’s
    Discussion and Analysis of Consolidated Financial Condition and
    Results of Operations, and Notes 4 and 31 to the
    Consolidated Financial Statements, below.

In addition to legal and regulatory compliance, we have
    developed complimentary programs to guide our company toward
    achieving environmental and sustainable development objectives.
    Evidencing our management’s commitment towards these
    objectives, in 2008, we moved our corporate headquarters to an
    environmentally sustainable, LEED, gold-certified building. We
    are also committed to managing climate change risks and
    responsibly reducing our greenhouse gas emissions. We have
    reported our greenhouse gas emissions annually to the Carbon
    Disclosure Project since 2004, became a Founding Reporter on The
    Climate Registry in 2008 and have committed to publicly
    reporting our independently-verified greenhouse gas emissions in
    the future. As a result of our efforts, we continue to achieve
    milestones, such as being the first gold company listed on the
    Dow Jones Sustainability Index World (“DJSI”),
    remaining a member of the DJSI for four consecutive years, and



receiving International Cyanide Management Code certification at
    100% of registered Newmont sites as of the end of 2009.

Employees and
    Contractors

Approximately 15,500 people were employed by Newmont at
    December 31, 2010. In addition, approximately
    18,800 people were working as contractors in support of
    Newmont’s operations.
