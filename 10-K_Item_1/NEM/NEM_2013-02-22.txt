Products

References in this report to “attributable gold ounces” or “attributable copper pounds” mean that portion of gold or copper
produced, sold or included in proven and probable reserves based on our ownership and/or economic interest, unless otherwise noted.

Gold

General.

We had consolidated gold production of 5.6 million ounces (5.0 million attributable ounces) in 2012,
5.9 million ounces (5.2 million attributable ounces) in 2011 and 6.4 million ounces (5.4 million attributable ounces) in 2010. Of our 2012 consolidated gold production, approximately 35% came from North America, 24% from South America, 31%
from Asia Pacific and 10% from Africa.



NEWMONT MINING CORPORATION

For 2012, 2011 and 2010, 92%, 88% and 81%, respectively, of our

Sales

were attributable to
gold. Most of our

Sales

comes from the sale of refined gold. The end product at our gold operations, however, is generally doré bars. Doré is an alloy consisting primarily of gold but also containing silver and other metals.
Doré is sent to refiners to produce bullion that meets the required market standard of 99.95% gold. Under the terms of our refining agreements, the doré bars are refined for a fee, and our share of the refined gold and the
separately-recovered silver is credited to our account or delivered to buyers. Gold sold from Batu Hijau in Indonesia and a portion of the gold from Boddington in Australia, Phoenix in Nevada and Yanacocha in Peru, is sold in a concentrate
containing other metals such as copper and silver.

Gold Uses.

Gold generally is used for fabrication or
investment. Fabricated gold has a variety of end uses, including jewelry, electronics, dentistry, industrial and decorative uses, medals, medallions and official coins. Gold investors buy gold bullion, official coins and jewelry.

Gold Supply.

A combination of current mine production, recycling and draw-down of existing gold stocks held by
governments, financial institutions, industrial organizations and private individuals make up the annual gold supply. Based on public information available for the years 2009 through 2012, on average, current mine production has accounted for
approximately 62% of the annual gold supply.

Gold Price.

The following table presents the annual high, low
and average daily afternoon fixing prices for gold over the past ten years on the London Bullion Market ($/ounce):

Reuters and the London Bullion Market Association

On February 14, 2013, the afternoon fixing gold price on the London Bullion
Market was $1,646 per ounce and the spot market gold price on the New York Commodity Exchange was $1,635 per ounce.

We generally sell
our gold at the prevailing market price during the month in which the gold is delivered to the buyers. We recognize revenue from a sale when the price is determinable, the gold has been delivered, the title has been transferred and collection of the
sales price is reasonably assured.

Copper

General.

We had consolidated copper production of 224 million pounds (143 million attributable pounds) in 2012, 338 million pounds (197 million pounds) in 2011 and
577 million pounds (314 million pounds) in 2010. Copper production is in the form of concentrate that is sold to smelters for further treatment and refining. For 2012, 2011 and 2010, 8%, 12% and 19%, respectively, of our

Sales

were
attributable to copper.



NEWMONT MINING CORPORATION

Copper Uses.

Refined copper is incorporated into wire and cable
products for use in the construction, electric utility, communications and transportation industries. Copper is also used in industrial equipment and machinery, consumer products and a variety of other electrical and electronic applications and is
also used to make brass. Copper substitutes include aluminum, plastics, stainless steel and fiber optics. Refined, or cathode, copper is also an internationally traded commodity.

Copper Supply.

A combination of current mine production and recycled scrap material make up the annual copper supply.

Copper Price.

The copper price is quoted on the London Metal Exchange in terms of dollars per metric ton
of high grade copper. The following table presents the dollar per pound equivalent of the annual high, low and average daily prices of high grade copper on the London Metal Exchange over the past ten years ($/pound):

Source: London
Metal Exchange

On February 14, 2013, the high grade copper closing price on the London Metal Exchange was $3.72 per pound.

We generally sell our copper based on the monthly average market price for the third month following the month in which the delivery to
the smelter takes place. We recognize revenue from a sale when the price is determinable, the concentrate has been loaded on a vessel, the title has been transferred and collection of the sales price is reasonably assured. For revenue recognition,
we use a provisional price based on the average prevailing market price during the two week period prior to completion of vessel loading. The copper concentrate is marked to market through earnings as an adjustment to revenue until final settlement.

Gold and Copper Processing Methods

Gold is extracted from naturally-oxidized ores by either milling or heap leaching, depending on the amount of gold contained in the ore, the amenability of the ore to treatment and related capital and operating
costs. Higher grade oxide ores are generally processed through mills, where the ore is ground into a fine powder and mixed with water into a slurry, which then passes through a carbon-in-leach circuit. Lower grade oxide ores are generally processed
using heap leaching. Heap leaching consists of stacking crushed or run-of-mine ore on impermeable pads, where a weak cyanide solution is applied to the surface of the heap to dissolve the gold. In both cases, the gold-bearing solution is then
collected and pumped to process facilities to remove the gold by collection on carbon or by zinc precipitation.

Gold contained in ores
that are not naturally-oxidized can be directly milled if the gold is liberated and amenable to cyanidation, generally known as free milling ores. Ores that are not amenable to



NEWMONT MINING CORPORATION

cyanidation, known as refractory ores, require more costly and complex processing techniques than oxide or free milling ore. Higher grade refractory ores are processed through either roasters or
autoclaves. Roasters heat finely ground ore to a high temperature, burn off the carbon and oxidize the sulfide minerals that prevent efficient leaching. Autoclaves use heat, oxygen and pressure to oxidize sulfide ores.

Some gold sulfide ores may be processed through a flotation plant or by bio-milling. In flotation, ore is finely ground, turned into slurry, then
placed in a tank known as a flotation cell. Chemicals are added to the slurry causing the gold-containing sulfides to attach to air bubbles and float to the top of the tank. The sulfides are removed from the cell and converted into a concentrate
that can then be processed in an autoclave or roaster to recover the gold. Bio-milling incorporates patented technology that involves inoculation of suitable crushed ore on a leach pad with naturally occurring bacteria strains, which oxidize the
sulfides over a period of time. The ore is then processed through an oxide mill.

At Batu Hijau, ore containing copper and gold is
crushed to a coarse size at the mine and then transported from the mine via conveyor to a concentrator, where it is finely ground and then treated by successive stages of flotation, resulting in a copper/gold concentrate containing approximately 20%
to 23% copper. The concentrate is dewatered and stored for loading onto ships for transport to smelters.

At Boddington and Phoenix, ore
containing copper and gold is crushed to a coarse size at the mine and then transported via conveyor to a process plant, where it is further crushed and then finely ground as a slurry. The ore is initially treated by successive stages of flotation
resulting in a copper/gold concentrate containing approximately 17% to 20% copper. Flotation concentrates are also processed via a gravity circuit to recover fine liberated gold and then dewatered and stored for loading onto ships for transport to
smelters. The flotation tailings has a residual gold content that is recovered in a carbon-in-leach circuit.

Hedging
Activities

Our strategy is to provide shareholders with leverage to gold and copper prices by selling our gold and copper at spot
market prices and consequently, we do not hedge our gold and copper sales. We continue to manage certain risks associated with commodity input costs and foreign currencies using the derivative market.

For additional information, see Hedging in Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk, and Note 17 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements.

Gold, Copper and Silver Reserves

At December 31, 2012, we had 99.2 million attributable ounces of proven and probable gold reserves. We added 5.5 million ounces to
proven and probable reserves, and depleted 6.2 million ounces during 2012. 2012 reserves were calculated at a gold price assumption of $1,400, A$1,400 or NZ$1,800 per ounce. A reconciliation of the changes in attributable proven and probable
gold reserves during the past three years is as follows:



NEWMONT MINING CORPORATION

A reconciliation of the changes in attributable proven and probable gold reserves for 2012 by
region is as follows:

(1)

Revisions and additions are due to reserve conversions, optimizations, model updates, metal price changes and updated operating costs and recoveries. The impact
of the change in gold price assumption on reserve additions was approximately 1.5 million, 3.3 million and 1.7 million ounces in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The gold price assumption was $1,400 per ounce in 2012, $1,200 per
ounce in 2011 and $950 per ounce in 2010.

In 2012, we completed a positive feasibility study on Merian and our interest increased from 50% to 80%. We also increased our interest in Regis Resources Ltd.
to 19.75% in 2012 from 16.85% in 2011. In 2010, we recognized our attributable interest in Regis Resources Ltd. for an attributable reserve of 0.3 million ounces.

(3)

In March 2010, our direct ownership interest in Batu Hijau decreased from 35.44% to 31.5% (economic interest decreased from 52.44% to 48.50%) because of the
partial divestiture required under the Contract of Work.

At December 31, 2012, we had 9,510 million
attributable pounds of proven and probable copper reserves. We added 60 million pounds to proven and probable reserves and depleted 270 million pounds during 2012. 2012 reserves were calculated at a copper price of $3.25 or A$3.25 per
pound. A reconciliation of the changes in attributable proven and probable copper reserves during the past three years is as follows:

Our exploration efforts are directed to the discovery of new mineralized material and converting it into proven and
probable reserves. We conduct near-mine exploration around our existing mines and greenfields exploration in other regions globally. Near-mine exploration can result in the discovery of additional deposits, which may receive the economic benefit of
existing operating, processing, and administrative infrastructures. In contrast, the discovery of mineralization through greenfields



NEWMONT MINING CORPORATION

exploration efforts will require capital investment to build a stand-alone operation. Our

Exploration

expense was $356, $350 and $218 in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively.

For additional information, see Item 2, Properties, Proven and Probable Reserves.

Licenses and Concessions

Other than operating licenses for our mining
and processing facilities, there are no third party patents, licenses or franchises material to our business. In many countries, however, we conduct our mining and exploration activities pursuant to concessions granted by, or under contract with,
the host government. These countries include, among others, Australia, Canada, Ghana, Indonesia, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru and Suriname. The concessions and contracts are subject to the political risks associated with foreign operations. See
Item 1A, Risk Factors, below. For a more detailed description of our Indonesian Contract of Work, see Item 
2, Properties, below.

Condition of Physical Assets and Insurance

Our business is capital intensive and requires ongoing capital investment for the replacement, modernization or expansion of equipment and
facilities. For more information, see Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Consolidated Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Liquidity and Capital Resources, below.

We maintain insurance policies against property loss and business interruption and insure against risks that are typical in the operation of our
business, in amounts that we believe to be reasonable. Such insurance, however, contains exclusions and limitations on coverage, particularly with respect to environmental liability and political risk. There can be no assurance that claims would be
paid under such insurance policies in connection with a particular event. See Item 1A, Risk Factors, below.

Environmental Matters

Our United States mining and exploration activities are subject to various federal and state laws and regulations governing the protection of the environment, including the Clean Air Act; the Clean Water Act; the
Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act; the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act; the Endangered Species Act; the Federal Land Policy and Management Act; the National Environmental Policy Act; the Resource
Conservation and Recovery Act; and related state laws. These laws and regulations are continually changing and are generally becoming more restrictive. Our activities outside the United States are also subject to various levels of governmental
regulations for the protection of the environment and, in some cases, those regulations can be as, or more, restrictive than those in the United States.

We conduct our operations so as to protect public health and the environment and believe our operations are in compliance with applicable laws and regulations in all material respects. Each operating mine has a
reclamation plan in place that meets all applicable legal and regulatory requirements. At December 31, 2012, $1,341 was accrued for reclamation costs relating to current or recently producing properties.

We are involved in several matters concerning environmental obligations associated with former, primarily historic, mining activities. Generally,
these matters concern developing and implementing remediation plans at the various sites. Based upon our best estimate of our liability for these matters, $198 was accrued at December 31, 2012 for such obligations associated with properties
previously owned or operated by us or our subsidiaries. The amounts accrued for these matters are reviewed periodically based upon facts and circumstances available at the time.

For a discussion of the most significant reclamation and remediation activities, see Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
Consolidated Financial Condition and Results of Operations, and Notes 4 and 30 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, below.
