ITEM 1.  BUSINESS

Overview

We are an independent oil and natural gas company currently focused on the acquisition, development, exploration and exploitation of unconventional, onshore oil and natural gas reserves in the Permian Basin in West Texas. This basin, which is one of the major producing basins in the United States, is characterized by an extensive production history, a favorable operating environment, mature infrastructure, long reserve life, multiple producing horizons, enhanced recovery potential and a large number of operators.

We began operations in December 2007 with our acquisition of 4,174 net acres with production at the time of acquisition of approximately 800 BOE/d from 34 gross (16.8 net) wells in the Permian Basin. Subsequently, we acquired approximately61,764additional net acres, which brought our total net acreage position in the Permian Basin to65,938net acres atDecember 31, 2013. We are the operator of approximately 99% of this acreage. In addition, we own mineral interests underlying approximately 15,000 gross (12,500 net) acres in Midland County, Texas, and we are the operator of approximately 50% of the acreage associated with these mineral interests. As ofDecember 31, 2013, we had drilled  270 gross (243 net) wells, and participated in an additional 22 gross (nine net) non-operated wells, in the Permian Basin. Of these 292 gross (252 net) wells, 277 were completed as producing wells and 15 were in various stages of completion. In 2013, we acquired working interests in 49 gross (40 net) producing wells. In the aggregate, as ofDecember 31, 2013, we held interests in 351 gross (306 net) producing wells in the Permian Basin. Nine gross (eight net) wells have been plugged and abandoned or converted to service wells. We also hold royalty interests in 81 wells in which we have no working interest. As discussed in more detail below under “–Pending Acquisition,” we recently entered into agreements to acquire approximately 6,450 gross (2,825 net) leasehold acres in Martin County, Texas.

Our activities are primarily focused on the Clearfork, Spraberry, Wolfcamp, Cline, Strawn and Atoka formations, which we refer to collectively as the Wolfberry play. The Wolfberry play is characterized by high oil and liquids rich natural gas, multiple vertical and horizontal target horizons, extensive production history, long-lived reserves and high drilling success rates. The Wolfberry play is a modification and extension of the Spraberry play, the majority of which is designated in the Spraberry Trend area field. According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, the Spraberry trend area ranked as the second largest oilfield in the United States, based on 2009 reserves.

As ofDecember 31, 2013, our estimated proved oil and natural gas reserves were63,586MBOE based on a reserve report prepared by Ryder Scott Company, L.P., or Ryder Scott, our independent reserve engineers. Of these reserves, approximately 45% are classified as proved developed producing, or PDP. Proved undeveloped, or PUD, reserves included in this estimate are from 206 vertical gross (151 net) well locations on 40-acre spacing and 43 gross (31 net) horizontal well locations. As ofDecember 31, 2013, these proved reserves were approximately 67% oil, 17% natural gas liquids and 16% natural gas.

Based on our evaluation of applicable geologic and engineering data as ofDecember 31, 2013, we had 848 identified potential vertical drilling locations on 40-acre spacing, an additional 1,128 identified potential vertical drilling locations based on 20-acre downspacing and we had also identified 1,430 potential horizontal drilling









locations in multiple horizons on our acreage. We intend to continue to grow our reserves and production through development drilling, exploitation and exploration activities on this multi-year project inventory of identified potential drilling locations and through additional acquisitions that meet our strategic and financial objectives, targeting oil-weighted reserves. The gross estimated ultimate recoveries, or EURs, from our future PUD vertical wells on 40-acre spacing, as estimated by Ryder Scott as ofDecember 31, 2013, range from 109 MBOE per well, consisting of 83 MBbls of oil and 156 MMcf of natural gas to 150 MBOE per well, consisting of 114 MBbls of oil and 214 MMcf of natural gas, with an average EUR per well of 128 MBOE, consisting of 94 MBbls of oil and 204 MMcf of natural gas. We also intend to continue to refine our drilling pattern and completion techniques in an effort to increase our average EUR per well from vertical wells drilled on 40-acre spacing. We currently anticipate a reduction of approximately 20% in our EURs from vertical wells drilled on 20-acre spacing.



Horizontal Wells. In 2012, we began testing the horizontal well potential of our acreage. Our first horizontal well was the Janey 16H in Upton County and was drilled in the Wolfcamp B interval. We are the operator of this well with a 100% working interest. Our second horizontal well was the Kemmer 4209H well in Midland County also drilled in the Wolfcamp B interval. It is a non-operated well in which we own a 47% working interest. Since the initial two wells, through December 31, 2013, we have drilled 41 horizontal wells as operator and participated in six wells as non-operator, including two in which we own only a minor wellbore interest. Of these 49 total horizontal wells (including our two initial wells), 44 are in the Wolfcamp B interval, two are in the Clearfork zone, two are in the Spraberry zone and one is in the Cline zone. Thirty-seven of the 49 wells were completed and producing as of December 31, 2013 and the other 12 are in various stages of completion.  The table below presents certain data regarding our producing horizontal wells (excluding the two non-operated wells in which we hold only a minor wellbore interest).

The production results from the wells in Midland and Upton Counties, along with geoscience and engineering data that we have gathered and analyzed, and published results by other operators, give us confidence that our acreage in Midland and Upton Counties is prospective in the Wolfcamp B interval. Additionally, we believe the results of our operated wells in Andrews County in the Wolfcamp B and the Clearfork intervals significantly reduces the hydrocarbon risks of our acreage in the vicinity of those wells.

Pending Acquisition

We have entered into definitive purchase agreements dated February 14, 2014 with unrelated third party sellers to acquire additional leasehold interests in Martin County, Texas, in the Permian Basin, for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $174.0 million, subject to certain adjustments. This transaction includes 6,450 gross (2,825 net) acres with a 43.8% working interest (75% net revenue interest) and net production of approximately 1,300 BOE/d (approximately 75% oil) during the first two weeks of February 2014 based on information reported by the operator, from 147 gross (63 net) producing vertical wells. Net proved reserves, based on our internal estimates as of December 31, 2013, were approximately 4,185 MBOE. Our estimate of proved reserves is based on our analysis of production data provided by the sellers, as well as available geologic and other data, and we may revise our estimates following ownership of these properties. We believe the acreage is prospective for horizontal drilling in the Wolfcamp B, Lower Spraberry, Middle Spraberry, Wolfcamp A, Cline and Clearfork horizons, and have identified 42 potential horizontal drilling locations in each of the Wolfcamp B and Lower Spraberry horizons based on 160 acre spacing per well (or six across a section) and an aggregate of 112 potential horizontal drilling









locations in the Middle Spraberry, Wolfcamp A, Cline and Clearfork intervals, based on 240 acre spacing per well (or four across a section). Under the terms of the existing joint operating agreement, we have made offers to the owners of the remaining 56.2% of the working interests to acquire their interests in the acreage.  If all such owners were to sell their interests to us, the aggregate purchase price would be approximately $397.2 million.  We intend to finance the acquisition, subject to market conditions and other factors, with a combination of borrowings under our revolving credit facility and the issuance of new debt and equity securities. We will become the operator of this acreage if and when two or more working interest holders with more than 50% of the working interest appoint us as the successor operator.  The acquisition is scheduled to close by the end of February 2014, however the transaction remains subject to completion of due diligence and satisfaction of other customary closing conditions, and there can be no assurance that the transaction will be completed.

Our Business Strategy

Our business strategy is to continue to profitably grow our business through the following:

•Grow production and reserves by developing our oil-rich resource base.We intend to actively drill and develop our acreage base in an effort to maximize its value and resource potential. Through the conversion of our undeveloped reserves to developed reserves, we will seek to increase our production, reserves and cash flow while generating favorable returns on invested capital. As ofDecember 31, 2013, we had 1,430 identified potential horizontal drilling locations, and 848 identified potential vertical drilling locations on our acreage in the Permian Basin based on 40-acre spacing and an additional 1,128 vertical locations based on 20-acre downspacing.  We were operating a one vertical rig drilling program as ofDecember 31, 2013, as we increase our focus on horizontal wells.



•

Focus on increasing hydrocarbon recovery through horizontal drilling and increased well density.

We believe there are opportunities to target various intervals in the Wolfberry play with horizontal wells. Our initial horizontal focus has been on the Wolfcamp B interval in Midland and Upton Counties. Our first two horizontal wells were completed in 2012 and had lateral lengths of less than 4,000 feet. Subsequently, we have drilled 41 horizontal wells as operator and have participated in six additional horizontal wells as a non-operator, including two in which we own only a minor wellbore interest. Of these 49 total horizontal wells (including our two initial wells), 44 are in the Wolfcamp B interval, two are in the Clearfork zone, two are in the Spraberry zone, and one is in the Cline zone. These wells have lateral lengths ranging from approximately 4,000 feet to 10,300 feet. In the future, we expect that our optimal average lateral lengths will be in the range of 6,000 feet to 7,500 feet, although the actual length will vary depending on the layout of our acreage and other factors. We expect that longer lateral lengths will result in higher per well recoveries and lower development costs per BOE. During the year ended

December 31, 2013

, we were able to drill our horizontal wells with approximately 7,500 foot lateral lengths to total depth, or TD, in an average of 18 days and we drilled an approximately 10,000 foot lateral well in 17 days. Our future horizontal drilling program is designed to further capture the upside potential that may exist on our properties. We also believe our horizontal drilling program may significantly increase our recoveries per section as compared to drilling vertical wells alone. Horizontal drilling may also be economical in areas where vertical drilling is currently not economical or logistically viable. In addition, we believe increased well density opportunities may exist across our acreage base. We closely monitor industry trends with respect to higher well density, which could increase the recovery factor per section and enhance returns since infrastructure is typically in place. We were using four horizontal drilling rigs as of

December 31, 2013

, and currently intend to add a fifth horizontal rig in the second quarter of 2014.

•Leverage our experience operating in the Permian Basin.Our executive team, which has an average of over 25 years of industry experience per person and significant experience in the Permian Basin, intends to continue to seek ways to maximize hydrocarbon recovery by refining and enhancing our drilling and completion techniques. Our focus on efficient drilling and completion techniques is an important part of the continuous drilling program we have planned for our significant inventory of identified potential drilling locations. We believe that the experience of our executive team in deviated and horizontal drilling and completions should help reduce the execution risk normally associated with these complex well paths. In addition, our completion techniques are continually evolving as we evaluate hydraulic fracturing practices that may potentially increase recovery and reduce completion costs. Our executive team regularly evaluates our operating results against those of other operators in the area in an effort to benchmark our performance against the best performing operators and evaluate and adopt best practices.

•Enhance returns through our low cost development strategy of resource conversion, capital allocation and continued improvements in operational and cost efficiencies.In the current commodity price environment, our oil and liquids rich asset base provides attractive returns. Our acreage position in the Wolfberry play is generally in contiguous blocks which allows us to develop this acreage efficiently









with a “manufacturing” strategy that takes advantage of economies of scale and uses centralized production and fluid handling facilities. We are the operator of approximately 99% of our acreage. This operational control allows us to more efficiently manage the pace of development activities and the gathering and marketing of our production and control operating costs and technical applications, including horizontal development. Our average 86% working interest in our acreage allows us to realize the majority of the benefits of these activities and cost efficiencies.

•Pursue strategic acquisitions with exceptional resource potential.We have a proven history of acquiring leasehold positions in the Permian Basin that have substantial oil-weighted resource potential and can achieve attractive returns on invested capital. Our executive team, with its extensive experience in the Permian Basin, has what we believe is a competitive advantage in identifying acquisition targets and a proven ability to evaluate resource potential. We regularly review acquisition opportunities and intend to pursue acquisitions that meet our strategic and financial targets. During the year endedDecember 31, 2013, we acquired mineral interests underlying approximately 15,000 gross (12,500 net) acres in Midland County, Texas and acquired approximately 13,900 additional gross (11,150 net) leasehold acres in Martin County, Texas and Dawson County, Texas. We have entered into agreements dated February 14, 2014 to acquire 6,450 gross (2,825 net) acres in Martin County, Texas. See “–Pending Acquisition” above for more information regarding the acquisition. We intend to continue to pursue acquisitions that meet our strategic and financial targets.

•Maintain financial flexibility.We seek to maintain a conservative financial position. Upon completion of our initial public offering in October 2012, we used a portion of the net proceeds from the offering to repay the entire balance outstanding under our revolving credit facility. On November 1, 2013, our credit agreement was amended and restated, resulting in an increase to the borrowing base under our revolving credit facility to $225.0 million, of which $215.0 million was available for borrowing as ofDecember 31, 2013.

Our Strengths

We believe that the following strengths will help us achieve our business goals:

•Oil rich resource base in one of North America’s leading resource plays.All of our leasehold acreage is located in one of the most prolific oil plays in North America, the Permian Basin in West Texas. The majority of our current properties are well positioned in the core of the Wolfberry play. We believe that our historical vertical development success will be complemented with horizontal drilling locations that could ultimately translate into an increased recovery factor on a per section basis. Our production for the year endedDecember 31, 2013was approximately 76% oil, 13% natural gas liquids and 11% natural gas. As ofDecember 31, 2013, our estimated net proved reserves were comprised of approximately 67% oil and 17% natural gas liquids, which allows us to benefit from the currently more favorable pricing of oil and natural gas liquids as compared to natural gas.

and Wolfcamp B.  Ryder Scott has estimated gross EURs of 638 MBOE for our Wolfcamp B wells in Andrews and Midland Counties, which constitute 51% of our remaining PUD horizontal wells, and 604 MBOE for our eastern Upton County Wolfcamp B wells, which constitute 19% of our remaining PUD horizontal wells, in each case based on 7,500 foot lateral lengths. In addition, we have approximately 182 square miles of proprietary 3-D seismic data covering our acreage. This data facilitates the evaluation of our existing drilling inventory and provides insight into future development activity, including horizontal drilling opportunities and strategic leasehold acquisitions.

•Experienced, incentivized and proven management team.Our executive team has an average of over 25 years of industry experience per person, most of which is focused on resource play development. This team has a proven track record of executing on multi-rig development drilling programs and extensive experience in the Permian Basin. In addition, our executive team has significant experience with both drilling and completing horizontal wells as well as horizontal well reservoir and geologic expertise, which will be of strategic importance as we expand our horizontal drilling activity. Prior to joining us, our Chief Executive Officer held management positions at Apache Corporation, Laredo Petroleum Holdings, Inc. and Burlington Resources.

•Favorable and stable operating environment.We have focused our drilling and development operations in the Permian Basin, one of the oldest hydrocarbon basins in the United States, with a long and well-established production history and developed infrastructure. With approximately 380,000 wells drilled in the Permian Basin since the 1940s, we believe that the geological and regulatory environment is more stable and predictable, and that we are faced with less operational risks, in the Permian Basin as compared to emerging hydrocarbon basins.

•High degree of operational control.We are the operator of approximately 99% of our Permian Basin acreage. This operating control allows us to better execute on our strategies of enhancing returns through operational and cost efficiencies and increasing ultimate hydrocarbon recovery by seeking to continually improve our drilling techniques, completion methodologies and reservoir evaluation processes. Additionally, as the operator of substantially all of our acreage, we retain the ability to adjust our capital expenditure program based on commodity price outlooks. This operating control also enables us to obtain data needed for efficient exploration of horizontal prospects.

•Financial flexibility to fund expansion.We have a conservative balance sheet. We will seek to maintain financial flexibility to allow us to actively develop our drilling, exploitation and exploration activities in the Wolfberry play and maximize the present value of our oil-weighted resource potential. As ofDecember 31, 2013, we had $10.0 million of borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility and $215.0 million of available borrowing capacity.
