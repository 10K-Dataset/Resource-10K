ITEM 1.  BUSINESS AND PROPERTIES

Overview

We are an independent oil and natural gas company currently focused on the acquisition, development, exploration and exploitation of unconventional, onshore oil and natural gas reserves in the Permian Basin in West Texas. This basin, which is one of the major producing basins in the United States, is characterized by an extensive production history, a favorable operating environment, mature infrastructure, long reserve life, multiple producing horizons, enhanced recovery potential and a large number of operators.

We began operations in December 2007 with our acquisition of 4,174 net acres with production at the time of acquisition of approximately 800 BOE/d from 34 gross (16.8 net) wells in the Permian Basin. Subsequently, we acquired approximately 81,195 additional net acres, which brought our total net acreage position in the Permian Basin to approximately 85,369 net acres atDecember 31, 2014. In addition, we, through our subsidiary Viper Energy Partners L.P., or Viper, own mineral interests underlying approximately 24,528 gross (15,948 net) acres primarily in Midland County, Texas in the Permian Basin. Approximately 43% of these net acres are operated by us. On June 23, 2014, Viper completed its initial public offering of 5,750,000 common units representing limited partner interests and, on September 19, 2014 Viper completed a follow-on underwritten public offering of 3,500,000 common units. The common units sold to the public represent, in the aggregate, an approximate 12% limited partner interest in Viper. We own Viper Energy Partners GP LLC, the general partner of Viper, which we refer to as the general partner, and the remaining approximate 88% limited partner interest in Viper.

Our activities are primarily focused on the Clearfork, Spraberry, Wolfcamp, Cline, Strawn and Atoka formations, which we refer to collectively as the Wolfberry play. The Wolfberry play is characterized by high oil and liquids rich natural gas, multiple vertical and horizontal target horizons, extensive production history, long-lived reserves and high drilling success rates. The Wolfberry play is a modification and extension of the Spraberry play, the majority of which is designated in the Spraberry Trend Area field. According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, the Spraberry Trend Area ranked as the second largest oilfield in the United States, based on 2009 reserves.

As ofDecember 31, 2014, our estimated proved oil and natural gas reserves were 112,832 MBOE (which includes estimated reserves of 18,510 MBOE attributable to the mineral interests owned by Viper), based on reserve reports prepared by Ryder Scott Company, L.P., or Ryder Scott, our independent reserve engineers. Of these reserves, approximately 57% are classified as proved developed producing, or PDP. Proved undeveloped, or PUD, reserves included in this estimate are from 79 gross (64 net) horizontal well locations and 87 gross (73 net) vertical well locations on 40-acre spacing in which we have a working interest and ten horizontal wells and 25 vertical wells in which we own only a mineral interest through our subsidiary, Viper. As ofDecember 31, 2014, our estimated proved reserves were approximately 67% oil, 16% natural gas liquids and 17% natural gas.

Based on our evaluation of applicable geologic and engineering data as ofDecember 31, 2014, we had 2,185 gross (1,646 net) identified potential horizontal drilling locations in multiple horizons on our acreage as well as 786 gross (746 net) identified potential vertical drilling locations on 40-acre spacing and an additional 1,084 gross (996 net) identified potential vertical drilling locations based on 20-acre downspacing. We intend to continue to grow our reserves and production through development drilling, exploitation and exploration activities on this multi-year project inventory of identified potential drilling locations and through additional acquisitions that meet our strategic and financial objectives, targeting oil-weighted reserves.

Our Business Strategy

Our business strategy is to continue to profitably grow our business through the following:

•Grow production and reserves by developing our oil-rich resource base.We intend to actively drill and develop our acreage base in an effort to maximize its value and resource potential. Through the conversion of our undeveloped reserves to developed reserves, we will seek to increase our production, reserves and cash flow while generating favorable returns on invested capital. As ofDecember 31, 2014, we had 2,185 gross (1,646 net) identified potential horizontal drilling locations, and 786 gross (746 net) identified potential vertical drilling locations on our acreage in the Permian Basin based on 40-acre spacing and an










additional 1,084 gross (996 net) vertical locations based on 20-acre downspacing.  As ofDecember 31, 2014, we were operating five horizontal rigs and one vertical rig.We intend to release two horizontal rigs and one vertical rig in February 2015 and continue with three horizontal rigs, two of which will operate in Spanish Trail.





•

Focus on increasing hydrocarbon recovery through horizontal drilling and increased well density.

We have targeted various intervals in the Wolfberry play through horizontal drilling and believe that there are opportunities to target additional intervals in the Wolfberry play with horizontal wells. Our initial horizontal focus has been on the Wolfcamp B interval

,

but we have begun to derisk additional intervals such as the Lower Spraberry.



Our first two horizontal wells were completed in 2012 and had lateral lengths of less than 4,000 feet. As of December 31, 2014, we had drilled 124 horizontal wells as operator and had participated in nine additional horizontal wells as a non-operator, including two in which we own only a minor wellbore interest. Of these 133 total horizontal wells, 100 had been completed and were on production. Of the 100 horizontal wells on production, 78 are in the Wolfcamp B interval, three are in the Clearfork zone, 16 are in the Spraberry zone, and three are in the Cline zone. These wells have lateral lengths ranging from approximately 4,000 feet to 10,300 feet. In the future, we expect that our optimal average lateral lengths will be in the range of 6,000 feet to 7,500 feet, although the actual length will vary depending on the layout of our acreage and other factors. We expect that longer lateral lengths will continue to result in higher per well recoveries and lower development costs per BOE. During the year ended

December 31, 2014

, we were able to drill our horizontal wells with approximately 7,500 foot lateral lengths to total depth, or TD, in an average of 16 days and we drilled an approximately 10,000 foot lateral well in 17 days. Our horizontal drilling program is designed to further capture the upside potential that may exist on our properties. We also believe our horizontal drilling program has significantly increased our recoveries per section as compared to drilling vertical wells alone. Horizontal drilling may also be economical in areas where vertical drilling is currently not economical or logistically viable. In addition, we believe increased well density opportunities may exist across our acreage base. We closely monitor industry trends with respect to higher well density, which could increase the recovery factor per section and enhance returns since infrastructure is typically in place.



•Leverage our experience operating in the Permian Basin.Our executive team, which has an average of over 25 years of industry experience per person and significant experience in the Permian Basin, intends to continue to seek ways to maximize hydrocarbon recovery by refining and enhancing our drilling and completion techniques. Our focus on efficient drilling and completion techniques is an important part of the continuous drilling program we have planned for our significant inventory of identified potential drilling locations. We believe that the experience of our executive team in deviated and horizontal drilling and completions should help reduce the execution risk normally associated with these complex well paths. In addition, our completion techniques are continually evolving as we evaluate hydraulic fracturing practices that may potentially increase recovery and reduce completion costs. Our executive team regularly evaluates our operating results against those of other operators in the area in an effort to benchmark our performance against the best performing operators and evaluate and adopt best practices.



•Enhance returns through our low cost development strategy of resource conversion, capital allocation and continued improvements in operational and cost efficiencies.Our acreage position in the Wolfberry play is generally in contiguous blocks which allows us to develop this acreage efficiently with a “manufacturing” strategy that takes advantage of economies of scale and uses centralized production and fluid handling facilities. We are the operator of approximately 95% of our acreage. This operational control allows us to manage more efficiently the pace of development activities and the gathering and marketing of our production and control operating costs and technical applications, including horizontal development. Our average 80% working interest in our acreage allows us to realize the majority of the benefits of these activities and cost efficiencies.



•Pursue strategic acquisitions with exceptional resource potential.We have a proven history of acquiring leasehold positions in the Permian Basin that have substantial oil-weighted resource potential and can achieve attractive returns on invested capital. Our executive team, with its extensive experience in the Permian Basin, has what we believe is a competitive advantage in identifying acquisition targets and a proven ability to evaluate resource potential. We regularly review acquisition opportunities and intend to pursue acquisitions that meet our strategic and financial targets. During the year endedDecember 31, 2014, we acquired approximately 28,654 gross (20,216) net leasehold acres primarily in Glasscock, Martin and Midland counties. We intend to continue to pursue acquisitions that meet our strategic and financial targets.












•Maintain financial flexibility.We seek to maintain a conservative financial position. On November 13, 2014, we entered into a second amendment to our amended and restated  credit agreement, resulting in an increase to the borrowing base under our revolving credit facility to $750.0 million. We elected a commitment amount of $500.0 million, of which$276.5 millionwas available for borrowing as ofDecember 31, 2014. As ofDecember 31, 2014, Viper had no outstanding borrowings, and $110.0 million available for borrowing, under its revolving credit facility.



Our Strengths

We believe that the following strengths will help us achieve our business goals:



•Oil rich resource base in one of North America’s leading resource plays.All of our leasehold acreage is located in one of the most prolific oil plays in North America, the Permian Basin in West Texas. The majority of our current properties are well positioned in the core of the Wolfberry play. We believe that our horizontal drilling has resulted in an increased recovery factor on a per section basis as compared to our historical vertical development. Our production for the year endedDecember 31, 2014was approximately76%oil,14%natural gas liquids and10%natural gas. As ofDecember 31, 2014, our estimated net proved reserves were comprised of approximately 67% oil and 16% natural gas liquids, which allows us to benefit from the currently more favorable pricing of oil and natural gas liquids as compared to natural gas.





•

Multi-year drilling inventory in one of North America’s leading oil resource plays.

We have identified a multi-year inventory of potential drilling locations for our oil-weighted reserves that we believe provides attractive growth and return opportunities. As of

December 31, 2014

•Experienced, incentivized and proven management team.Our executive team has an average of over 25 years of industry experience per person, most of which is focused on resource play development. This team has a proven track record of executing on multi-rig development drilling programs and extensive










experience in the Permian Basin. In addition, our executive team has significant experience with both drilling and completing horizontal wells as well as horizontal well reservoir and geologic expertise, which will be of strategic importance as we expand our horizontal drilling activity. Prior to joining us, our Chief Executive Officer held management positions at Apache Corporation, Laredo Petroleum Holdings, Inc. and Burlington Resources.

•Favorable and stable operating environment.We have focused our drilling and development operations in the Permian Basin, one of the oldest hydrocarbon basins in the United States, with a long and well-established production history and developed infrastructure. We believe that the geological and regulatory environment of the Permian Basin is more stable and predictable, and that we are faced with less operational risks, in the Permian Basin as compared to emerging hydrocarbon basins.

•High degree of operational control.We are the operator of approximately 95% of our Permian Basin acreage. This operating control allows us to better execute on our strategies of enhancing returns through operational and cost efficiencies and increasing ultimate hydrocarbon recovery by seeking to continually improve our drilling techniques, completion methodologies and reservoir evaluation processes. Additionally, as the operator of substantially all of our acreage, we retain the ability to adjust our capital expenditure program based on commodity price outlooks. This operating control also enables us to obtain data needed for efficient exploration of horizontal prospects.

•Financial flexibility to fund expansion.We have a conservative balance sheet. We will seek to maintain financial flexibility to allow us to actively develop our drilling, exploitation and exploration activities in the Wolfberry play and maximize the present value of our oil-weighted resource potential. As ofDecember 31, 2014, we had$223.5 millionof borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility and$276.5 millionof available borrowing capacity. As ofDecember 31, 2014, Viper had no outstanding borrowings, and $110.0 million available for borrowing, under its revolving credit facility.
