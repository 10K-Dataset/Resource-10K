Management Philosophy



Our businesses are committed to operational excellence and to being market leaders as measured by market share, customer service, innovation, profitability, and return on invested capital. Our operating structure of four business segments and two platforms allows for focused acquisition activity, accelerates opportunities to identify and capture operating synergies, including global sourcing and supply chain integration, and advances the development of our executive talent. Our segment and executive management set strategic direction, initiatives and goals, provide oversight, allocate and manage capital, are responsible for major acquisitions, and provide other services. We foster an operating culture with high ethical standards, trust, respect, and open communication, to allow individual growth and operational effectiveness.



In addition, we are committed to creating value for our customers, employees, and shareholders through sustainable business practices that protect the environment and developing products that help our customers meet their sustainability goals. Our companies are increasing their focus on efficient energy usage, greenhouse gas reduction, and waste management as they strive to meet the global environmental needs of today and tomorrow.











Company Goals



We are committed to driving shareholder return through three key objectives. First, we are committed to achieving annual organic sales growth over the next three years (2013through2015) of 4% to 6%, complemented by acquisition growth of 3% to 5% over the same period. Secondly, we continue to focus on segment margin expansion through productivity initiatives, including supply chain activities, strategic pricing, and portfolio shaping. We are targeting segment margins of approximately 19% by 2015, representing an increase of roughly 200 basis points  over our 2012 segment margins. Lastly, we are committed to generating free cash flow as a percentage of sales of approximately 10% through disciplined capital allocation, strong performance, productivity improvements, and active working capital management. We support these goals through (1) alignment of management compensation with financial objectives, (2) well-defined and actively managed merger and acquisition processes, and (3) talent development programs.



Business Strategy



To achieve our goals, we are focused on execution of the following three key business strategies:



Positioning ourselves for growth



We have aligned our business segments to focus on key-end markets that are well-positioned for future growth. In particular, our businesses are well-positioned to capitalize on growth trends in the areas of global energy demand, sustainability, consumer product safety, communications, and emerging economies. For instance, our Communication Technologies segment is positioned to capitalize on growth in hand-held communications (handsets), medical technology, and aerospace/defense, with its complement of micro audio components and communication components serving those markets. Our Energy segment is driven by a growing demand for innovative extraction technologies. The growing demand from emerging economies, plus expanding exploration activity around the globe will provide significant opportunities for this segment. Our Engineered Systems segment combines its engineering technology, unique product advantages, and applications expertise to address market needs and requirements including sustainability, consumer product safety, and growth in emerging economies, while our Printing & Identification segment is responding to the growing requirements for consumer product safety and traceability technologies by providing integrated printing, coding, and identification solutions with a global reach, in the growing markets of fast moving consumer goods and industrial applications.



Capturing the benefits of common ownership



We are committed to operational excellence, and have implemented various productivity initiatives, such as supply chain management, lean manufacturing, and facility consolidations to maximize our efficiency, coupled with workplace safety initiatives to help ensure the health and welfare of our employees. We foster the sharing of best practices throughout the organization. To ensure success, our businesses place strong emphasis on continual quality improvement and new product development to better serve customers and expand into new product and geographic markets. We have also developed regional support centers and shared manufacturing centers in China, Brazil, and India.  Further, we continue to make significant investments in talent development, recognizing that the growth and development of our employees are essential for our continued success.



Disciplined capital allocation



Our businesses generate annual free cash flow of approximately 10% of revenue. We are focused on the most efficient allocation of our capital to maximize investment returns. To do this, we grow and support our existing businesses, with annual investment in capital spending approximating 3.5% of revenue with a focus on internal projects to expand markets, develop products, and boost productivity. We continue to evaluate our portfolio for strategic fit and intend to make additional acquisitions focused on our key growth spaces: consumer electronics, energy, product ID, refrigeration and food equipment, and fluid solutions. We consistently provide shareholder returns by paying dividends, which have increased annually over each of the last 57 years. We will also continue to repurchase our shares per our previously announced share repurchase programs.











Portfolio Development



Acquisitions



Our acquisition program has two key elements. First, we seek to acquire value creating add-on businesses that enhance our existing businesses either through their global reach and customers, or by broadening their product mix. Second, in the right circumstances, we will strategically pursue larger, stand-alone businesses that have the potential to either complement our existing businesses or allow us to pursue innovative technologies within our key growth spaces. Over the past three years (


–


), we have spent over

$2.6 billion

to purchase


businesses that strategically fit within our business model. This included the largest acquisition in our history, that of Sound Solutions in July of 2011 for net purchase consideration of approximately $790 million. By enhancing the product offerings serving the high growth handset market, the acquisition of Sound Solutions has enabled our Communication Technologies segment to be a global leader in audio components serving this market.  In the fourth quarter of  2012, we spent approximately $600 million to acquire Anthony International, a leading manufacturer of specialty glass, commercial glass refrigerator and freezer doors, lighting systems, and display equipment. The acquisition of Anthony expands our portfolio of industry-leading technology in the refrigeration space and provides access to new geographies and new markets, most notably the convenience store market.  Recent significant acquisitions have also included Harbison-Fischer, which we acquired for approximately $400 million at the beginning of 2011 in order to enhance our artificial lift portfolio within our Energy segment, Maag Pump Systems, a European acquisition for our Fluid Solutions platform, which we acquired in the first quarter of 2012 for approximately $266 million, and Production Control Services, acquired in the second quarter of 2012 for consideration totaling $220 million, which added to our artificial lift technology in our Energy segment.



For more details regarding acquisitions completed over the past two years, see Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Our future growth depends in large part on finding and acquiring successful businesses, as a substantial number of our current businesses operate in relatively mature markets. While we expect to generate annual organic growth of 4% - 5% over a long-term business cycle absent extraordinary economic conditions, sustained organic growth at these levels for individual businesses is difficult to achieve consistently each year. Our success is also dependent on the ability to successfully integrate our acquired businesses within our existing structure. To track post-merger integration and accountability, we utilize an internal tool kit and defined processes to help ensure synergies are realized and value is created, as had been planned when the acquisition was made.



Dispositions



We continually review our portfolio to evaluate whether our businesses continue to be essential contributors to our long-term strategy. Occasionally, we may also make an opportunistic sale of one of our businesses based on specific market conditions and strategic considerations. Accordingly, in an effort to reduce our exposure to cyclical markets and focus on our higher margin growth spaces, during the past three years (2010–2012) we have soldfourbusinesses for aggregate consideration of approximately$517 million.  Over the same period, disposals of a few minor non-core divisions of our businesses generated additional proceeds of approximately$5 million.  Additionally, in the fourth quarter of  2012, we initiated the sale of two businesses in our Printing & Identification segment that serve the electronic assembly and test markets to reduce our exposure to these cyclical markets.  The financial position and results of operations for these businesses have been presented as discontinued operations for all periods presented. For more details, see Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.



Business Segments



As noted previously, we currently operate through four business segments that are aligned with the key end-markets they serve and comprise our operating and reportable segments: Communication Technologies, Energy, Engineered Systems, and Printing & Identification. For financial information about our segments and geographic areas, see Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.

The majority of the refrigeration/food systems and machinery that are manufactured or serviced by the Refrigeration & Industrial platform are used by the supermarket industry, “big-box” retail and convenience stores, the commercial/industrial refrigeration industry, institutional and commercial foodservice and food production markets, and beverage can-making industries. The commercial foodservice cooking equipment products serve their markets worldwide through a network of dealers, distributors, national chain accounts, manufacturer representatives, and a direct sales force with the primary market being North America.



•Other industrial– We also serve the vehicle service, industrial automation, and waste and recycling markets.  Our businesses serving the vehicle service markets provide a wide range of products and services that are utilized in vehicle services, maintenance, washing, repair, and modification. Vehicle lifts and collision equipment are sold through equipment distributors and directly to a wide variety of markets, including independent service and repair shops, collision repair shops, national chains and franchised service facilities, new vehicle dealers, governments, and directly to consumers via the Internet. The businesses also produce 4WD and AWD powertrain systems and accessories for off-road vehicles, which are sold to OEMs and through extensive dealer networks primarily in North America. These other industrial manufacturing operations are located primarily in North and South America, Asia, and Europe.



The businesses in the industrial automation market provide a wide range of modular automation components including manual clamps, power clamps, rotary and linear mechanical indexers, conveyors, pick and place units, glove ports and manipulators, as well as end-of-arm robotic grippers, slides, and end effectors. These products serve a very broad market including food processing, packaging, paper processing, medical, electronic, automotive, nuclear, and general industrial products.

Printing & Identification



Our Printing & Identification segment is a worldwide supplier of precision marking & coding,  printing, dispensing, soldering and coating equipment, and related consumables and services. The segment serves two broad global end-markets: fast moving consumer goods and industrial.



•Fast Moving Consumer Goods (FMCG)– Our businesses serving this market primarily design and manufacture marking & coding products used for printing variable information (such as date codes and serial numbers) on food, beverage, consumer goods, and pharmaceutical products, capitalizing on expanding food and product safety requirements and growth in emerging markets.



•Industrial– Our products used by the industrial market are primarily marking & coding, bar code & portable printers, and fluid dispensing related products serving a number of industrial end markets including aerospace, cable, military, material packaging, industrial assembly, and medical devices capitalizing on growing industrial-related manufacturing in emerging markets. Additional products include broad line marking solutions leveraged for secondary packaging, such as cartons and pallets for use in warehouse logistics operations and bar code and portable printers used where on-demand labels/receipts are required.



In the fourth quarter of 2012, we reclassified to discontinued operations our businesses serving the electronic assembly and test markets, as we intend to divest these businesses in 2013.



Printing & Identification’s products are manufactured primarily in the United States, France, China, and India, and are sold throughout the world directly and through a network of distributors.



Raw Materials



We use a wide variety of raw materials, primarily metals and semi-processed or finished components, which are generally available from a number of sources. As a result, shortages or the loss of any single supplier have not had, and are not likely to have, a material impact on operating profits. While the required raw materials are generally available, commodity pricing has trended upward over the past few years, particularly for various grades of steel, copper, aluminum, select other commodities, and rare earth metals. Although some cost increases may be recovered through increased prices to customers, our operating results are exposed to such fluctuations. We attempt to control such costs through fixed-price contracts with suppliers and various other programs, such as our global supply chain activities.



Research and Development



Our businesses are encouraged to develop new products as well as to upgrade and improve existing products to satisfy customer needs, expand revenue opportunities domestically and internationally, maintain or extend competitive advantages, improve product reliability, and reduce production costs. During2012, we spent$189,844for research and development, including qualified engineering costs.  In2011and2010, research and development spending totaled$175,532and$159,338, respectively.











Our Communication Technologies and Printing & Identification segments expend significant effort in research and development because the rate of product development by their customers is often quite high.  Our businesses that develop product identification and printing equipment and specialty electronic components for the consumer electronics, medical technology, and datacom/telecom markets believe that their customers expect a continuing rate of product innovation, performance improvement, and reduced costs. The result has been that product life cycles in these markets generally average less than five years with meaningful sales price reductions over that time period.



Our other segments contain many businesses that are also involved in important product improvement initiatives. These businesses also concentrate on working closely with customers on specific applications, expanding product lines and market applications, and continuously improving manufacturing processes. Most of these businesses experience a much more moderate rate of change in their markets and products than is generally experienced by the Communication Technologies and Printing & Identification segments.



Intellectual Property and Intangible Assets



Our businesses own many patents, trademarks, licenses, and other forms of intellectual property, which have been acquired over a number of years and, to the extent relevant, expire at various times over a number of years. A large portion of our businesses’ intellectual property consists of patents, unpatented technology, and proprietary information constituting trade secrets that we seek to protect in various ways, including confidentiality agreements with employees and suppliers where appropriate. In addition, a significant portion of our intangible assets relate to customer relationships. While our intellectual property and customer relationships are important to our success, the loss or expiration of any of these rights or relationships, or any group of related rights or relationships, is not likely to materially affect our results on a consolidated basis. We believe that our commitment to continuous engineering improvements, new product development, and improved manufacturing techniques, as well as strong sales, marketing, and service efforts, are significant to our general leadership positions in the niche markets we serve.



Seasonality



In general, our businesses, while not strongly seasonal, tend to have stronger revenue in the second and third quarters, particularly those serving the consumer electronics, transportation, construction, waste and recycling, petroleum, commercial refrigeration, and food service markets. Our businesses serving the major equipment markets, such as power generation, chemical, and processing industries, have longer lead times geared to seasonal, commercial, or consumer demands, and tend to delay or accelerate product ordering and delivery to coincide with those market trends that tend to moderate the aforementioned seasonality patterns.



Customers



We serve thousands of customers, no one of which accounted for more than 10% of our consolidated revenue in2012.  Similarly, within each of our four segments, no customer accounted for more than 10% of any individual segment’s revenue in2012, except in our Communication Technologies segment where there is some revenue concentration with OEM customers in the consumer electronics market.  Given our diversity of served markets, customer concentrations are quite varied. Businesses supplying the waste and recycling, agricultural, defense, energy, automotive, commercial refrigeration, handset, and hearing aid industries tend to deal with a few large customers that are significant within those industries. This also tends to be true for businesses supplying the power generation, aerospace, and chemical industries. In the other markets served, there is usually a much lower concentration of customers, particularly where the companies provide a substantial number of products and services applicable to a broad range of end-use applications.



Certain of our businesses, particularly within the Communication Technologies segment, serve the military, space, aerospace, commercial, and telecom infrastructure markets. Their customers include some of the largest operators in these markets. In addition, many of the OEM customers within the Communication Technologies segment outsource their manufacturing to Electronic Manufacturing Services (“EMS”) companies. Other customers include global cell phone and hearing aid manufacturers and many of the largest global EMS companies, particularly in China.



Backlog



Backlog is not a significant indicator of long-term performance, as our products generally have relatively short order-to-delivery periods. It is more relevant to our businesses that produce larger and more sophisticated machines or have long-term government









contracts, primarily in the aerospace and defense markets of our Communication Technologies segment. Our total backlog relating to our continuing operations as ofDecember 31, 2012and2011was$1.5 billionand$1.4 billion, respectively.



Competition



Our competitive environment is complex because of the wide diversity of our products manufactured and the markets served. In general, most of our businesses are market leaders that compete with only a few companies, and the key competitive factors are customer service, product quality, price, and innovation.  However, as we become increasingly global, we are exposed to more competition. Certain businesses in the Communication Technologies and Printing & Identification segments compete globally against a variety of companies, primarily operating in Europe and East Asia.  A summary of our key competitors by end market within each our segments follows:

International



Consistent with our strategic focus on positioning our businesses for growth, we continue to increase our expansion into international markets, particularly in developing economies in South America, Asia, and Eastern Europe.



Most of our non-U.S. subsidiaries and affiliates are currently based in France, Germany, the Netherlands, Sweden, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and, with increasing emphasis, Canada, China, Malaysia, India, Mexico, Brazil, and Eastern Europe.



The following table shows annual revenue derived from customers outside the U.S. as a percentage of total annual revenue for each of the last three years, by segment and in total:

Our percentage of revenue derived from customers outside of the U.S. declined slightly in 2012 as compared to 2011 as a result of economic weakness in Europe and slower growth in Asia, which impacted certain of our businesses.













Our international operations are subject to certain risks, such as price and exchange rate fluctuations and non-U.S. governmental restrictions, which are discussed further in “Item 1A. Risk Factors.”  For additional details regarding our non-U.S. revenue and the geographic allocation of the assets of our continuing operations, see Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.



Environmental Matters



Our operations are governed by a variety of international, national, state, and local environmental laws. We are committed to continued compliance and believe our operations generally are in substantial compliance with these laws. In a few instances, particular plants and businesses have been the subject of administrative and legal proceedings with governmental agencies or private parties relating to the discharge or potential discharge of regulated substances. Where necessary, these matters have been addressed with specific consent orders to achieve compliance.



In 2010, we developed and implemented a process to conduct an inventory of greenhouse gas emissions.  Since then, we have evaluated our climate change risks and opportunities and have developed an energy and climate change strategy that includes clearly defined goals and objectives, along with prioritized programs and projects for achieving energy use and greenhouse gas emissions reductions. We have committed to reducing our overall energy and greenhouse gas intensity indexed to net revenue by 20% from 2010 to 2020.  We also participated as a respondent in the 2012 Carbon Disclosure Project.



All of our segments are investigating the energy efficiencies related to their operations and the use of their products and services by customers. In some instances, our businesses may be able to help customers reduce some of their energy needs. Increased demand for energy-efficient products, based on a variety of drivers (including, but not limited to, reduction of greenhouse gas emissions) could result in increased sales for a number of our businesses.



There have been no material effects upon our earnings and competitive position resulting from compliance with laws or regulations enacted or adopted relating to the protection of the environment. We are aware of a number of existing or upcoming regulatory initiatives intended to reduce emissions in geographies where our manufacturing and warehouse/distribution facilities are located and have evaluated the potential impact of these regulations on our businesses. We anticipate that direct impacts from regulatory actions will not be significant in the short- to medium-term. We expect the regulatory impacts associated with climate change regulation would be primarily indirect and would result in “pass through” costs from energy suppliers, suppliers of raw materials, and other services related to our operations.



Employees



We had approximately35,000employees in continuing operations as ofDecember 31, 2012, which was an increase of13%from the prior year end.  The increase is primarily the result of recent acquisitions, slightly offset by headcount reduction  programs in certain businesses.



Iran Related Activities



Pursuant to Section 13(r) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, we are required to provide disclosure if, during 2012, we or any of our affiliates have engaged in transactions or dealings with the government of Iran that have not been specifically authorized by a U.S. federal department or agency.



During the disclosure period, Automatik Plastics Machinery GmbH ("Automatik"), a German affiliate of Maag Pump Systems, which we acquired on March 13, 2012, exported from Germany European-origin equipment used in the processing of polystyrene pellets and PET chip to two entities in Iran, Tabriz Petrochemical (“Tabriz”) and Shahid Tondgoyan Petrochemical (“Shahid Tondgoyan”), which we understand are owned or controlled by the Government of Iran.  All of the exports except one were made prior to August 10, 2012, the date of enactment of the Iran Threat Reduction and Syria Human Rights Act of 2012 (“ITRA”).   Automatik made two exports to Tabriz on February 24, 2012 and May 8, 2012, with total revenue and net profit values of  €51,550 and €14,759, respectively.  Automatik made three exports to Shahid Tondgoyan on March 6, 2012, July 19, 2012, and August 8, 2012 with total revenue and net profit values of €516,831 and €162,588, respectively.  The only export made after the enactment of the ITRA was made to Shahid Tondgoyan on October 4, 2012, with a revenue and net profit value of €20,388 and €7,411, respectively. This last export was made prior to the October 9, 2012 date of the Presidential Executive Order that made it a









violation of U.S. law for owned or controlled foreign subsidiaries after October 9, 2012 to knowingly engage in transactions with the Government of Iran or any person subject to the jurisdiction of the Government of Iran.  For most of these exports, Automatik received official written confirmation from the German Government that it did not require a license under German law and for the others it received oral confirmation no license was required.  Automatik also received a payment in November 2012 for a prior order that was not shipped and will not be shipped in the future.  Given the SEC guidance that issuers should disclose all activities, including those taking place prior to ITRA's enactment on August 10, 2012, we are including all exports by Automatik Germany to government entities in Iran during 2012.  Management has instructed all of the Company's non-U.S. affiliates not to engage in any trade transactions with Iran.
