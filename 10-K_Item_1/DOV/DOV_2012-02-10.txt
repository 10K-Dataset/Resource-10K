Overview



Dover Corporation is a diversified, multinational corporation that manufactures a broad range of specialized products and components and also offers related services and consumables.  Dover provides its customers with outstanding products and services that reflect the company’s commitment to operational excellence, innovation and market leadership.Unless the context indicates otherwise, references herein to “Dover,” “the Company,” and such words as “we,” “us,” and “our” include Dover Corporation and its subsidiaries.  Dover was incorporated in 1947 in the State of Delaware and became a publicly traded company in 1955.  Dover is headquartered in Downers Grove, Illinois and currently employs approximately 34,000 people worldwide.



In the fourth quarter of 2011, we reorganized into four new business segments that are aligned with the key end-markets they serve:  Communication Technologies, Energy, Engineered Systems and Printing & Identification.  We believe the segment reorganization provides better alignment and focus around our end-markets, allows for better leverage of our executive leadership talent and expertise, helps improve the sharing and leveraging of resources within and between the four segments, enhances execution of business-specific strategies, and facilitates internal and external benchmarking against companies serving similar markets.



Our Communication Technologies segment is engaged in the design and manufacture of innovative products and components in the communications, life sciences, aerospace/industrial, defense, and telecommunication/other markets.  Our Energy segment provides highly-engineered solutions for the safe and efficient extraction and handling of oil and gas in the drilling, production and downstream markets.  Our Engineered Systems segment is comprised of two platforms, Fluid Solutions and Refrigeration & Industrial, which are industry leaders in the fluids systems, refrigeration and food equipment, and certain industrial markets.  Our Printing & Identification segment provides integrated printing, coding, and testing solutions for the consumer goods, food, pharmaceutical, industrial, electronics and alternative energy markets.



The following table shows the percentage of total annual revenue generated by each of our four segments over the last three years:

Management Philosophy



Our businesses are committed to operational excellence, and to being market leaders as measured by market share, customer service, innovation, profitability and return on invested capital.  Our operating structure of four business segments and two platforms allows for focused acquisition activity, accelerates opportunities to identify and capture operating synergies, including global sourcing and supply chain integration, and advances the development of our executive talent.  Our segment and executive management set strategic direction, initiatives and goals, provide oversight, allocate and manage capital, are responsible for major acquisitions, and provide other services.  We foster an operating culture with high ethical standards, trust, respect and open communication, to allow individual growth and operational effectiveness.



In addition, we are committed to creating value for our customers, employees and shareholders through sustainable business practices that protect the environment and developing products that help our customers meet their sustainability goals. Our companies are increasing their focus on efficient energy usage, greenhouse gas reduction and waste management as they strive to meet the global environmental needs of today and tomorrow.





Company Goals



We are committed to driving shareholder return through three key objectives.  First, we are committed to achieving annual organic sales growth over the next three years (2012 through 2014) of 7% to 9%, complemented by acquisition growth of 3% to 5% over the same periods.  Secondly, we continue to focus on segment margin expansion through productivity initiatives, including supply chain activities, strategic pricing and portfolio shaping.  We are targeting segment margins of approximately 19% by 2014, representing an increase of roughly 200 basis points over our 2011 segment margins.  Lastly, we are committed to generating free cash flow as a percentage of sales in excess of 10% through disciplined capital allocation, strong performance, productivity improvements and active working capital management.  We support these goals through (1) alignment of management compensation with financial objectives, (2) well-defined and actively managed merger and acquisition processes, and (3) talent development programs.



Business Strategy



To achieve our goals, we are focused on execution of the following three key business strategies:



Positioning ourselves for growth



We have aligned our business segments to focus on key-end markets that are well-positioned for future growth.  In particular, our businesses are well-positioned to capitalize on growth trends in the areas of global energy demand, sustainability, consumer product safety, communications and emerging economies.  For instance, our Communication Technologies segment is positioned to capitalize on growth in handheld communications (handsets), life sciences and aerospace, with its complement of micro audio components and communication components serving those markets.  Our Energy segment is driven by a growing demand for innovative extraction technologies. The growing emerging economies, plus expanding exploration activity around the globe will provide significant opportunities for this segment.  Our Engineered Systems segment combines its engineering technology, unique product advantages, and applications expertise to address market needs and requirements including sustainability, consumer product safety and growth in emerging economies, while our Printing & Identification segment is responding to the growing requirements for consumer product safety and renewable energy technologies by providing integrated printing, coding and identification solutions with a global reach, in the growing markets of fast moving consumer goods, industrial, and electronics, including alternative energy.



Capturing the benefits of common ownership



We are committed to operational excellence, and have implemented various productivity initiatives, such as supply chain management, lean manufacturing, and facility consolidations to maximize our efficiency, coupled with workplace safety initiatives to help ensure the health and welfare of our employees.  We foster the sharing of best practices throughout the organization.  To ensure success, our businesses place strong emphasis on continual quality improvement and new product development to better serve customers and expand into new product and geographic markets.  We have also developed regional support centers and shared manufacturing centers in China, Brazil and India. We also continue to make significant investments in talent development, recognizing that the growth and development of our employees are key to our continued success.



Disciplined capital allocation



Our businesses generate annual free cash flow of approximately 10% of revenue.  We are focused on the most efficient allocation of our capital to maximize investment returns.  To do this, we grow and support our existing businesses, with annual investment in capital spending approximating 3% of revenue with a focus on internal projects to expand markets, develop products and boost productivity.  We continue to evaluate our portfolio for strategic fit and intend to make additional acquisitions focused on our key growth spaces: communication components, energy, product ID, refrigeration and food equipment, and fluid solutions.  We consistently provide shareholder returns by paying dividends, which have increased annually over each of the last 56 years.  We will also continue to repurchase our shares principally to cover market dilution.



Portfolio Development



Acquisitions



Our acquisition program has two key elements.  First, we seek to acquire value creating add-on businesses that enhance our existing businesses either through their global reach and customer mix, or by broadening their product mix.  Second, in the right circumstances, we will strategically pursue larger, stand-alone businesses that have the potential to either complement our existing businesses or allow us to pursue innovative technologies within our key growth spaces.  Over the past three years (2009 – 2011), we have spent over $1.7 billion to purchase 21 businesses that strategically fit within our business model.  This included the largest acquisition in our history, that of Sound Solutions in July of 2011 for approximately $800 million. By enhancing the product offerings serving the high growth handset market, the acquisition of Sound Solutions has enabled our Communication Technologies segment to be a global leader in audio components serving this market.  At the beginning of 2011, in order to build out our artificial lift portfolio within our Energy segment, we spent approximately $400 million to acquire Harbison-Fischer, a designer and manufacturer of down-hole rod pumps and related products used in artificial lift applications around the world.





For more details regarding acquisitions completed over the past two years, see Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.  Our future growth depends in large part on finding and acquiring successful businesses, as a substantial number of our current businesses operate in relatively mature markets.  While we expect to generate annual organic growth of 4% - 5% over a business cycle absent extraordinary economic conditions, sustained organic growth at these levels for individual businesses is difficult to achieve consistently each year.  Our success is also dependent on the ability to successfully integrate our acquired businesses within our existing structure. To track post-merger integration and accountability, we utilize an internal tool kit and defined processes to ensure synergies are realized and value is created.



Dispositions

We continually review our portfolio to evaluate whether our businesses continue to be essential contributors to our long-term growth strategy.  Occasionally, we may also make an opportunistic sale of one of our businesses based on specific market conditions and strategic considerations.  Accordingly, in an effort to focus on our higher margin growth spaces, during the past three years (2009 - 2011) we have sold four businesses for aggregate consideration ofapproximately $517million. The financial position and results of operations for these businesses have been presented as discontinued operations.  For more details, see Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.Over the same period, disposals of a few minor non-core divisions of our businesses generated additional proceeds of approximately $8 million.

Business Segments



As noted previously, in the fourth quarter of 2011, we reorganized our businesses into four new business segments that are aligned with the key end-markets they serve and comprise our operating and reportable segments:  Communication Technologies, Energy, Engineered Systems and Printing & Identification.  For financial information about our segments and geographic areas, see Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.  All information set forth within this Annual Report has been recast to reflect the new segmentation.

Printing & Identification



Our Printing & Identification segment is a worldwide supplier of precision marking & coding, dispensing, printing, soldering, coating, inspection and testing equipment and related consumables and services.  The segment serves three broad global end-markets: fast moving consumer goods, industrial, and electronics.



·Fast Moving Consumer Goods (FMCG)– Our businesses serving this market primarily design and manufacture marking & coding products used for printing variable information (such as date codes and serial numbers) on food, beverage, consumer goods, and pharmaceutical products, capitalizing on expanding food and product safety requirements and growth in emerging markets.



·Industrial– Our products used by the industrial market are primarily marking & coding, bar code & portable printers, and fluid dispensing related products serving a number of industrial end markets including aerospace, cable, military, material packaging, industrial assembly, and medical devices capitalizing on growing industrial-related manufacturing in emerging markets.  Additional products include broad line marking solutions leveraged for secondary packaging, such as cartons and pallets for use in warehouse logistics operations, and bar code printers and portable printers used where on demand labels/receipts are required.



·Electronics –Our businesses serving the electronics market primarily design and manufacture high-speed precision material deposition machines and other related tools used in the assembly process for printed circuit boards, solar cells and other specialty electronic applications as well as precision manual soldering, de-soldering and other hand tools.  The test equipment products include machines, test fixtures and related products used in testing “bare” and “loaded” electronic circuit boards and semiconductors.



Printing & Identification’s products are manufactured primarily in the United States, France, China, Malaysia, and Germany, and are sold throughout the world directly and through a network of distributors.



Raw Materials



We use a wide variety of raw materials, primarily metals and semi-processed or finished components, which are generally available from a number of sources. As a result, shortages or the loss of any single supplier have not had, and are not likely to have, a material impact on operating profits. While the required raw materials are generally available, commodity pricing has trended upward over the past few years, particularly for various grades of steel, copper, aluminum, select other commodities, and rare earth metals. Although some cost increases may be recovered through increased prices to customers, our operating results are exposed to such fluctuations. We attempt to control such costs through fixed-price contracts with suppliers and various other programs, such as our global supply chain activities.



Research and Development



Our businesses are encouraged to develop new products as well as to upgrade and improve existing products to satisfy customer needs, expand revenue opportunities domestically and internationally, maintain or extend competitive advantages, improve product reliability and reduce production costs.  During 2011, we spent $197.0 million for research and development, including qualified engineering costs. In 2010 and 2009, research and development spending totaled $186.7 million and $172.1 million, respectively.



Our Communication Technologies and Printing & Identification segments expend significant effort in research and development because the rate of product development by their customers is often quite high. Our businesses that develop product identification and printing equipment and specialty electronic components for the consumer goods, handset, life sciences, datacom and telecom commercial markets believe that their customers expect a continuing rate of product innovation, performance improvement and reduced costs. The result has been that product life cycles in these markets generally average less than five years with meaningful sales price reductions over that time period.



Our other segments contain many businesses that are also involved in important product improvement initiatives. These businesses also concentrate on working closely with customers on specific applications, expanding product lines and market applications, and continuously improving manufacturing processes. Most of these businesses experience a much more moderate rate of change in their markets and products than is generally experienced by the Communication Technologies and Printing & Identification segments.



Intellectual Property and Intangible Assets



Our businesses own many patents, trademarks, licenses and other forms of intellectual property, which have been acquired over a number of years and, to the extent relevant, expire at various times over a number of years.  A large portion of our businesses’ intellectual property consists of patents, unpatented technology and proprietary information constituting trade secrets that we seek to protect in various ways, including confidentiality agreements with employees and suppliers where appropriate. In addition, a significant portion of our intangible assets relate to customer relationships. While our intellectual property and customer relationships are important to our success, the loss or expiration of any of these rights or relationships, or any group of related rights or relationships, is not likely to materially affect our results on a consolidated basis. We believe that our commitment to continuous engineering improvements, new product development and improved manufacturing techniques, as well as strong sales, marketing and service efforts, are significant to our general leadership positions in the niche markets we serve.





Seasonality



In general, our businesses, while not strongly seasonal, tend to have stronger revenue in the second and third quarters, particularly those serving the consumer electronics, transportation, construction, waste and recycling, petroleum, commercial refrigeration and food service markets.  Our businesses serving the major equipment markets, such as power generation, chemical and processing industries, have long lead times geared to seasonal, commercial or consumer demands, and tend to delay or accelerate product ordering and delivery to coincide with those market trends, which tends to moderate the aforementioned seasonality patterns.



Customers



We serve thousands of customers, no one of which accounted for more than 10% of our consolidated revenue in 2011. Similarly, within each of our four segments, no customer accounted for more than 10% of any individual segment’s revenue in 2011.



Given our diversity of served markets, customer concentrations are quite varied.  Businesses supplying the waste and recycling, agricultural, defense, energy, automotive, commercial refrigeration, handset and hearing aid industries tend to deal with a few large customers that are significant within those industries. This also tends to be true for businesses supplying the power generation, aerospace and chemical industries. In the other markets served, there is usually a much lower concentration of customers, particularly where the companies provide a substantial number of products and services applicable to a broad range of end-use applications.



Certain of our businesses, particularly within the Communication Technologies segment, serve the military, space, aerospace, commercial and datacom/telecom infrastructure markets. Their customers include some of the largest operators in these markets. In addition, many of the OEM customers within the Communication Technologies segment outsource their manufacturing to Electronic Manufacturing Services (“EMS”) companies.  Other customers include global cell phone and hearing aid manufacturers, many of the largest global EMS companies, particularly in China, and major printed circuit board and semiconductor manufacturers.



Backlog



Backlog is generally not a significant indicator of long-term performance, as most of our products have relatively short order-to-delivery periods. It is more relevant to our businesses that produce larger and more sophisticated machines or have long-term government contracts, primarily in the aerospace and industrial markets of our Communication Technologies segment.  Our total backlog as of December 31, 2011 and 2010 was $1,446.5 million and $1,262.5 million, respectively.



Competition



Our competitive environment is complex because of the wide diversity of our products manufactured and the markets served. In general, most of our businesses are market leaders that compete with only a few companies, and the key competitive factors are customer service, product quality, price and innovation.  However, as we become increasingly global, we are exposed to  more competition. Certain businesses in the Communication Technologies and Printing & Identification segments compete globally against a variety of companies, primarily operating in Europe and East Asia.



International



Consistent with our strategic focus on positioning our businesses for growth, we continue to increase our expansion into international markets, particularly in developing economies in South America, Asia and Eastern Europe.



Most of our non-U.S. subsidiaries and affiliates are currently based in France, Germany, the Netherlands, Sweden, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and, with increasing emphasis, China, Malaysia, India, Mexico, Brazil and Eastern Europe.



The following table shows annual revenue derived from customers outside the U.S. as a percentage of total annual revenue for each of the last three years, by segment and in total:

Our international operations are subject to certain risks, such as price and exchange rate fluctuations and non-U.S. governmental restrictions, which are discussed further in “Item 1A. Risk Factors.”



For additional details regarding our non-U.S. revenue and the geographic allocation of the assets of our continuing operations, see Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.



Environmental Matters



Our operations are governed by a variety of international, national, state and local environmental laws.  We are committed to continued compliance and believe our operations generally are in substantial compliance with these laws. In a few instances, particular plants and businesses have been the subject of administrative and legal proceedings with governmental agencies or private parties relating to the discharge or potential discharge of regulated substances. Where necessary, these matters have been addressed with specific consent orders to achieve compliance.



In 2010, we developed and implemented a process to conduct an inventory of greenhouse gas emissions.  In 2011, we evaluated our climate change risks and opportunities and developed an energy and climate change strategy that includes clearly defined goals and objectives, along with prioritized programs and projects for achieving energy use and greenhouse gas emissions reductions.  We have committed to reducing our overall energy and greenhouse gas intensity indexed to net revenue by 20% from 2010 to 2020.  We also participated in the 2011 Carbon Disclosure Project as a respondent.

All of our segments are investigating the energy efficiencies related to their operations and the use of their products and services by customers.  In some instances, our businesses may be able to help customers reduce some of their energy needs. Increased demand for energy-efficient products, based on a variety of drivers (including, but not limited to, reduction of greenhouse gas emissions) could result in increased sales for a number of our businesses.

There have been no material effects upon our earnings and competitive position resulting from compliance with laws or regulations enacted or adopted relating to the protection of the environment.  We are  aware of a number of existing or upcoming regulatory initiatives intended to reduce emissions in geographies where our manufacturing and warehouse/distribution facilities are located and have evaluated the potential impact of these regulations on our businesses.  We anticipate that direct impacts from regulatory actions will not be significant in the short- to medium-term.  We expect the regulatory impacts associated with climate change regulation would be primarily indirect and would result in “pass through” costs from energy suppliers, suppliers of raw materials and other services related to our operations.



Employees



We had approximately 34,000 employees in continuing operations as of December 31, 2011, which was an increase of 14% from the prior year end.  The increase reflects the impact of recent acquisitions as well as additional headcount necessary to support the volume growth in 2011.
