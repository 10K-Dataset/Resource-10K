We offer apparel, accessories, and personal care products for men, women, and children under the Gap, Banana Republic, Old Navy, Piperlime, Athleta, and Intermix brands. Our global portfolio of distinct brands across multiple channels and geographies gives us a competitive advantage in the global retail marketplace. We operate in the specialty, outlet, online, and franchise channels.

Gap Inc. has Company-operated stores in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, France, Ireland, Japan, Italy, China, Hong Kong, and beginning in March 2014, Taiwan. We also have franchise agreements with unaffiliated franchisees to operate Gap, Banana Republic, and Old Navy stores throughout Asia, Australia, Eastern Europe, Latin America, the Middle East, and Africa. Under these agreements, third parties operate, or will operate, stores that sell apparel and related products under our brand names. We have grown our franchise store base to375stores in 41 countries as of the end offiscal 2013. Our products are also available to customers online through Company-owned websites and through the use of third parties that provide logistics and fulfillment services. Most of the products sold under our brand names are designed by us and manufactured by independent sources. We also sell products that are designed and manufactured by branded third parties, especially at our Piperlime and Intermix brands.

Gap.Founded in 1969, Gap is our flagship brand and remains one of the most iconic apparel brands in the marketplace today. The brand stands for casual, American style and offers classic apparel at accessible price points to help customers express their individuality.

Gap entered the children’s apparel market in 1986 with GapKids and in 1989 with babyGap. Maternity apparel was later added to the collection. In 1998, we launched GapBody, which offers loungewear, sleepwear, intimates, and active apparel for women. Today, Gap products are available globally in our specialty and outlet stores, online, and in franchise stores.

Banana Republic.Banana Republic is a global apparel and accessories brand that focuses on delivering modern, covetable workplace style for both men and women.

Acquired in 1983 with two stores, Banana Republic has evolved to offer collections that include apparel, handbags, shoes, jewelry, personal care products, and eyewear for men and women at higher price points than Gap. Today, customers can purchase Banana Republic products globally in our specialty and outlet stores, online, and in franchise stores.

Merchandise Vendors

We purchase private label and non-private label merchandise from over 1,000 vendors. Our vendors have factories in about 40 countries. No vendor accounted for more than 5 percent of the dollar amount of our totalfiscal 2013purchases. Of our merchandise purchased duringfiscal 2013, approximately 98 percent of purchases, by dollar value, were from factories outside the United States, while the remaining 2 percent of all purchases were from domestic factories. Approximately 28 percent of our purchases, by dollar value, were from factories in China. Product cost increases or events causing disruption of imports from China or other foreign countries, including the imposition of additional import restrictions or vendors potentially failing due to political, financial, or regulatory issues, could have an adverse effect on our operations. Substantially all of our foreign purchases of merchandise are negotiated and paid for in U.S. dollars. Also see the sections entitled “Risk Factors—Our business, including our costs and supply chain, is subject to risks associated with global sourcing and manufacturing," "Risk Factors—Risks associated with importing merchandise from foreign countries, including failure of our vendors to adhere to our Code of Vendor Conduct, could harm our business,” and “Risk Factors—Trade matters may disrupt our supply chain” in Item 1A of this Form 10-K.



Seasonal Business

Our business follows a seasonal pattern, with sales peaking over a total of about eight weeks during the end-of-year holiday period.



Brand Building

Our ability to develop and evolve our existing brands is a key to our success. We believe our distinct brands are among our most important assets. With the exception of Piperlime and Intermix, virtually all aspects of brand development, from product design and distribution to marketing, merchandising and shopping environments, are controlled by Gap Inc. employees. With respect to Piperlime and Intermix, we control all aspects of brand development except for product design related to third-party products. We continue to invest in our brands and enhance the customer experience through significant investments in marketing, enhancement of our online shopping sites, international expansion, remodeling of existing stores, and continued focus on customer service.

Franchising

We have franchise agreements with unaffiliated franchisees to operate Gap, Banana Republic, and Old Navy stores in a number of countries throughout Asia, Australia, Eastern Europe, Latin America, the Middle East, and Africa. Under these agreements, third parties operate, or will operate, stores that sell apparel and related products under our brand names. We continue to increase the number of countries in which we enter into these types of arrangements as part of our strategy to expand internationally.

Inventory

The nature of the retail business requires us to carry a significant amount of inventory, especially prior to peak holiday selling season when we, along with other retailers, generally build up inventory levels. We maintain a large part of our inventory in distribution centers. We review our inventory levels in order to identify slow-moving merchandise and broken assortments (items no longer in stock in a sufficient range of sizes or colors) and we primarily use promotions and markdowns to clear merchandise. Also see the sections entitled “Risk Factors—We must successfully gauge apparel trends and changing consumer preferences to succeed” and "Risk Factors—If we are unable to manage our inventory effectively, our gross margins could be adversely affected" in Item 1A of this Form 10-K.



Competitors

The global apparel retail industry is highly competitive. We compete with local, national, and global apparel retailers. We are also faced with competition in European, Japanese, Chinese, and Canadian markets from established regional and national chains, and our franchisees face significant competition in the markets in which they operate. Also see the section entitled “Risk Factors—Our business is highly competitive” in Item 1A of this Form 10-K.



Employees

As ofFebruary 1, 2014, we had a workforce of approximately137,000employees, which includes a combination of part-time and full-time employees. We also hire seasonal employees, primarily during the peak end-of-year holiday period.

To remain competitive in the apparel retail industry, we must attract, develop, and retain skilled employees in our design, merchandising, marketing, and other functions. Competition for such personnel is intense. Our success is dependent to a significant degree on the continued contributions of key employees. Also see the section entitled “Risk Factors—The failure to attract and retain key personnel could have an adverse impact on our results of operations” in Item 1A of this Form 10-K.
