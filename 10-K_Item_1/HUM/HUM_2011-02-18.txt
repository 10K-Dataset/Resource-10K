ITEM 1.BUSINESS

General

Headquartered in Louisville, Kentucky, Humana Inc. and its subsidiaries, referred to throughout this document as “we,”
“us,” “our,” the “Company” or “Humana,” is one of the nation’s largest publicly traded health and supplemental benefits companies, based on our 2010 revenues of approximately $33.9 billion. We provide
full-service benefits and wellness solutions, offering a wide array of health, pharmacy and supplemental benefit products for employer groups, government benefit programs, and individuals, as well as primary and workplace care through our medical
centers and worksite medical facilities. As of December 31, 2010, we had approximately 10.2 million members in our medical benefit plans, as well as approximately 7.1 million members in our specialty products. During 2010, 76% of our
premiums and administrative services fees were derived from contracts with the federal government, including 17% related to our Medicare Advantage contracts in Florida with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, and 11% related to
our military services contracts. Under our Medicare Advantage CMS contracts in Florida, we provide health insurance coverage to approximately 378,700 members as of December 31, 2010.

Humana Inc. was organized as a Delaware corporation in 1964. Our principal executive offices are located at 500 West Main Street,
Louisville, Kentucky 40202, the telephone number at that address is (502) 580-1000, and our website address is www.humana.com. We have made available free of charge through the Investor Relations section of our web site our annual reports on
Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, proxy statements, and, if applicable, amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act, as soon as reasonably practicable after
we electronically file such material with, or furnish it to, the Securities and Exchange Commission.

This Annual Report on
Form 10-K contains both historical and forward-looking information. See Item 1A.—Risk Factors for a description of a number of factors that may adversely affect our results or business.

Health Insurance Reform

In March 2010, the President signed into law The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and The Health Care and Education
Reconciliation Act of 2010 (which we collectively refer to as the Health Insurance Reform Legislation) which enact significant reforms to various aspects of the U.S. health insurance industry. There are many significant provisions of the legislation
that will require additional guidance and clarification in







the form of regulations and interpretations in order to fully understand the impacts of the legislation on our overall business, which we expect to occur over the next several years.

Certain significant provisions of the Health Insurance Reform Legislation include, among others, mandated coverage requirements, rebates
to policyholders based on minimum benefit ratios, adjustments to Medicare Advantage premiums, the establishment of state-based exchanges, and an annual insurance industry premium-based assessment. Implementation dates of the Health Insurance Reform
Legislation vary from as early as six months from the date of enactment, or September 30, 2010, to as late as 2018. The Health Insurance Reform Legislation is discussed more fully beginning on page 40.

Business Segments

We
manage our business with two segments: Government and Commercial. The Government segment consists of beneficiaries of government benefit programs, and includes three lines of business: Medicare, Military, and Medicaid. The Commercial segment
consists of members enrolled in our medical and specialty products marketed to employer groups and individuals. When identifying our segments, we aggregated products with similar economic characteristics. These characteristics include the nature of
customer groups as well as pricing, benefits, and underwriting requirements. These segment groupings are consistent with information used by our Chief Executive Officer.

The results of each segment are measured by income before income taxes. We allocate all selling, general and administrative expenses, investment and other revenue, interest expense, and goodwill, but no
other assets or liabilities, to our segments. Members served by our two segments often utilize the same provider networks, in some instances enabling us to obtain more favorable contract terms with providers. Our segments also share indirect
overhead costs and assets. As a result, the profitability of each segment is interdependent.







Our Products

As more fully described in the products discussion that follows, we provide health insurance benefits under health maintenance organization, or HMO, Private Fee-For-Service, or PFFS, and preferred
provider organization, or PPO, plans. On January 1, 2011, most of our members enrolled in PFFS plans transitioned to networked-based PPO type plans. In addition, we provide other benefits with our specialty products including dental, vision,
and other supplementary benefits. The following table presents our segment membership at December 31, 2010, and premiums and administrative services only, or ASO, fees by product for the year ended December 31, 2010:

Our Government Segment Products

Medicare

We have participated in the Medicare program for private
health plans for over 20 years and have established a national presence, offering at least one type of Medicare plan in all 50 states. The resulting growing membership base provides us with greater ability to expand our network of PPO and HMO
providers. We employ strategies including health assessments and clinical guidance programs such as lifestyle and fitness programs for seniors to guide Medicare beneficiaries in making cost-effective decisions with respect to their health care,
including cost savings that occur from making positive behavior changes that result in living healthier.

Medicare is a
federal program that provides persons age 65 and over and some disabled persons under the age of 65 certain hospital and medical insurance benefits. CMS, an agency of the United States Department of







Health and Human Services, administers the Medicare program. Hospitalization benefits are provided under Part A, without the payment of any premium, for up to 90 days per incident of illness plus
a lifetime reserve aggregating 60 days. Eligible beneficiaries are required to pay an annually adjusted premium to the federal government to be eligible for physician care and other services under Part B. Beneficiaries eligible for Part A and Part B
coverage under original Medicare are still required to pay out-of-pocket deductibles and coinsurance. Throughout this document this program is referred to as original Medicare. As an alternative to original Medicare, in geographic areas where a
managed care organization has contracted with CMS pursuant to the Medicare Advantage program, Medicare beneficiaries may choose to receive benefits from a Medicare Advantage organization under Medicare Part C. Pursuant to Medicare Part C, Medicare
Advantage organizations contract with CMS to offer Medicare Advantage plans to provide benefits at least comparable to those offered under original Medicare. Our Medicare Advantage plans are discussed more fully below. Prescription drug benefits are
provided under Part D.

Medicare Advantage Products

Our Medicare HMO and PPO plans, which cover
Medicare-eligible individuals residing in certain counties, may eliminate or reduce coinsurance or the level of deductibles on many other medical services while seeking care from participating in-network providers or in emergency situations. Except
in emergency situations, HMO plans provide no out-of-network benefits. PPO plans carry an out-of network benefit that is subject to higher member cost-sharing. In most cases, these beneficiaries are required to pay a monthly premium to the HMO or
PPO plan in addition to the monthly Part B premium they are required to pay the Medicare program.

Our Medicare PFFS plans
generally have no preferred network. Individuals in these plans pay us a monthly premium to receive typical Medicare Advantage benefits along with the freedom to choose any health care provider that accepts individuals at rates equivalent to
original Medicare payment rates. On January 1, 2011, most of our members enrolled in PFFS plans transitioned to networked-based PPO type products due to a requirement that Medicare Advantage organizations establish adequate provider networks,
except in geographic areas that CMS determines have fewer than two network-based Medicare Advantage plans.

CMS uses monthly
rates per person for each county to determine the fixed monthly payments per member to pay to health benefit plans. These rates are adjusted under CMS’s risk-adjustment model which uses health status indicators, or risk scores, to improve the
accuracy of payment. The risk-adjustment model, which CMS implemented pursuant to the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 (BBA) and the Benefits and Improvement Protection Act of 2000 (BIPA), generally pays more for members with predictably higher costs and
uses principal hospital inpatient diagnoses as well as diagnosis data from ambulatory treatment settings (hospital outpatient department and physician visits). CMS transitioned to this risk-based payment model while the old payment model based on







demographic data including gender, age, and disability status was phased out. The phase-in of risk adjusted payment was completed in 2007. Under the risk-adjustment methodology, all health
benefit organizations must collect and submit the necessary diagnosis code information to CMS within prescribed deadlines.

At
December 31, 2010, we provided health insurance coverage under CMS contracts to approximately 1,762,000 Medicare Advantage members for which we received premium and ASO fees revenues of approximately $19.3 billion, or 58.1%, of our total
premiums and ASO fees for the year ended December 31, 2010. Under our Medicare Advantage contracts with CMS in Florida, we provided health insurance coverage to approximately 378,700 members. These contracts accounted for premium revenues of
approximately $5.5 billion, which represented approximately 28.5% of our Medicare Advantage premium revenues, or 16.5% of our total premiums and ASO fees for the year ended December 31, 2010.

Our HMO, PPO, and PFFS products covered under Medicare Advantage contracts with CMS are renewed generally for a one-year term each
December 31 unless CMS notifies us of its decision not to renew by August 1 of the calendar year in which the contract would end, or we notify CMS of our decision not to renew by the first Monday in June of the calendar year in which the
contract would end. All material contracts between Humana and CMS relating to our Medicare Advantage business have been renewed for 2011.

Medicare Stand-Alone Prescription Drug Products

Medicare stand-alone PDP premium revenues were
approximately $2.3 billion, or 7.0% of our total premiums and ASO fees for the year ended December 31, 2010.

Medicaid Product

Medicaid is a federal program that is state-operated to facilitate the delivery of health care services primarily to low-income residents. Each electing state develops, through a state-specific regulatory
agency, a Medicaid managed care initiative that must be approved by CMS. CMS requires that Medicaid managed care plans meet federal standards and cost no more than the amount that would have been spent on a comparable fee-for-service basis. States
currently either use a formal proposal process in which they review many bidders before selecting one or award individual contracts to qualified bidders who apply for entry to the program. In either case, the contractual relationship with a state
generally is for a one-year period. Under these contracts, we receive a fixed monthly payment from a government agency for which we are required to provide health insurance coverage to enrolled members. Due to the increased emphasis on state health
care reform and budgetary constraints, more states are utilizing a managed care product in their Medicaid programs.







Our Medicaid business, which accounted for premium revenues of approximately $723.6 million,
or 2.2%, of our total premiums and ASO fees for the year ended December 31, 2010, consists of contracts in Puerto Rico and Florida, with the vast majority in Puerto Rico.

Military Services

Under our TRICARE South Region contract with the
United States Department of Defense, or DoD, we provide health insurance coverage to the dependents of active duty military personnel and to retired military personnel and their dependents. Currently, three health benefit options are available to
TRICARE beneficiaries. In addition to a traditional indemnity option, participants may enroll in a HMO-like plan with a point-of-service option or take advantage of reduced copayments by using a network of preferred providers, similar to a PPO.

As required under the current contract, the target underwritten health care cost and underwriting fee amounts for Option Period IX will be negotiated separately. Any variance from the target health care
cost is shared with the federal government. Accordingly, events and circumstances not contemplated in the negotiated target health care cost amount may have a material adverse effect on us. These changes may include an increase or reduction in the
number of persons enrolled or eligible to enroll due to the federal government’s decision to increase or decrease U.S. military deployments.







For the year ended December 31, 2010, military services premium revenues were
approximately $3.5 billion, or 10.4% of our total premiums and ASO fees, and military services ASO fees totaled $99.1 million, or 0.3% of our total premiums and ASO fees. The TRICARE South Region contract represents approximately 96% of total
military services premiums and ASO fees.

Our Commercial Segment Products

We offer medical and specialty benefits, including primary and workplace care through our medical centers and worksite medical facilities,
to employer groups and individuals in the commercial market. Our commercial medical products offered as HMO, PPO or ASO, are more fully described in the following sections, include offerings designed to promote wellness and engage consumers.

HMO

Our commercial HMO products provide prepaid health insurance coverage to our members through a network of independent primary care physicians, specialty physicians, and other health care providers who
contract with the HMO to furnish such services. Primary care physicians generally include internists, family practitioners, and pediatricians. Generally, the member’s primary care physician must approve access to certain specialty physicians
and other health care providers. These other health care providers include hospitals, nursing homes, home health agencies, pharmacies, mental health and substance abuse centers, diagnostic centers, optometrists, outpatient surgery centers, dentists,
urgent care centers, and durable medical equipment suppliers. Because the primary care physician generally must approve access to many of these other health care providers, the HMO product is considered the most restrictive form of a health benefit
plan.

An HMO member, typically through the member’s employer, pays a monthly fee, which generally covers, together with
some copayments, health care services received from, or approved by, the member’s primary care physician. We participate in the Federal Employee Health Benefits Program, or FEHBP, primarily with our HMO offering in certain markets. FEHBP is the
government’s health insurance program for Federal employees, retirees, former employees, family members, and spouses. For the year ended December 31, 2010, commercial HMO premium revenues totaled approximately $3.0 billion, or 9.1% of our
total premiums and ASO fees.

PPO

Our commercial PPO products, which are marketed primarily to employer groups and individuals, include some types of wellness and utilization management programs. However, they typically include more
cost-sharing with the member through copayments and annual deductibles. PPOs also are similar to traditional health insurance because they provide a member with more freedom to choose a physician or other health care provider. In a PPO, the member
is encouraged, through financial incentives, to use participating health care providers, which have contracted with the PPO to provide services at favorable rates. In the event a member chooses not to use a participating health care provider, the
member may be required to pay a greater portion of the provider’s fees.

As part of our PPO products, we offer HumanaOne,
a major medical product marketed directly to individuals. We offer this product in select markets where we can generally underwrite risk and utilize our existing networks and distribution channels. This individual product includes provisions
mandated by law to guarantee renewal of coverage for as long as the individual chooses.

For the year ended December 31,
2010, employer and individual commercial PPO premium revenues totaled approximately $2.9 billion, or 8.7% of our total premiums and ASO fees.







ASO

We also offer ASO products to employers who self-insure their employee health plans. We receive fees to provide administrative services which generally include the processing of claims, offering access to
our provider networks and clinical programs, and responding to customer service inquiries from members of self-funded employers. These products may include all of the same benefit and product design characteristics of our fully-insured PPO or HMO
products described previously. Under ASO contracts, self-funded employers retain the risk of financing substantially all of the cost of health benefits. However, most ASO customers purchase stop loss insurance coverage from us to cover catastrophic
claims or to limit aggregate annual costs. For the year ended December 31, 2010, commercial ASO fees totaled $376.5 million, or 1.1% of our total premiums and ASO fees.

Specialty

We also offer various specialty
products and services, including dental, vision, and other supplemental products as well as disease management services under Corphealth, Inc. (d/b/a LifeSynch), mail-order pharmacy benefit administration services for our members under Humana
Pharmacy, Inc. (d/b/aRightSourceRx

SM

), and patient
services under Concentra Inc. During 2007, we made investments which significantly expanded our specialty product offerings with the acquisitions of CompBenefits Corporation and KMG America Corporation. These acquisitions significantly increased our
dental membership and added new product offerings, including vision and other supplemental health and life products. The supplemental health plans cover, for example, some of the costs associated with cancer and critical illness. Other supplemental
health products also include a closed block of approximately 36,000 long-term care policies acquired in connection with the KMG acquisition. No new policies have been written since 2005 under this closed block. As a result of our December 21,
2010 acquisition of Concentra Inc., we provide patient services including primary and workplace care through our over 300 medical centers and 240 worksite medical facilities. At December 31, 2010, we had approximately 7.1 million specialty
members, including 3.9 million dental members and 2.2 million vision members. For the year ended December 31, 2010, specialty product premiums and ASO fees were approximately $1,022.5 million, or 3.1% of our total premiums and ASO
fees.

Provider Arrangements

We provide our members with access to health care services through our networks of health care providers with whom we have contracted, including hospitals and other independent facilities such as
outpatient surgery centers, primary care physicians, specialist physicians, dentists and providers of ancillary health care services and facilities. These ancillary services and facilities include ambulance services, medical equipment services, home
health agencies, mental health providers, rehabilitation facilities, nursing homes, optical services, and pharmacies. Our membership base and the ability to influence where our members seek care generally enable us to obtain contractual discounts
with providers.

We use a variety of techniques to provide access to effective and efficient use of health care services for
our members. These techniques include the coordination of care for our members, product and benefit designs, hospital inpatient management systems and enrolling members into various disease management programs. The focal point for health care
services in many of our HMO networks is the primary care physician who, under contract with us, provides services to our members, and may control utilization of appropriate services by directing or approving hospitalization and referrals to
specialists and other providers. Some physicians may have arrangements under which they can earn bonuses when certain target goals relating to the provision of quality patient care are met. Our hospitalist programs use specially-trained physicians
to effectively manage the entire range of an HMO member’s medical care during a hospital admission and to effectively coordinate the member’s discharge and post-discharge care. We have available a variety of disease management programs
related to







specific medical conditions such as congestive heart failure, coronary artery disease, prenatal and premature infant care, asthma related illness, end stage renal disease, diabetes, cancer, and
certain other conditions.

We typically contract with hospitals on either (1) a per diem rate, which is an all-inclusive
rate per day, (2) a case rate or diagnosis-related groups (DRG), which is an all-inclusive rate per admission, or (3) a discounted charge for inpatient hospital services. Outpatient hospital services generally are contracted at a flat rate
by type of service, ambulatory payment classifications, or APCs, or at a discounted charge. APCs are similar to flat rates except multiple services and procedures may be aggregated into one fixed payment. These contracts are often multi-year
agreements, with rates that are adjusted for inflation annually based on the consumer price index or other nationally recognized inflation indexes. Outpatient surgery centers and other ancillary providers typically are contracted at flat rates per
service provided or are reimbursed based upon a nationally recognized fee schedule such as the Medicare allowable fee schedule.

Our contracts with physicians typically are renewed automatically each year, unless either party gives written notice, generally ranging
from 90 to 120 days, to the other party of its intent to terminate the arrangement. Most of the physicians in our PPO networks and some of our physicians in our HMO networks are reimbursed based upon a fixed fee schedule, which typically provides
for reimbursement based upon a percentage of the standard Medicare allowable fee schedule.

Capitation

For approximately 1.0% of our medical membership at December 31, 2010, we contract with hospitals and physicians to accept financial
risk for a defined set of HMO membership. In transferring this risk, we prepay these providers a monthly fixed-fee per member, known as a capitation (per capita) payment, to coordinate substantially all of the medical care for their capitated HMO
membership, including some health benefit administrative functions and claims processing. For these capitated HMO arrangements, we generally agree to reimbursement rates that target a benefit ratio. The benefit ratio measures underwriting
profitability and is computed by taking total benefit expenses as a percentage of premium revenues. Providers participating in hospital-based capitated HMO arrangements generally receive a monthly payment for all of the services within their system
for their HMO membership. Providers participating in physician-based capitated HMO arrangements generally have subcontracted directly with hospitals and specialist physicians, and are responsible for reimbursing such hospitals and physicians for
services rendered to their HMO membership.

For approximately 8.9% of our medical membership at December 31, 2010, we
contract with physicians under risk-sharing arrangements whereby physicians have assumed some level of risk for all or a portion of the medical costs of their HMO membership. Although these arrangements do include physician capitation payments for
services rendered, we share hospital and other benefit expenses and process substantially all of the claims under these arrangements.

Physicians under capitation arrangements typically have stop loss coverage so that a physician’s financial risk for any single member is limited to a maximum amount on an annual basis. We monitor the
financial performance and solvency of our capitated providers. However, we remain financially responsible for health care services to our members in the event our providers fail to provide such services.







Medical membership under these various arrangements was as follows at December 31, 2010
and 2009:

Accreditation Assessment

Our accreditation assessment program consists of several internal programs, including those that credential providers and those designed to meet the audit standards of federal and state agencies, as well
as external accreditation standards. We also offer quality and outcome measurement and improvement programs such as the Health Care Effectiveness Data and Information Sets, or HEDIS, which is used by employers, government purchasers and the National
Committee for Quality Assurance, or NCQA, to evaluate health plans based on various criteria, including effectiveness of care and member satisfaction.

Physicians participating in our networks must satisfy specific criteria, including licensing, patient access, office standards, after-hours coverage, and other factors. Most participating hospitals also
meet accreditation criteria established by CMS and/or the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations.

Recredentialing of participating providers occurs every two to three years, depending on applicable state laws. Recredentialing of
participating physicians includes verification of their medical licenses; review of their malpractice liability claims histories; review of their board certifications, if applicable; and review of applicable quality information. Committees, composed
of a peer group of physicians, review the applications of physicians being considered for credentialing and recredentialing.

We request accreditation for certain of our health plans and/or departments from NCQA, the Accreditation Association for Ambulatory
Health Care, and the Utilization Review Accreditation Commission, or URAC. Accreditation or external review by an approved organization is mandatory in the states of Florida and Kansas for licensure as an HMO. Certain commercial businesses, like
those impacted by a third-party labor agreement or those where a request is made by the employer, may require or prefer accredited health plans.

NCQA performs reviews of our compliance with standards for quality improvement, credentialing, utilization management, member connections, and member rights and responsibilities. We have achieved and
maintained NCQA accreditation in all of our commercial, Medicare and Medicaid HMO/POS markets with enough history and membership, except Puerto Rico, and for many of our PPO markets.

Sales and Marketing

We use various methods to market our Medicare,
Medicaid, and commercial products, including television, radio, the Internet, telemarketing, and direct mailings.

At December 31, 2010, we employed approximately 1,800 sales representatives, as well as approximately 800 telemarketing representatives who assisted in the marketing of Medicare products by making
appointments for sales representatives with prospective members. We also market our Medicare products via a strategic alliance with Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., or Wal-Mart. This alliance includes stationing Humana representatives in certain Wal-Mart
stores, SAM’S CLUB locations, and Neighborhood Markets across the country providing an opportunity to enroll Medicare eligible individuals in person. In addition, we market our Medicare products through licensed independent brokers and agents
including strategic alliances with State Farm®and United Services Automobile Association, or USAA. Finally, we
sell group Medicare Advantage products through large employers, including via an alliance with CIGNA Corporation. Under the terms of the alliance, we and CIGNA coordinate services and share financial results. Commissions paid to employed sales
representatives and independent brokers and agents are based on a per unit commission structure approved by CMS.

Individuals
become members of our commercial HMOs and PPOs through their employers or other groups which typically offer employees or members a selection of health insurance products, pay for all or part of the premiums, and make payroll deductions for any
premiums payable by the employees. We attempt to become an employer’s or group’s exclusive source of health insurance benefits by offering a variety of HMO, PPO, and specialty products that provide cost-effective quality health care
coverage consistent with the needs and







expectations of their employees or members. We also offer commercial health insurance and specialty products directly to individuals.

At December 31, 2010, we used licensed independent brokers and agents and approximately 1,100 licensed employees to sell our
commercial insurance products. Many of our employer group customers are represented by insurance brokers and consultants who assist these groups in the design and purchase of health care products. We generally pay brokers a commission based on
premiums, with commissions varying by market and premium volume. In addition to a commission based directly on premium volume for sales to particular customers, we also have programs that pay brokers and agents based on other metrics including
certain other incentives for our commercial brokers. These include commission bonuses based on sales that attain certain levels or involve particular products. We also pay additional commissions based on aggregate volumes of sales involving multiple
customers.

Underwriting

Through the use of internally developed underwriting criteria, we determine the risk we are willing to assume and the amount of premium to charge for our commercial products. In most instances, employer
and other groups must meet our underwriting standards in order to qualify to contract with us for coverage. Small group laws in some states have imposed regulations which provide for guaranteed issue of certain health insurance products and
prescribe certain limitations on the variation in rates charged based upon assessment of health conditions.

Underwriting
techniques are not employed in connection with our Medicare, military services, or Medicaid products because government regulations require us to accept all eligible applicants regardless of their health or prior medical history.

Competition

The health
benefits industry is highly competitive. Our competitors vary by local market and include other managed care companies, national insurance companies, and other HMOs and PPOs, including HMOs and PPOs owned by Blue Cross/Blue Shield plans. Many of our
competitors have larger memberships and/or greater financial resources than our health plans in the markets in which we compete. Our ability to sell our products and to retain customers may be influenced by such factors as those described in the
section entitled “Risk Factors” in this report.

Government Regulation

Diverse legislative and regulatory initiatives at both the federal and state levels continue to affect aspects of the nation’s health
care system.

Our management works proactively to ensure compliance with all governmental laws and regulations affecting our
business. We are unable to predict how existing federal or state laws and regulations may be changed or interpreted, what additional laws or regulations affecting our businesses may be enacted or proposed, when and which of the proposed laws will be
adopted or what effect any such new laws and regulations will have on our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.

For a description of all of the material current activities in the federal and state legislative areas, see the section entitled “Risk Factors” in this report.

Other

Captive
Insurance Company

We bear general business risks associated with operating our Company such as professional and
general liability, employee workers’ compensation, and officer and director errors and omissions risks. Professional and







general liability risks may include, for example, medical malpractice claims and disputes with members regarding benefit coverage. We retain certain of these risks through our wholly-owned,
captive insurance subsidiary. We reduce exposure to these risks by insuring levels of coverage for losses in excess of our retained limits with a number of third-party insurance companies. We remain liable in the event these insurance companies are
unable to pay their portion of the losses.

Centralized Management Services

We provide centralized management services to each of our health plans and both of our business segments from our headquarters and service
centers. These services include management information systems, product development and administration, finance, human resources, accounting, law, public relations, marketing, insurance, purchasing, risk management, internal audit, actuarial,
underwriting, claims processing, and customer service.

Employees

As of December 31, 2010, we had approximately 35,200 employees, including approximately 1,900 medical professionals working at the
Concentra medical centers and 34 employees covered by collective bargaining agreements. We believe we have good relations with our employees and have not experienced any work stoppages.
