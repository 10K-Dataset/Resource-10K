ITEM 1.BUSINESS

General

Headquartered in Louisville, Kentucky, Humana Inc. and its subsidiaries, referred to throughout this document as “we,”
“us,” “our,” the “Company” or “Humana,” is one of the nation’s largest publicly traded health and supplemental benefits companies, based on our 2009 revenues of approximately $31.0 billion. We are a
full-service benefits solutions company, offering a wide array of health and supplemental benefit products for employer groups, government benefit programs, and individuals. As of December 31, 2009, we had approximately 10.3 million
members in our medical benefit plans, as well as approximately 7.2 million members in our specialty products. During 2009, 73% of our premiums and administrative services fees were derived from contracts with the federal government, including
17% related to our Medicare Advantage contracts in Florida with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, and 12% related to our military services contracts. Under our Medicare Advantage CMS contracts in Florida, we provide health
insurance coverage to approximately 377,900 members as of December 31, 2009.

Humana Inc. was organized as a Delaware
corporation in 1964. Our principal executive offices are located at 500 West Main Street, Louisville, Kentucky 40202, the telephone number at that address is (502) 580-1000, and our website address is www.humana.com. We have made available free
of charge through the Investor Relations section of our web site our annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, proxy statements, and, if applicable, amendments to those reports filed or furnished
pursuant to Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act, as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file such material with, or furnish it to, the Securities and Exchange Commission.

This Annual Report on Form 10-K contains both historical and forward-looking information. See Item 1A.—Risk Factors for a
description of a number of factors that may adversely affect our results or business.

Business Segments

We manage our business with two segments: Government and Commercial. The Government segment consists of beneficiaries of government benefit
programs, and includes three lines of business: Medicare, Military, and Medicaid. The Commercial segment consists of members enrolled in our medical and specialty products marketed to employer groups and individuals. When identifying our segments,
we aggregated products







with similar economic characteristics. These characteristics include the nature of customer groups as well as pricing, benefits, and underwriting requirements. These segment groupings are
consistent with information used by our Chief Executive Officer.

The results of each segment are measured by income before
income taxes. We allocate all selling, general and administrative expenses, investment and other revenue, interest expense, and goodwill, but no other assets or liabilities, to our segments. Members served by our two segments often utilize the same
provider networks, in some instances enabling us to obtain more favorable contract terms with providers. Our segments also share indirect overhead costs and assets. As a result, the profitability of each segment is interdependent.

Our Products

As more fully
described in the products discussion that follows, we provide health insurance benefits under health maintenance organization, or HMO, Private Fee-For-Service, or PFFS, and preferred provider organization, or PPO, plans. In addition, we provide
other benefits with our specialty products including dental, vision, and other supplementary benefits. The following table presents our segment membership at December 31, 2009, and premiums and administrative services only, or ASO, fees by
product for the year ended December 31, 2009:

Our Products Marketed to Government Segment Members and Beneficiaries

Medicare

We have participated in the Medicare program for private health plans for over 20 years and have established a national presence, offering at least one type of Medicare plan in all 50 states. The resulting growing membership base provides
us with greater ability to expand our network of PPO and HMO providers. We employ strategies including health assessments and clinical guidance programs such as lifestyle and fitness programs for seniors to guide Medicare beneficiaries in making
cost-effective decisions with respect to their health care, including cost savings that occur from making positive behavior changes that result in living healthier.

Medicare is a federal program that provides persons age 65 and over and some disabled persons under the age of 65 certain hospital and medical insurance benefits. Hospitalization benefits are provided
under Part A, without the payment of any premium, for up to 90 days per incident of illness plus a lifetime reserve aggregating 60 days. Eligible beneficiaries are required to pay an annually adjusted premium to the federal government to be eligible
for physician care and other services under Part B. Beneficiaries eligible for Part A and Part B coverage under traditional Medicare are still required to pay out-of-pocket deductibles and coinsurance. Prescription drug benefits are provided under
Part D. CMS, an agency of the United States Department of Health and Human Services, administers the Medicare program.

Medicare Advantage Products

We contract with CMS under the Medicare Advantage program to provide a
comprehensive array of health insurance benefits, including wellness programs, to Medicare eligible persons under HMO, PPO, and PFFS plans in exchange for contractual payments received from CMS, usually a fixed payment per member per month. With
each of these products, the beneficiary receives benefits in excess of original Medicare, typically including reduced cost sharing, enhanced prescription drug benefits, care coordination, data analysis techniques to help identify member needs,
complex case management, tools to guide members in their health care decisions, disease management programs, wellness and prevention programs and, in some instances, a reduced monthly Part B premium. Since 2006, Medicare beneficiaries have had more
health plan options, including a prescription drug benefit option. Most Medicare Advantage plans offer the prescription drug benefit under Part D as part of the basic plan, subject to cost sharing and other limitations. Accordingly, all of the
provisions of the Medicare Part D program described in connection with our stand-alone prescription drug plans in the following section also are applicable to most of our Medicare Advantage plans. Medicare Advantage plans may charge beneficiaries
monthly premiums and other copayments for Medicare-covered services or for certain extra benefits.

Our Medicare HMO and PPO
plans, which cover Medicare-eligible individuals residing in certain counties, may eliminate or reduce coinsurance or the level of deductibles on many other medical services while seeking care from participating in-network providers or in emergency
situations. Except in emergency situations, HMO plans provide no out-of-network benefits. PPO plans carry an out-of network benefit that is subject to higher member cost-sharing. In most cases, these beneficiaries are required to pay a monthly
premium to the HMO or PPO plan in addition to the monthly Part B premium they are required to pay the Medicare program.

Our
Medicare PFFS plans generally have no preferred network. Individuals in these plans pay us a monthly premium to receive typical Medicare Advantage benefits along with the freedom to choose any health care provider that accepts individuals at rates
equivalent to traditional Medicare payment rates.

CMS uses monthly rates per person for each county to determine the fixed
monthly payments per member to pay to health benefit plans. These rates are adjusted under CMS’s risk-adjustment model which uses health status indicators, or risk scores, to improve the adequacy of payment. The risk-adjustment model, which CMS
implemented pursuant to the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 (BBA) and the Benefits and Improvement Protection Act of 2000 (BIPA), generally pays more for members with predictably higher costs and uses principal hospital







inpatient diagnoses as well as diagnosis data from ambulatory treatment settings (hospital outpatient department and physician visits). CMS transitioned to this risk-based payment model while the
old payment model based on demographic data including gender, age, and disability status was phased out. The phase-in of risk adjusted payment was completed in 2007. Under the risk-adjustment methodology, all health benefit organizations must
collect and submit the necessary diagnosis code information to CMS within prescribed deadlines.

Commensurate with the
phase-in of the risk-adjustment methodology, payments to Medicare Advantage plans were increased by a “budget neutrality” factor. The budget neutrality factor was implemented to prevent overall health plan payments from being reduced
during the transition from the previous payment model, based upon average original Medicare fee-for-service spending, to the risk-adjustment payment model. The budget neutrality adjustment began phasing out in 2007 and will be fully eliminated by
2011.

At December 31, 2009, we provided health insurance coverage under CMS contracts to approximately 1,508,500
Medicare Advantage members for which we received premium revenues of approximately $16.4 billion, or 54.0%, of our total premiums and ASO fees for the year ended December 31, 2009. Under our Medicare Advantage contracts with CMS in Florida, we
provided health insurance coverage to approximately 377,900 members. These contracts accounted for premium revenues of approximately $5.2 billion, which represented approximately 31.8% of our Medicare Advantage premium revenues, or 17.1% of our
total premiums and ASO fees for the year ended December 31, 2009.

Our HMO, PFFS, and PPO products covered under Medicare
Advantage contracts with CMS are renewed generally for a one-year term each December 31 unless CMS notifies us of its decision not to renew by August 1 of the year in which the contract would end, or we notify CMS of our decision not to
renew by the first Monday in June of the year in which the contract would end. All material contracts between Humana and CMS relating to our Medicare Advantage business have been renewed for 2010.

Medicare Stand-Alone Prescription Drug Products

We offer stand-alone prescription drug plans, or PDPs, under Medicare Part D. Generally, Medicare-eligible individuals enroll in one of our plan choices between November 15 and December 31 for
coverage that begins January 1. Our stand-alone PDP offerings consist of plans offering basic coverage with benefits mandated by Congress, as well as plans providing enhanced coverage with varying degrees of out-of-pocket costs for premiums,
deductibles and co-insurance. Our revenues from CMS and the beneficiary are determined from our bids submitted annually to CMS. These revenues also reflect the health status of the beneficiary and risk sharing provisions as more fully described
beginning on page 60. Our stand-alone PDP contracts with CMS are renewed generally for a one-year term each December 31 unless CMS notifies us of its decision not to renew by August 1 of the year in which the contract would end, or we
notify CMS of our decision not to renew by the first Monday in June of the year in which the contract would end. All material contracts between Humana and CMS relating to our Medicare stand-alone PDP business have been renewed for 2010.

Medicare stand-alone PDP premium revenues were approximately $2.3 billion, or 7.6% of our total premiums and ASO fees for the year ended
December 31, 2009.

Medicaid Product

Medicaid is a federal program that is state-operated to facilitate the delivery of health care services primarily to low-income residents.
Each electing state develops, through a state-specific regulatory agency, a Medicaid managed care initiative that must be approved by CMS. CMS requires that Medicaid managed care plans meet federal standards and cost no more than the amount that
would have been spent on a comparable fee-for-service basis. States currently either use a formal proposal process in which they review many bidders before selecting one or award individual contracts to qualified bidders who apply for entry to the
program. In either case, the contractual relationship with a state generally is for a one-year period. Under these contracts, we







receive a fixed monthly payment from a government agency for which we are required to provide health insurance coverage to enrolled members. Due to the increased emphasis on state health care
reform and budgetary constraints, more states are utilizing a managed care product in their Medicaid programs.

Our Medicaid
business, which accounted for premium revenues of approximately $646.2 million, or 2.1%, of our total premiums and ASO fees for the year ended December 31, 2009, consists of contracts in Puerto Rico and Florida, with the vast majority in Puerto
Rico.

Military Services

Under our TRICARE South Region contract with the United States Department of Defense, or DoD, we provide health insurance coverage to the dependents of active duty military personnel and to retired
military personnel and their dependents. Currently, three health benefit options are available to TRICARE beneficiaries. In addition to a traditional indemnity option, participants may enroll in a HMO-like plan with a point-of-service option or take
advantage of reduced copayments by using a network of preferred providers, similar to a PPO.

The TRICARE South Region contract contains provisions that require us to
negotiate a target health care cost amount annually with the federal government. Any variance from the target health care cost is shared with the federal government. Accordingly, events and circumstances not contemplated in the negotiated target
health care cost amount may have a material adverse effect on us. These changes may include an increase or reduction in the number of persons enrolled or eligible to enroll due to the federal government’s decision to increase or decrease U.S.
military deployments.

In July 2009, we were notified by the Department of Defense that we were not awarded the third
generation TRICARE program contract for the South Region which had been subject to competing bids. We filed a protest with the Government Accountability Office, or GAO, in connection with the award to another contractor citing discrepancies between
the award criteria and procedures prescribed in the request for proposals issued by the DoD and those that appear to have been used by the DoD in making its contractor selection. In October 2009, we learned that the GAO had upheld our protest,
determining that the TMA evaluation of our proposal had unreasonably failed to fully recognize and reasonably account for the likely cost savings associated with our







record of obtaining network provider discounts from our established network in the South Region. On December 22, 2009, we were advised that TMA notified the GAO of its intent to implement
corrective action consistent with the discussion contained within the GAO’s decision with respect to our protest. At this time, we are not able to determine what actions TMA will take in response to recommendations by the GAO, nor can we
determine whether or not the protest decision by the GAO will have any effect upon the ultimate disposition of the contract award.

For the year ended December 31, 2009, military services premium revenues were approximately $3.4 billion, or 11.3% of our total premiums and ASO fees, and military services ASO fees totaled $108.4 million, or 0.3% of our total premiums
and ASO fees. The TRICARE South Region contract represents approximately 97% of total military services premiums and ASO fees.

International Operations

In August 2006, we established our subsidiary Humana Europe in the United
Kingdom to provide commissioning support to Primary Care Trusts, or PCTs, in England. Under the contracts we are awarded, we work in partnership with local PCTs, health care providers, and patients to strengthen health-service delivery and to
implement strategies at a local level to help the National Health Service enhance patient experience, improve clinical outcomes, and reduce costs. For the year ended December 31, 2009, revenues under these contracts were approximately $9.0
million, or less than 0.1% of our total premium and ASO fees.

Our Products Marketed to Commercial Segment Employers and Members

We offer medical and specialty benefits to employer groups and individuals in the commercial market. Our commercial
medical products offered as HMO, PPO or ASO, more fully described in the following sections, include offerings designed to provide additional options to the consumer. For example, our “Smart” products give more cost control and
predictability to employers and more choice and control over healthcare decision-making to employees. Online tools and resources deliver information, convenience, and easy access for members enrolled in our Smart products. Our other consumer
offerings include products with a high deductible offering in conjunction with a spending account.

HMO

Our commercial HMO products provide prepaid health insurance coverage to our members through a network of independent
primary care physicians, specialty physicians, and other health care providers who contract with the HMO to furnish such services. Primary care physicians generally include internists, family practitioners, and pediatricians. Generally, the
member’s primary care physician must approve access to certain specialty physicians and other health care providers. These other health care providers include hospitals, nursing homes, home health agencies, pharmacies, mental health and
substance abuse centers, diagnostic centers, optometrists, outpatient surgery centers, dentists, urgent care centers, and durable medical equipment suppliers. Because the primary care physician generally must approve access to many of these other
health care providers, the HMO product is considered the most restrictive form of a health benefit plan.

An HMO member,
typically through the member’s employer, pays a monthly fee, which generally covers, together with some copayments, health care services received from, or approved by, the member’s primary care physician. We participate in the Federal
Employee Health Benefits Program, or FEHBP, primarily with our HMO offering in certain markets. FEHBP is the government’s health insurance program for Federal employees, retirees, former employees, family members, and spouses. For the year
ended December 31, 2009, commercial HMO premium revenues totaled approximately $3.0 billion, or 9.9% of our total premiums and ASO fees.

PPO

Our commercial PPO products, which are marketed primarily to
employer groups and individuals, include some types of wellness and utilization management programs. However, they typically include more cost-sharing







with the member through copayments and annual deductibles. PPOs also are similar to traditional health insurance because they provide a member with more freedom to choose a physician or other
health care provider. In a PPO, the member is encouraged, through financial incentives, to use participating health care providers, which have contracted with the PPO to provide services at favorable rates. In the event a member chooses not to use a
participating health care provider, the member may be required to pay a greater portion of the provider’s fees.

As part
of our PPO products, we offer HumanaOne, a major medical product marketed directly to individuals. We offer this product in select markets where we can generally underwrite risk and utilize our existing networks and distribution channels. This
individual product includes provisions mandated by law to guarantee renewal of coverage for as long as the individual chooses.

For the year ended December 31, 2009, employer and individual commercial PPO premium revenues totaled approximately $3.2 billion, or 10.5% of our total premiums and ASO fees.

ASO

We also offer ASO products to employers who self-insure their employee health plans. We receive fees to provide administrative services which generally include the processing of claims, offering access to our provider networks and clinical
programs, and responding to customer service inquiries from members of self-funded employers. These products may include all of the same benefit and product design characteristics of our fully-insured PPO or HMO products described previously. Under
ASO contracts, self-funded employers retain the risk of financing substantially all of the cost of health benefits. However, most ASO customers purchase stop loss insurance coverage from us to cover catastrophic claims or to limit aggregate annual
costs. For the year ended December 31, 2009, commercial ASO fees totaled $373.4 million, or 1.2% of our total premiums and ASO fees.

Specialty

We also offer various specialty
products, including dental, vision, and other supplemental products as well as disease management services under Corphealth, Inc. (d/b/a LifeSynch) and mail-order pharmacy benefit administration services for our members under Humana Pharmacy, Inc.
(d/b/aRightSourceRxSM). During 2007, we made
investments which significantly expanded our specialty product offerings with the acquisitions of CompBenefits Corporation and KMG America Corporation. These acquisitions significantly increased our dental membership and added new product offerings,
including vision and other supplemental health and life products. The supplemental health plans cover, for example, some of the costs associated with cancer and critical illness. Other supplemental health products also include a closed block of
approximately 36,000 long-term care policies acquired in connection with the KMG acquisition. No new policies have been written since 2005 under this closed block. At December 31, 2009, we had approximately 7.2 million specialty members,
including 3.8 million dental members and 2.5 million vision members. For the year ended December 31, 2009, specialty product premiums and ASO fees were approximately $942.3 million, or 3.1% of our total premiums and ASO fees.

Provider Arrangements

We provide our members with access to health care services through our networks of health care providers with whom we have contracted, including hospitals and other independent facilities such as
outpatient surgery centers, primary care physicians, specialist physicians, dentists and providers of ancillary health care services and facilities. These ancillary services and facilities include ambulance services, medical equipment services, home
health agencies, mental health providers, rehabilitation facilities, nursing homes, optical services, and pharmacies. Our membership base and the ability to influence where our members seek care generally enable us to obtain contractual discounts
with providers.

We use a variety of techniques to provide access to effective and efficient use of health care services for
our members. These techniques include the coordination of care for our members, product and benefit designs, hospital inpatient management systems and enrolling members into various disease management programs. The focal point for health care
services in many of our HMO networks is the primary care physician who, under contract with us, provides services to our members, and may control utilization of appropriate services by directing or approving hospitalization and referrals to
specialists and other providers. Some physicians may have arrangements under which they can earn bonuses when certain target goals relating to the provision of quality patient care are met. Our hospitalist programs use specially-trained physicians
to effectively manage the entire range of an HMO member’s medical care during a hospital admission and to effectively coordinate the member’s discharge and post-discharge care. We have available a variety of disease management programs
related to specific medical conditions such as congestive heart failure, coronary artery disease, prenatal and premature infant care, asthma related illness, end stage renal disease, diabetes, cancer, and certain other conditions.







We typically contract with hospitals on either (1) a per diem rate, which is an
all-inclusive rate per day, (2) a case rate or diagnosis-related groups (DRG), which is an all-inclusive rate per admission, or (3) a discounted charge for inpatient hospital services. Outpatient hospital services generally are contracted
at a flat rate by type of service, ambulatory payment classifications, or APCs, or at a discounted charge. APCs are similar to flat rates except multiple services and procedures may be aggregated into one fixed payment. These contracts are often
multi-year agreements, with rates that are adjusted for inflation annually based on the consumer price index or other nationally recognized inflation indexes. Outpatient surgery centers and other ancillary providers typically are contracted at flat
rates per service provided or are reimbursed based upon a nationally recognized fee schedule such as the Medicare allowable fee schedule.

Our contracts with physicians typically are renewed automatically each year, unless either party gives written notice, generally ranging from 90 to 120 days, to the other party of its intent to terminate
the arrangement. Most of the physicians in our PPO networks and some of our physicians in our HMO networks are reimbursed based upon a fixed fee schedule, which typically provides for reimbursement based upon a percentage of the standard Medicare
allowable fee schedule.

Capitation

For approximately 2.4% of our medical membership at December 31, 2009, we contract with hospitals and physicians to accept financial risk for a defined set of HMO membership. In transferring this
risk, we prepay these providers a monthly fixed-fee per member, known as a capitation (per capita) payment, to coordinate substantially all of the medical care for their capitated HMO membership, including some health benefit administrative
functions and claims processing. For these capitated HMO arrangements, we generally agree to reimbursement rates that target a benefit ratio. The benefit ratio measures underwriting profitability and is computed by taking total benefit expenses as a
percentage of premium revenues. Providers participating in hospital-based capitated HMO arrangements generally receive a monthly payment for all of the services within their system for their HMO membership. Providers participating in physician-based
capitated HMO arrangements generally have subcontracted directly with hospitals and specialist physicians, and are responsible for reimbursing such hospitals and physicians for services rendered to their HMO membership.

For approximately 5.7% of our medical membership at December 31, 2009, we contract with physicians under risk-sharing arrangements
whereby physicians have assumed some level of risk for all or a portion of the medical costs of their HMO membership. Although these arrangements do include physician capitation payments for services rendered, we share hospital and other benefit
expenses and process substantially all of the claims under these arrangements.

Physicians under capitation arrangements
typically have stop loss coverage so that a physician’s financial risk for any single member is limited to a maximum amount on an annual basis. We monitor the financial performance and solvency of our capitated providers. However, we remain
financially responsible for health care services to our members in the event our providers fail to provide such services.







Medical membership under these various arrangements was as follows at December 31, 2009

Accreditation Assessment

Our accreditation assessment program consists of several internal programs, including those that credential providers and those designed to
meet the audit standards of federal and state agencies, as well as external accreditation standards. We also offer quality and outcome measurement and improvement programs such as the Health Care Effectiveness Data and Information Sets, or HEDIS,
which is used by employers, government purchasers and the National Committee for Quality Assurance, or NCQA, to evaluate health plans based on various criteria, including effectiveness of care and member satisfaction.

Physicians participating in our networks must satisfy specific criteria, including licensing, patient access, office standards, after-hours
coverage, and other factors. Most participating hospitals also meet accreditation criteria established by CMS and/or the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations.

Recredentialing of participating providers occurs every two to three years, depending on applicable state laws. Recredentialing of
participating physicians includes verification of their medical licenses; review of their malpractice liability claims histories; review of their board certifications, if applicable; and review of applicable quality information. Committees, composed
of a peer group of physicians, review the applications of physicians being considered for credentialing and recredentialing.

We request accreditation for certain of our health plans from NCQA, the Accreditation Association for Ambulatory Health Care, and the Utilization Review Accreditation Commission, or URAC. URAC performs reviews for utilization management
standards and for health plan and health network standards in quality management, credentialing, rights and responsibilities, and network management. Accreditation or external review by an approved organization is mandatory in the states of Florida
and Kansas for licensure as an HMO. Certain commercial businesses, like those impacted by a third-party labor agreement or those where a request is made by the employer, may require or prefer accredited health plans.

NCQA performs reviews of our compliance with standards for quality improvement, credentialing, utilization management, member connections,
and member rights and responsibilities. We have achieved and maintained NCQA accreditation in all of our commercial HMO/POS markets except Puerto Rico, in all of our Medicare HMO markets with the exception of Illinois which will be surveyed in 2010,
and for nearly all our PPO markets.

Sales and Marketing

We use various methods to market our Medicare, Medicaid, and commercial products, including television, radio, the Internet, telemarketing, and direct mailings.

At December 31, 2009, we employed approximately 1,700 sales representatives, as well as approximately 900
telemarketing representatives who assisted in the marketing of Medicare products by making appointments for sales representatives with prospective members. We also market our Medicare products via a strategic alliance with Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., or
Wal-Mart. This alliance includes stationing Humana representatives in certain Wal-Mart stores, SAM’S CLUB locations, and Neighborhood Markets across the country providing an opportunity to enroll Medicare eligible individuals in person. In
addition, we market our Medicare products through licensed independent brokers and agents including strategic alliances with State Farm®and United Services Automobile Association, or USAA. Commissions paid to employed sales representatives and independent brokers and agents are based on a per unit
commission structure approved by CMS.

Individuals become members of our commercial HMOs and PPOs through their employers or
other groups which typically offer employees or members a selection of health insurance products, pay for all or part of the premiums, and make payroll deductions for any premiums payable by the employees. We attempt to become an employer’s or
group’s exclusive source of health insurance benefits by offering a variety of HMO, PPO, and







specialty products that provide cost-effective quality health care coverage consistent with the needs and expectations of their employees or members. We also offer commercial health insurance and
specialty products directly to individuals.

At December 31, 2009, we used licensed independent brokers and agents and
approximately 1,200 licensed employees to sell our commercial products. Many of our employer group customers are represented by insurance brokers and consultants who assist these groups in the design and purchase of health care products. We
generally pay brokers a commission based on premiums, with commissions varying by market and premium volume. In addition to a commission based directly on premium volume for sales to particular customers, we also have programs that pay brokers and
agents based on other metrics including certain other incentives for our commercial brokers. These include commission bonuses based on sales that attain certain levels or involve particular products. We also pay additional commissions based on
aggregate volumes of sales involving multiple customers.

Underwriting

Through the use of internally developed underwriting criteria, we determine the risk we are willing to assume and the amount of premium to
charge for our commercial products. In most instances, employer and other groups must meet our underwriting standards in order to qualify to contract with us for coverage. Small group laws in some states have imposed regulations which provide for
guaranteed issue of certain health insurance products and prescribe certain limitations on the variation in rates charged based upon assessment of health conditions.

Underwriting techniques are not employed in connection with our Medicare, military services, or Medicaid products because government regulations require us to accept all eligible applicants regardless of
their health or prior medical history.

Competition

The health benefits industry is highly competitive. Our competitors vary by local market and include other managed care companies, national insurance companies, and other HMOs and PPOs, including HMOs and
PPOs owned by Blue Cross/Blue Shield plans. Many of our competitors have larger memberships and/or greater financial resources than our health plans in the markets in which we compete. Our ability to sell our products and to retain customers may be
influenced by such factors as those described in the section entitled “Risk Factors” in this report.

Government Regulation

Diverse legislative and regulatory initiatives at both the federal and state levels continue to affect aspects of the
nation’s health care system.

Our management works proactively to ensure compliance with all governmental laws and
regulations affecting our business. We are unable to predict how existing federal or state laws and regulations may be changed or interpreted, what additional laws or regulations affecting our businesses may be enacted or proposed, when and which of
the proposed laws will be adopted or what effect any such new laws and regulations will have on our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.

For a description of all of the material current activities in the federal and state legislative areas, see the section entitled “Risk Factors” in this report.







Other

Captive Insurance Company

We bear general business risks associated
with operating our Company such as professional and general liability, employee workers’ compensation, and officer and director errors and omissions risks. Professional and general liability risks may include, for example, medical malpractice
claims and disputes with members regarding benefit coverage. We retain certain of these risks through our wholly-owned, captive insurance subsidiary. We reduce exposure to these risks by insuring levels of coverage for losses in excess of our
retained limits with a number of third-party insurance companies. We remain liable in the event these insurance companies are unable to pay their portion of the losses.

Centralized Management Services

We provide centralized management
services to each of our health plans and both of our business segments from our headquarters and service centers. These services include management information systems, product development and administration, finance, human resources, accounting,
law, public relations, marketing, insurance, purchasing, risk management, internal audit, actuarial, underwriting, claims processing, and customer service.

Employees

As of December 31, 2009, we had approximately 28,100
employees, including 31 employees covered by collective bargaining agreements. We believe we have good relations with our employees and have not experienced any work stoppages.
