Item 1.    Business

Principal Financial Group, Inc. ("PFG") is a global investment management leader offering businesses, individuals and
institutional clients a wide range of financial products and services, including retirement, asset management and insurance through our diverse family of financial services companies. We had
$519.3 billion in assets under management ("AUM") and approximately 19.7 million customers worldwide as of December 31, 2014.

We
primarily focus on small and medium-sized businesses, which we define as companies with less than 1,000 employees, providing a broad array of retirement and employee benefit solutions
to meet the needs of the business, the business owner and their employees. We are the leading provider of corporate defined contribution plans in the U.S., according to Spectrem Group. We are also the
leading employee stock ownership plan consultant. In addition, we are a leading provider of nonqualified plans, defined benefit plans and plan termination annuities. We are also one of the largest
providers of specialty benefits insurance product solutions.

We
believe small and medium-sized businesses are an underserved market, offering attractive growth opportunities in the U.S. in retirement services and other employee benefits. We also
believe there is a significant opportunity to leverage our U.S. retirement expertise into select international markets that have adopted or are moving toward private sector defined contribution
pension systems. This opportunity is particularly compelling as aging populations around the world are driving increased demand for retirement accumulation, retirement asset management and retirement
income management solutions.

Our Reportable Segments

We organize our businesses into the following reportable segments:

•Retirement and Investor Services;•Principal Global Investors;•Principal International and•U.S. Insurance Solutions.

We
also have a Corporate segment, which consists of the assets and activities that have not been allocated to any other segment.

See
Item 8. "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 16, Segment Information" for financial results of our segments,
including our operating revenues for our products and services described in each of the subsequent segment discussions.

Retirement and Investor Services Segment

Our asset accumulation activities in the U.S. date back to the 1940s when we first began providing pension plan products and services.
We now offer a comprehensive portfolio of asset accumulation products and services for retirement savings and investment:

•To businesses of all sizes with a concentration on small and medium-sized businesses, we offer products and services for defined
contribution pension plans, including 401(k) and 403(b) plans, defined benefit pension plans, nonqualified executive benefit plans and employee stock ownership plan ("ESOP") consulting services. For
more basic investment needs, we offer SIMPLE Individual Retirement Accounts ("IRA") and payroll deduction plans;•To large institutional clients, we also offer investment-only products, including guaranteed investment contracts ("GICs") and funding
agreements and•To employees of businesses and other individuals, we offer the ability to accumulate savings for retirement and other purposes through
mutual funds, individual annuities and bank products.

We
organize our Retirement and Investor Services ("RIS") operations into two business groupings:

•Accumulation business — includes full service accumulation, Principal Funds (our mutual fund business), individual
annuities and bank and trust services; and•Guaranteed business — includes investment only and full service payout.

Accumulation Business

Full Service Accumulation

Products

We offer a wide variety of investment and administrative products for defined contribution pension plans, including 401(k) and 403(b)
plans, defined benefit pension plans, nonqualified executive benefit plans and ESOPs. A 403(b) plan is









a
plan described in Section 403(b) of the Internal Revenue Code that provides retirement benefits for employees of tax-exempt organizations and public schools.

Full
service accumulation products respond to the needs of plan sponsors seeking both administrative and investment services for defined contribution plans or defined benefit plans. The
investment component of both the defined contribution and defined benefit plans may be in the form of a general account, separate account, a mutual fund offering or a collective investment trust. In
addition, defined contribution plans may also offer their own employer security as an investment option.

We
deliver both administrative and investment services to our defined contribution plan and defined benefit plan customers through annuities and mutual funds. Group annuities and the
underlying investment options are not required to be registered with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"). Our mutual fund offering is called Principal Advantage. It is a
qualified plan product based on our series mutual fund, Principal Funds, Inc. ("PFI"). We offer investments covering the full range of stable value, equity, fixed income, real estate and
international investment options managed by our Principal Global Investors segment as well as third party asset managers.

As
of December 31, 2014, we provided full service accumulation products to (a) over 33,600 defined contribution pension plans, of which approximately 28,400 were 401(k)
plans, including $117.3 billion in assets and covering 4.0 million eligible plan participants, and (b) to over 2,200 defined benefit pension plans, including $18.0 billion
in assets and covering over 326,600 eligible plan participants. As of December 31, 2014, approximately 56% of our full service accumulation account values were managed by our Principal Global
Investors segment. Third party asset managers provide asset management services with respect to the remaining assets. Of those third party assets, 27% is managed entirely by the third party asset
managers, 10% is sub-advised and 7% represents employer securities.

Markets and Distribution

We offer our full service accumulation products and services to employer-sponsored pension plans, including qualified and nonqualified
defined contribution plans and defined benefit plans. Our primary target market is plans sponsored by small and medium-sized businesses, which we believe remains under-penetrated. According to
Spectrem Group, in 2013, only 22% of businesses with between 10 and 49 employees, 51% of businesses with between 50 and 99 employees, 55% of businesses with between 100 and 249 employees and 71% of
businesses with between 250 and 500 employees offered a 401(k) plan. The same study indicates that 76% of employers with between 500 and 1,000 employees, 84% of employers with between 1,000 and 5,000
employees and 86% of employers with 5,000 or more employees offered a 401(k) plan in 2013.

We
distribute our full service accumulation products and services nationally, primarily through a captive retirement services sales force. As of December 31, 2014, 119 retirement
services sales representatives in 42 offices, operating as a wholesale distribution network, maintained relationships with over 14,400 independent brokers, consultants and agents. Retirement services
sales representatives are an integral part of the sales process alongside the referring consultant or independent broker. We compensate retirement services sales representatives through a blend of
salary and production-based incentives, while we pay independent brokers, consultants and agents a commission or fee.

As
of December 31, 2014, we had a separate staff of over 290 service and education specialists located in the sales offices who play a key role in the ongoing servicing of pension
plans by providing local services to our customers, such as reviewing plan performance, investment options and plan design; communicating the customers' needs and feedback to us and helping employees
understand the benefits of their pension plans. The following summarizes our distribution channels:

•We distribute our annuity-based products through sales representatives, agents and brokers who are primarily state licensed
individuals.•Principal Advantage, our mutual fund-based product, is targeted at defined contribution plans through broker-dealer distribution
channels. Principal Advantage gives us access to Financial Industry Regulatory Authority-registered distributors who are not traditional sellers of annuity-based products and broadens opportunities
for us in the investment advisor and broker-dealer distribution channels.•Principal Retirement Income Edge® is designed to create a coordinated experience from accumulation to income management
for advisors to use with their individual clients and plan participants who are nearing or enjoying retirement. The Principal Retirement Income Edge® program provides education and
planning tools as well as a wide variety of products such as annuities, mutual funds and bank products to provide personalized income management solutions.•Through our Retire Secure strategy we provide financial education and assistance to individual investors who are participants/members
of employer-based accumulation solutions to help them achieve financial security.

We
believe our approach to full service accumulation plan services distribution gives us a local sales and service presence that differentiates us from many of our competitors. We have
also established a number of marketing and distribution relationships to increase the sales of our accumulation products.









Principal Funds

We have been providing mutual funds to customers since 1969. We offer mutual funds to individuals, businesses and institutional
investors for use within variable life and variable annuity contracts, for use in employer-sponsored pension plans, as a rollover investment option, and for general investment purposes.

retirement assets into individual retirement accounts.

over the phone, on the Internet or by mail. Princor recruits, trains and supervises registered representatives selling our products through Principal Connection.

Individual Annuities

Individual annuities offer a tax-deferred means of accumulating retirement savings, as well as a tax-efficient source of income during
the payout period.









Products

We offer both fixed and variable annuities to individuals and pension plans. Individual annuities may be categorized in two ways:
(1) deferred, in which case assets accumulate until the contract is surrendered, the customer dies or the customer begins receiving benefits under an annuity payout option, or
(2) payout, in which case payments are made for a fixed period of time or for life.

Fixed Deferred Annuities.Our individual fixed deferred annuities consist of both single premium deferred annuity contracts and
flexible premium
deferred annuity contracts ("FPDAs"). Some FPDA contracts limit the period of time deposits are allowed (e.g., only one year). For certain contracts, the principal amount is guaranteed. We
credit the customer's account with a fixed interest rate for a specified number of years. Thereafter, we reset the interest rate credited to the contract based upon our discretion, subject to
contractual minimums, by taking into account market and other conditions. We also offer a fixed deferred annuity where the interest credited is linked to an external equity index, subject to maximum
and minimum values. Our major source of income from fixed deferred annuities is the spread between the investment income earned on the underlying general account assets and the interest rate credited
to the contracts. We bear the investment risk because, while we credit customers' accounts with a stated interest rate, we cannot be certain the investment income we earn on our general account assets
will exceed that rate. The Principal Global Investors segment manages the assets supporting these contracts.

Fixed Income Annuities.Our individual fixed income annuities consist of single premium immediate annuity contracts ("SPIAs")
and deferred income
annuity contracts ("DIAs"). SPIAs and DIAs are products where the customer pays a premium in return for periodic benefit payments. SPIA payments begin immediately and DIA payments begin after a
deferral period, during which a return-of-premium death benefit is included. Payments may be contingent upon the survival of one or two individuals or payments may be fixed, meaning payments are
contractually guaranteed and do not depend on the continuing survival of any individual. Our major source of income from fixed immediate annuities is the spread between the investment income earned on
the underlying general account assets and the interest rate implied in the calculation of annuity benefit payments. We bear the investment risk because we cannot be certain the investment income we
earn on our general account assets will exceed the rate implied in the SPIA and DIA contracts. The Principal Global Investors segment manages the assets supporting these contracts.

Markets and Distribution

Our target markets for individual annuities include owners, executives and employees of small and medium-sized businesses and
individuals seeking to accumulate and/or eventually receive distributions of assets for retirement. We market both fixed and variable annuities to individuals for both qualified and nonqualified
retirement savings.

We
sell our individual annuity products through our affiliated financial representatives, who accounted for 49%, 47% and 46% of annuity sales for the years ended December 31,
2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. The remaining sales were made through banks, brokerage general agencies, mutual fund companies, Principal Connection and unaffiliated broker-dealer firms. Affiliated
financial representatives continued to be the primary distribution channel of our variable









deferred
annuities. The majority of overall annuity sales, however, were from non-affiliated distribution channels, as a result of focused efforts to increase fixed annuity sales through
non-affiliated distribution channels.

Bank and Trust Services

Bank and trust services include Principal Bank and Principal Trust Company. Principal Bank is a federal savings bank that began its
activities in February 1998. As of December 31, 2014, Principal Bank had
over 280,000 customers and approximately $2.2 billion in assets. Principal Bank operates under a limited purpose charter and may only accept deposits held in a fiduciary capacity and may not
hold demand deposits, own commercial loans or originate loans. Delaware Charter Guarantee & Trust Company, dba Principal Trust Company, is a Delaware state-chartered non-deposit trust company
that was chartered in 1899. As of December 31, 2014, Principal Trust Company served as trustee or custodian to over 229,000 accounts, which held assets of approximately $157.0 billion.
The majority of the trust assets are affiliated and reported in Full Service Accumulation AUM.

Products

Principal Bank's products and services include IRAs that are primarily funded by moneys rolled over from qualified retirement plans.
The IRAs hold savings accounts, money market accounts and certificates of deposit. The deposit products provide a relatively stable source of funding and liquidity for Principal Bank and are backed by
purchases of investment securities and residential mortgage loans.

Principal
Trust Company specializes in providing trust solutions for a full array of employee benefit plans and accounts including 401(k) and 403(b) plans, defined benefit pension plans,
nonqualified executive benefit plans and ESOPs. Principal Trust Company also maintains collective investment funds and provides personal trust services.

Markets and Distribution

Principal Bank pursues asset retention strategies by offering bank products and services to participants rolling out of qualified
retirement plans primarily serviced by affiliates of PFG. Principal Bank services customers through the telephone, mail and Internet.

Principal
Trust Company offers directed trust services to qualified and non-qualified retirement plans serviced by the affiliates of PFG. Personal trust services are primarily available
through affiliated financial representatives. Collective investment trust funds are offered to qualified retirement plan clients of our full service accumulation business as well as non-affiliated
retirement plan recordkeepers.

Guaranteed Business

Investment Only

Products

The three primary products for which we provide investment only services are: GICs, funding agreements and other investment only
products.

GICs
and funding agreements pay a specified rate of return. The rate of return can be a floating rate based on an external market index or a fixed rate. Our investment only products
contain provisions disallowing or limiting early surrenders, including penalties for early surrenders and minimum notice requirements.

Deposits
to investment only products are predominantly in the form of single payments. As a result, the level of new deposits can fluctuate from one fiscal quarter to another. Assets
invested in GICs and funding agreements generate a spread between the investment income earned by us and the amount credited to the customer. Our other investment only products consist of separate
accounts invested in either equities or fixed income instruments. The Principal Global Investors segment manages the assets supporting investment only account values.

Markets and Distribution

We market GICs and funding agreements primarily to pension plan sponsors and other institutions. We also offer them as part of our full
service accumulation products. We sell our GICs primarily to plan sponsors for funding of tax-qualified retirement plans. We sell our funding agreements directly to institutions that may or may not be
pension funds and unconsolidated special purpose vehicles domiciled either in the U.S. or offshore for funding agreement-backed note programs. The funding agreements sold as part of these funding
agreement-backed note programs work by having investors purchase debt obligations from the special purpose vehicle which, in turn, purchases the funding agreement from us with terms similar to those
of the debt obligations. The strength of this market is dependent on debt capital market conditions. As a result, our sales through this channel can vary widely from one quarter to another. In
addition to the special purpose vehicle selling the funding agreement-backed notes to U.S. and foreign institutional investors, the special purpose vehicle may also sell notes to U.S. retail investors
through a SEC-registered shelf debt issuance program.









Full Service Payout

Products

Full service payout products respond to the needs of pension plan participants who, upon retirement or termination of their employment,
seek a guaranteed income stream. Plan participants who seek these services include those from pension plans we service, as well as pension plans other providers service. We primarily offer single
premium group annuities, which are immediate or deferred annuities that provide a current or future specific income amount, fully guaranteed by us. These are available to defined contribution and
defined benefit plan participants. We make regular payments to individuals, invest the underlying assets on their behalf and provide tax reporting to them. We also reinsure single premium immediate
annuities issued by another insurer.

Single
premium group annuities are traditionally used in conjunction with defined benefit plans, particularly those where the plan is being terminated. In such instances, the plan
sponsor transfers all its obligations under the plan to an insurer by paying a single premium. Increasingly, these products are purchased by defined contribution plan participants who reach retirement
age. Generally, plan sponsors restrict their purchases to insurance companies with superior or excellent financial quality ratings because the Department of Labor has mandated that annuities be
purchased only from the "safest available" insurers.

Premium
received from full service payout products are generally in the form of single payments. As a result, the level of new premiums can fluctuate depending on the number of
retirements and large-scale annuity sales in a particular fiscal quarter. The Principal Global Investors segment manages the assets supporting full service payout account values.

Markets and Distribution

Our primary distribution channel for full service payout products is comprised of several specialized home office sales consultants
working through consultants and brokers that specialize in this type of business. Our sales consultants also make sales directly to institutions. Our nationally dispersed retirement services sales
representatives act as a secondary distribution channel for these products. Principal Connection also distributes full service payout products to participants in plans we service who are terminating
employment or retiring.

Principal Global Investors Segment

Our Principal Global Investors segment manages assets for sophisticated investors around the world, using a multi-boutique strategy
that enables the segment to provide an expanded range of diverse investment capabilities including equity, fixed income, real estate and other alternative investments. We also have experience in asset

U.S. Insurance Solutions Segment

Our U.S. Insurance Solutions segment offers individual and group insurance solutions. We focus on providing comprehensive insurance
solutions for small and medium-sized businesses and their owners
and executives. We organize our operations into two divisions: Individual Life Insurance and Specialty Benefits Insurance. However, we share key resources in our core areas such as strategic
leadership, distribution, and marketing.

Individual Life Insurance

We began as an individual life insurer in 1879. Our U.S. operations administered approximately 557,000 individual life insurance
policies with over $231 billion of individual life insurance in force as of December 31, 2014. We specialize in business insurance needs for small to medium-sized companies through our
wide range of business and nonqualified solutions and also provide personal insurance.

Small
and medium-sized companies are challenged with how to build quality benefits packages for executives, how to transition the company's ownership to a partner or family member and
how to save for retirement. In addition, executives and other key employees often have personal insurance needs. These needs are the focus of our products within the individual life insurance arena.

Products and Services

Our Business Owner and Executive Solutions platform as well as our nonqualified deferred compensation offering combines administration
and consulting to service our clients' needs. We target the business and personal insurance needs of owners and executives of small and medium-sized businesses with an increasing focus on providing
insurance solutions for nonqualified executive benefits. In addition, we market our products to meet traditional retail insurance needs. We offer a variety of individual life insurance products,
including universal life insurance, variable universal life insurance and term life insurance.

Universal and Variable Universal Life Insurance.Universal and variable universal life insurance products offer the policyholder
the option of
adjusting both the premium and the death benefit amounts of the insurance contract. Universal life insurance typically includes a cash value account that accumulates at a credited interest rate based
on the investment returns of the block of business. Variable universal life insurance is credited with the investment returns of the various investment options selected. For the year ended
December 31, 2014, 66% of individual life insurance annualized first year premium sales were generated from universal and variable universal life insurance products. Universal and variable
universal life insurance represented 36% of individual life insurance in force as of December 31, 2014.

After
a deduction for policy level expenses, we credit net deposits to an account maintained for the policyholder. For universal life contracts, the entire account balance is invested in
the general account. Interest is credited to the policyholder's account based on the earnings on general account investments. For variable universal life contracts, the policyholder may allocate the
account balance among our general account and a variety of mutual funds underlying the contract. Interest is credited on amounts allocated to the Principal Life general account in the same manner as
for universal life. Net investment performance on mutual funds is allocated directly to the policyholder accounts; the policyholder bears the investment risk. Some of our universal life and variable
universal life insurance contracts contain what are commonly referred to as "secondary" or "no-lapse" guarantee provisions. A no-lapse guarantee
keeps the contract in force, even if the contractholder's account balance is insufficient to cover all of the contract charges, provided that the contractholder has continually paid a specified
minimum premium.

Traditional Life Insurance.Traditional life insurance includes participating whole life, adjustable life products and
non-participating term life
insurance products. Participating products and non-participating term life insurance products represented 34% of our individual life insurance annualized first year premium sales for the year ended
December 31, 2014, and 64% of individual life insurance in force as of December 31, 2014. Adjustable life insurance products provide a guaranteed benefit in return for the payment of a
fixed premium and allow the policyholder to set the coverage period, premium and face amount combination. Term insurance products provide a guaranteed death benefit for a specified period of time in
return for the payment of a fixed premium. Policyholder dividends are not paid on term insurance.

Specialty Benefits Insurance

Specialty benefits insurance, which includes group dental, vision, life and disability insurance and individual disability insurance,
is an important component of the employee benefit offering at small and medium-sized businesses. We offer traditional employer sponsored and voluntary products for group dental, vision, life and
disability. We also offer group dental, vision and disability on a fee-for-service basis.









Products and Services

Group Dental and Vision Insurance.We began selling group dental and vision insurance in the late 1960s. Our plans provide
partial reimbursement for
dental and vision expenses. As of December 31, 2014, we had nearly 38,000 group dental and vision insurance policies in force covering over 1,016,000 employee lives. According to Life Insurance
and Market Research Association ("LIMRA"), we were the 7th largest group dental insurer in terms of number of contracts/employer groups in force in 2013. In addition to indemnity and preferred
provider organization dental offered on both an employer paid and voluntary basis, we offer a prepaid dental plan in Arizona through our Employers Dental Services, Inc. subsidiary. In 2012, we
purchased a 100% interest in First Dental Health, a California based organization that includes a discount dental product nationally and a dental network of preferred providers primarily in
California. Our indemnity vision product and our newly introduced managed care vision product are offered on both an employer paid and voluntary basis.

Group Life Insurance.Group life insurance was one of our first group products beginning in the early 1940s. Our group life
insurance provides
coverage to employees and their dependents for a specified period. As of December 31, 2014, we had nearly 50,000 group policies providing $121.3 billion of group life insurance in force
to approximately 2.0 million employee lives. According to LIMRA, in 2013 we were ranked 4th in the U.S. in terms of the number of group life insurance contracts in force. We currently
sell traditional group life insurance that does not provide for accumulation of cash values on both an employer paid and voluntary basis. Our group life insurance business remains focused on the
traditional, annually renewable term product. Group term life and group universal life accounted for 98% and 2%, respectively, of our total group life insurance in force as of December 31,
2014. We no longer market group universal life insurance to new employer groups.

Group Disability Insurance.Group disability insurance has also been sold since the early 1940s. Our group disability insurance
provides a benefit to
insured employees who become disabled. In most instances, this benefit is in the form of a monthly income. Our group disability products include both short-term and long-term disability, offered on
both an employer paid and voluntary basis. As of December 31, 2014, long-term disability represented 64% of total group disability premium, while short-term disability represented 36% of total
group disability premium. In addition, we provide disability management services, also called rehabilitation services, to assist individuals in returning to work as quickly as possible following
disability. We also work with disability claimants to improve the approval rate of Social Security benefits, thereby reducing payment of benefits by the amount of Social Security payments received. As
of December 31, 2014, we served approximately 1.5 million employee lives under nearly 38,000 contracts. According to LIMRA, our group short-term disability business was ranked
6th and our group long-term disability business was ranked 4th in the U.S. as of December 31, 2013, in terms of number of contracts/employer groups in force. We recently expanded
our product offering to include voluntary critical illness insurance. The insurance provides a lump-sum cash benefit to pay for additional expenses associated with the five most common critical
illnesses.

Individual Disability Insurance.Individual disability insurance has been sold since the early 1950s. Our individual disability
insurance products
provide income protection to the insured member and/or business in the event of disability. In most instances, this benefit is in the form of a monthly income. In addition to income replacement, we
offer products to pay business-related costs such as overhead expenses for a disabled business owner, buy-out costs for business owners purchasing a disabled owner's interest in the business,
expenditures for replacement of a key person and business loan payments. We also offer a product to protect retirement savings in the event of disability. As of December 31, 2014, we served
approximately 168,000 individual disability policyholders. According to LIMRA, our individual disability business was ranked 5th in the U.S. in terms of premium in force in the non-cancellable
segment of the market and 7th overall, as of December 31, 2013.

Fee-for-Service.We offer administration of group dental, disability and vision benefits on a fee-for-service basis.

U.S. Insurance Solutions Markets and Distribution

For each of our products, administration and distribution channels are customized to meet customer needs and expectations for that
product.

We
sell our individual life and individual disability income products in all 50 states and the District of Columbia, primarily targeting owners and executives of small and medium-sized
businesses. Small and medium-sized business sales represented 55% of individual life sales and 60% of individual disability sales for the year ended December 31,
2014. Much of our life insurance sales efforts focus on the Business Owner and Executive Solutions market. This strategy offers solutions to address business owner financial challenges such as exiting
the business, business transition, retaining key employees and retirement planning. Key employees also have needs to supplement retirement income, survivor income, and business protection. We believe
the Business Owner and Executive Solutions segment offers growth opportunities and we will continue to develop strategies to capitalize on this expanding market.

We
distribute our individual life and individual disability insurance products through our affiliated financial representatives and independent brokers, as well as other marketing and
distribution alliances. Affiliated financial representatives were responsible for 27% of individual life insurance sales based on first year annualized premium and 13% of individual disability sales
for the year ended December 31, 2014. We had 1,211 affiliated financial representatives in 34 offices as of December 31, 2014. Although they are independent contractors, we have a close
tie with affiliated financial representatives and we offer them benefits, training and access to tools and expertise. To meet the needs of the









various
marketing channels, particularly the independent brokers, we employ wholesale distributors — Regional Vice Presidents for individual life and Regional Vice Presidents for
individual disability. A key differentiator in the nonqualified executive benefit sale is our Regional Vice Presidents-Nonqualified Plans, who are not only wholesalers but also consultants and
subject-matter experts providing point-of-sale support in closing cases.

We
market our group life, disability, dental and vision insurance products to small and medium-sized businesses, primarily targeting our sales toward owners and human resources
professionals. We sell our group life, disability, dental and vision products in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. We continually adapt our products and pricing to meet local market
conditions. We market our fee-for-service capabilities to employers that self-insure their employees' dental, disability and vision benefits. We market our fee-for-service businesses in all 50 states
and the District of Columbia.

The
group insurance market continues to see a shift to voluntary/worksite products due to various pressures on employers. In keeping with this market change, which shifts the funding of
such products from the employer to the employee, we continue to place an enhanced focus on our voluntary benefits platform. We believe the voluntary/worksite market presents growth opportunities, and
we will continue to develop strategies to capitalize on this expanding market.

As
of December 31, 2014, we had 115 sales representatives and 141 service representatives in 28 local markets. Our sales representatives accounted for 98% of our group insurance
sales for the year ended December 31, 2014. The service representatives play a key role in servicing the case by providing local, responsive services to our customers and their brokers, such as
renewing contracts, revising plans, solving administrative issues and communicating the customers' needs and feedback to us.

Corporate Segment

Our Corporate segment manages the assets representing capital that has not been allocated to any other segment. Financial results of
the Corporate segment primarily reflect our financing activities
(including interest expense and preferred stock dividends), income on capital not allocated to other segments, inter-segment eliminations, income tax risks and certain income, expenses and other
after-tax adjustments not allocated to the segments based on the nature of such items. Results of our exited group medical insurance business are reported in this segment.

Competition

Competition in our segments is based on a number of factors including: scale, service, product features, price, investment performance,
commission structure, distribution capacity, financial strength ratings and name recognition. We compete with a large number of financial services companies such as banks, mutual funds,
broker-dealers, insurers and asset managers. Some of these companies offer a broader array of products, more competitive pricing, greater diversity of distribution sources, better brand recognition
or, with respect to insurers, higher financial strength ratings. Some may also have greater financial resources with which to compete or may have better investment performance at various times. We
believe we distinguish ourselves from our competitors through our:

•full service platform;•strong customer relationships;•focus on financial performance and•expansive product portfolio.

Ratings

Insurance companies are assigned financial strength ratings by rating agencies based upon factors relevant to policyholders. Financial
strength ratings are generally defined as opinions as to an insurer's financial strength and ability to meet ongoing obligations to policyholders. Information about ratings provides both industry
participants and insurance consumers meaningful insights on specific insurance companies. Higher ratings generally indicate financial stability and a stronger ability to pay claims.

Principal
Life and Principal National Life Insurance Company ("PNLIC") have been assigned the following insurer financial strength ratings:

Rating AgencyFinancial Strength RatingRating StructureA.M. Best Company, Inc.A+ ("Superior") with a stable outlookSecond highest of 16 rating levelsFitch Ratings Ltd.AA– ("Very Strong") with a stable outlookFourth highest of 19 rating levelsMoody's Investors ServiceA1 ("Good") with a stable outlookFifth highest of 21 rating levelsStandard & Poor'sA+ ("Strong") with a stable outlookFifth highest of 24 rating levels

A.M.
Best's ratings for insurance companies range from "A++" to "S". A.M. Best indicates that "A++" and "A+" ratings are assigned to those companies that in A.M. Best's
opinion have superior ability to meet ongoing obligations to policyholders. Fitch's ratings for insurance companies range from "AAA" to "C". Fitch "AA" ratings indicate very strong capacity to meet
policyholder and contractholder obligations on a timely basis. Moody's Investors Service ratings for insurance companies range from "Aaa" to "C". Moody's Investors Service indicates that "A" ratings
are assigned to those









companies
that have demonstrated good financial security. Standard & Poor's ratings for insurance companies range from "AAA" to "NR". Standard & Poor's indicates that "A" ratings are
assigned to those companies that have demonstrated strong financial security characteristics. In evaluating a company's financial and operating performance, these rating agencies review its
profitability, leverage and liquidity, as well as its book of business, the adequacy and soundness of its reinsurance, the quality and estimated market value of its assets, the adequacy of its policy
reserves, the soundness of its risk management programs, the experience and competency of its management and other factors. All of the four rating agencies maintain a 'stable' outlook on the U.S. life
insurance sector. The rating agencies have indicated they expect gradually increasing interest rates will help stabilize earnings on spread businesses and rising equity markets will grow assets under
management.

We
believe our strong ratings are an important factor in marketing our products to our distributors and customers, as ratings information is broadly disseminated and generally used
throughout the industry. Our ratings reflect each rating agency's opinion of our financial strength, operating performance and ability to meet our obligations to policyholders and are not evaluations
directed toward the protection of investors. Such ratings are neither a rating of securities nor a recommendation to buy, hold or sell any security, including our common stock. For more information on
ratings, see Item 7. "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Liquidity and Capital Resources — Financial
Strength and Credit Ratings."

Regulation

Our businesses are subject to regulation and supervision by U.S. federal and state regulatory authorities as well as non-U.S.
regulatory authorities for our operations outside the U.S., which can have a significant effect on our business. Our businesses are also affected by U.S. federal, state and local tax laws as well as
tax laws for jurisdictions outside the U.S.

PFG,
our parent holding company, is not licensed as an insurer, investment advisor, broker-dealer, bank or other regulated entity. However, because it is the holding company for all of
our operations, it is subject to regulation of our regulated entities, including as an insurance holding company. We are subject to legal and regulatory requirements applicable to public companies,
including public reporting and disclosure, securities trading, accounting and financial reporting and corporate governance.

U.S. Insurance Regulation

We are subject to the insurance holding company laws in the states where our insurance companies are domiciled. Principal Life and
PNLIC are domiciled in Iowa and their principal insurance regulatory authority is the Insurance Division of the Department of Commerce of the State of Iowa. Our other U.S. insurance companies are
principally regulated by the insurance departments of the states in which they are domiciled. These laws generally require each insurance company directly or indirectly owned by the holding company to
register with the insurance department in the insurance company's state of domicile and to furnish financial and other information about the operations of the companies within the holding company
system. Transactions affecting the insurers in the holding company system must be fair and at arm's length. Most states have insurance laws that require regulatory approval of a direct or indirect
change in control of an insurer or an insurer's holding company and laws requiring prior notification of state insurance departments of a change in control of a non-domiciliary insurance company doing
business in that state.

Annually,
our U.S. insurance companies must submit an opinion from a board-appointed qualified actuary to state insurance regulators, where licensed, on whether the statutory assets held
backing statutory reserves are sufficient to meet contractual obligations and related expenses of the insurer. If such an opinion cannot be rendered noting the sufficiency of assets, then the
insurance company must set up additional statutory reserves drawing from available statutory surplus until such an opinion can be given.

State
insurance departments have broad administrative powers over the insurance business, including insurance company licensing and examination, agent licensing, establishment of reserve
requirements and solvency standards, premium rate regulation, admittance of assets to statutory surplus, policy form approval, unfair trade and claims practices regulation and other matters. State
insurance statutes also typically place restrictions and limitations on the amount of dividends or other distributions payable by insurance company subsidiaries to their parent companies. See
Item 7. "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Liquidity and Capital Resources" for further details.

In
order to enhance the regulation of insurer solvency, the National Association of Insurance Commissioners ("NAIC") has established risk-based capital standards. The standards require
life insurers to submit a report to state regulators on an annual basis regarding their risk-based capital based upon four categories of risk: asset risk, insurance risk, interest rate risk and
business risk. As of December 31, 2013, the statutory surplus of each of our U.S.
life insurance companies exceeded the minimum level of risk-based capital requirements required before state insurance departments would take action against an insurer.

State
and federal insurance and securities regulatory authorities and other state law enforcement agencies and attorneys general regularly make inquiries and conduct examinations or
investigations regarding our compliance with, among other things, insurance laws and securities laws.









Each
state has insurance guaranty association laws under which insurers doing business in a state can be assessed, up to prescribed limits, in order to cover contractual benefit
obligations of insolvent insurance companies. The guaranty associations levy assessments on each member insurer in a jurisdiction on the basis of the proportionate share of the premiums written by
such insurer in the lines of business in which the insolvent insurer is engaged. Some jurisdictions permit the member insurers to recover the assessments paid through full or partial premium tax
offsets.

Securities Regulation

Insurance and investment products such as variable annuities, variable life insurance and some funding agreements that constitute
securities and mutual fund products are subject to securities laws and regulations, including state securities regulation as well as federal regulation under the SEC, the Financial Industry Regulatory
Authority and other regulatory authorities. These regulations affect investment advice, sales and related activities for these products.

We
also have entities which are registered as investment advisers with the SEC under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.

Employee Retirement Income Security Act

As we provide products and services for U.S. employee benefit plans, we are subject to regulation under the Employee Retirement Income
Security Act ("ERISA"). ERISA provisions include reporting and disclosure requirements and standards of conduct.

Banking Regulation

Principal Bank, a wholly owned subsidiary, is a federal savings bank regulated by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency.
Principal Bank's deposits are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ("FDIC"), making the Bank subject to certain of the FDIC's regulations.

Environmental Regulation

As we own and operate real property, we are subject to federal, state and local environmental laws and could be subject to
environmental liabilities and costs associated with required remediation of our properties. We routinely have environmental assessments performed for real estate being acquired or used as collateral
for commercial mortgages we use for investment.

Regulation of International Businesses

Our international businesses are supervised by regulatory authorities in the jurisdictions in which they operate.

Risk Management

Like all financial services companies, we are exposed to a wide variety of financial, operational and other risks, as described in
Item 1A. "Risk Factors." Effective enterprise risk management is, therefore, a key component of our business model. Enterprise risk management helps us to:

•identify and manage those risks that present profitable growth opportunities, and avoid those that do not and•balance the sometimes competing demands of our various stakeholders, meet our customer obligations, satisfy regulatory requirements
and optimize shareholder returns relative to the risks we take.

We
utilize an integrated risk management framework to help us identify, assess, monitor, report and manage our risks within established limits and risk tolerances. The framework delivers
important perspective that is used in strategic and tactical decision making and is adaptable to changes in our businesses and in the external environments in which we operate. Our approach also
requires a commitment to continuous improvement and periodic validation.

Our
governance structure includes Board of Director oversight, internal risk committees, a corporate risk management function and embedded risk professionals in all of our business units
and functional areas. Our Board of Directors, Audit Committee, Finance Committee, Human Resource Committee and Nominating and Governance Committee provide oversight no less frequently than quarterly,
addressing various aspects and assessments of our risk profile. Quarterly reports on risk topics and an annual enterprise-wide risk report are provided to the Board of Directors by the Corporate Chief
Risk Officer.

Our
internal risk committees meet on a regular and frequent basis to discuss various issues and reflect on profile status. Each business unit and key functional area has its own risk
committee that is responsible for oversight of all risks within the unit. These committees typically include key corporate leaders. We also have committees that provide oversight around a certain risk
or group of related risks across the organization. This matrix approach helps us maintain comprehensive risk coverage and preserve an integrated view of risks. Two committees reside at the top of our
internal risk committee hierarchy. The Corporate Strategic Working Group provides enterprise-wide oversight around our strategic risk profile and the Enterprise Risk Management Committee, comprised of
members from corporate senior management, exercises enterprise-wide oversight around all other risk profiles.









The business units and functional areas are responsible for identifying, assessing, monitoring, reporting and managing their own risks. Chief Risk Officers
embedded within each business unit or risk professionals in functional areas help align risk management practice with the strategies of the unit as well as with enterprise-wide objectives. The
Corporate Chief Risk Officer and supporting staff are separate from the business units and provide objective oversight, framework enablement and aggregated risk analysis. Internal Audit provides
independent assurance around effective risk management design and control execution.

We
have established risk tolerances from an overall corporate perspective, a business unit perspective and for specific categories of risks. We monitor a variety of risk metrics on an
ongoing basis and take the appropriate steps to help us stay within our established risk tolerances. Potentially significant actions are considered in terms of the possible impact on our risk profile,
including but not limited to the capital required, the impact on near term and long-term earnings and the ability to meet our targets with respect to return on equity, liquidity, debt/capital, cash
coverage, business risk and operational risk. Quarterly risk reporting provides a feedback loop between the business units and the Corporate Chief Risk Officer and includes, among other things,
emerging risk outlooks or incident reporting, if necessary. We have developed a Business Continuity Management Program that identifies critical business functions and includes plans for their
protection and recovery in the event of a disaster or other business interruption.

We
regularly build upon our already strong risk management practices to incorporate updated modeling tools, processes and metrics, which we actively use to better understand and manage
our business.

Employees

As of December 31, 2014, we had 14,873 employees. None of our employees are subject to collective bargaining agreements
governing employment with us. We believe that our employee relations are satisfactory.

Internet Website

Our Internet website can be found at www.principal.com. We make available free of charge, on or through our Internet website, access to
our annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or
15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as soon as reasonably practicable after such material is filed with or furnished to the SEC. Also available free of charge on our Internet website is our
code of business conduct and ethics, corporate governance guidelines and charters for the Audit, Finance, Human Resources and Nominating and Governance committees of our Board of Directors. Also see
