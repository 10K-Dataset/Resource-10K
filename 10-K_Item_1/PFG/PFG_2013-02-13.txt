Item 1.    Business

Principal Financial Group, Inc. ("PFG") is a global investment management leader offering retirement services, insurance
solutions and asset management. We offer businesses, individuals and institutional clients a wide range of financial products and services, including retirement, asset management and insurance through
our diverse family of financial services companies. We have $403.0 billion in assets under management ("AUM") and approximately 18.3 million customers worldwide as of December 31,
2012.

We
primarily focus on small and medium-sized businesses, which we define as companies with less than 1,000 employees, providing a broad array of retirement and employee benefit solutions
to meet the needs of the business, the business owner and their employees. We are the leading provider of corporate defined contribution plans in the U.S., according to Spectrem Group. We are also the
leading employee stock ownership plan consultant. In addition, we are a leading provider of nonqualified plans, defined benefit plans and plan termination annuities. We are also one of the largest
providers of specialty benefits insurance product solutions.

We
believe small and medium-sized businesses are an underserved market, offering attractive growth opportunities in the U.S. in retirement services and other employee benefits. We also
believe there is a significant opportunity to leverage our U.S. retirement expertise into select international markets that have adopted or are moving toward private sector defined contribution
pension systems. This opportunity is particularly compelling as aging populations around the world are driving increased demand for retirement accumulation, retirement asset management and retirement
income management solutions.

Our Reportable Segments

We organize our businesses into the following reportable segments:

•Retirement and Investor Services;•Principal Global Investors;•Principal International and•U.S. Insurance Solutions.

We
also have a Corporate segment, which consists of the assets and activities that have not been allocated to any other segment.

See
Item 8. "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 16, Segment Information" for financial results of our segments,
including our operating revenues for our products and services described in each of the subsequent segment discussions.

Retirement and Investor Services Segment

Our asset accumulation activities in the U.S. date back to the 1940s when we first began providing pension plan products and services.
We now offer a comprehensive portfolio of asset accumulation products and services for retirement savings and investment:

•To businesses of all sizes with a concentration on small and medium-sized businesses, we offer products and services for
defined contribution pension plans, including 401(k) and 403(b) plans, defined benefit pension plans, nonqualified executive benefit plans and employee stock ownership plan ("ESOP") consulting
services. For more basic investment needs, we offer SIMPLE Individual Retirement Accounts ("IRA") and payroll deduction plans;•To large institutional clients, we also offer investment-only products, including guaranteed investment
contracts ("GICs") and funding agreements and•To employees of businesses and other individuals, we offer the ability to accumulate savings for retirement and other
purposes through mutual funds, individual annuities and bank products.

We
organize our Retirement and Investor Services operations into two business groupings:

•Accumulation business — which includes full service accumulation, Principal Funds (our mutual fund
business), individual annuities and bank and trust services; and•Guaranteed business — which includes investment only and full service payout.









Accumulation Business

Full Service Accumulation

Products

We offer a wide variety of investment and administrative products for defined contribution pension plans, including 401(k) and 403(b)
plans, defined benefit pension plans, nonqualified executive benefit plans and ESOPs. A 403(b) plan is a plan described in Section 403(b) of the Internal Revenue Code that provides retirement
benefits for employees of tax-exempt organizations and public schools.

Full
service accumulation products respond to the needs of plan sponsors seeking both administrative and investment services for defined contribution plans or defined benefit plans. The
investment component of both the defined contribution and defined benefit plans may be in the form of a general account, separate account, a mutual fund offering or a collective investment trust. In
addition, defined contribution plans may also offer their own employer security as an investment option.

We
deliver both administrative and investment services to our defined contribution plan and defined benefit plan customers through annuities and mutual funds. Group annuities and the
underlying investment options are not required to be registered with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"). Our mutual fund offering is called Principal Advantage. It is a
qualified plan product based on our series mutual fund, Principal Funds, Inc. We offer investments covering the full range of stable value, equity, fixed income, real estate and international
investment options managed by our Principal Global Investors segment as well as third-party asset managers.

As
of December 31, 2012, we provided full service accumulation products to (a) over 30,700 defined contribution pension plans, of which approximately 25,500 were 401(k)
plans, including $93.7 billion in assets and covering 3.4 million eligible plan participants, and (b) to over 2,400 defined benefit pension plans, including $15.9 billion
in assets and covering over 354,000 eligible plan participants. As of December 31, 2012, approximately 61% of our full service accumulation account values were managed by our affiliated asset
manager, Principal Global Investors. Third-party asset managers provide asset management services with respect to the remaining assets.

Markets and Distribution

We offer our full service accumulation products and services to employer-sponsored pension plans, including qualified and nonqualified
defined contribution plans and defined benefit plans. Our primary target market is plans sponsored by small and medium-sized businesses, which we believe remains under-penetrated. According to
Spectrem Group, in 2011, only 25% of businesses with between 10 and 49 employees, 50% of businesses with between 50 and 99 employees, 56% of businesses with between 100 and 249 employees and 69% of
businesses with between 250 and 500 employees offered a 401(k) plan. The same study indicates that 75% of employers with between 500 and 1,000 employees, 78% of employers with between 1,000 and 5,000
employees and 79% of employers with 5,000 or more employees offered a 401(k) plan in 2011.

We
distribute our full service accumulation products and services nationally, primarily through a captive retirement services sales force. As of December 31, 2012, over 117
retirement services sales representatives in over 42 offices, operating as a wholesale distribution network, maintained relationships with over 12,100 independent brokers, consultants and agents.
Retirement services sales representatives are an integral part of the sales process alongside the referring consultant or independent broker. We compensate retirement services sales representatives
through a blend of salary and production-based incentives, while we pay independent brokers, consultants and agents a commission or fee.

As
of December 31, 2012, we had a separate staff of over 280 service and education specialists located in the sales offices who play a key role in the ongoing servicing of pension
plans by providing local services to our customers, such as reviewing plan performance, investment options and plan design; communicating the customers' needs and feedback to us and helping employees
understand the benefits of their pension plans. The following summarizes our distribution channels:

•We distribute our annuity-based products through sales representatives, agents and brokers who are primarily state
licensed individuals.•Principal Advantage, our mutual fund-based product, is targeted at defined contribution plans through
broker-dealer distribution channels. Principal Advantage gives us access to Financial Industry Regulatory Authority-registered distributors who are not traditional sellers of annuity-based products
and broadens opportunities for us in the investment advisor and broker-dealer distribution channels.•Principal Retirement Income Edge® is designed to create a coordinated experience from accumulation to income
management for advisors to use with their individual clients and plan participants who are nearing or enjoying retirement. The Principal Retirement Income Edge® program provides education
and planning tools as well as a wide variety of products such as annuities, mutual funds and bank products to provide personalized income management solutions.•Through our Retire Secure strategy we provide financial education and assistance to individual investors who are
participants/members of employer-based accumulation solutions to help them achieve financial security.









We
believe our approach to full service accumulation plan services distribution gives us a local sales and service presence that differentiates us from many of our competitors. We have
also established a number of marketing and distribution relationships to increase the sales of our accumulation products.

Principal Funds

We have been providing mutual funds to customers since 1969. We offer mutual funds to individuals, businesses and institutional
investors for use within variable life and variable annuity contracts, for use in employer-sponsored pension plans, as a rollover investment option, and for general investment purposes.

Markets and Distribution

Our markets for PFI's retail share classes are individuals seeking to accumulate savings for retirement and other purposes, as well as
nonqualified individual savings plans utilizing payroll deductions. We also market PFI's retail share classes to participants in pension plans who are departing their plans and reinvesting their
retirement assets into individual retirement accounts.

We
sell PFI's share classes primarily through registered representatives from other broker-dealers; affiliated financial representatives; independent brokers registered with our
securities broker-dealer, Princor; direct deposits from our employees and others and Principal Connection. As of December 31, 2012, 63 retail sales representatives across the United States,
operating as a wholesale distribution network, maintained relationships with over 47,000 independent brokers, consultants and agents. Principal Connection is our direct response distribution channel
for retail financial services products to individuals. Principal Connection's services are available over the phone, on the Internet or by mail. Princor recruits, trains and supervises registered
representatives selling our products through Principal Connection.

Individual Annuities

Individual annuities offer a tax-deferred means of accumulating retirement savings, as well as a tax-efficient
source of income during the payout period.

Products

We offer both fixed and variable annuities to individuals and pension plans. Individual annuities may be categorized in two ways:
(1) deferred, in which case assets accumulate until the contract is surrendered, the customer dies or the









customer
begins receiving benefits under an annuity payout option, or (2) immediate/payout, in which case payments begin within one year of issue and continue for a fixed period of time or for
life.

Fixed Deferred Annuities.Our individual fixed deferred annuities consist of both single premium deferred annuity contracts and
flexible premium
deferred annuity contracts ("FPDAs"). Some FPDA contracts limit the period of time deposits are allowed (e.g., only one year). For most contracts, the principal amount is guaranteed. We credit
the customer's account with a fixed interest rate and for a specified number of years. Thereafter, we reset, typically annually, the interest rate credited to the contract based upon our discretion,
subject to contractual minimums, by taking into account market and other conditions. We also offer a fixed deferred annuity where the interest credited is linked to an external equity index, subject
to maximum and minimum values. Our major source of income from fixed deferred annuities is the spread between the investment income earned on the underlying general account assets and the interest
rate credited to the contracts. We bear the investment risk because, while we credit customers' accounts with a stated interest rate, we cannot be certain the investment income we earn on our general
account assets will exceed that rate. The Principal Global Investors segment manages the assets supporting these contracts.

Variable Deferred Annuities.

Fixed Immediate Annuities.Our individual fixed immediate annuities consist almost exclusively of single premium immediate
annuity contracts
("SPIAs"). SPIAs are products where the customer makes a single deposit and from which periodic benefit payments are made. Payments may be contingent upon the survival of one or two individuals or
payments may be fixed, meaning payments are contractually guaranteed and do not depend on the continuing survival of any individual. Our major source of income from fixed immediate annuities is the
spread between the investment income earned on the underlying general account assets and the interest rate implied in the calculation of annuity benefit payments. We bear the investment risk because
we cannot be certain the investment income we earn on our general account assets will exceed the rate implied in the SPIA contracts. The Principal Global Investors segment manages the assets
supporting these contracts.

Markets and Distribution

Our target markets for individual annuities include owners, executives and employees of small and medium-sized businesses and
individuals seeking to accumulate and/or eventually receive distributions of assets for retirement. We market both fixed and variable annuities to individuals for both qualified and nonqualified
retirement savings.

We
sell our individual annuity products through our affiliated financial representatives, who accounted for 46%, 50% and 43% of annuity sales for the years ended December 31,
2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The remaining sales were made through banks, brokerage general agencies, mutual fund companies, Principal Connection and unaffiliated broker-dealer firms. Affiliated
financial representatives continued to be the primary distribution channel of our variable deferred annuities. The majority of overall annuity sales, however, were from non-affiliated
distribution channels, as a result of focused efforts to increase fixed annuity sales through non-affiliated distribution channels.

Bank and Trust Services

Bank and trust services includes Principal Bank and Principal Trust Company. Principal Bank is a federal savings bank that began its
activities in February 1998. As of December 31, 2012, Principal Bank had over 254,000 customers and approximately $2.4 billion in assets. Delaware Charter Guarantee & Trust
Company, dba Principal Trust Company, is a Delaware state chartered non-deposit trust company that was chartered in 1899. It is one of the largest non-deposit trust companies
in the U.S. As of December 31, 2012, we served as trustee to over 247,000 accounts, which held assets of approximately $127.6 billion. Principal Trust Company may not accept deposits and
cannot make personal or commercial loans.









Products

Our current bank products and services include a suite of consumer checking and savings accounts, money market accounts, certificates
of deposit ("CDs"), individual retirement accounts, small account rollovers from qualified retirement plans and sweep accounts associated with affiliated brokerage accounts. Principal Bank
participates in the Certificate of Deposit Account Registry Service program through which certain customer CDs are exchanged for CDs of similar amounts from participating banks. The deposit products
provide a relatively stable source of funding and liquidity and are used to fund purchases of investment securities and loans.

Principal
Trust Company specializes in providing trust solutions for a full array of employee benefit plans and accounts including 401(k) and 403(b) plans, defined benefit pension plans,
nonqualified executive benefit plans, ESOPs, and self-directed tax-advantaged savings accounts, such as IRAs. Principal Trust Company also maintains collective investment funds
and provides personal trust services.

Markets and Distribution

We offer our bank products and services to employees of businesses and other individuals with a primary focus on helping customers
accumulate savings for retirement and other purposes. We also pursue asset retention strategies with customers who seek to transfer assets from our other asset accumulation products by offering them
our banking products and services. Principal Bank services customers through the telephone, mail and Internet.

We
deliver our directed trust services and collective investment funds to customers through our PFG affiliates and affiliated financial representatives. Administrative trust services for
self-directed tax-advantaged savings accounts are sold through non-affiliated brokerage firms, clearing firms, financial advisors and asset managers.

Guaranteed Business

Investment Only

Products

The three primary products for which we provide investment only services are: GICs, funding agreements and other investment only
products.

GICs
and funding agreements pay a specified rate of return. The rate of return can be a floating rate based on an external market index or a fixed rate. Our investment only products
contain provisions disallowing or limiting early surrenders, including penalties for early surrenders and minimum notice requirements.

Deposits
to investment only products are predominantly in the form of single payments. As a result, the level of new deposits can fluctuate from one fiscal quarter to another. Assets
invested in GICs and funding agreements generate a spread between the investment income earned by us and the amount credited to the customer. Our other investment only products consist of separate
accounts invested in either equities or fixed income instruments. The Principal Global Investors segment manages the assets supporting investment only account values.

Markets and Distribution

We market GICs and funding agreements primarily to pension plan sponsors and other institutions. We also offer them as part of our full
service accumulation products. We sell our GICs primarily to plan sponsors for funding of tax-qualified retirement plans. We sell our funding agreements directly to institutions that may
or may not be pension funds and unconsolidated special purpose vehicles domiciled either in the U.S. or offshore for funding agreement-backed note programs. The funding agreements sold as part of
these funding agreement-backed note programs work by having investors purchase debt obligations from the special purpose vehicle which, in turn, purchases the funding agreement from us with terms
similar to those of the debt obligations. The strength of this market is dependent on debt capital market conditions. As a result, our sales through this channel can vary widely from one quarter to
another. In addition to the special purpose vehicle selling the funding agreement-backed notes to U.S. and foreign institutional investors, the special purpose vehicle may also sell notes to U.S.
retail investors through a SEC-registered shelf debt issuance program.

Full Service Payout

Products

Full service payout products respond to the needs of pension plan participants who, upon retirement or termination of their employment,
seek a guaranteed income stream. Plan participants who seek these services include those from pension plans we service, as well as pension plans other providers service. We primarily offer single
premium group annuities, which are immediate or deferred annuities that provide a current or future specific income amount, fully guaranteed by us. These are available to defined contribution and
defined benefit plan participants. We make regular payments to individuals, invest the underlying assets on their behalf and provide tax reporting to them. We also reinsure single premium immediate
annuities issued by another insurer.









Single
premium group annuities are traditionally used in conjunction with defined benefit plans, particularly those where the plan is being terminated. In such instances, the plan
sponsor transfers all its obligations under the plan to an insurer by paying a single premium. Increasingly, these products are purchased by defined contribution plan participants who reach retirement
age. Generally, plan sponsors restrict their purchases to insurance companies with superior or excellent financial quality ratings because the Department of Labor has mandated that annuities be
purchased only from the "safest available" insurers.

Premium
received from full service payout products are generally in the form of single payments. As a result, the level of new premiums can fluctuate depending on the number of
retirements and large-scale annuity sales in a particular fiscal quarter. The Principal Global Investors segment manages the assets supporting full service payout account values.

Markets and Distribution

Our primary distribution channel for full service payout products is comprised of several specialized home office sales consultants
working through consultants and brokers that specialize in this type of business. Our sales consultants also make sales directly to institutions. Our nationally dispersed retirement services sales
representatives act as a secondary distribution channel for these products. Principal Connection also distributes full service payout products to participants in plans we service who are terminating
employment or retiring.

Principal Global Investors Segment

Our Principal Global Investors segment manages assets for sophisticated investors around the world, using a multi-boutique strategy
that enables the segment to provide an expanded range of diverse investment capabilities including equity, fixed income and real estate investments. We also have experience in currency management,
asset allocation, stable value management and other structured investment strategies. We focus on providing services to our other segments and third-party institutional clients. We maintain offices in

contribution pension systems and individual long-term savings. Through the Principal International segment, we offer retirement products and services, annuities, mutual funds,
institutional asset management and life insurance accumulation products.

Products, Markets and Distribution

Brazil.We offer pension, retirement income and asset accumulation products through a co-managed joint venture, Brasilprev
Seguros e
Previdencia ("Brasilprev") in which PFG owns 25% of the economic interest and 50.01% of the voting shares. The partner is Banco do Brasil ("Banco"), which had approximately 5,340 Brazilian branches as
of September 30, 2012. Brasilprev has an exclusive agreement with Banco to distribute pension, retirement and long-term asset accumulation products. Our joint venture provides
defined contribution products, complementary life protection and payout solutions for the retirement needs of employers and individuals. Banco's employees sell these products directly to individual
clients through its bank branches. In addition, our joint venture reaches corporate clients through two wholesale distribution channels: (1) a network of independent brokers who sell to the
public and (2) Banco's corporate account executives who sell to existing and prospective corporate clients. According to Federação Nacional de
Previdência e Vida, our joint venture ranked third in the Brazilian private pension market based upon managed assets as of October 31, 2012.

On
April 2, 2012, we purchased a 60% indirect ownership in Claritas Administração de Recursos Ltda ("Claritas"), a leading Brazilian mutual
fund and asset management company. The Sao Paulo-based company manages equity funds, balanced funds, managed accounts and other strategies for affluent clients and institutions through its
multi-channel distribution network. This purchase positions us to capture future growth expected in the mutual fund and asset management business in Brazil.

institutional
asset management services.

annuities are offered to individuals exiting the pre-retirement accumulation system. Annuity products are distributed through a network of brokers and independent

(qualified group retirement solutions that are similar to the U.S. 401(k) product line). According to the Asociacion de Adminstradoras de Fondos Mutuous de Chile, we ranked first in AUM for mutual
fund companies offering these plans in Chile as of November 30, 2012. The plans, together with non-qualified mutual fund products, are distributed to retail clients through our
proprietary sales force, financial advisors, brokerage houses, alliances with financial institutions and one of the largest retailers in Chile, Falabella.

Mandatory Provident Fund ("MPF"). We target small and medium-sized employers and distribute products mainly through strategic alliances with intermediaries, e.g., insurance companies, brokers,
consultants and banks. We have expanded our distribution capability to complement our MPF and mutual fund businesses by developing a proprietary sales force through a wholly owned investment financial
planning company that will focus on retirement and long-term investment products.

We
sell mutual funds to retail customers primarily through strategic alliances with banks. To grow institutional asset management, our operations in Hong Kong SAR leverage Principal
Global Investors' regional asset management and sales resources to jointly secure mandates.

India.We offer mutual funds and asset management services to both retail and corporate customers.

In
the mutual funds market, we compete by managing and administering funds for both individuals and corporations through a majority-owned joint venture. The minority partners are Punjab
National Bank and Vijaya Bank, two large Indian commercial banks with a combined network of approximately 7,000 branches. Mutual funds are sold through regional offices and other bank branches located
throughout India. In addition to the current mutual fund business, we are positioning ourselves to compete in the emerging pension and long-term savings market in
India through the launch of a proprietary distribution company in October 2012 that will focus on retirement and long-term investment products.

Mexico.We offer defined contribution pension products, mutual funds, annuities and asset management services to institutional
clients.

in Mexico.

administer previously sold annuities and life products.

agents selling to retail customers as of December 31, 2012. We also market mutual funds through wholesale bank channels. The joint venture's main bank channels include approximately 1,100 bank

The
joint venture also has operations in Singapore (CIMB-Principal Asset Management (S) Pte Ltd), Indonesia (PT CIMB-Principal Asset Management) and

U.S. Insurance Solutions Segment

Our U.S. Insurance Solutions segment offers individual and group insurance solutions. We focus on providing comprehensive insurance
solutions for small and medium-sized businesses and their owners and executives. We organize our operations into two divisions: Individual Life Insurance and Specialty Benefits Insurance. However, we
share key resources in our core areas such as strategic leadership, distribution, and marketing.









Individual Life Insurance

We began as an individual life insurer in 1879. Our U.S. operations administer approximately 539,000 individual life insurance policies
with over $167.4 billion of individual life insurance in force as of December 31, 2012. We assist not only in personal insurance but also specialize in business insurance needs for small
to medium-sized companies through our wide range of business and nonqualified solutions.

Small
and medium-sized companies are challenged with how to build quality benefits packages for executives, how to transition the company's ownership to a partner or family member and
how to save for retirement. In addition, executives and other key employees often have personal insurance needs. These needs are the focus of our products within the individual life insurance arena.

Products and Services

Our Business Owner and Executive Solutions platform as well as our nonqualified deferred compensation offering combines administration
and consulting to service our client's needs. We target the business and personal insurance needs of owners and executives of small and medium-sized businesses with an increasing focus on providing
insurance solutions for nonqualified executive benefits. In addition, we market our products to meet traditional retail insurance needs. We offer a variety of individual life insurance products,
including universal life insurance, variable universal life insurance and term life insurance.

Universal and Variable Universal Life Insurance.Universal and variable universal life insurance products offer the policyholder
the option of
adjusting both the premium and the death benefit amounts of the insurance contract. Universal life insurance typically includes a cash value account that accumulates at a credited interest rate based
on the investment returns of the block of business. Variable universal life insurance is credited with the investment returns of the various investment options selected. For the year ended
December 31, 2012, 77% of individual life insurance annualized first year premium sales were generated from universal and variable universal life insurance products. Universal and variable
universal life insurance represents 69% of individual life insurance premium and deposits for the year ended December 31, 2012, and 45% of individual life insurance in force as of
December 31, 2012.
Variable universal life insurance products represented 27% of our universal and variable universal life insurance deposits for the year ended December 31, 2012.

After
a deduction for policy level expenses, we credit net deposits to an account maintained for the policyholder. For universal life contracts, the entire account balance is invested in
the general account. Interest is credited to the policyholder's account based on the earnings on general account investments. For variable universal life contracts, the policyholder may allocate the
account balance among our general account and a variety of separate account choices. Interest is credited on amounts allocated to the Principal Life general account in the same manner as for universal
life. Net investment performance on separate account investments is allocated directly to the policyholder accounts; the policyholder bears the investment risk. Some of our universal life and variable
universal life insurance contracts contain what are commonly referred to as "secondary" or "no-lapse" guarantee provisions. A no-lapse guarantee keeps the contract in force,
even if the contractholder's account balance is insufficient to cover all of the contract charges, provided that the contractholder has continually paid a specified minimum premium.

Traditional Life Insurance.Traditional life insurance includes participating whole life, adjustable life products and
non-participating
term life insurance products. Participating products and non-participating term life insurance products represented 3% and 20%, respectively, of our individual life insurance annualized
first year premium sales for the year ended December 31, 2012, and 13% and 42%, respectively, of individual life insurance in force as of December 31, 2012. Adjustable life insurance
products provide a guaranteed benefit in return for the payment of a fixed premium and allow the policyholder to set the coverage period, premium and face amount combination. Term insurance products
provide a guaranteed death benefit for a specified period of time in return for the payment of a fixed premium. Policyholder dividends are not paid on term insurance.

Specialty Benefits Insurance

Specialty benefits insurance, which includes group dental, vision, life and disability insurance, wellness programs and individual
disability insurance, is an important component of the employee benefit offering at small and medium-sized businesses. We offer traditional employer sponsored and voluntary products for group dental,
vision, life and disability. We also offer group dental, vision, and disability on a fee-for-service basis.









Products and Services

Group Dental and Vision Insurance.We began selling group dental and vision insurance in the late 1960's. Our plans provide
partial reimbursement for
dental and vision expenses. As of December 31, 2012, we had nearly 34,000 group dental and vision insurance policies in force covering over 893,000 employee lives. According to Life Insurance
and Market Research Association ("LIMRA"), we were the 7th largest group dental insurer in terms of number of contracts/employer groups in force in 2011. In addition to indemnity and preferred
provider organization dental offered on both an employer paid and voluntary basis, we offer a prepaid dental plan in Arizona through our Employers Dental Services, Inc. subsidiary. On
November 1, 2012, we finalized the purchase of a 100% interest in First Dental Health, a California based independent dental preferred provider organization. We acquired First Dental Health to
expand our owned dental networks primarily in California.

Group Life Insurance.Group life insurance was one of our first group products beginning in the early 1940's. Our group life
insurance provides
coverage to employees and their dependents for a specified period. As of December 31, 2012, we had over 45,000 group policies providing over $115.3 billion of group life insurance in
force to approximately 1.9 million employee lives. According to LIMRA in 2011, we were ranked 6th in the U.S. in terms of the number of group life insurance contracts in force. We
currently sell traditional group life insurance that does not provide for accumulation of cash values on both an employer paid and voluntary basis. Our group life insurance business remains focused on
the traditional, annually renewable term product. Group term life and group universal life accounted for 97% and 3%, respectively, of our total group life insurance in force as of December 31,
2012. We no longer market group universal life insurance to new employer groups.

Group Disability Insurance.Group disability insurance has also been sold since the early 1940's. Our group disability insurance
provides a benefit
to insured employees who become disabled. In most instances, this benefit is in the form of a monthly income. Our group disability products include both short-term and
long-term disability, offered on both an employer paid and voluntary basis. As of December 31, 2012, long-term disability represents 65% of total group disability
premium, while short-term disability represents 35% of total group disability premium. In addition, we provide disability management services, also called rehabilitation services, to
assist individuals in returning to work as quickly as possible following disability. We also work with disability claimants to improve the approval rate of Social Security benefits, thereby reducing
payment of benefits by the amount of Social Security payments received. As of December 31, 2012, we served approximately 1.3 million employee lives under nearly 33,000 contracts.
According to LIMRA, our group short-term disability business was ranked 5th and our group long-term disability business was ranked 4th in the U.S. as of
December 31, 2011, in terms of number of contracts/employer groups in force.

Individual Disability Insurance.Individual disability insurance has been sold since the early 1950's. Our individual disability
insurance products
provide income protection to the insured member and/or business in the event of disability. In most instances, this benefit is in the form of a monthly income. In addition to income replacement, we
offer products to pay business-related costs such as overhead expenses for a disabled business owner, buy-out costs for business owners purchasing a disabled owner's interest in the
business, expenditures for replacement of a key person and business loan payments. We also offer a product to protect retirement savings in the event of disability. As of December 31, 2012, we
served approximately 150,000 individual disability policyholders, with our individual disability business being ranked 7th in the U.S. as of December 31, 2011, in terms of premium in
force, according to LIMRA.

Wellness.We recognize the importance of promoting healthy behavior. Our programs are designed to improve health, reduce health
insurance claim
costs, reduce absenteeism and increase employee productivity. We work with employers to create a healthy culture through our year round wellness program, wellness screenings, counseling to high risk
participants and other services. Wellness has been a part of the Specialty Benefits Insurance division since 2011.

Fee-for-Service.We offer administration of group dental, disability and vision benefits on a
fee-for-service basis. The fee-for-service business also became a part of the Specialty Benefits Insurance division in 2011.

U.S. Insurance Solutions Markets and Distribution

For each of our products, administration and distribution channels are customized to meet customer needs and expectations for that
product.

We
sell our individual life and individual disability income products in all 50 states and the District of Columbia, primarily targeting owners and executives of small and medium-sized
businesses. Small and medium-sized business sales represented 55% of individual life sales and 60% of individual disability sales for the year ended December 31, 2012. Much of our life
insurance sales efforts focus on the Business Owner & Executive Solutions market. This strategy offers solutions to address business owner financial challenges such as exiting the business,
business transition, retaining key employees and retirement planning. Key employees also have needs to supplement retirement income, survivor income, and business protection. We believe the Business
Owner & Executive Solutions segment offers growth opportunities and we will continue to develop strategies to capitalize on this expanding market.

We
distribute our individual life and individual disability insurance products through our affiliated financial representatives and independent brokers, as well as other marketing and
distribution alliances. Affiliated financial representatives were responsible for 28% of individual life insurance sales based on first year annualized premium and









12%
of individual disability sales for the year ended December 31, 2012. We had 1,071 affiliated financial representatives in 29 offices as of December 31, 2012. Although they are
independent contractors, we have a close tie with affiliated financial representatives and we offer them benefits, training and access to tools and expertise. To meet the needs of the various
marketing channels, particularly the independent brokers, we employ wholesale distributors — Regional Vice Presidents for individual life and Regional Vice Presidents for individual
disability. A key differentiator in the nonqualified executive benefit sale is our Regional Vice Presidents — Nonqualified Plans, who are not only wholesalers but also consultants and
subject-matter experts providing point-of-sale support in closing cases.

We
market our group life, disability, dental and vision insurance products to small and medium-sized businesses, primarily targeting our sales toward owners and human resources
professionals. We sell our group life, disability, dental and vision products in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. We continually adapt our products and pricing to meet local market
conditions. We market our fee-for-service capabilities to employers that self-insure their employees' dental, disability and vision benefits. We market our wellness
and fee-for-service businesses in all 50 states and the District of Columbia.

The
group insurance market continues to see a shift to voluntary/worksite products due to various pressures on employers. In keeping with this market change, which shifts the funding of
such products from the employer to the employee, we continue to place an enhanced focus on our voluntary benefits platform. We believe the voluntary/worksite market presents growth opportunities, and
we will continue to develop strategies to capitalize on this expanding market.

As
of December 31, 2012, we had 108 sales representatives and 119 service representatives in 29 offices. Our sales representatives accounted for 96% of our group insurance sales
for the year ended December 31, 2012. The group sales force plays a key role in the ongoing servicing of the case by providing local, responsive services to our
customers and their brokers, such as renewing contracts, revising plans and solving any administrative issues; communicating the customers' needs and feedback to us and helping employees understand
the benefits of their plans.

Corporate Segment

Our Corporate segment manages the assets representing capital that has not been allocated to any other segment. Financial results of
the Corporate segment primarily reflect our financing activities (including interest expense and preferred stock dividends), income on capital not allocated to other segments, inter-segment
eliminations, income tax risks and certain income, expenses and other after-tax adjustments not allocated to the segments based on the nature of such items. Results of our exited group
medical insurance business are reported in this segment. For further details, see Item 7. "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations — Transactions Affecting Comparability of Results of Operations."

Competition

Competition in our segments is based on a number of factors including: scale, service, product features, price, investment performance,
commission structure, distribution capacity, financial strength ratings and name recognition. We compete with a large number of financial services companies such as banks, mutual funds,
broker-dealers, insurers and asset managers. Some of these companies offer a broader array of products, more competitive pricing, greater diversity of distribution sources, better brand recognition
or, with respect to insurers, higher financial strength ratings. Some may also have greater financial resources with which to compete or may have better investment performance at various times. We
believe we distinguish ourselves from our competitors through our:

•full service platform;•strong customer relationships;•focus on financial performance and•expansive product portfolio.

Ratings

Insurance companies are assigned financial strength ratings by rating agencies based upon factors relevant to policyholders. Financial
strength ratings are generally defined as opinions as to an insurer's financial strength and ability to meet ongoing obligations to policyholders. Information about ratings provides both industry
participants and insurance consumers meaningful insights on specific insurance companies. Higher ratings generally indicate financial stability and a stronger ability to pay claims.









Principal
Life and Principal National Life Insurance Company ("PNLIC") have been assigned the following insurer financial strength ratings:

Rating AgencyFinancial Strength RatingRating StructureA.M. Best Company, Inc.A+ ("Superior") with a stable outlookSecond highest of 16 rating levelsFitch Ratings Ltd.AA- ("Very Strong") with a negative outlookFourth highest of 21 rating levelsMoody's Investors ServiceAa3 ("Excellent") with a negative outlookFourth highest of 21 rating levelsStandard & Poor'sA+ ("Strong") with a negative outlookFifth highest of 21 rating levels

We
believe our strong ratings are an important factor in marketing our products to our distributors and customers, as ratings information is broadly disseminated and generally used
throughout the industry. Our ratings reflect each rating agency's opinion of our financial strength, operating performance and ability to meet our obligations to policyholders and are not evaluations
directed toward the protection of investors. Such ratings are neither a rating of securities nor a recommendation to buy, hold or sell any security, including our common stock. For more information on
ratings, see Item 7. "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Liquidity and Capital Resources — Financial
Strength Rating and Credit Ratings."

Regulation

Our businesses are subject to regulation and supervision by U.S. federal and state regulatory authorities as well as
non-U.S. regulatory authorities for our operations outside the U.S., which can have a significant effect on our business. Our businesses are also affected by U.S. federal, state and local
tax laws as well as tax laws for jurisdictions outside the U.S.

PFG,
our parent holding company, is not licensed as an insurer, investment advisor, broker-dealer, bank or other regulated entity. However, because it is the holding company for all of
our operations, it is subject to regulation of our regulated entities, including as an insurance holding company and savings and loan holding company. We are subject to legal and regulatory
requirements applicable to public companies, including public reporting and disclosure, securities trading, accounting and financial reporting and corporate governance.

U.S. Insurance Regulation

We are subject to the insurance holding company laws in the states where our insurance companies are domiciled. Principal Life and
PNLIC are domiciled in Iowa and their principal insurance regulatory authority is the Insurance Division of the Department of Commerce of the State of Iowa. Our other U.S. insurance companies are
principally regulated by the insurance departments of the states in which they are domiciled. These laws generally require each insurance company directly or indirectly owned by the holding company to
register with the insurance department in the insurance company's state of domicile and to furnish financial and other information about the operations of the companies within the holding company
system. Transactions affecting the insurers in the holding company system must be fair and at arm's length. Most states have insurance laws that require regulatory approval of a direct or indirect
change in control of an insurer or an insurer's holding company and laws requiring prior notification of state insurance departments of a change in control of a non-domiciliary insurance
company doing business in that state.

Annually,
our U.S. insurance companies must submit an opinion from a board-appointed qualified actuary to state insurance regulators, where licensed, on whether the statutory assets held
backing statutory reserves are sufficient to meet contractual obligations and related expenses of the insurer. If such an opinion cannot be rendered noting the sufficiency of assets, then the
insurance company must set up additional statutory reserves drawing from available statutory surplus until such an opinion can be given.

State
insurance departments have broad administrative powers over the insurance business, including insurance company licensing and examination, agent licensing, establishment of reserve
requirements and solvency standards,









premium
rate regulation, admittance of assets to statutory surplus, policy form approval, unfair trade and claims practices regulation and other matters. State insurance statutes also typically place
restrictions and limitations on the amount of dividends or other distributions payable by insurance company subsidiaries to their parent companies. See Item 7. "Management's Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Liquidity and Capital Resources" for further details.

In
order to enhance the regulation of insurer solvency, the National Association of Insurance Commissioners ("NAIC") has established risk-based capital standards. The
standards require life insurers to submit a report to state regulators on an annual basis regarding their risk-based capital based upon four categories of risk: asset risk, insurance risk,
interest rate risk and business risk. As of December 31, 2011, the statutory surplus of each of our U.S. life insurance companies exceeded the minimum level of risk-based capital
requirements required before state insurance departments would take action against an insurer.

State
and federal insurance and securities regulatory authorities and other state law enforcement agencies and attorneys general regularly make inquiries and conduct examinations or
investigations regarding our compliance with, among other things, insurance laws and securities laws.

Each
state has insurance guaranty association laws under which insurers doing business in a state can be assessed, up to prescribed limits, in order to cover contractual benefit
obligations of insolvent insurance companies. The guaranty associations levy assessments on each member insurer in a jurisdiction on the basis of the proportionate share of the
premiums written by such insurer in the lines of business in which the insolvent insurer is engaged. Some jurisdictions permit the member insurers to recover the assessments paid through full or
partial premium tax offsets.

Securities Regulation

Insurance and investment products such as variable annuities, variable life insurance and some funding agreements that constitute
securities and mutual fund products are subject to securities laws and regulations, including state securities regulation as well as federal regulation under the SEC, the Financial Industry Regulatory
Authority and other regulatory authorities. These regulations affect investment advice, sales and related activities for these products.

We
also have entities which are registered as investment advisers with the SEC under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.

Employee Retirement Income Security Act

As we provide products and services for U.S. employee benefit plans, we are subject to regulation under the Employee Retirement Income
Security Act ("ERISA"). ERISA provisions include reporting and disclosure requirements and standards of conduct.

Banking Regulation

Principal Bank, a wholly owned subsidiary, is a federal savings bank regulated by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency.
Principal Bank is also a member of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ("FDIC") and subject to its regulations. In July 2011, we became subject to oversight from and examination by the Federal
Reserve Board ("Federal Reserve") pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act ("Dodd-Frank Act"). This oversight includes all entities within the
PFG family. Due to our ownership of Principal Bank, we are classified under federal banking law as a savings and loan holding company ("SLHC"). The Federal Reserve has adopted a procedure for
deregistration as a SLHC for companies seeking to avail themselves of an exemption included within the Dodd-Frank Act. We intend to submit an application to the Federal Reserve to
deregister as a SLHC. For more information, see Item 1A. "Risk Factors — Changes in laws, regulations or accounting standards may reduce our
profitability — Financial services regulatory reform may reduce our profitability, impact how we do business or limit our ability to engage in certain capital expenditures."

Environmental Regulation

As we own and operate real property, we are subject to federal, state and local environmental laws and could be subject to
environmental liabilities and costs associated with required remediation of
our properties. We routinely have environmental assessments performed for real estate being acquired or used as collateral for commercial mortgages we use for investment.

Regulation of International Businesses

Our international businesses are supervised by regulatory authorities in the jurisdictions in which they operate.









Risk Management

Like all financial services companies, we are exposed to a wide variety of financial, operational and other risks, as described in
Item 1A. "Risk Factors." Effective enterprise risk management is, therefore, a key component of our business model. Enterprise risk management helps us to:

•identify and manage those risks that present profitable growth opportunities, and avoid those that do not and•balance the sometimes competing demands of our various stakeholders, meet our customer obligations, satisfy regulatory
requirements and optimize shareholder returns relative to the risks we take.

We
utilize an integrated risk management framework to help us identify, assess, monitor, report and manage our risks within established limits and risk tolerances. The framework delivers
important perspective that is used in strategic and tactical decision making and is adaptable to changes in our businesses and in the external environments in which we operate. Our approach also
requires a commitment to continuous improvement and periodic validation.

Our
governance structure includes Board of Director oversight, internal risk committees, a corporate risk area and embedded risk professionals in all of our business units and functional
areas. Our Board of Directors, Audit Committee, Finance Committee, Human Resource Committee and Nominating and Governance Committee provide oversight no less frequently than quarterly addressing
various aspects and assessments of our risk profile. Quarterly reports on risk topics and an annual enterprise-wide risk report are provided to the Board of Directors by the Chief Risk
Officer.

Our
internal risk committees meet on a regular and frequent basis to discuss various issues and reflect on profile status. Each business unit and key functional area has its own risk
committee that is responsible for oversight of all risks within the unit. Quite often, these committees include key corporate leaders. We are also deploying committees that provide oversight around a
certain risk or group of related risks across the organization. This matrix approach helps us maintain comprehensive risk coverage and preserve an integrated view of risks. Two committees reside at
the top of our internal risk committee hierarchy. The Corporate Strategic Working Group provides enterprise-wide oversight around our strategic risk profile and the Enterprise Risk
Management Committee, comprised of members from corporate senior management, exercises enterprise-wide oversight around all other risk profiles.

The
business units and functional areas are responsible for identifying, assessing, monitoring, reporting and managing their own risks. Risk professionals embedded within each business
unit help align risk management practice with the strategies of the unit as well as enterprise-wide objectives. The Chief Risk Officer and supporting staff are separate from the business
units and provide objective oversight, framework enablement and aggregated risk analysis. Internal Audit provides independent assurance around effective risk management design and control execution.

We
have established risk tolerances from an overall corporate perspective, a business unit perspective, and for specific categories of risks. We monitor a variety of risk metrics on an
ongoing basis and make any necessary adjustments to help us stay within our established risk tolerances. Potentially significant actions are considered in terms of the possible impact on our risk
profile, including but not limited to the capital required, the impact on near term and long-term earnings and the ability to meet our targets with respect to return on equity, liquidity,
debt/capital, cash coverage and operational risk. Quarterly risk reporting provides a feedback loop between the business units and the Chief Risk Officer and includes, among other things, emerging
risk outlooks or incident reporting, if necessary. We have developed a Business Continuity Management Program that identifies critical business functions and includes plans for their protection and
recovery in the event of a disaster or other business interruption.

We
regularly build upon our already strong risk management practices to incorporate updated modeling tools, processes and metrics, which we actively use to better understand and manage
our business.

Employees

As of December 31, 2012, we had 13,373 employees. None of our employees are subject to collective bargaining agreements
governing employment with us. We believe that our employee relations are satisfactory.
