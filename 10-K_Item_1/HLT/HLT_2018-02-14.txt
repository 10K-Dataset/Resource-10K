We operate our business through two operating segments: (i) management and franchise; and (ii) ownership. Each segment is managed separately because of its distinct economic characteristics. The management and franchise segment includes all of the hotels we manage for third-party owners, as well as all franchised hotels operated or managed by someone other than us. As ofDecember 31, 2017, this segment included656managed hotels,4,507franchised hotels and48timeshare resorts totaling 5,211 properties consisting of 833,909 rooms. Within this total are the67hotels with35,406rooms that were previously owned or leased by Hilton or unconsolidated affiliates of Hilton and, upon completion of the spin-offs, were owned or leased by Park or unconsolidated affiliates of Park. The management and franchise segment generates its revenue from: (i) management and franchise fees charged to third-party hotel owners; (ii) license fees for the exclusive right to use certain Hilton marks and intellectual property; and (iii) affiliate fees charged to owned and leased hotels. As ofDecember 31, 2017, the ownership segment included 73 properties totaling 22,206 rooms, comprising64hotels that we wholly owned or leased,onehotel owned by a consolidated non-wholly owned entity,twohotels leased by consolidated variable interest entities ("VIEs") andsixhotels owned or leased by unconsolidated affiliates.



In addition to our current hotel portfolio, we are focused on the growth of our business through expanding our share of the global lodging industry through our development pipeline. During the year endedDecember 31, 2017, nearly 108,000 new rooms were approved for development, and we opened 399 hotels consisting of over 59,000 rooms. As ofDecember 31, 2017, we had a total of2,257hotels in our development pipeline, representingapproximately345,000rooms under construction or approved for development throughout107countries and territories, including39countries and territories where we do not currently have any open hotels. All of the rooms in the pipeline are within our management and franchise segment. Over182,000rooms in the pipeline, or more than half, are located outside the U.S. Additionally, over174,000rooms in the pipeline, or more than half, are under construction. We do not consider any individual development project to be material to us.



Overall, we believe that our experience in the hotel industry, which spans nearly a century of highly focused customer service and entrepreneurship, evolving for the needs of our customers; our strong, well-defined brands that operate throughout the lodging industry chain scales; and our commercial service offerings will continue to drive customer loyalty, including participation in our Hilton Honors guest loyalty program. We believe that satisfied customers will continue to provide strong overall hotel performance for our hotel owners and us and encourage further development of additional hotels under our brands and with existing and new hotel owners, which further supports our growth and future financial performance. We believe that our existing portfolio and development pipeline, which will require minimal capital investment from us, puts us in a strong position to further improve our business and serve our customers in the future.

Our Guest Loyalty Program

is our award-winning guest loyalty program that supports our portfolio of brands and our owned, leased, managed and franchised hotels and resorts. The program generates significant repeat business by rewarding guests with points for each stay at any of our nearly 5,300 properties worldwide, which are then redeemable for free nights and other goods and services. Members can also use points earned to transact with nearly 130 partners, including airlines, rail and car rental companies, credit card providers, Amazon.com and others. The program provides targeted marketing, promotions and customized guest experiences to approximately

71 million

members, a 20 percent increase from December 31, 2016. Our Hilton Honors members represented approximately 57 percent of our system-wide occupancy and contributed hotel-level revenues to us and our hotel owners of over $19 billion during the

year ended December 31, 2017

. Affiliation with our loyalty programs encourages members to allocate more of their travel spending to our hotels. The percentage of travel spending we capture from loyalty members increases as they move up the tiers of our program. The program is funded by contributions from eligible revenues generated by Hilton Honors members and collected by us from hotels and resorts in our system. These funds are applied to reimburse hotels and partners for Hilton Honors points redemptions by loyalty members and to pay for program administrative expenses and marketing initiatives that support the program.

(1)Includes properties owned or leased by entities in which we own a noncontrolling interest.










We operate our business under a management and franchise segment and an ownership segment. For more information regarding our segments, see "Part II—Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" andNote 19: "Business Segments" in "Part II—Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data."



Management and Franchise



Through our management and franchise segment, we manage hotels and license our brands. This segment generates its revenue primarily from fees charged to hotel owners. We grow our management and franchise business by attracting owners to become a part of our system and participate in our commercial services to support their hotel properties. These contracts require little or no capital investment to initiate on our part and provide significant return on investment for us as fees are earned.



Hotel Management



Our core management services consist of operating hotels under management contracts for the benefit of third parties who either own or lease the hotels and the associated personal property. Terms of our management contracts vary, but our fees generally consist of a base management fee, which is based on a percentage of the hotel’s gross revenue, and, when applicable, an incentive management fee, which is typically based on a percentage of hotel operating profits. In general, the owner pays all operating and other expenses and reimburses our out-of-pocket expenses. In turn, our managerial discretion typically is subject to approval by the owner in certain major areas, including the approval of annual operating and capital expenditure budgets. Additionally, the owners generally pay a monthly fee based on a percentage of the hotel's gross room revenue, or other usage fees, which covers the costs of advertising and marketing programs; the costs of internet, technology and reservation systems; and quality assurance program expenses. Owners are also responsible for various other fees and charges, including payments for participation in our Hilton Honors guest loyalty program, training, consultation and procurement of certain goods and services. As ofDecember 31, 2017, we managed656hotels with208,235rooms, excluding our owned, leased and joint venture hotels.



The initial terms of our management contracts for full service hotels are typically20 to 30 years. In certain cases, when we have entered into a franchise contract in addition to a management contract, we classify these hotels as managed hotels in our portfolio. Extension options for our management contracts are negotiated and vary, but typically are more prevalent in full service hotels. Typically, these contracts contain one or two extension options that are for eitherfive or 10 yearsand can be exercised at our or the other party’s option or by mutual agreement. In the case of our management contracts with Park, assuming we exercise all renewal periods, the total term of the management contracts will range from 30 to 70 years.



Some of our management contracts provide early termination rights to hotel owners upon certain events, including the failure to meet certain financial or performance criteria. Performance test measures typically are based upon the hotel’s performance individually and/or in comparison to specified competitive hotels. We often have a cure right by paying an amount equal to the performance shortfall over a specified period, although in some cases our cure rights are limited.



Franchising



We license our brand names, trademarks and service marks and operating systems to hotel owners under franchise contracts. We do not own, manage or operate franchised hotels and do not employ the individuals working at these locations. We conduct periodic inspections to ensure that brand standards are maintained. For new franchised hotels (both new construction and conversions of existing hotels from other brands), we approve the location, as well as the plans for the facilities to ensure the hotels meet our brand standards. For existing franchised hotels, we provide franchisees with product improvement plans that must be completed to keep the hotels in compliance with our brand standards so they can remain in our hotel system. Occasionally, we may have a franchise contract and a management contract in place at the same property, in which case we are both the franchisor and the manager of that property. We also earn license fees from a license agreement with HGV and co-brand credit card arrangements for the use of certain Hilton marks and intellectual property. As ofDecember 31, 2017, we franchised4,555properties with625,674rooms.



Each franchisee pays us a franchise application fee in conjunction with the inception of a franchise contract. Franchisees also pay a royalty fee, generally based on a percentage of the hotel’s gross room revenue and, in some cases, a percentage of food and beverage revenue. Additionally, the franchisees pay a monthly program fee based on a percentage of the hotel's gross room revenue that covers the costs of certain advertising and marketing programs, internet, technology and reservation systems, and quality assurance programs (among other things) that benefit the brand. Franchisees also are responsible for various other fees and charges, including payments for participation in our Hilton Honors guest loyalty program, training, consultation and procurement of certain goods and services.










Our franchise contracts for new construction hotels and our franchise contracts with Park typically have initial terms of approximately 20 years. Our franchise contracts for converted hotels have initial terms of approximately10 to 20 years. At the expiration of the initial term, we may have a contractual right or obligation to relicense the hotel to the franchisee, for an additional term ranging from 10 to 15 years. Our franchise contracts with Park cannot be extended without our consent. We have the right to terminate a franchise contract upon specified events of default, including nonpayment of fees or noncompliance with brand standards. If a franchise contract is terminated by us because of a franchisee’s default, the franchisee is contractually required to pay us liquidated damages.



Ownership



As ofDecember 31, 2017, our ownership segment consisted of73hotels with22,206rooms that we owned or leased or that are owned or leased by entities in which we own a noncontrolling interest. As a hotel owner, we focus on maximizing the cost efficiency and profitability of the portfolio by, among other things, maximizing hotel revenues, implementing new labor management practices and systems and reducing fixed costs. Through our disciplined approach to asset management, we develop and execute on strategic plans for each of our hotels to enhance their market position and, at many of our hotels, we invest in renovating guest rooms and public spaces and adding or enhancing meeting and retail space to improve profitability.



Competition



We encounter active and robust competition as a hotel, residential and resort manager, franchisor, owner and developer. Competition in the hotel and lodging industry generally is based on the attractiveness of the facility; location; level of service; quality of accommodations; amenities; food and beverage options and outlets; public and meeting spaces and other guest services; consistency of service; room rate; brand reputation; and the ability to earn and redeem loyalty program points through a global system. Our properties and brands compete with other hotels, resorts, motels and inns in their respective geographic markets or customer segments, including facilities owned by local interests, individuals, national and international chains, institutions, investment and pension funds and real estate investment trusts ("REITs"). We believe that our position as a multi-branded manager, franchisor and owner of hotels with an associated system-wide guest loyalty platform helps us succeed as one of the largest and most geographically diverse lodging companies in the world.



Our principal competitors include other branded and independent hotel operating companies, national and international hotel brands and ownership companies, including hotel REITs. While local and independent brand competitors vary, on a global scale, our primary competitors are firms such as Accor S.A., Carlson Rezidor Group, Choice Hotels International, Hongkong and Shanghai Hotels, Hyatt Hotels Corporation, Intercontinental Hotel Group, Marriott International and Wyndham Worldwide Corporation.



Seasonality



The hospitality industry is seasonal in nature. The periods during which our hotels and resorts experience higher revenues vary from property to property, depending principally upon their location and the customer-base served. We generally expect our revenues to be lower in the first quarter of each year than in each of the three subsequent quarters.



Cyclicality



The hospitality industry is cyclical, and demand generally follows, on a lagged basis, key macroeconomic indicators. There is a history of increases and decreases in the development and supply of and demand for hotel rooms, occupancy levels and room rates realized by owners of hotels through economic cycles. The combination of changes in economic conditions and in the supply of hotel rooms can result in significant volatility in results for owners and managers of hotel properties. The costs of running a hotel tend to be more fixed than variable. As a result of such fixed costs, in a negative economic environment, the rate of decline in earnings can be higher than the rate of decline in revenues.



Intellectual Property



In the highly competitive hospitality industry in which we operate, trademarks, service marks, trade names, logos and patents are very important to the success of our business. We have a significant number of trademarks, service marks, trade names, logos, patents and pending registrations and expend significant resources each year on surveillance, registration and protection of our trademarks, service marks, trade names, logos and patents, which we believe have become synonymous in the hospitality industry with a reputation for excellence in service and authentic hospitality.










Government Regulation



Our business is subject to various foreign and U.S. federal and state laws and regulations, including laws and regulations that govern the offer and sale of franchises, many of which impose substantive requirements on franchise contracts and require that certain materials be registered before franchises can be offered or sold in a particular jurisdiction.



In addition, a number of states regulate the activities of hospitality properties and restaurants, including safety and health standards, as well as the sale of liquor at such properties, by requiring licensing, registration, disclosure statements and compliance with specific standards of conduct. Operators of hospitality properties also are subject to laws governing their relationship with employees, including minimum wage requirements, overtime, working conditions and work permit requirements. Our franchisees are responsible for their own compliance with laws, including with respect to their employees, minimum wage requirements, overtime, working conditions and work permit requirements. Compliance with, or changes in, these laws could reduce the revenue and profitability of our properties and could otherwise adversely affect our operations.



We also manage and own hotels with casino gaming operations as part of or adjacent to the hotels. However, with the exception of casinos at certain of our properties in Puerto Rico and one property in Egypt, third parties manage and operate the casinos. We hold and maintain the casino gaming license and manage the casinos located in Puerto Rico and Egypt and employ third-party compliance consultants and service providers. As a result, our business operations at these facilities are subject to the licensing and regulatory control of the local regulatory agency responsible for gaming licenses and operations in those jurisdictions.



Finally, as an international owner, manager and franchisor of properties in105countries and territories, we also are subject to the local laws and regulations in each country in which we operate, including employment laws and practices, privacy laws and tax laws, which may provide for tax rates that exceed those of the U.S. and which may provide that our foreign earnings are subject to withholding requirements or other restrictions, unexpected changes in regulatory requirements or monetary policy and other potentially adverse tax consequences.



In addition, our business operations in countries outside the U.S. are subject to a number of laws and regulations, including restrictions imposed by the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act ("FCPA"), as well as trade sanctions administered by the Office of Foreign Assets Control ("OFAC"). The FCPA is intended to prohibit bribery of foreign officials and requires us to keep books and records that accurately and fairly reflect our transactions. OFAC administers and enforces economic and trade sanctions based on U.S. foreign policy and national security goals against targeted foreign states, organizations and individuals. In addition, some of our operations may be subject to additional laws and regulations of non-U.S. jurisdictions, including the United Kingdom's ("U.K.") Bribery Act 2010, which contains significant prohibitions on bribery and other corrupt business activities, and other local anti-corruption laws in the countries and territories in which we conduct operations.



Environmental Matters












Insurance



U.S. hotels that we manage are permitted to participate in certain of our insurance programs by mutual agreement with our hotel owners. If not participating in our programs, hotel owners must purchase insurance programs consistent with our requirements. U.S. franchised hotels are not permitted to participate in our insurance programs, but rather must purchase insurance programs consistent with our requirements. Foreign managed and franchised hotels are required to participate in certain of our insurance programs. In addition, our management and franchise contracts typically include provisions requiring the owner of the hotel property to indemnify us against losses arising from the design, development and operation of hotels owned by such third parties.



Most of our insurance policies are written with self-insured retentions or deductibles that are common in the insurance market for similar risks, and we believe such risks are prudent for us to assume. Our third-party insurance policies provide coverage for claim amounts that exceed our self-insurance retentions or deductible obligations. We maintain insurance coverage for general liability, property including business interruption, terrorism and other risks with respect to our business for all of our owned and leased hotels, and we maintain workers' compensation coverage for all of our team members. In addition, through our captive insurance subsidiary, we participate in a reinsurance arrangement that provides coverage for a certain portion of our deductibles. In general, our insurance provides coverage related to any claims or losses arising out of the design, development and operation of our hotels.



Corporate Responsibility



The success of our business is linked to the success of communities in which our hotels operate - from the local owners who partner with us to build hotels, to the local talent that operate the hotels, to the local economies and businesses our hotels support through sourcing products serving guests.



Travel with Purpose, our corporate responsibility strategy, is a holistic approach that leverages our global footprint and scale coupled with local insights and partnerships to address global and local challenges. Our strategy was developed by mapping social and environmental issues that are impacted by our business and will continue to be critical to our long-term success. We ranked the issues based on our influence and the relative importance to our business operations and stakeholder groups. We also engaged with both internal and external stakeholders to identify interests and concerns that should be taken into consideration as we continue to grow. We revisited our materiality results in 2015 and based on these results, we have identified the priority issue areas for our corporate responsibility efforts and forthcoming goals and targets. Creating shared value for hotel employees, guests, owners, communities and overall business is a strategic priority we strive to achieve by focusing on advancing three priority, material issue areas:



•Creating opportunities-Youth Opportunity, Great Place to Work, Inclusive Economies: we have a passion and a responsibility to invest in current and future employees. We open doors that help individuals build meaningful job and life skills through the hospitality industry.

•Strengthening communities- Skills-based Volunteering, Human Rights, Disaster Support: we encourage and enable our employees to deliver hospitality to our communities. We are committed to having a positive economic and social impact on the millions of communities and lives we touch.

•Preserving environment-Climate Changes, Energy, Carbon, Water, Waste, Responsible Sourcing: as environmental stewards for the wellbeing of people and ecosystems in our communities, we protect the environment through efficient and responsible operations and sourcing.
