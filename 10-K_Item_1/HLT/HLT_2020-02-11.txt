Item 1.  Business



Overview



Hilton is one of the largest and fastest growing hospitality companies in the world, with 6,110 properties comprising 971,780 rooms in 119 countries and territories as of December 31, 2019. For more than 100 years, Hilton has been an innovator in its industry, driven by the vision of our founder Conrad Hilton, "to fill the earth with the light and warmth of hospitality." Our premier brand portfolio includes: our luxury and lifestyle hotel brands, Waldorf Astoria Hotels & Resorts, LXR Hotels & Resorts, Conrad Hotels & Resorts and Canopy by Hilton; our full service hotel brands, Signia by Hilton, Hilton Hotels &






Resorts, Curio Collection by Hilton, DoubleTree by Hilton, Tapestry Collection by Hilton and Embassy Suites by Hilton; our focused service hotel brands, Motto by Hilton, Hilton Garden Inn, Hampton by Hilton, Tru by Hilton, Homewood Suites by Hilton and Home2 Suites by Hilton; and our timeshare brand, Hilton Grand Vacations. In January 2020, we launched a new brand: Tempo by Hilton. See "—Our Brand Portfolio," for additional information. As of December 31, 2019, we had more than 103 million members in our award-winning guest loyalty program, Hilton Honors.



We operate our business through: (i) a management and franchise segment and (ii) an ownership segment, each of which is managed separately because of its distinct economic characteristics. The management and franchise segment includes all of the hotels we manage for third-party owners, as well as all franchised hotels operated or managed by someone other than us. The management and franchise segment generates its revenue from: (i) management and franchise fees charged to third-party hotel owners; (ii) licensing fees from HGV's 55 resorts, consisting of 8,916 rooms, and strategic partnerships for the right to use certain Hilton marks and intellectual property ("IP"); and (iii) fees for managing our owned and leased hotels. As of December 31, 2019, this segment included 703 managed hotels and 5,287 franchised hotels consisting of 942,307 total rooms. As of December 31, 2019, the ownership segment included 65 hotels totaling 20,557 rooms, comprising 57 hotels that we wholly owned or leased, one hotel owned by a consolidated non-wholly owned entity, two hotels leased by consolidated variable interest entities ("VIEs") and five hotels owned or leased by unconsolidated affiliates. For more information regarding our segments, see "Part II—Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Segment Results" and Note 18: "Business Segments" in "Part II—Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data."



In addition to our current hotel portfolio, we are focused on the growth of our business by expanding our share in the global hospitality industry through our development pipeline. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we opened nearly 470 hotels consisting of more than 65,000 rooms, contributing to over 58,000 net rooms growth in our system during the year. Additionally, during the year ended December 31, 2019, more than 116,000 new rooms were approved for development and added to our development pipeline. As of December 31, 2019, we had more than 2,570 hotels in our development pipeline that we expect to add as open hotels in our system, representing over 387,000 rooms under construction or approved for development throughout 116 countries and territories, including 35 countries and territories where we do not currently have any open hotels. All of the rooms in the development pipeline are within our management and franchise segment. Additionally, of the rooms in the development pipeline, 215,000 rooms were located outside the U.S., and 193,000 rooms were under construction. We do not consider any individual development project to be material to us.



Overall, we believe that our experience in the hospitality industry, which spans more than a century of customer service and entrepreneurship, and continues to evolve for the tastes, preferences and demands of our hotel guests; our strong, well-defined brands that operate throughout the hospitality industry chain scales; and our commercial service offerings will continue to drive customer loyalty, including participation in our Hilton Honors guest loyalty program. We believe that satisfied customers will continue to provide strong overall hotel performance for us and our hotel owners and encourage further development of additional hotels under our brands with both existing and new hotel owners, which further supports our growth and future financial performance. We believe that our existing portfolio and development pipeline, which will require minimal capital investment from us, positions us to further improve our business, allocate capital effectively and serve our customers in the future.

Management and Franchise



We manage hotels and license our brands through our management and franchise segment. This segment generates its revenue primarily from fees charged to hotel owners, as well as from fees associated with license agreements. We grow our management and franchise business by attracting owners to become a part of our system and participate in our commercial services to support their properties. These contracts require little or no capital investment to initiate on our part and provide significant return on investment for us as fees are earned.



Hotel Management



Our core management services consist of operating hotels under management contracts for the benefit of third parties who either own or lease the hotels and the associated personal property. Terms of our management contracts vary, but our fees generally consist of a base management fee, which is typically based on a percentage of the hotel’s monthly gross revenue, and, when applicable, an incentive management fee, which is typically based on a percentage of the hotel's operating profits and may be subject to a stated return threshold to the owner, normally over a one-calendar year period. In general, the owner pays all operating and other expenses and reimburses our out-of-pocket expenses. In turn, our managerial discretion typically is subject to approval by the owner in certain major areas, including the approval of annual operating and capital expenditure budgets. Additionally, the owners generally pay a monthly program fee based on the underlying hotel's sales or usage, which covers the costs of: (i) advertising and marketing programs; (ii) internet, technology and reservation systems; and (iii) quality assurance program expenses. Owners are also responsible for various other fees and charges, including payments for participation in our Hilton Honors guest loyalty program, training, consultation and procurement of certain goods and services. As of December 31, 2019, we managed 703 hotels with 221,615 rooms, excluding hotels included in our ownership segment.



The initial terms of our management contracts are typically 20 to 30 years. In certain cases, we are both the franchisor and manager of the hotel, when we enter into a franchise contract in addition to a management contract, and we classify the hotel as managed in our portfolio. Extension options for our management contracts are negotiated and vary, but typically are more prevalent in full service hotels. Generally, these contracts contain one or two extension options that are for either five or 10 years and can be exercised at our or the hotel owner's option or by mutual agreement.



Some of our management contracts provide early termination rights to hotel owners upon certain events, including the failure to meet certain financial or performance criteria. Performance test measures typically are based upon the hotel’s performance individually and/or in comparison to specified competitive hotels. We often have a cure right by paying an amount equal to the performance shortfall over a specified period, although in some cases our cure rights are limited.



Franchising



We license our brand names, trademarks and service marks and operating systems to hotel owners under franchise contracts. We do not own, manage or operate franchised properties and do not employ the individuals working at these locations. We conduct periodic inspections to ensure that brand standards that we establish are maintained. For newly franchised hotels, including both new construction and conversions of existing hotels from other brands, we approve the location, as well as the plans for the facilities to ensure the hotels meet our brand standards. For existing franchised hotels, we provide franchisees with product improvement plans that must be completed to keep the hotels in compliance with our brand standards, so that they can remain in our hotel system. We also earn license fees from a license agreement with HGV and co-brand credit card arrangements for the use of certain Hilton marks and IP.



Each franchisee pays us an application, initiation or other fee in conjunction with the inception of a franchise contract. Franchisees also pay a royalty fee, generally based on a percentage of the hotel’s monthly gross room revenue and, in some cases, a percentage of gross food and beverage revenues and other revenues, as applicable. Additionally, the franchisees generally pay a monthly program fee based on the underlying hotel's sales or usage, which covers the costs of: (i) advertising and marketing programs; (ii) internet, technology and reservation systems; and (iii) quality assurance program expenses. Franchisees are also responsible for various other fees and charges, including payments for participation in our Hilton Honors guest loyalty program, training, consultation and procurement of certain goods and services. As of December 31, 2019, we franchised 5,342 properties with 729,608 rooms.



Our franchise contracts typically have initial terms of approximately 20 years for new hotels and approximately 10 to 20 years for hotels converting from brands outside our system. At the expiration of the initial term, we may have a contractual right or obligation to relicense the hotel to the franchisee for an additional term ranging from 10 to 15 years. We have the right to terminate a franchise contract upon specified events of default, including nonpayment of fees or noncompliance with brand






standards. If a franchise contract is terminated by us because of a franchisee’s default, the franchisee is contractually required to pay us liquidated damages. We have no legal responsibility for the employees or the liabilities associated with operating franchised properties.



Ownership



As a hotel owner and lessee, we focus on maximizing cost efficiency and profitability of the portfolio by, among other things, maximizing hotel revenues, implementing new labor management practices and systems and reducing fixed costs. Through our disciplined approach to hotel and asset management, we develop and execute on strategic plans for each of our hotels to enhance their competitive position and, at many of our hotels, we invest in renovating guest rooms and public spaces and adding or enhancing meeting and retail space to improve profitability. As of December 31, 2019, our ownership segment consisted of 65 hotels with 20,557 rooms that we owned or leased or that are owned or leased by entities in which we own a noncontrolling financial interest.



Corporate Responsibility



The success of our business is linked to our ability to operate and grow sustainably. As one of the world’s largest hotel companies, we have a responsibility to protect our communities and our planet, so destinations remain vibrant and resilient for generations of travelers to come. We work to drive positive social and environmental change across our operations, our supply chain and our communities.



Travel with Purpose, our corporate responsibility strategy, is our commitment to drive responsible travel and tourism globally. We have committed to double our investment in social impact and cut our environmental impact in half by 2030 (the "2030 Goals"). Our strategy and our 2030 Goals were developed by mapping and ranking the social and environmental issues that are affected by our business and are critical to our long-term success. We engage with stakeholders on an ongoing basis to identify interests and concerns to continuously inform and enhance our strategy.



Travel and tourism plays an important role in helping the international community achieve the global Sustainable Development Goals ("SDGs") adopted by the United Nations in 2015. Our corporate responsibility strategy and actions, which align with the SDGs, are designed to address issues important to our business and help ensure that there will be sufficient natural resources and thriving communities in the future to sustain our growth. We use LightStay, our proprietary and award-winning corporate responsibility performance management platform, to measure our social and environmental impact, including, but not limited to, volunteer hours, in-kind donations, local partnerships and energy, water and waste management. Use of LightStay is a global brand standard required across Hilton’s entire system of hotels and corporate offices.



Hilton recognizes climate change to be a critical business risk, and we are committed to reducing our carbon emissions in line with climate science. We were the first hospitality brand to set science-based carbon reduction targets, which were verified by the Science Based Targets initiative ("SBTi") in May 2018.



In 2019, Hilton was named the global industry leader on the Dow Jones Sustainability Indices, demonstrating industry leadership across economic, social and environmental pillars. We were also named to the global environmental impact nonprofit CDP's 2019 "A-List" for climate change, recognizing our actions to cut emissions, mitigate climate risk and contribute to the low-carbon economy.



In 2019, we launched The Hilton Effect Foundation (the "Foundation") with the mission to create a better world to travel by investing in organizations and people that have a positive impact on the communities Hilton serves. The Foundation is our primary international philanthropic arm, supporting efforts that help us meet our 2030 Goals. During the year, the Foundation announced its first 15 grant recipients, funding programs around the globe that are creating opportunities for youth, aiding in disaster recovery and supporting water stewardship and sustainability. The Foundation is a nonprofit established in the United States and is registered as a 501(c)(3) charitable organization.



Social Impact



We use our global presence as an engine of opportunity, focusing on positively impacting human rights, inclusive growth and our communities as we work towards our goal to double our social impact investment by 2030.



We are committed to an environment free of any form of discrimination or harassment, and we require all of our employees to complete trainings on our Code of Conduct, which embraces our values and states that we will not tolerate any form of






discrimination or harassment on the basis of any characteristic protected by law. As reflected in our Code of Conduct, any behavior, communication or other conduct that creates an environment that is intimidating, offensive or hostile is unacceptable. To combat human trafficking, we require all hotel-based employees to complete an annual training on identifying signs of trafficking. We also partner with expert organizations, including ECPAT, Vital Voices and It’s a Penalty, to help prevent and mitigate such risks, including at an industry level through the International Tourism Partnership, World Travel and Tourism Council, American Hotel & Lodging Association and UK Stop Slavery Hotel Industry Network. We developed the industry’s first tailored training on Risks of Modern Slavery in Labor Sourcing and made this training freely available to the public in 2019 via the International Tourism Partnership. In 2019, we once again received a 100 percent rating in the Corporate Equality Index from the Human Rights Campaign.



This year, we exceeded our goal to open doors for 1 million young people by the end of 2019 by connecting with, preparing or employing them through global partnerships, talent pipeline and local activations. We continue to promote inclusive growth to generate participation in and benefits from travel and tourism for our customers, owners and team members. Through our Operation: Opportunity initiative, we have hired more than 30,000 veterans in the U.S. since 2013. In collaboration with partners like Project SEARCH and Foxes Academy (UK), we offer young people with disabilities skills training and opportunities for success in integrated, competitive employment. As members of the Tent Partnership for Refugees, we have impacted nearly 11,000 refugees since 2015 through volunteering, in-kind donations, purchasing, training and employment. We also create opportunities through our value chain, and we are working to double our sourcing spend from local, small and medium-sized enterprises and minority-owned suppliers. We support nearly 3,500 women-, minority-, veteran-, disabled- and LGBT-owned businesses through our purchasing operations in the U.S.



We continually seek to create a positive impact in the communities in which we operate. In 2019, employees from 107 countries and territories volunteered nearly 550,000 hours. Additionally, since 2014, we have raised over $3.2 million to support disaster relief campaigns for our employees around the world.



Environmental Impact



We are committed to cutting our environmental footprint in half by 2030, through energy and carbon management, water stewardship, waste reduction and responsible sourcing. In 2019, we maintained our portfolio-wide certification to ISO 9001 (Quality Management), ISO 14001 (Environmental Management) and ISO 50001 (Energy Management) standards, one of the largest ISO certified portfolios of buildings in the world. Also in 2019, our LightStay corporate responsibility management system achieved Global Sustainable Tourism Council Recognized Standard status, the first major hotel company to receive this recognition.



We continue to focus on reducing carbon emissions in line with our science-based targets and driving water stewardship and responsible sourcing in our operations and value chain. In 2019, we also focused heavily on our waste reduction efforts. We implemented a global ban on plastic straws, cocktail picks and stir sticks at all hotels globally, and we are continuing our transition from individual bath toiletries to full-size dispensers. In 2019, we announced the expansion of our soap recycling program to 5,300 hotels globally, and we also announced the implementation of our food waste reduction program in our Americas region and the expansion of Hilton’s food donation initiative to all managed hotels across the U.S. and Canada.



We continued to work with our environmental partner, World Wildlife Fund, to evolve our environmental strategy and implement our programs globally.



We have achieved the following reductions in environmental impact since 2008:

Competition



We encounter active and robust competition as a hotel and resort manager, franchisor and owner. Competition in the hospitality industry generally is based on the attractiveness of the facility; location; level of service; quality of accommodations; amenities; food and beverage options and outlets; public and meeting spaces and other guest services; consistency of service; room rate; brand reputation; and the ability to earn and redeem loyalty program points through a global system. Our properties and brands compete with other hotels, resorts, motels, inns and other accommodation rental services in their respective geographic markets or customer segments, including facilities owned by local interests, individuals, national and international chains, institutions, investment and pension funds and real estate investment trusts ("REITs"). We believe that our position as a multi-branded manager, franchisor and owner of hotels with an associated system-wide guest loyalty and commercial platform helps us continue to maintain our position as one of the largest and most geographically diverse hospitality companies in the world.



Our principal competitors include other branded and independent hotel operating companies, national and international hotel brands and ownership companies. While local and independent brand competitors vary, on a global scale, our primary competitors are firms such as Accor S.A., Choice Hotels International, Hongkong and Shanghai Hotels, Hyatt Hotels Corporation, Intercontinental Hotel Group, Marriott International, Radisson Hotel Group and Wyndham Hotels & Resorts.



Seasonality



The hospitality industry is seasonal in nature. The periods during which our properties experience higher or lower levels of demand vary from property to property, depending principally upon their location, type of property and competitive mix within






the specific location. Based on historical results, we generally expect our revenues to be lower in the first quarter of each year than in each of the three subsequent quarters.



Cyclicality



The hospitality industry is cyclical, and demand generally follows, on a lagged basis, key macroeconomic indicators. There is a history of increases and decreases in the development and supply of and demand for hotel rooms, occupancy levels and room rates realized by hotel owners through economic cycles. The combination of changes in economic conditions and in the supply of hotel rooms can result in significant volatility in results for owners and managers of hotel properties. The costs of running a hotel tend to be more fixed than variable. As a result of such fixed costs, in a negative economic environment, the rate of decline in earnings can be higher than the rate of decline in revenues.



Intellectual Property



In the highly competitive hospitality industry in which we operate, trademarks, service marks, trade names, logos and patents are very important to the success of our business. We have a significant number of trademarks, service marks, trade names, logos, patents and pending registrations and expend significant resources each year on surveillance, registration and protection of our trademarks, service marks, trade names, logos and patents, which we believe have become synonymous in the hospitality industry with a reputation for excellence in service and authentic hospitality.



Government Regulation



Our business is subject to various foreign and U.S. federal and state laws and regulations, including laws and regulations that govern the offer and sale of franchises, many of which impose substantive requirements on franchise contracts and require that certain materials be registered before franchises can be offered or sold in a particular jurisdiction.



In addition, a number of states regulate the activities of hospitality properties and restaurants, including safety and health standards, as well as the sale of liquor at such properties, by requiring licensing, registration, disclosure statements and compliance with specific standards of conduct. Operators of hospitality properties also are subject to laws governing their relationship with employees, including minimum wage requirements, overtime, working conditions and work permit requirements. Our franchisees are responsible for their own compliance with laws, including with respect to their employees, minimum wage requirements, overtime, working conditions and work permit requirements. Compliance with, or changes in, these laws could reduce the revenue and profitability of our properties and could otherwise adversely affect our operations.



We also manage hotels with casino gaming operations as part of or adjacent to the hotels. However, with the exception of casinos at certain properties in Puerto Rico and Egypt, third parties manage and operate the casinos. We hold and maintain the casino gaming license and manage the casinos located in Puerto Rico and Egypt and employ third-party compliance consultants and service providers. As a result, our business operations at these facilities are subject to the licensing and regulatory control of the local regulatory agency responsible for gaming licenses and operations in those jurisdictions.



As an international manager, franchisor, owner and lessee of properties in 119 countries and territories, we also are subject to the local laws and regulations in each country in which we operate, including employment laws and practices; privacy laws; tax laws, which may provide for tax rates that exceed those of the U.S. and which may provide that our foreign earnings are subject to withholding requirements or other restrictions; unexpected changes in regulatory requirements or monetary policy; and other potentially adverse tax consequences.



In addition, our business operations in countries outside the U.S. are subject to a number of laws and regulations, including restrictions imposed by the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act ("FCPA"), as well as trade sanctions administered by the Office of Foreign Assets Control ("OFAC"). The FCPA is intended to prohibit bribery of foreign officials and requires us to keep books and records that accurately and fairly reflect our transactions. OFAC administers and enforces economic and trade sanctions based on U.S. foreign policy and national security goals against targeted foreign states, organizations and individuals. In addition, some of our operations may be subject to additional laws and regulations of non-U.S. jurisdictions, including the United Kingdom's ("U.K.") Bribery Act 2010, which contains significant prohibitions on bribery and other corrupt business activities, and other local anti-corruption laws in the countries and territories in which we conduct operations. The European Union's ("E.U.") General Data Protection Regulation ("GDPR"), effective in 2018, has stringent requirements regarding the handling of personal data such as credit card numbers and other personally identifiable information that we collect for a variety of important business purposes, including managing our workforce, providing requested products and services and maintaining guest preferences to enhance customer service and for marketing and promotion purposes.






Environmental Matters





Insurance



U.S. hotels that we manage are permitted to participate in certain of our insurance programs by mutual agreement with our hotel owners. If not participating in our programs, hotel owners must purchase insurance programs consistent with our requirements. U.S. franchised hotels are not permitted to participate in our insurance programs, but rather must purchase insurance programs consistent with our requirements. Foreign managed and franchised hotels are required to participate in certain of our insurance programs. In addition, our management and franchise contracts typically include provisions requiring the owner of any hotel to indemnify us against losses arising from the design, development and operation of such hotel.



Most of our insurance policies are written with self-insured retentions or deductibles that are common in the insurance market for similar risks, and we believe such risks are prudent for us to assume. Our third-party insurance policies provide coverage for claim amounts that exceed our self-insurance retentions or deductible obligations. We maintain insurance coverage for general liability, property, business interruption, terrorism and other risks with respect to our business for all of our owned and leased hotels, and we maintain workers' compensation coverage for all of our employees. In addition, through our captive insurance subsidiary, we participate in a reinsurance arrangement that provides coverage for a certain portion of our deductibles. In general, our insurance provides coverage related to any claims or losses arising out of the design, development and operation of our hotels.



History



In May 1919, our founder Conrad Hilton purchased his first hotel in Cisco, Texas, and in 2019, we celebrated our 100th anniversary. Our predecessors commenced corporate operations in 1946, and Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc. was incorporated in Delaware in March 2010.



Employees



As of December 31, 2019, we employed more than 173,000 people at our managed, owned and leased properties and at our corporate locations.



As of December 31, 2019, approximately 31 percent of our employees worldwide and 37 percent of our employees in the U.S. were covered by various collective bargaining agreements generally addressing pay rates, working hours, other terms and conditions of employment, certain employee benefits and orderly settlement of labor disputes.
