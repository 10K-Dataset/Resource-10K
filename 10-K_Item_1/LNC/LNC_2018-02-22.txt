BUSINESS SEGMENTS AND OTHER OPERATIONS

﻿

ANNUITIES

﻿

Overview

﻿

The Annuities segment provides tax-deferred investment growth and lifetime income opportunities for its clients by offering fixed (including indexed) and variable annuities.  The “fixed” and “variable” classifications describe whether we or the contract holders bear the investment risk of the assets supporting the contract.  This also determines the manner in which we earn investment margin profits from these products, either as investment spreads for fixed products or as asset-based fees charged to variable products.

﻿

Annuities have several features that are attractive to customers.  Annuities are unique in that contract holders can select a varietyof payout alternatives toprovide an income flow for life.  Many annuity contracts also include guarantee features (living and death benefits) that are not found in any other investment vehicle and, we believe, make annuities attractive especially in times of economic uncertainty.  In addition, growth on the underlying principal in certain annuities is granted tax-deferred treatment, thereby deferring the tax consequences of the growth in value until withdrawals are made from the accumulation values, often at lower tax rates occurring during retirement.

﻿

Products

﻿

In general, an annuity is a contract between an insurance company and an individual or group in which the insurance company, after receipt of one or more premium payments, agrees to pay an amount of money either in one lump sum or on a periodic basis (i.e., annually, semi-annually, quarterly or monthly), beginning on a certain date and continuing for a period of time as specified in the contract or as requested.  Periodic payments can begin within 12 months after the premium is received (referred to as an immediate annuity) or at a future date in time (referred to as a deferred annuity).  This retirement vehicle helps protect an individual from outliving his or her money.

﻿

Variable Annuities

﻿

A variable annuity provides the contract holder the ability to direct the investment of premium deposits into one or morevariablesub-accounts(“variable funds”)offered through the product (“variable portion”) and, for a specified period,into a fixed account with a guaranteed return (“fixed portion”).  The value of the variable portion of the contract holder’s account varies with the performance of the underlyingvariable fundschosen by the contract holder.

﻿

Ourvariable fundsinclude theManaged RiskStrategies fund options, a series of funds that embed volatilityriskmanagement and, with some funds, capital protectionstrategies, inside the funds themselves.  These fundsseek toreduce equity marketvolatilityrisk for both the contract holder and us.  As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, theManaged Risk Strategies funds totaled $39.2billion and $34.9 billion, or 33%of total variable annuity account values, respectively.

﻿

We charge mortality and expense assessments and administrative fees on variable annuity accounts to cover insurance and administrative expenses.  These assessments are built into accumulation unit values, which when multiplied by the number of units owned for anyvariable fundequals the contract holder’s account value for thatvariable fund.  In addition, for some contracts, we impose surrender charges, which are typically applicable during the early years of the annuity contract, with a declining level of surrender charges over time.



We offer guaranteed benefit riders with certain of our variable annuity products, such as a guaranteed death benefit (“GDB”), a guaranteed withdrawal benefit (“GWB”), a guaranteed income benefit (“GIB”) and acombination of such benefits.  In 2017, 35% of our variable annuity deposits were on products without guaranteed living benefit (“GLB”) riders, compared to 30% and 28% in 2016 and 2015, respectively.

﻿

The GDB features offered in 2017included those where we contractually guarantee to the contract holder that upon death, depending on the particular product, we will return no less than:  the current contract value; the total deposits made to the contract, adjusted to reflect any partial withdrawals; the highest contract value on a specified anniversary date adjusted to reflect any partial withdrawals following the contract anniversary.

﻿

In 2017,



we offered product riders including the

﻿

We also offered thei4LIFE® Advantage,i4LIFE® Advantage Guaranteed Income Benefit (Managed Risk) andi4LIFE® Advantage Guaranteed Income Benefit riders.  These riders, which are covered by U.S. patents, allow variable annuity contract holders access and control during a portion of the income distribution phase of their contract.  This added flexibility allows the contract holder to access the account value for transfers, additional withdrawals and other service features like portfolio rebalancing.  In general, GIB is an optional feature available withi4LIFEAdvantage and a non-optional feature oni4LIFEAdvantage Guaranteed Income Benefit (Managed Risk) andi4LIFEAdvantageSelectGuaranteed Income Benefit that guarantees regular income payments will not fall below the greater of a minimum income floor set at benefit issue and 75% of the highest income payment on a specified anniversary date (reduced for any subsequent withdrawals).  Contract holders underi4LIFEAdvantage Guaranteed Income Benefit (Managed Risk) are subject to the allocation of their account value to our Managed Risk Strategies fund options and certain fixed-income options.  Contract holders underi4LIFEAdvantage Guaranteed Income Benefit are subject to restrictions on the allocation of their account value within the various investment choices.

﻿

We also offered the4LATER® Advantage (Managed Risk) rider.  This rider provides a minimum income base used to determine the GIB floor when a client begins income payments underi4LIFEAdvantage Guaranteed Income Benefit (Managed Risk).4LATERAdvantage (Managed Risk) rider provides growth during the accumulation phase through both a 5% enhancement to the income base each year a withdrawal is not taken for a specified period of time and an annual step-up of the income base to the current contract value.  Contract holders under the4LATERAdvantage (Managed Risk) rider are subject to the allocation of their account value to our Managed Risk Strategies fund options and certain fixed-income options.

﻿

We design and actively manage the features and structure of our guaranteed benefit riders to maintain a competitive suite of products consistent with profitability and risk management goals.  To mitigate the increased risks associated with guaranteed benefits, we developed a dynamic hedging program.  The customized dynamic hedging program uses equity, interest rateand currency futures positions, interest rate and total return swapsand equity-based options depending upon the risks underlying the guarantees.  For more information on our hedging program, see “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates – Derivatives” and “Realized Gain (Loss) and Benefit Ratio Unlocking” in the MD&A.  For information regarding risks related to guaranteed benefits, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors – Market Conditions – Changes in the equity markets, interest rates and/or volatility affect the profitability of our products with guaranteed benefits; therefore, such changes may have a material adverse effect on our business and profitability.”

﻿

Although we do not have any significant concentration of customers, our American Legacy Variable Annuity (“ALVA”) product is significant to this segment.  The ALVA product accountedfor14%,21% and 18%ofour variable annuity product deposits in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively, andrepresented 40%,41% and 42%of the segment’s total variable annuity product account values as of December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  In addition, fund choices for certain of our other variable annuity products offered includeAmerican Fund Insurance SeriesSM(“AFIS”) funds.

﻿

Fixed Annuities



A fixed annuity preserves the principal value of the contract while guaranteeing a minimum interest rate to be credited to the accumulation value.  Our fixed annuity product offerings as of December 31, 2017, consisted of traditional fixed-rate and fixed indexed deferred annuities, as well as fixed-rate immediateand deferred incomeannuities with various payment options, including lifetime incomes.Fixed annuity contracts are general account obligations.  We bear the investment risk for fixed annuity contracts.  To protect from premature withdrawals, we impose surrender charges.  Surrender charges are typically applicable during the early years of the annuity contract, with a declining level of surrender charges over time.  We expect to earn a spread between what we earn on the underlying general account investments supporting the fixed annuity product line and what we credit to our fixed annuity contract holders’ accounts.

﻿

We offer single and flexible premium fixed deferred annuities.  Single premium fixed deferred annuities are contracts that allow only a single premium to be paid.  Flexible premium fixed deferred annuities are contracts that allow multiple premium payments on either a scheduled or non-scheduled basis.

﻿

Our fixed indexed annuities allow the contract holder to choose between a fixed interest crediting rate and an indexed interest crediting rate, which is based on the performance of the Standard & Poor’s (“S&P”) 500 Index®(“S&P 500”) or the S&P 500 Daily Risk Control 5%TMIndex.  The indexed interestcreditis guaranteed never to be less than zero.  Available with certain of our fixed indexed annuities,LincolnLifetimeIncomeSMEdge providesthe contract holder a guaranteed lifetime withdrawal benefit.  We use derivatives to hedge the equity market risk associated with our fixed indexed annuity products.  For more information on our hedging program, see “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates – Derivatives” and “Realized Gain (Loss) and Benefit Ratio Unlocking” in the MD&A.

The Annuities segment competes with numerous other financial services companies.  The main factors upon which entities in this market compete are distribution channel access and the quality of wholesalers, investment performance, cost, product features, speed to market, brand recognition, financial strength ratings, crediting rates and client service.

LIFEINSURANCE

﻿

Overview

﻿

The Life Insurance segment focuses on the creation and protection of wealth for its clients by providing life insurance products, including term insurance,both single (including COLI and BOLI) and survivorship versions of universal life insurance (“UL”), variable universal life insurance (“VUL”) and indexed universal life insurance (“IUL”) products, alinked-benefit product(which is UL with riders providing for long-term care costs) and a critical illness rider, which can be attached to UL, VUL or IUL policies.Some of ourproductsinclude secondary guarantees, which are discussed more fully below.Generally, this segment has higher sales during the second half of the year with the fourth quarter being the strongest.Mortality margins, morbidity margins, investment margins, expense marginsand surrender fees drive life insurance profits.



Similar to the annuity product classifications described above, life products can be classified as “fixed” (includingindexed) or “variable” contracts.  This classification describes whether we or the contract holders bear the investment risk of the assets supporting the policy.  This also determines the manner in which we earn investment margin profits from these products, either as investment spreads for fixed productsor as asset-based fees charged to variable products.

﻿

Products

﻿

We offer four categories of life insurance products consisting of:

﻿

UL

﻿

ULinsurance products provide life insurance with account values that earn rates of return based on company-declared interest rates.  Contract holder account values are invested in our general account investment portfolio, so we bear the risk of investment performance.We offer a variety of UL products, such asLincoln LifeGuarantee® UL,Lincoln LifeCurrent® ULandLincoln LifeReserve® UL.

﻿

In a UL contract, contract holders typically have flexibility in the timing and amount of premium payments and the amount of death benefit, provided there is sufficient account value to cover all policy charges forcost of insuranceand expenses for the coming period.  Under certain contract holder options and market conditions, the death benefit amount may increase or decrease.  Premiums received on a UL product, net of expense loads and charges, are added to the contract holder’s account valueand accrued with interest.  The client has access to their account value (or a portion thereof), less surrender charges and policy loan payoffs, through contractual liquidity features such as loans, partial withdrawals and full surrenders.  Loans and withdrawals reduce the death benefit amount payable and are limited to certain contractual maximums (some of which are required under state law),and interest is charged on all loans.Our UL








contracts assess surrender charges against the policies’ account values for full or partial surrendersand certain policy changesthat occur during the contractual surrender charge period.  Depending on the product selected, surrender charge periods can rangefrom 0 to 25years.

﻿

We also offer fixedIUL products that function similarly to a traditional UL policy, with the added flexibility of allowing contract holders to have portions of theiraccount values earn credits based on the performance of indexessuch as the S&P 500.These products includeLincoln WealthAdvantage® IULandLincoln LifeReserve® IUL Accumulator.

﻿

As mentioned previously, we offer survivorship versions of our individualUL and IUL products.  These products insure two lives with a single policy and pay death benefits upon the second death.These products includeLincoln LifeGuarantee® SUL andLincolnWealthPreserve®Survivorship IUL.

﻿

A UL policy with alifetimesecondary guarantee can stay in force, even if the base policy cash value is zero, as long as secondary guarantee requirements have been met.These products includeLincoln LifeGuarantee® UL andLincoln LifeGuarantee® SUL.The secondary guarantee requirement is basedon the payment of a required minimum premium oron the evaluation of a reference value within the policy, calculated in a manner similar to the base policy account value, but using different expense charges, cost of insurance charges and credited interestrates.Theparameters for the secondary guarantee requirement are listed in the contract.  As long as the contract holderpays the minimum premium orfunds the policy to a level that keeps this calculated reference value positive, thepolicy isguaranteedto stay in force.  The reference value has no actual monetary value to the contract holder; it is only a calculated value used to determine whether or not the policy will lapse should the base policycash value be less than zero.

﻿

Our secondary guarantee benefits maintain the flexibility of a traditional UL policy, which allows a contract holder to take loans or withdrawals.  Although loans and withdrawals are likely to shorten the time period of thesecondary guarantee, the guarantee is not automatically or completely forfeited.  The length of the guarantee may be increased at any time through additional excess premium deposits.Reserves on UL products with secondary guarantees representedapproximately26% and30%of total life reserves for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.

﻿

VUL

﻿

VUL products are UL products that provide a return on account values linked to an underlying investment portfolio ofvariable fundsoffered through the product.The valueof the variable portionof the contract holder’s accountis driven bythe performance of theunderlying variable fundschosen by the contract holder.  As the return on the investment portfolio increases or decreases, the account value of the VUL policy will increase or decrease.In addition, VUL products offer a fixed account option that is managed by us.As with fixed UL products, contract holders have access, within contractual maximums, to account values through loans, withdrawals and surrenders.  Surrender charges are assessed during the surrender charge period, rangingfrom 0 to 20 yearsdepending on the product.Our single life VUL products includeLincoln AssetEdge® VUL andLincoln VULONE.  Our COLI products are also VUL-type products.

﻿

We also offer survivorship versionsof our individual VUL products,LincolnSVULONEandLincolnPreservation Edge® SVUL.  These products insure two lives with a single policy and pay death benefits upon the second death.

﻿

We offerlifetimeguaranteed benefit riders with certain of our VUL products,LincolnVULONEandLincolnSVULONE.  TheONEriderfeatures contractually guarantee to the contract holder that upon death, as long as secondary guarantee requirements have been met, the death benefit will be payable even if the account value equals zero.

﻿

Linked-Benefit Life Productsand Products with Critical Illness Riders

﻿

Our linked-benefit life product,LincolnMoneyGuard®,combinesULwith long-term care insurancethrough the use of riders.One type ofrider allows the contract holder to accelerate death benefits on a tax-free basis in the event of aqualified long-term care need, reducing the remaining death benefit.Anotherrider extends the long-term care insurance benefits for an additionallimitedperiod of time if the death benefit is fully accelerated.  Certain policiesalso provide a reduced death benefit to the contract holder’s beneficiary if thedeath benefit has been fullyacceleratedas long-term care benefits duringthe contract holder’slife.

﻿

Some life products provide for critical illness insurance by the use of riders attached to UL, VUL or IUL policies.  These riders allow the contract holder to accelerate death benefits on a tax-free basis in the event of a qualified critical illness condition.

﻿

Term Life Insurance

﻿

Term life insurance provides a fixed death benefit for a scheduled period of time.Some of our term life insurance products give the policyholder the option to reduce the death benefit at a future time.Scheduled policy premiums are required to be paid at least annually.These products includeLincoln TermAccel®Level Term andLincoln LifeElements®Level Term.

﻿

Competition

﻿

The life insurance marketis very competitive and consists of many companies with no one company dominating the market for all products.Principalcompetitive factors include productfeatures, price, underwriting and issue process, customer service and insurers’ financial strength.

In addition, we use automated underwriting within a defined criteria as well asLincXpress®, a simplified issue process, both of which are seen as marketplace competitive advantages.

﻿

Underwriting



In the context of life insurance, underwriting is the process of evaluating medical and non-medical information about an individual and determining the effect these factors statistically have on mortality.  This process of evaluation is often referred to as risk classification.  Of course, no one can accurately predict how long any individual will live, but certain risk factors can affect life expectancy and are evaluated during the underwriting process.

﻿

Claims Administration



Claims serviceishandled primarily in-house, and claims examiners are assigned to each claim notification based on coverage amount, type of claim and the experience of the examiner.  Claims meeting certain criteria are referred to senior claimsexaminers.  A formal quality assurance program is carried out to ensure the consistency and effectiveness of claims examining activities.  A network of in-house legal counsel, compliance officers, medical personnel and an anti-fraud investigative unit also support claimsexaminers.  A special team of claims examiners, in conjunction with claims management, focus on more complex claims matters such as claims incurred during the contestable period, beneficiary disputes andlitigated claims.

In this market, the Group Protection segment competes with a number of major companies andregionally withother companiesoffering all or some of the products within our product set.In addition, there is competition in attracting brokersto actively market our products and attracting and retaining sales representatives to sell our products.  Key competitive factors in attracting brokers and sales representativesinclude product offerings and features, financial strength, support services andcompensation.

﻿

Underwriting

﻿

The Group Protection segment’s underwriters evaluate the risk characteristics of each employergroup.  Generally, the relevant characteristics evaluated include employee census information (such as age, gender, income and occupation), employer industry classification, geographic location, benefit design elements and other factors.  The segment employs detailed underwriting policies, guidelines and procedures designed to assist the underwriter to properly assess and quantify risks.  The segment uses technology to efficiently review, price and issue smaller cases, utilizing its underwriting staff on larger, more complex cases.  Individual underwriting techniques (including evaluation of individual medical history information) may be used on certain covered individuals selecting larger benefit amounts.  For voluntary and other forms of employee paid coverages, minimum participation requirements are used to obtain a better spread of risk and minimize the risk of anti-selection.

﻿

Claims Administration

﻿

Claims for the Group Protection segment are managed by in-house claim specialists and outsourced third-party resources.  Claims are evaluated for eligibility and payment of benefits pursuant to the group insurance contract and in compliance with federal and state regulations.  Disability claims management is especially important to segment results, as results depend on both the incidence and the length of approved disability claims.The segment employs a variety of clinical experts, including internal and external medical professionals and rehabilitation specialists, to evaluate medically supported functional capabilities, assess employability and develop return to work plans.The accuracy and speed of life claims are important customer service and risk management factors.  Some life policies provide for the waiver ofpremiumcoverage in the event of the insured’s disability where our disability claims management expertise is utilized.Dental claims management focuses on assisting plan administrators and members with the rising costs of insurance by utilizing tools to optimize dental claims payment accuracy through advanced claims review and validation, improved data analysis, enhanced clinical review of claims and provider utilization monitoring.

OTHEROPERATIONS

﻿

Other Operations includes the financial data for operations that are not directly related to the business segments.  Other Operations includes investments related to the excess capital in our insurance subsidiaries; corporate investments; benefit plan net liability; the unamortized deferred gain on indemnity reinsurance related to the sale to Swiss Re Life & Health America, Inc. (“Swiss Re”) in 2001; the results of certain disability income business; our run-off Institutional Pension business in the form of group annuity and insuredfunding-type of contracts;debt; and strategic digitization expense.Other Operations also included our investment in media properties that were sold in July 2015, as described above.  For more information on our strategic digitization initiative, see “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Introduction – Executive Summary – Significant Operational Matters.”

﻿

REINSURANCE



Our reinsurance strategy is designedto protect our insurance subsidiaries against the severity of losses on individual claims and unusually serious occurrences in which a number of claims produce an aggregate extraordinary loss.  Although reinsurance does not discharge the insurance subsidiaries from their primary liabilities to their contract holders for losses insured under the insurance policies, it does make the assuming reinsurer liable to the insurance subsidiaries for the reinsured portion of the risk.  Because we bear the risk of nonpayment by one or more of our reinsurers, we primarily cede reinsurance to well-capitalized, highly ratedunaffiliated reinsurers.We also utilize inter-company reinsurance agreements to manage our statutory capital position as well as our hedge program for variable annuity guarantees.  These inter-company agreements do not have an effect on our consolidated financial statements.

﻿

As of December 31, 2017,thepolicy for ourreinsurance program was to retain up to $20 million on a single insured life.  As the amount we retain varies by policy, we reinsured approximately 25%of the mortality risk on newly issued life insurance contracts in 2017.As of December 31, 2017,approximately 38% ofour total individual life in-force amount was reinsured.

﻿

Some portions of our deferred annuity business have been reinsured oneitheracoinsurance or a modified coinsurance (“Modco”)basis with other companies to limit our exposureassociated with fixed and variable annuities.In a coinsurance program, thereinsurer shares proportionally in all financial terms of the reinsured policies (i.e., premiums, expenses, claims, etc.) based on their respectivepercentage of the risk.  In a Modco program, we as the ceding company retain the reserves, as well as the assets backing those reserves, and the reinsurer shares proportionally in all financial terms of the reinsured policies based on their respective percentage of the risk.

﻿

In addition, we acquire other reinsurance to cover products other than as discussed above with retentions and limits that management believes are appropriate for the circumstances.For example, we use reinsurance to cover larger life and disability claims in our Group Protection business.

﻿

We obtain reinsurance from a diverse group of reinsurers, and we monitor concentration and financial strengthratings of our principal reinsurers.  Swiss Re represents our largest reinsurance exposure.  The amounts recoverable from reinsurers were $4.9 billion and$5.3 billionas of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, ofwhich $1.8billion and$2.1 billionwererecoverable from Swiss Re related to the sale of our reinsurance business to Swiss Re for the respective periods.

﻿

For more information regarding reinsurance, see “Reinsurance” in the MD&A and Note 9.  For risks involving reinsurance, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors –Operational Matters –We face risks of non-collectabilityof reinsurance and increased reinsurance rates, which could materially affect our results of operations.”

﻿

RESERVES

﻿

The applicable insurance laws under which insurance companies operate require that they report, as liabilities, policy reserves to meet future obligations on their outstanding policies.  These reserves are the amounts that, with the additional premiums to be received and interest thereon compounded annually at certain assumed rates, are calculated to be sufficient to meet the various policy and contract obligations as they mature.  These laws specify that the reserves shall not be less than reserves calculated using certain specified mortality and morbidity tables, interest rates and methods of valuation.For more information on reserves, see “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates – Derivatives – GLB”and “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates – Future Contract Benefits and Other Contract Holder Obligations” in the MD&A.

﻿

See “Regulatory” below for information on permitted practices and proposed regulations that may impact the amount of statutory reserves necessary to support our current insurance liabilities.

﻿

For risks related to reserves, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors – Market Conditions – Changes in interest rates and sustained low interest rates may cause interest rate spreads to decrease and changes in interest rates may also result inincreased contract withdrawals,”“Item 1A. Risk Factors – Legislative, Regulatory and Tax – Attempts to mitigate the impact of Regulation XXX and Actuarial Guideline 38 may fail in whole or in part resulting in an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations”and “Item IA. Risk Factors–Operational Matters–We face risks of non-collectability of reinsurance and increased reinsurance rates, which could materially affect our results of operations.”

﻿












INVESTMENTS



An important component of our financial results is the return on invested assets.  Our investment strategy is to balance the need for current income with prudent risk management, with an emphasis on generating sufficient current income to meet our obligations.  This approach requires the evaluation of risk and expected return of each asset class utilized, while still meeting our income objectives.  This approach also permits us to be more effective in our asset-liability management because decisions can be made based upon both the economic and current investment income considerations affecting assets and liabilities.  Investments by our insurance subsidiaries must comply with the insurance laws and regulations of the states of domicile.

﻿

Derivatives are used primarily for hedging purposes and, to a lesser extent, income generation.  Hedging strategies are employed for a number of reasons including, but not limited to, hedging certain portions of our exposure to changes in our GDB, GWB and GIB liabilities, interest rate fluctuations, the widening of bond yield spreads over comparable maturity U.S. government obligations and credit, foreign exchange and equity risks.  Income generation strategies include credit default swaps through replication synthetic asset transactions.  These derivatives synthetically create exposure in the general account to corporate debt, similar to investing in the credit markets.

﻿

For additional information on our investments, including carrying values by category, quality ratings and net investment income, see “Consolidated Investments” in the MD&A, as well as Notes 1 and 5.

﻿

FINANCIAL STRENGTH RATINGS



The Nationally Recognized Statistical Ratings Organizations rate the financial strength of our principal insurance subsidiaries.

﻿

Rating agencies rate insurance companies based on financial strength and the ability to pay claims, factors more relevant to contract holders than investors.  We believe that the ratings assigned by nationally recognized, independent rating agencies are material to our operations.  There may be other rating agencies that also rate our insurance companies, which we do not disclose in our reports.

﻿

Insurer Financial Strength Ratings



The insurer financial strength rating scales of A.M. Best, Fitch Ratings (“Fitch”), Moody’s Investors Service (“Moody’s”) and S&P are characterized as follows:



·A.M. Best – A++ to S

·Fitch – AAA to C

·Moody’s – Aaa to C

·S&P – AAA to D

﻿

As of February 16, 2018, the financial strength ratings of our principal insurance subsidiaries, as published by the principal rating agencies that rate us,were as follows:

﻿

﻿

﻿﻿A.M. BestFitchMoody'sS&PInsurer Financial Strength RatingsThe Lincoln National Life Insurance Company ("LNL")A+A+A1AA-﻿(2nd of 16)(5th of 19)(5th of 21)(4th of 21)﻿Lincoln Life & Annuity Company of New York ("LLANY")A+A+A1AA-﻿(2nd of 16)(5th of 19)(5th of 21)(4th of 21)﻿First Penn-Pacific Life Insurance Company ("FPP")AA+A1A-﻿(3rd of 16)(5th of 19)(5th of 21)(7th of 21)

﻿

A downgrade of the financial strength rating of one of our principal insurance subsidiaries could affect our competitive position in the insurance industry and make it more difficult for us to market our products, as potential customers may select companies with higher financial strength ratings.  Ratings are not recommendations to buy our securities.

﻿

All of our financial strength ratings are on outlook stable, except for Fitch’s ratings, which are on outlook positive.  All of our ratings are subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the rating agencies, and therefore, no assurance can be given that our principal insurance subsidiaries can maintain these ratings.  Each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating.  See “Review of Consolidated Financial Condition – Liquidity and Capital Resources – Sources of Liquidity and Cash Flow” in the MD&A for a discussion of our credit ratings.

﻿












REGULATORY

﻿

Insurance Regulation



Our insurance subsidiaries, like other insurance companies, are subject to regulation and supervision by the states, territories and countries in which they are licensed to do business.  The extent of such regulation varies, but generally has its source in statutes that delegate regulatory, supervisory and administrative authority to supervisory agencies.  In the U.S., this power is vested in state insurance departments.



In supervising and regulating insurance companies, state insurance departments, charged primarily with protecting contract holders and the public rather than investors, enjoy broad authority and discretion in applying applicable insurance laws and regulation for that purpose.  Our principal insurance subsidiaries, LNL, LLANY and FPP, are domiciled in the states of Indiana, New York and Indiana, respectively.

﻿

The insurance departments of the domiciliary states exercise principal regulatory jurisdiction over our insurance subsidiaries.  The extent of regulation by the states varies, but in general, most jurisdictions have laws and regulations governing standards of solvency, adequacy of reserves, reinsurance, capital adequacy, licensing of companies and agents to transact business, prescribing and approving policy forms, regulating premium rates for some lines of business, prescribing the form and content of financial statements and reports, regulating the type and amount of investments permitted and standards of business conduct.Insurance company regulation is discussed further under “Insurance Holding Company Regulation” and “Restrictions on Subsidiaries’ Dividends and Other Payments.”

﻿

As part of their regulatory oversight process, state insurance departments conduct periodic, generally once every three to five years, examinations of thebooks, records, accountsand business practices of insurers domiciled in their states.Examinations are generally carried out in cooperation with the insurance regulators of other states underguidelines promulgated by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (“NAIC”).  State and federal insurance and securities regulatory authorities and other state law enforcement agencies and Attorneys General also, from time to time, make inquiries and conduct examinations or investigations regarding the compliance by our company, as well as other companies in our industry, with, among other things, insurance laws and securities laws.  Our captive reinsurance and reinsurance subsidiaries are subject to periodic financial examinations by their respective domiciliary state insurance regulators.We have not received any material adverse findings resulting from state insurance department examinations of our insurance, reinsurance and captive reinsurance subsidiaries conducted duringthe three-year period ended December 31, 2017.

﻿

State insurance laws and regulations require our U.S. insurance companies to file financial statements with state insurance departments everywhere they do business, and the operations of our U.S. insurance companies and accounts are subject to examination by those departments at any time.  Our U.S. insurance companies prepare statutory financial statements in accordance with accounting practices and procedures prescribed or permitted by these departments.  The NAIChas approved a series of statutory accounting principles that have been adopted, in some cases with minor modifications, by virtually all state insurance departments.  Changes in these statutory accounting principles can significantly affect our capital and surplus.For more information, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors–Legislative, Regulatory and Tax–Attempts to mitigate the impact of Regulation XXX and Actuarial Guideline 38 may fail in whole or in part resulting in an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.”

﻿

The NAIC’s adoption of the new Valuation Manual that defines a principles-based reserving framework for newly issued life insurance policies waseffective January 1, 2017.Principles-based reservingplacesa greater weight on our past experience and anticipated future experience as well as considerscurrent economic conditions in calculating life insurance product reserves in accordance with statutory accounting principles.  We adoptedthe new framework for primarily our newly issued term businessin 2017and will phase in the framework prior to January 1, 2020, for all other newly issued life insurance products.  We believe that these changes mayreduceour future use of captive reinsurance and reinsurance subsidiaries for reserve financing transactions for our life insurance business.  Additionally, the NAIC through its various committees, task forces and working groups has been evaluating the adequacy of existing NAIC model regulations with a focus on targeted improvements to the statutory reserving and accounting framework for variable annuities.  For more information, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors –Legislative, Regulatory and Tax–Changes in accounting standards issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board or other standard-setting bodies may adversely affect our financial statements.”

﻿

For more information onstatutory reserving and our use of captive reinsurance structures,see “Review of Consolidated Financial Condition –Liquidity and Capital Resources– Sources of Liquidity and Cash Flow – Insurance Subsidiaries’ Statutory Capital and Surplus” in the MD&A.

﻿

Insurance Holding Company Regulation



LNC and its primary insurance subsidiaries are subject to regulation pursuant to the insurance holding company laws of the states of Indiana and New York.  These insurance holding company laws generally require an insurance holding company and insurers that are members of such insurance holding company’s system to register with the insurance department authorities, to file with it certain reports disclosing information, including their capital structure, ownership,management, financial conditionand certain inter-company transactions, including material transfers of assets and inter-company business agreements and to report material changes in that information.  These laws also require that inter-company transactions be fair and reasonable and, under certain circumstances, prior approval of the insurance departments must be received before entering into an inter-company transaction.  Further, these laws require that an insurer’s contract holders’ surplus following any dividends or distributions to shareholder affiliates is reasonable in relation to the insurer’s outstanding liabilities and adequate for its financial needs.










In general, under state holding company regulations, no person may acquire, directly or indirectly, a controlling interest in our capital stock unless such person, corporation or other entity has obtained prior approval from the applicable insurance commissioner for such acquisition of control.  Pursuant to such laws, in general, any person acquiring, controlling or holding the power to vote, directly or indirectly, 10% or more of the voting securities of an insurance company, is presumed to have “control” of such company.  This presumption may be rebutted by a showing that control does not exist in fact.  The insurance commissioner, however, may find that “control” exists in circumstances in which a person owns or controls a smaller amount of voting securities.  To obtain approval from the insurance commissioner of any acquisition of control of an insurance company, the proposed acquirer must file with the applicable commissioner an application containing information regarding: the identity and background of the acquirer and its affiliates; the nature, source and amount of funds to be used to carry out the acquisition; the financial statements of the acquirer and its affiliates; any potential plans for disposition of the securities or business of the insurer; the number and type of securities to be acquired; any contracts with respect to the securities to be acquired; any agreements with broker-dealers; and other matters.



Other jurisdictions in which our insurance subsidiaries are licensed to transact business may have similar or additional requirements for prior approval of any acquisition of control of an insurance or reinsurance company licensed or authorized to transact business in those jurisdictions.  Additional requirements in those jurisdictions may include re-licensing or subsequent approval for renewal of existing licenses upon an acquisition of control.  As further described below, laws that govern the holding company structure also govern payment of dividends to us by our insurance subsidiaries.

﻿

Restrictions on Subsidiaries’ Dividends and Other Payments



We are a holding company that transacts substantially all of our business directly and indirectly through subsidiaries.  Our primary assets are the stock of our operating subsidiaries.  Our ability to meet our obligations on our outstanding debt and to pay dividends and our general and administrative expenses depends on the surplus and earnings of our subsidiaries and the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or to advance or repay funds to us.

﻿

Our insurance subsidiaries are subject to certain insurance department regulatory restrictions as to the transfer of funds and payment of dividends to the holding company.  Under Indiana laws and regulations, our Indiana insurance subsidiaries, including our primary insurance subsidiary, LNL, may pay dividends to uswithout prior approval of the Indiana Insurance Commissioner (the “Commissioner”), only from unassigned surplus or must receive prior approval of the Commissioner to pay a dividend if such dividend, along with all other dividends paid within the preceding 12 consecutive months, would exceed the statutory limitation.  The current statutory limitation is thegreaterof 10% of the insurer’s contract holders’ surplus, as shown on its last annual statement on file with the Commissioner or the insurer’s statutory net gain from operations for the previous 12 months, but in no event to exceed statutory unassigned surplus.  Indiana law gives the Commissioner broad discretion to disapprove requests for dividends in excess of these limits.  LNL’s subsidiary, LLANY, a New York-domiciled insurance company,is bound bysimilar restrictionsunderNew Yorklaw, with the applicable statutory limitation on dividends equal tothe lesser of 10% of surplus to contract holders as of the immediately preceding calendar year or net gain from operations for the immediately preceding calendar year, not including realized capital gains.

﻿

Indiana law also provides that following the payment of any dividend, the insurer’s contract holders’ surplus must be reasonable in relation to its outstanding liabilities and adequate for its financial needs, and permits the Commissioner to bring an action to rescind a dividend that violates these standards.  In the event the Commissioner determines that the contract holders’ surplus of one subsidiary is inadequate, the Commissioner could use his or her broad discretionary authority to seek to require us to apply payments received from another subsidiary for the benefit of that insurance subsidiary.  For information regarding dividends paid to us during 2017from our insurance subsidiaries, see “Review of Consolidated Financial Condition – Liquidity and Capital Resources – Sources of Liquidity and Cash Flow” in the MD&A.

﻿

Risk-Based Capital



The NAIC has adoptedrisk-based capital (“RBC”)requirements for life insurance companies to evaluate the adequacy of statutory capital and surplus in relation to investment and insurance risks.  The requirements provide a means of measuring the minimum amount of statutory surplus appropriate for an insurance company to support its overall business operations based on its size and risk profile.  There are five major risks involved in determining the requirements:

﻿

﻿

﻿CategoryNameDescriptionAsset risk–affiliatesC-0Risk of assets' default for certain affiliated investmentsAsset risk–othersC-1Risk of assets' default of principal and interest or fluctuation in fair valueInsurance riskC-2Risk of underestimating liabilities from business already written or inadequately pricing﻿business to be written in the futureInterest rate risk, health creditC-3Risk of losses due to changes in interest rate levels, risk that health benefits prepaid torisk and market riskproviders become the obligation of the health insurer once again and risk of loss due﻿to changes in market levels associated with variable products with guaranteesBusiness riskC-4Risk of general business

﻿

A company’s risk-based statutory surplus is calculated by applying factors and performing calculations relating to various asset, premium, claim, expense and reserve items.  Regulators can then measure adequacy of a company’s statutory surplus by comparing it to the RBC








determined by the formula.  Under RBC requirements, regulatory compliance is determined by the ratio of a company’s total adjusted capital, as defined by the NAIC, to its company action level of RBC (known as the RBC ratio), also as defined by the NAIC.

﻿

Accordingly, factors that have an impact on the total adjusted capital of our insurance subsidiaries, such as the permitted practices discussed above, will also affect their RBC levels.Four levels of regulatory attention may be triggered if the RBC ratio is insufficient:



·“Company action level” – If the RBC ratio is between 75% and 100%, then the insurer must submit a plan to the regulator detailing corrective action it proposes to undertake;

·“Regulatory action level” – If the RBC ratio is between 50% and 75%, then the insurer must submit a plan, but a regulator may also issue a corrective order requiring the insurer to comply within a specified period;

·“Authorized control level” – If the RBC ratio is between 35% and 50%, then the regulatory response is the same as at the “Regulatory action level,” but in addition, the regulator may take action to rehabilitate or liquidate the insurer; and

·“Mandatory control level” – If the RBC ratio is less than 35%, then the regulator must rehabilitate or liquidate the insurer.



As of December 31, 2017, the RBC ratios of LNL, LLANY and FPP reported to their respective states of domicile and the NAIC all exceeded the “company action level.”  We believe that we will be able to maintain the RBC ratios of our insurance subsidiaries in excess of “company action level” through prudent underwriting, claims handling, investing and capital management.  However, no assurances can be given that developments affecting the insurance subsidiaries, many of which could be outside of our control, will not cause the RBC ratios to fall below our targeted levels.  These developments may include, but may not be limited to:  changes to the manner in which the RBC ratio is calculated; new regulatory requirements for calculating reserves, such as principles-based reserving; economic conditions leading to higher levels of impairments of securities in our insurance subsidiaries’ general accounts; and an inability to finance life reservessuch as the issuanceof letters of credit(“LOCs”) supporting inter-companyreinsurance structures.

﻿

See “Item 1A. Risk Factors – Liquidity and Capital Position – A decrease in the capital and surplus of our insurance subsidiaries may result in a downgrade to our credit and insurer financial strength ratings”and “Item IA. Risk Factors–Legislative, Regulatory and Tax– Our businesses are heavily regulated and changes in regulation may affect our insurance subsidiary capital requirements or reduce our profitability.”

﻿

Privacy Regulations

﻿

In the course of our business, we collect and maintain personal data from our customers including personally identifiable non-public financial and health information, which subjects us to regulation under federal and state privacy laws.  These laws require that we institute certain policies and procedures in our business to safeguard this information from improper use or disclosure.  While we employ a robust and tested information security program, iffederal or state regulators establish further regulations for addressing customer privacy, we may need to amend our policies and adapt our internal procedures.For information regarding cybersecurity risks, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors – Operational Matters –Our information systems may experience interruptions or breaches in security and a failure of disaster recovery systems could result in a loss or disclosure of confidential information, damage to our reputation and impairment of our ability to conduct business effectively.”



Federal Initiatives

﻿

The U.S. federal government does not directly regulate the insurance industry; however, federal initiatives from time to time can impact the insurance industry.Although much of the initial rulemaking has been completed, the implementation process continues and the marketplace continues to evolve in the changing regulatory environment.

﻿

Financial Reform Legislation

﻿

Since it was enacted in 2010, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (“Dodd-Frank Act”)has imposed considerable reform inthe financial services industry.  The ongoing implementation continues to present challenges and uncertainties for financial market participants.For instance, the Dodd-Frank Actand corresponding global initiativesimposed significant changes to the regulation of derivatives transactions, which we use to mitigate many types of risk in our business.  The mandate to clear interest rate swaps requires us to post initial margin in support of these transactions, which was not required when we and our industry peers were permitted to transact these trades in the over-the-counter market.  We also expectincreased clearing costs as the marketplace responds to the evolving regulatory environment, including changes to capital requirements imposed on our bank counterparties.

﻿

Swap documentationand processing requirements continue tochange in light ofnewrules for margining uncleared swaps, and the ultimate impact on our derivatives use remains unclear.  The exchange of variation margin in over-the counter trades is already part of our standard practice, but the requirement to post initial margin beginning in 2020 will require us to manage our derivatives trading and the attendant liquidity requirements in ways we continue to evaluate.  Althoughtheserules provide some flexibility in the categories of eligible collateral, it is still possible that we may be required to hold more of our assets in cash and other low-yielding investments in order to satisfy margin requirements.  Documentation requirements attendant to the new margining regime are potentially burdensome and costly.  The new regulations may reduce the level of risk exposure we have to our derivatives counterparties (currently managed by holding collateral), but will increase our exposure to central clearinghouses and clearing members with which we transact.  Central clearinghouses and regulators alike continue to evaluate the appropriate allocation of risk in the event of the failure of a clearing member or clearinghouse, and the results of these deliberations may change our use of derivatives in ways we cannot yet determine.  The








standardization of derivatives products for clearing may make customized products unavailable or uneconomical, potentially decreasing the effectiveness of some of our hedging activities.  As implementation of the new regulatory framework continuesin the U.S. and abroad,and the marketplace continues to evolve, the extent to which our derivatives costs and strategies may change and the extent to which those changes may affect the range or pricing of our products remains uncertain.



In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act requires new regulations governing broker-dealers and investment advisers.  In particular, the fiduciary standard rulemaking could potentially have broad implications for how our products are designed and sold in the future.  In January 2011, theSecurities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) released a study on the obligations and standards of conduct of financial professionals, as required under the Dodd-Frank Act.  The SEC staff recommended establishing a uniform fiduciary standard for investment advisers and broker-dealers when providing investment advice about securities, including guidance for principal trading and definitions of the duties of loyalty and care owed to retail customers that would be consistent with the standard that currently applies to investment advisers.  A more uniform fiduciary standard could potentially affect our business in areas including, but not limited to:design and availability of proprietary products; commission-based compensation arrangements; advertising and other communications; use of finders or solicitors of clients (i.e., business contacts who provide referrals); and continuing education requirements for advisors.

﻿

Additional provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act include, among other things, the creation of a new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to protect consumers of certain financial products; and changesto certain corporate governance rules.  The SEC has postponed rule making on a number of these provisionsindefinitely.  InDecember 2013, the new Federal Insurance Office established undertheDodd-FrankActissued a wide-ranging report on the state of insurance regulation in the U.S., together with a series of recommendations on ways to monitor and improve the regulatory environment.  The ultimate impact of these recommendations on our business is undeterminable at this time.

﻿

Department of Labor Regulation

﻿

On April 8, 2016, the Department of Labor (“DOL”) released theDOL Fiduciary Rule, whichbecame effective on June 9, 2017, andsubstantially expandedthe range of activities thatareconsidered to be fiduciary investment advice under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974(“ERISA”)and the Internal Revenue Code.The DOL Fiduciary Rule providedfor a phased implementation of the provisions of this new regulation,withthe firstparteffective onJune 9, 2017, andfull implementationon January 1, 2018.Under the DOL Fiduciary Rule, the investment-related information and support that our advisors and employees may provide to plan sponsors, participants and IRA holders on a non-fiduciary basisis morelimitedthanwhatwas previouslyallowedby regulation.  As a result, changes to the methods thatwe useto (i) deliver products and services, and (ii) pay andreceive compensation forourinvestment-related products and serviceshave occurred, which may impactfuturesales or margins.  In addition, to the extent that advisors withouraffiliated retail broker-dealers(LFN)provide fiduciary investment advice as defined in the DOL Fiduciary Rule, it could expose those broker-dealers and theiradvisors to additional risk of legal liability in connection with that advice, which ultimately impactsus.

﻿

On February 3, 2017,President Trump directed the DOL to prepare an updated economic and legal analysis on whether the DOL FiduciaryRule (i) has harmed or is likely to harm investors due to a reduction of Americans’ access to certain retirement savings offerings, retirement product structures, retirement savings information or related advice, (ii) has resulted in dislocations or disruptions within the retirement services industry that may adversely affect investors or retirees and (iii) is likely to cause an increase in litigation and an increase in prices that investors or retirees must pay to gain access to retirement services.

﻿

On April 7, 2017, the DOL issued a final rule delaying the applicability date of the DOL Fiduciary Rule and related exemptions from April 10, 2017, to June 9, 2017.  On November 27, 2017, the DOL issued another final rule extending the transition period and delaying full implementation from January 1, 2018, to July 1, 2019.  The DOL also changed some requirements initially released in April 2016, including (i) advisors relying on the Best Interest Contract Exemption will need to adhere to the Impartial Conduct Standards during the transition period of June 9, 2017, through July 1, 2019, but will not need to send certain disclosures to retirement investors during that time period and (ii) advisors will be permitted to rely on Prohibited Transaction Exemption 84-24 until July 1, 2019, for the sale of all annuities and insurance, provided they adhere to that exemption’s Impartial Conduct Standards as of June 9, 2017.  As a result of this latest delay and the directive to the DOL to further study the effects of the DOL Fiduciary Rule on the retail retirement market, there may be additional changes to the DOL Fiduciary Rule and/or further delays to these dates.

﻿

Federal Tax Legislation



On December 22, 2017, President Trump signed into law the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”).  The Tax Act results in sweeping reforms, including tax rate reductions for corporations and individuals, an expansion of the tax base through the elimination or reduction of specified deductions and credits and incentives related to growth and development including providing for the immediate write-off of qualifying capital investment.  Specific provisions that affect corporations generally relate to limitations on the deductibility of expenses related to interest, executive compensation and business entertainment.  The Tax Act repeals the ability to carry back tax losses to prior tax years and also repeals the corporate Alternative Minimum Tax.

﻿

The Tax Act contains a number of provisions that directly impact insurance companies.  Specifically, there are changes to the calculation of tax reserves associated with policyholder liabilities, modifications to the computations of capitalized expenses for tax purposes of amounts incurred to originate or acquire insurance contracts (commonly referred to as the DAC tax) and changes to the proration formula used to determine the amount of dividends eligible to be included in the dividends-received deduction.The vast majority of the provisions in the Tax Act are effective January 1, 2018.  As noted, the changes to the Internal Revenue Code are significant and broad-








based and will require interpretation as companies move forward with implementing the changes.  We expect clarifying guidance to be released in the future in the form of a technical corrections bill, administrative guidance or Treasury regulations.

﻿

The uncertainty of federal funding and the future of the Social Security Disability Insurance (“SSDI”) program can have a substantial impact on the entire group benefit market, because SSDI benefits are a direct offset to the cost of group disability benefits.Congress alleviated some of this uncertainty by passing the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015.  As a result, the Social Security Administration’s 2017Annual Report projects that the SSDI reserves will not be depleted until 2034.

﻿

Health Care Reform Legislation

﻿

In March 2010,President Obamasigned into law the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act,which was subsequently amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act.  This legislation, as well as subsequent state and federal laws and regulations, includes provisions that provide for additional taxes to help finance the cost of these reformsand substantive changes and additions to health care and related laws, which could potentially impactsome of our lines of business.We continue to monitor efforts by the government to repeal or replace provisions of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and those effects on our businesses.

﻿

Patriot Act

The USA PATRIOT Act of 2001 includes anti-money laundering and financial transparency laws as well as various regulations applicable to broker-dealers and other financial services companies, including insurance companies.  Financial institutions are required to collect information regarding the identity of their customers, watch for and report suspicious transactions, respond to requests for information by regulatory authorities and law enforcement agencies and share information with other financial institutions.  As a result, we are required to maintain certain internal compliance practices, procedures and controls.

ERISA Considerations

﻿

ERISA is a comprehensive federal statute that applies to U.S. employee benefit plans sponsored by private employers and labor unions.  Plans subject to ERISA include pension and profit sharing plans and welfare plans, including health, life and disability plans.  ERISA provisions include reporting and disclosure rules, standards of conduct that apply to plan fiduciaries and prohibitions on transactions known as “prohibited transactions,” such as conflict-of-interest transactions and certain transactions between a benefit plan and a party in interest.  ERISA also provides for a scheme of civil and criminal penalties and enforcement.  Our insurance, asset management, plan administrative services and other businesses provide services to employee benefit plans subject to ERISA, including services where we may act as an ERISA fiduciary.  In addition to ERISA regulation of businesses providing products and services to ERISA plans, we become subject to ERISA’s prohibited transaction rules for transactions with those plans, which may affect our ability to enter transactions, or the terms on which transactions may be entered, with those plans, even in businesses unrelated to those giving rise to party in interest status.

Broker-Dealer and Securities Regulation

﻿

In addition to being registered under the Securities Act of 1933, some of our separate accounts as well as mutual funds that we sponsor are registered as investment companies under the Investment Company Act of 1940, and the shares of certain of these entities are qualified for sale in some or all states and the District of Columbia.  We also have several subsidiaries that are registered as broker-dealers under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (“Exchange Act”) and are subject to federal and state regulation, including,but not limited to,the Financial Industry Regulation Authority’s (“FINRA”) net capital rules.  In addition, we have several subsidiaries that areregisteredinvestmentadvisorsunder the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.  Agents, advisorsand employees registered or associated with any of our broker-dealer subsidiaries are subject to the Exchange Act and to examination requirements and regulation by the SEC, FINRA and state securities commissioners.  Regulation also extends to various LNC entities that employ or control those individuals.  The SEC and other governmental agencies and self-regulatory organizations, as well as state securities commissions in the U.S., have the power to conduct administrative proceedings that can result in censure, fines, the issuance of cease-and-desist orders or suspension and termination or limitation of the activities of the regulated entity or its employees.

Environmental Considerations



Federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations apply to our ownership and operation of real property.  Inherent in owning and operating real property are the risksof hidden environmental liabilities and the costs of any required clean-up.  Under the laws of certain states, contamination of a property may give rise to a lien on the property to secure recovery of the costs of clean-up, which could adversely affect our commercial mortgage lending.  In several states, this lien has priority over the lien of an existing mortgage against such property.  In addition, in some states and under the federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (“CERCLA”), we may be liable, as an “owner” or “operator,” for costs of cleaning-up releases or threatened releases of hazardous substances at a property mortgaged to us.  We also risk environmental liability when we foreclose on a property mortgaged to us.  Federal legislation provides for a safe harbor from CERCLA liability for secured lenders that foreclose and sell the mortgaged real estate, provided that certain requirements are met.  However, there are circumstances in which actions taken could still expose us to CERCLA liability.  Application of various other federal and state environmental laws could also result in the imposition of liability on us for costs associated with environmental hazards.












We routinely conduct environmental assessments for real estate we acquire for investment and before taking title through foreclosure to real property collateralizing mortgages that we hold.  Although unexpected environmental liabilities can always arise, based on these environmental assessments and compliance with our internal procedures, we believe that any costs associated with compliance with environmental laws and regulations or any clean-up of properties would not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.

Intellectual Property

﻿

We rely on a combination of copyright, trademark, patent and trade secret laws to establish and protect our intellectual property.  We have implemented a patent strategy designed to protect innovative aspects of our products and processes which we believe distinguish us from competitors.  We currently own several issued U.S. patents.

﻿

We have an extensive portfolio of trademarks and service marks that we consider important in the marketing of our products and services, including, among others, the trademarks of the Lincoln National and Lincoln Financial names, the Lincoln silhouette logo and the combination of these marks.  Trademark registrations may be renewed indefinitely subject to continued use and registration requirements.  We regard our trademarks as valuable assets in marketing our products and services and intend to protect them against infringement and dilution.

﻿

EMPLOYEES

﻿

As of December 31, 2017, we had a totalof 9,047employees.  In addition, we had a total of 1,147planners and agents who had active sales contracts with one of our insurance subsidiaries.  None of our employees are represented by a labor union, and we are not a party to any collective bargaining agreements.  We consider our employee relations to be good.
