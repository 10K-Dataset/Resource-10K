BUSINESS SEGMENTS AND OTHER OPERATIONS



RETIREMENT SOLUTIONS



Overview



The Retirement Solutions business, with principal operations in Radnor, Pennsylvania; Fort Wayne, Indiana; Hartford, Connecticut; and Greensboro, North Carolina and additional operations in Concord, New Hampshire and Arlington Heights, Illinois, provides its products through two segments:  Annuities and Defined Contribution.  The Retirement Solutions – Annuities segment provides tax-deferred investment growth and lifetime income opportunities for its clients by offering individual fixed annuities, including indexed annuities, and variable annuities.  The Retirement Solutions – Defined Contribution segment provides employer-sponsored variable and fixed annuities, defined benefit, individual retirement accounts and mutual-fund based programs in the retirement plan marketplaces.  Products for both segments are distributed through a wide range of intermediaries including both affiliated and unaffiliated channels of advisors, consultants, brokers, banks and wirehouses.



Retirement Solutions – Annuities



Overview



The Retirement Solutions – Annuities segment provides tax-deferred investment growth and lifetime income opportunities for its clients by offering fixed and variable annuities.  The Retirement Solutions – Annuities segment offers non-qualified and qualified fixed and variable annuities to individuals.  The “fixed” and “variable” classification describes whether we or the contract holders bear the investment risk of the assets supporting the contract.  This also determines the manner in which we earn investment margin profits from these products, either as investment spreads for fixed products or as asset-based fees charged to variable products.



Annuities have several features that are attractive to customers.  First, they provide tax-deferred growth on the underlying principal, thereby deferring the tax consequences of the growth in value until withdrawals are made from the accumulation values, often at lower tax rates occurring during retirement.  Second, annuities are unique in that contract holders can select a variety of payout alternatives to help provide an income flow for life.  Many annuity contracts include guarantee features (living and death benefits) that are not found in any other investment vehicle and, we believe, make annuities attractive especially in times of economic uncertainty.



Products



In general, an annuity is a contract between an insurance company and an individual or group in which the insurance company, after receipt of one or more premium payments, agrees to pay an amount of money either in one lump sum or on a periodic basis (i.e., annually, semi-annually, quarterly or monthly), beginning on a certain date and continuing for a period of time as specified in the contract or as requested.  Periodic payments can begin within 12 months after the premium is received (referred to as an immediate annuity) or at a future date in time (referred to as a deferred annuity).  This retirement vehicle helps protect an individual from outliving his or her money and can be either a fixed annuity or a variable annuity.








The Retirement Solutions – Annuities segment’s deposits (in millions) were as follows:



For the Years Ended December 31,201020092008DepositsVariable portion of variable annuity$5,099$4,007$6,690Fixed portion of variable annuity3,1673,1943,433Total variable annuity8,2667,20110,123Fixed indexed annuity2,0272,1821,078Other fixed annuity374979529Total annuity deposits$10,667$10,362$11,730



Variable Annuities



A variable annuity provides the contract holder the ability to direct the investment of premium deposits into one or more sub-accounts offered through the product (“variable portion”) or into a fixed account with a guaranteed return (“fixed portion”).  The value of the variable portion of the contract holder’s account varies with the performance of the underlying sub-accounts chosen by the contract holder.  The underlying assets of the sub-accounts are managed within a special insurance series of mutual funds.  The contract holder’s return is tied to the performance of the segregated assets underlying the variable annuity (i.e., the contract holder bears the investment risk associated with these investments).  The value of the fixed portion is guaranteed by us and recorded in our general account liabilities.  Variable annuity account values were $68.4 billion, $59.4 billion and $44.5 billion for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively, including the fixed portion of variable accounts of $3.5 billion, $4.0 billion and $3.6 billion, for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.



We charge mortality and expense assessments and administrative fees on variable annuity accounts to cover insurance and administrative expenses.  These assessments are built into accumulation unit values, which when multiplied by the number of units owned for any sub-account equals the contract holder’s account value for that sub-account.  The fees that we earn from these contracts are reported as insurance fees on our Consolidated Statements of Income (Loss).  In addition, for some contracts, we collect surrender charges that range from 0% to 10% of withdrawals when contract holders surrender their contracts during the surrender charge period, which is generally higher during the early years of a contract.



We offer A-share, B-share, C-share, L-share and bonus variable annuities, although not with every annuity product.  The differences in these relate to the sales charge and fee structure associated with the contract.



·An A-share has a front-end sales charge and no back-end contingent deferred sales charge, also known as a surrender charge.  The net premium (premium less front-end charge) is invested in the contract, resulting in full liquidity and lower mortality and expense assessments over the long term than those in other share classes.  A-share account values for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, were $11.1 billion, $8.6 billion and $5.7 billion, respectively.

·A B-share has a seven year surrender charge that attaches to each deposit and is only paid if the account is surrendered or withdrawals are in excess of contractual free withdrawals within the contract’s specified surrender charge period.  The entire premium is invested in the contract, but it offers limited liquidity during the surrender charge period. B-share account values for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, were $30.0 billion, $26.6 billion and $21.1 billion, respectively.

·A C-share has no front-end sales charge or back-end surrender charge.  Accordingly, it offers maximum liquidity but mortality and expense assessments are higher than those for A-share or B-share.  A persistency credit is applied beginning in year eight so that the total charge to the customer is consistent with B-share levels after that time.  C-share account values for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, were $2.3 billion, $2.1 billion and $1.7 billion, respectively.

·An L-share has a four to five year surrender charge that attaches to each deposit and is only paid if the account is surrendered or withdrawals are in excess of contractual free withdrawals within the contract’s specified surrender charge period.  The differences between the L-share and the B-share are the length of the surrender charge period and the fee structure.  L-shares have a shorter surrender charge period, so for the added liquidity, mortality and expense assessments are higher.  We offer L-share annuity products with persistency credits that are applied in all years after a specified contract duration so that the total charge to the customer is consistent with B-share levels.  L-share account values for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, were $19.3 billion, $16.4 billion and $11.5 billion, respectively.

·A bonus annuity is a variable annuity contract that offers a bonus credit to a contract based on a specified percentage (typically ranging from 2% to 5%) of each deposit.  The entire premium plus the bonus are invested in the sub-accounts supporting the contract.  It has a seven to nine year surrender charge.  The expenses are higher than those for a B-share.  We offer bonus annuity products with persistency credits that are applied in all years after a specified contract duration so that the total charge to the customer is consistent with B-share levels.  Bonus annuity account values for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, were $5.7 billion, $5.6 billion and $4.6 billion, respectively.






We offer guaranteed benefit riders with certain of our variable annuity products, such as a guaranteed death benefit (“GDB”), a guaranteed withdrawal benefit (“GWB”), a guaranteed income benefit (“GIB”) and a combination of such benefits.  Most of our variable annuity products also offer the choice of a fixed option that provides for guaranteed interest credited to the account value.



Approximately 93%, 92% and 91% of variable annuity separate account values had a GDB rider as of December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.  The GDB features offered in 2010 included those where we contractually guarantee to the contract holder that upon death,we will return no less than: the current contract value; the total deposits made to the contract, adjusted to reflect any partial withdrawals; the highest contract value on a specified anniversary date adjusted to reflect any partial withdrawals following the contract anniversary; or the current contract value plus a specified percentage of contract earnings, not to exceed a covered earnings limit.



Approximately 20%, 23% and 26% of variable annuity account values as of December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively, had aLincoln SmartSecurity® Advantage rider.  TheLincoln SmartSecurity® Advantage one-year benefit is a GWB rider that offers the contract holder a guarantee equal to the initial deposit (or contract value, if elected after issue), adjusted for any subsequent purchase payments or withdrawals.Lincoln SmartSecurity® Advantage one-year allows an owner to step up the guarantee amount automatically on the benefit anniversary to the current contract value if the contract value is greater than the guarantee amount at the time of step up.  To receive the full amount of the guarantee, annual withdrawals are limited to 5% of the guaranteed amount.  Withdrawals will continue until the longer of when the guarantee is equal to zero or for the rest of the owner’s life (“single life version”) or the life of the owner or owner’s spouse (“joint life version”) as long as withdrawals begin after attained age 65 and are limited to 5% of the guaranteed amount.  Withdrawals in excess of the applicable maximum in any contract year are assessed any applicable surrender charges, and the guaranteed amount is recalculated.

Fixed Annuities



A fixed annuity preserves the principal value of the contract while guaranteeing a minimum interest rate to be credited to the accumulation value.  We offer single and flexible premium fixed deferred annuities to the individual annuities market.  Single premium fixed deferred annuities are contracts that allow only a single premium to be paid.  Flexible premium fixed deferred annuities are contracts that allow multiple premium payments on either a scheduled or non-scheduled basis.  Our fixed annuities include both traditional fixed-rate and fixed indexed annuities.  With fixed deferred annuities, the contract holder has the right to surrender the contract and receive the current accumulation value less any applicable surrender charge and, if applicable, a market value adjustment (“MVA”).  Depending on market conditions, MVAs can, for some products, be less than zero, which means the MVA results in an increase to the amount received by the contract holder.



Fixed indexed annuities allow the contract holder to elect an interest rate linked to the performance of the Standard & Poor’s (“S&P”) 500 Index® (“S&P 500”).  The indexed interest rate is guaranteed never to be less than zero.  Our fixed indexed annuities provide contract holders a choice of a traditional fixed-rate account and one or more different indexed accounts.  A contract holder may elect to change allocations at renewal dates, either annually or biannually.  At each renewal date, we have the opportunity to re-price the indexed component (i.e. reset the caps, spreads or participation rates), subject to guarantees.



Fixed annuity contracts are general account obligations.  We bear the investment risk for fixed annuity contracts.  To protect from premature withdrawals, we impose surrender charges.  Surrender charges are typically applicable during the early years of the annuity contract, with a declining level of surrender charges over time.  We expect to earn a spread between what we earn on the underlying general account investments supporting the fixed annuity product line and what we credit to our fixed annuity contract holders’ accounts.  In addition, with respect to fixed indexed annuities, we purchase options that are highly correlated to the indexed account allocation decisions of our contract holders, such that we are closely hedged with respect to indexed interest for the current reset period.  For more information on our hedging program for fixed indexed annuities, see “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates – Derivatives” and “Realized Gain (Loss)” in the MD&A.



Individual fixed annuity account values were $17.4 billion, $15.9 billion and $14.0 billion as of December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.  Approximately $13.3 billion of individual fixed annuity account values as of December 31, 2010, were still within the surrender charge period.



Our fixed annuity product offerings as of December 31, 2010, consisted of traditional fixed-rate and fixed indexed deferred annuities, as well as fixed-rate immediate annuities with various payment options, including lifetime incomes.  In addition to traditional fixed-rate immediate annuities, we offered theLincoln SmartIncomeSMInflation Annuity which provides lifetime income with annual adjustments to keep pace with inflation.  It uses a patent-pending design to preserve access to remaining principal, also adjusted annually for inflation, for premature death or unexpected needs.  The traditional fixed-rate deferred annuity products includeLincoln ClassicSM(Single and Flexible Premium),Lincoln SelectSM,Lincoln Smart Course®,Lincoln MYGuaranteeSMPlus andLincoln GrowSmartSMFixed Annuity.  The fixed indexed deferred annuity products include LincolnOptiPoint®,Lincoln OptiChoiceSMandLincoln New Directions®.  The fixed indexed annuities offer one or more of the following indexed accounts:



·The Performance Triggered Indexed Account pays a specified rate, declared at the beginning of the indexed term, if the S&P 500 value at the end of the indexed term is the same or greater than the S&P 500 value at the beginning of the indexed term;

·The Point to Point Indexed Account compares the value of the S&P 500 at the end of the indexed term to the S&P 500 value at the beginning of the term.  If the S&P 500 at the end of the indexed term is higher than the S&P 500 value at the beginning of the term, then the percentage change, up to the declared indexed interest cap, is credited to the indexed account;

·The Monthly Cap Indexed Account reflects the monthly changes in the S&P 500 value over the course of the indexed term.  Each month, the percentage change in the S&P 500 value is calculated, subject to a monthly indexed cap that is declared at the beginning of the indexed term.  At the end of the indexed term, all of the monthly change percentages are summed to determine the rate of indexed interest that will be credited to the account; and

·The Monthly Average Indexed Account compares the average monthly value of the S&P 500 to the S&P 500 value at the beginning of the term.  The average of the S&P 500 values at the end of each of the twelve months in the indexed term is calculated.  The percentage change of the average S&P 500 value to the starting S&P 500 value is calculated.  From that amount, the indexed interest spread, which is declared at the beginning of the indexed term, is subtracted.  The resulting rate is used to calculate the indexed interest that will be credited to the account.



If the S&P 500 values produce a negative indexed interest rate, no indexed interest is credited to the indexed account.



In November of 2010, we launched theLincoln Long-Term CareSMAdvantage fixed annuity.This product combines the features of a single premium fixed annuity with a long-term care rider.  It allows a contract holder the protection of principal, while providing a way to manage the potential impact of long-term care expenses.  The long-term care rider provides the contract holder with the potential to receive long-term care benefits equal to the premium payment plus an additional amount equal to one or two times the premium payment.  In addition, the contract holder has the opportunity to increase the long-term care benefits if there are gains in the contract.






Available with certain of our fixed indexed annuities,Lincoln Living IncomeSMAdvantage provides the contract holder a guaranteed lifetime withdrawal benefit.  Withdrawals in excess of the free amount are assessed any applicable surrender charges, and the guaranteed withdrawal amount is recalculated.



Many of our fixed annuities have an MVA.  If a contract with an MVA is surrendered during the surrender charge period, both a surrender charge and an MVA may be applied.  The MVA feature increases or decreases the contract value of the annuity based on a decrease or increase in interest rates.  Individual fixed annuities with an MVA feature constituted 61%, 55% and 46% of total fixed annuity account values as of December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.



Distribution



The Retirement Solutions – Annuities segment distributes its individual fixed and variable annuity products through LFD.  LFD’s distribution channels give the Retirement Solutions – Annuities segment access to its target markets.  LFD distributes the segment’s products to a large number of financial intermediaries, including LFN.  The financial intermediaries include wire/regional firms, independent financial planners, financial institutions and managing general agents.



Competition



The annuities market is very competitive and consists of many companies, with no one company dominating the market for all products.  The Annuities segment competes with numerous other financial services companies.  The main factors upon which entities in this market compete are distribution channel access and the quality of wholesalers, investment performance, cost, product features, speed to market, brand recognition, financial strength ratings, crediting rates and client service.



Retirement Solutions – Defined Contribution



Overview



The Retirement Solutions – Defined Contribution segment provides employers with retirement plan products and services, primarily in the defined contribution retirement plan marketplaces.  While our focus is employer-sponsored defined contribution plans, we also serve the defined benefit plan and individual retirement account (IRA) markets.  We provide a variety of plan investment vehicles, including individual and group variable annuities, group fixed annuities and mutual fund-based programs.  We also offer a broad array of plan services including plan recordkeeping, compliance testing, participant education and other related services.



DC plans are a popular employee benefit offered by many employers across a wide spectrum of industries and by employers large and small.  Some plans include employer matching of employee contributions, which can increase participation by employees.  Growth in the number of DC plans has occurred as these plans have been used as replacements for frozen or eliminated defined benefit retirement plans.  In general, DC plans offer tax-deferred contributions and investment growth, thereby deferring the tax consequences of both the contributions and investment growth until withdrawals are made from the accumulated values, often at lower tax rates occurring during retirement.  The types of DC plans on which the Retirement Solutions – Defined Contribution segment primarily focuses are Internal Revenue Code section 403(b) plans and section 401(k) plans.



Retirement Solutions – Defined Contribution’s 403(b) assets accounted for 58% of total assets under management in this segment as of December 31, 2010.  The mid to large market 401(k) business accounted for 17% and the small market 401(k) business accounted for 15% of this segment’s assets as of December 31, 2010 for this segment.

Account values for theMulti-Fund® variable annuity were $11.4 billion, $10.9 billion and $9.7 billion as of December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.



Also within this segment, we have created theLincoln Unifier® service offering to further assist employers in meeting the administrative challenges of bringing retirement plans into compliance with the new 403(b) regulations.Lincoln Unifier® includes common remitter administration, compliance monitoring and proactive transaction monitoring.



During the third quarter of 2010, we partnered with a leading provider of retirement recordkeeping services to enhance our retirement plan offerings.  Through this partnership, we expect to reduce our current recordkeeping platforms from five to one over the next several years.



Distribution



DC products are primarily distributed by LFD.  Wholesalers and managers distribute these products through advisors, consultants, banks, wirehouses, TPAs and individual planners.  During 2010, LFD expanded its distribution of DC products by increasing wholesalers and managers from 44 to 49, increasing relationship management expertise and growing the number of broker dealer relationships.



TheMulti-Fund® program is sold primarily by affiliated advisors.  TheLINCOLN ALLIANCE® program and theLincoln SmartFuture® program are sold primarily through consultants and affiliated advisors.  LINCOLN DIRECTORSMgroup variable annuity is sold in the small marketplace by intermediaries, including TPAs, planners and wirehouses.



Competition



The DC marketplace is very competitive and is comprised of many providers, with no one company dominating the market for all products.  As stated above, we compete in the small, mid and large markets.  We compete with numerous other financial services companies.  The main factors upon which entities in this market compete are distribution channel access and the quality of wholesalers, investment performance, cost, product features, speed to market, brand recognition, financial strength ratings, crediting rates, client service and client compliance and fiduciary services.



INSURANCE SOLUTIONS



The Insurance Solutions business provides its products through two segments:  Life Insurance and Group Protection.  The Insurance Solutions – Life Insurance segment offers wealth protection and transfer opportunities through term insurance, a linked-benefit product and both single and survivorship versions of UL and VUL, including COLI and BOLI products.  The Insurance Solutions – Group Protection segment offers group life, disability and dental insurance primarily in the small- to mid-sized employer marketplace for their eligible employees.



Insurance Solutions – Life Insurance



Overview



The Insurance Solutions – Life Insurance segment, with principal operations in Greensboro, North Carolina and Hartford, Connecticut and additional operations in Concord, New Hampshire and Fort Wayne, Indiana, focuses on the creation and protection of wealth for its clients through the manufacturing of life insurance products.  The Insurance Solutions – Life Insurance segment offers wealth protection and transfer opportunities through term insurance, a linked-benefit product (which is a UL policy linked with riders that provide for long-term care costs) and both single and survivorship versions of UL and VUL, including COLI and BOLI products.



The Insurance Solutions – Life Insurance segment primarily targets the affluent to high net worth markets, defined as households with at least $250,000 of financial assets.  For those individual policies we sold in 2010, the average face amount (excluding term andMoneyGuard® products) was $1 million and average first year premiums paid were approximately $50,000.



The Insurance Solutions – Life Insurance segment also offers COLI and BOLI products and services to small- to mid-sized banks and mid- to large-sized corporations, mostly through executive benefit brokers.








Products



The Insurance Solutions – Life Insurance segment sells primarily interest/market-sensitive products (UL and VUL), including COLI and BOLI products, and term products.  The segment’s sales (in millions) were as follows:



For the Years Ended December 31,201020092008Sales by ProductUL:ExcludingMoneyGuard®$353$397$525MoneyGuard®1086750Total UL461464575VUL433654COLI and BOLI635184Term705928Total sales$637$610$741



UL and VUL sales (including COLI and BOLI), represent first year commissionable premiums plus 5% of excess premiums received, including an adjustment for internal replacements of approximately 50% of commissionable premiums; term sales represent 100% of first year paid premiums; and linked-benefit sales represent 15% of premium deposits.



The segment generally has higher sales in the second half of the year than in the first half of the year.  Approximately 44%, 44% and 46% of total sales were in the first half of 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.

Mortality margins, morbidity margins (for linked-benefit products), investment margins (through spreads or fees), net expense charges (expense charges assessed to the contract holder less expenses incurred to manage the business) and surrender fees drive life insurance profits.  Mortality margins, morbidity margins, and some expense assessments are a function of the rates priced into the product and level of insurance in force (less reserves previously set aside to fund benefits).  Insurance in force, in turn, is driven by sales, persistency and mortality experience.



Similar to the annuity product classifications described above, life products can be classified as “fixed” or “variable” contracts.  This classification describes whether we or the contract holders bear the investment risk of the assets supporting the policy.  This also determines the manner in which we earn investment margin profits from these products, either as investment spreads for fixed products or as asset-based fees charged to variable products.



We offer four categories of life insurance products consisting of:



Interest-sensitive Life Insurance (Primarily UL)



Interest-sensitive life insurance products provide life insurance with account (cash) values that earn rates of return based on company-declared interest rates.  Contract holder account values are invested in our general account investment portfolio, so we bear the risk of investment performance.  Some of our UL contracts include secondary guarantees, which are explained more fully below.



In a UL contract, contract holders have flexibility in the timing and amount of premium payments and the amount of death benefit, provided there is sufficient account value to cover all policy charges for mortality and expenses for the coming period.






Under certain contract holder options and market conditions, the death benefit amount may increase or decrease.  Premiums received on a UL product, net of expense loads and charges, are added to the contract holder’s account value.  The client has access to their account value (or a portion thereof), less surrender charges and policy loan payoffs, through contractual liquidity features such as loans, partial withdrawals and full surrenders.  Loans and withdrawals reduce the death benefit amount payable and are limited to certain contractual maximums (some of which are required under state law), and interest is charged on all loans.  Our UL contracts assess surrender charges against the policies’ account values for full or partial face amount surrenders that occur during the contractual surrender charge period.  Depending on the product selected, surrender charge periods can range from 0 to 20 years.



We also offer a fixed indexed UL product that functions similarly to a traditional UL policy, with the added flexibility of allowing contract holders to have portions of their account value earn interest credits linked to the performance of the S&P 500.  The indexed interest rate is guaranteed never to be less than 1%.  Our fixed indexed UL policy provides contract holders a choice of a traditional fixed rate account and several different indexed accounts.  A contract holder may elect to change allocations annually for amounts in the indexed accounts and quarterly for new premiums into the policy.  Prior to each new allocation, we have the opportunity to re-price the indexed components, subject to minimum guarantees.



As mentioned previously, we offer survivorship versions of our individual UL products.  These products insure two lives with a single policy and pay death benefits upon the second death.



Sales results are heavily influenced by the series of UL products with secondary guarantees.  A UL policy with a secondary guarantee can stay in force, even if the base policy account value is zero, as long as secondary guarantee requirements have been met.  The secondary guarantee requirement is based on the evaluation of a reference value within the policy, calculated in a manner similar to the base policy account value, but using different assumptions as to expense charges, cost of insurance (“COI”) charges and credited interest.  The assumptions for the secondary guarantee requirement are listed in the contract.  As long as the contract holder funds the policy to a level that keeps this calculated reference value positive, the death benefit will be guaranteed.  The reference value has no actual monetary value to the contract holder; it is only a calculated value used to determine whether or not the policy will lapse should the base policy account value be less than zero.



Unlike other GDB designs, our secondary guarantee benefits maintain the flexibility of a traditional UL policy, which allows a contract holder to take loans or withdrawals.  Although loans and withdrawals are likely to shorten the time period of the guaranteed death benefit, the guarantee is not automatically or completely forfeited, as is sometimes the case with other death benefit guarantee designs.  The length of the guarantee may be increased at any time through additional excess premium deposits.  Secondary guarantee UL face amount in force was $112.0 billion, $110.4 billion and $99.0 billion or 20%, 20% and 18% of total life policies’ in-force face amount as of December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.  For information on the reserving requirements for this business, see “Regulatory” below and “Results of Insurance Solutions – Insurance Solutions – Life Insurance – Income (Loss) from Operations – Strategies to Address Statutory Reserve Strain” in the MD&A.



We manage investment margins (i.e., the difference between the amount the portfolio earns compared to the amount that is credited to the customer) by seeking to maximize current yields, in line with asset/liability and risk management targets, while crediting a competitive rate to the customer.  Crediting rates are typically subject to guaranteed minimums specified in the underlying life insurance contract.



Linked-benefit Life Products



Linked-benefit life products combine UL with long-term care insurance through the use of riders.  The first rider allows the contract holder to accelerate death benefits on a tax-free basis in the event of a qualified long-term care need.  The second rider extends the long-term care insurance benefits for an additional period of time if the death benefit is fully depleted for the purposes of long-term care.  The policy also provides a death benefit, the value of which is excluded from federal income tax, to the contract holder’s beneficiary if the contract holder does not accelerate the entire amount of the death benefit as long-term care benefits during his or her life.  Linked-benefit life products generate earnings through investment, mortality and morbidity margins.MoneyGuard® products are linked-benefit life products.



VUL



VUL products are UL products that provide a return on account values linked to an underlying investment portfolio of sub-accounts offered through the product.  The value of the contract holder’s account varies with the performance of the sub-accounts chosen by the contract holder.  The underlying assets of the sub-accounts are managed within a special insurance series of mutual funds.  Premiums, net of expense loads and charges for mortality and expenses, received on VUL products are invested according to the contract holder’s investment option selection.  As the return on the investment portfolio increases or decreases, the account value of the VUL policy will increase or decrease.  As with fixed UL products, contract holders have access, within contractual maximums, to account values through loans, withdrawals and surrenders.  Surrender charges are assessed during the surrender






charge period, ranging from 0 to 20 years depending on the product.  The investment choices we offer in VUL products are the same, in most cases, as the investment choices offered in our individual variable annuity contracts.



In addition, VUL products offer a fixed account option that is managed by us.  Investment risk is borne by the customer on all but the fixed account option.  We charge fees for mortality costs and administrative expenses as well as asset-based investment management fees.



We also offer survivorship versions of our individual VUL products.  These products insure two lives with a single policy and pay death benefits upon the second death.



We also offer single life and survivorship versions of our VUL products with secondary guarantees.  These products combine the lapse protection elements of UL with the upside potential of a traditional VUL product, giving clients the flexibility to choose the appropriate balance between protection and market risk that meets their individual needs.  The combined single life and survivorship face amount in force of these products was $5.7 billion, $5.3 billion and $4.9 billion or 1% of total life policies’ in-force face amount as of December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.



Term Life Insurance



Term life insurance provides a fixed death benefit for a scheduled period of time.  It usually does not offer cash values.  Scheduled policy premiums are required to be paid at least annually.



Distribution



The Insurance Solutions – Life Insurance segment’s products are sold through LFD.  LFD provides the Insurance Solutions – Life Insurance segment with access to financial intermediaries in the following primary distribution channels:  wire/regional firms; independent planner firms (including LFN); financial institutions; and managing general agents/independent marketing organizations.  LFD distributes COLI and BOLI products primarily to 16 intermediaries who specialize in the executive benefits market and are serviced through a network of internal and external sales professionals



Competition



The life insurance industry is very competitive and consists of many companies with no one company dominating the market for all products.  As of the end of 2009, the latest year for which data is available, there were 946 life insurance companies in the U.S. and U.S. territories, according to the American Council of Life Insurers.



The Insurance Solutions – Life Insurance segment competes on product design and customer service.  The Insurance Solutions –Life Insurance segment designs products specifically for the high net worth and affluent markets.  In addition to the growth opportunity offered by its target market, our product breadth, design innovation, competitiveness, speed to market, customer service, underwriting and risk management and extensive distribution network all contribute to the strength of the Insurance Solutions – Life Insurance segment.  On average, the development of products takes approximately six months.  The Insurance Solutions – Life Insurance segment implemented several major product upgrades and/or new features, including important UL, VUL, linked-benefit and term product enhancements in 2010.  With respect to customer service, management tracks the speed, accuracy and responsiveness of service to customers’ calls and transaction requests.  Further, the Insurance Solutions – Life Insurance segment tracks the turnaround time and quality for various client services such as processing of applications.



Underwriting



In the context of life insurance, underwriting is the process of evaluating medical and non-medical information about an individual and determining the effect these factors statistically have on mortality.  This process of evaluation is often referred to as risk classification.  Of course, no one can accurately predict how long any individual will live, but certain risk factors can affect life expectancy and are evaluated during the underwriting process.



Claims Administration



Claims services are delivered to customers from the Greensboro, North Carolina and Concord, New Hampshire home offices.  Claims examiners are assigned to each claim notification based on coverage amount, type of claim and the experience of the examiner.  Claims meeting certain criteria are referred to senior claim examiners.  A formal quality assurance program is carried out to ensure the consistency and effectiveness of claims examining activities.  A network of in-house legal counsel, compliance officers, medical personnel and an anti-fraud investigative unit also support claim examiners.  A special team of claims examiners, in conjunction with claims management, focus on more complex claims matters such as long-term care claims, claims incurred during the contestable period, beneficiary disputes, litigated claims and the few invalid claims that are encountered.








The Insurance Solutions – Life Insurance segment maintains a centralized claim service center in order to minimize the volume of clerical and repetitive administrative demands on its claims examiners while providing convenient service to policy owners and beneficiaries.



Insurance Solutions – Group Protection



Overview



The Insurance Solutions – Group Protection segment based in Omaha, Nebraska offers group non-medical insurance products, principally term life, disability and dental, to the employer marketplace through various forms of contributory and noncontributory plans.  Most of the segment’s group contracts are sold to employers with fewer than 500 employees.



The segment’s insurance premiums (in millions) by product line were as follows:

Products



Group Life Insurance



We offer employer-sponsored group term life insurance products including basic, optional and voluntary term life insurance to employees and their dependents.  Additional benefits may be provided in the event of a covered individual’s accidental death or dismemberment.



Group Disability Insurance



We offer short- and long-term employer-sponsored group disability insurance, which protects an employee against loss of wages due to illness or injury.  Short-term disability generally provides benefits for up to 26 weeks following a short waiting period, ranging from 1 to 30 days.  Long-term disability provides benefits following a longer waiting period, usually between 30 and 180 days and provides benefits for a longer period, at least 2 years and typically extending to normal (Social Security) retirement age.



Group Dental



We offer employer-sponsored group dental insurance, which covers a portion of the cost of eligible dental procedures for employees and their dependents.  Products offered include indemnity coverage, which does not distinguish benefits based on a dental provider’s participation in a network arrangement, and a Preferred Provider Organization (“PPO”) product that does reflect the dental provider’s participation in the PPO network arrangement, including agreement with network fee schedules.



EXEC-U-CARE®



We manage employer-sponsored benefits designed to supplement a company’s major medical plan by reimbursing executives and eligible dependents for health care expenses not covered by the basic plan.  Along with medical expense reimbursement, EXEC-U-CARE plans include Accidental Death and Dismemberment coverage, EXEC-U-CARE CONCIERGE® health care assistance andTravelConnectSMtravel assistance services.



Distribution



The segment’s products are marketed primarily through a national distribution system, including approximately 160 managers and marketing representatives.  The managers and marketing representatives develop business through employee benefit brokers, TPAs and other employee benefit firms.








Competition



The group protection marketplace is very competitive.  Principal competitive factors include particular product features, price, quality of customer service and claims management, technological capabilities, financial strength and claims-paying ratings.  In the group insurance market, the Insurance Solutions – Group Protection segment competes with a limited number of major companies and selected other companies that focus on these products.



Underwriting



The Insurance Solutions – Group Protection segment’s underwriters evaluate the risk characteristics of each employee group.  Generally, the relevant characteristics evaluated include employee census information (such as age, gender, income and occupation), employer industry classification, geographic location, benefit design elements and other factors.  The segment employs detailed underwriting policies, guidelines and procedures designed to assist the underwriter to properly assess and quantify risks.  The segment uses technology to efficiently review, price and issue smaller cases, utilizing its underwriting staff on larger, more complex cases.  Individual underwriting techniques (including evaluation of individual medical history information) may be used on certain covered individuals selecting larger benefit amounts.  For voluntary and other forms of employee paid coverages, minimum participation requirements are used to obtain a better spread of risk and minimize the risk of anti-selection.



Claims Administration



Claims for the Insurance Solutions – Group Protection segment are managed by a staff of experienced claim specialists.  Disability claims management is especially important to segment results, as results depend on both the incidence and the length of approved disability claims.  The segment employs nurses and rehabilitation specialists to help evaluate medical conditions and develop return to work plans.  Independent medical reviews are routinely performed by external medical professionals to further evaluate conditions as part of the claim management process.



OTHER OPERATIONS



Other Operations includes the financial data for operations that are not directly related to the business segments.  Other Operations also includes investments related to the excess capital in our insurance subsidiaries; investments in media properties and other corporate investments; benefit plan net liability; the unamortized deferred gain on indemnity reinsurance related to the sale of reinsurance to Swiss Re in 2001; the results of certain disability income business due to the rescission of a reinsurance agreement with Swiss Re; our run-off Institutional Pension business in the form of group annuity and insured funding-type of contracts with assets under management of approximately $1.9 billion as of December 31, 2010; and debt.  We are actively managing our remaining radio station clusters to maximize performance and future value.

REINSURANCE



We follow the industry practice of reinsuring a portion of our life insurance and annuity risks with unaffiliated reinsurers.  In a reinsurance transaction, a reinsurer agrees to indemnify another insurer for part or all of its liability under a policy or policies it has issued for an agreed upon premium.  We use reinsurance to protect our insurance subsidiaries against the severity of losses on individual claims and unusually serious occurrences in which a number of claims produce an aggregate extraordinary loss.  We also use reinsurance to improve our results by leveraging favorable reinsurance pricing.  Although reinsurance does not discharge the insurance subsidiaries from their primary liabilities to their contract holders for losses insured under the insurance policies, it does make the assuming reinsurer liable to the insurance subsidiaries for the reinsured portion of the risk.  Because we bear the risk of nonpayment by one or more of our reinsurers, we primarily cede reinsurance to well-capitalized, highly rated reinsurers.








We reinsure approximately 40% to 45% of the mortality risk on newly issued non-term life insurance contracts and approximately 35% of total mortality risk including term insurance contracts.  As of December 31, 2010 our policy for this program was to retain no more than $10 million on a single insured life issued on fixed, VUL and term life insurance contracts.  The retention per single insured life for COLI remained at $2 million.



Effective January 1, 2011, our maximum corporate retention on UL, VUL and term insurance contracts increased to $20 million for new business.  This change has no impact on our reinsurance structure at this time.



Portions of our deferred annuity business have been reinsured on a modified coinsurance (“Modco”) basis with other companies to limit our exposure to interest rate risks.  In a Modco program, the reinsurer shares proportionally in all financial terms of the reinsured policies (i.e. premiums, expenses, claims, etc.) based on their respective quota share of the risk.



In addition, we acquire other reinsurance to cover products other than as discussed above with retentions and limits that management believes are appropriate for the circumstances.



We obtain reinsurance from a diverse group of reinsurers and we monitor concentration and financial strength ratings of our principal reinsurers.  Swiss Re represents our largest reinsurance exposure.  As of December 31, 2010 and 2009, the amounts recoverable from reinsurers were $6.5 billion and $6.4 billion, respectively, of which $3.0 billion was recoverable from Swiss Re, related to the sale of our reinsurance business to Swiss Re, for both periods.



We also utilize intercompany reinsurance agreements to manage our statutory capital position as well as our hedge program for variable annuity guarantees.  These intercompany agreements do not have an effect on our consolidated financial statements.



For more information regarding reinsurance, see “Reinsurance” in the MD&A and Note 9.  For risks involving reinsurance, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors – We face a risk of non-collectibility of reinsurance, which could materially affect our results of operations.”



RESERVES



The applicable insurance laws under which insurance companies operate require that they report, as liabilities, policy reserves to meet future obligations on their outstanding policies.  These reserves are the amounts that, with the additional premiums to be received and interest thereon compounded annually at certain assumed rates, are calculated to be sufficient to meet the various policy and contract obligations as they mature.  These laws specify that the reserves shall not be less than reserves calculated using certain specified mortality and morbidity tables, interest rates and methods of valuation.



For more information on reserves, see “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates – Derivatives” and “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates – Future Contract Benefits and Other Contract Holder Obligations” in the MD&A.



See “Regulatory” below for information on permitted practices and proposed regulations that may impact the amount of statutory reserves necessary to support our current insurance liabilities.



For risks related to reserves, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors – Changes in interest rates and sustained low interest rates may cause interest rate spreads to decrease and changes in interest rates may also result in increased contract withdrawals.”



INVESTMENTS



An important component of our financial results is the return on invested assets.  Our investment strategy is to balance the need for current income with prudent risk management, with an emphasis on generating sufficient current income to meet our obligations.  This approach requires the evaluation of risk and expected return of each asset class utilized, while still meeting our income objectives.  This approach also permits us to be more effective in our asset-liability management because decisions can be made based upon both the economic and current investment income considerations affecting assets and liabilities.  Investments by our insurance subsidiaries must comply with the insurance laws and regulations of the states of domicile.



We do not use derivatives for speculative purposes.  Derivatives are used for hedging purposes and income generation.  Hedging strategies are employed for a number of reasons including, but not limited to, hedging certain portions of our exposure to changes in our GDB, GWB and GIB liabilities, interest rate fluctuations, the widening of bond yield spreads over comparable maturity U.S. Government obligations and credit, foreign exchange and equity risks.  Income generation strategies include credit default swaps through replication synthetic asset transactions.  These derivatives synthetically create exposure in the general account to corporate debt, similar to investing in the credit markets.






As of December 31, 2010 and 2009, our most significant investments in one issuer were our investments in securities issued by the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation with a fair value of $5.0 billion and $4.8 billion, or 6% of our invested assets portfolio, respectively, and our investments in securities issued by Fannie Mae with a fair value of $2.9 billion and $3.0 billion, or 3% and 4% of our invested assets portfolio, respectively.



As of December 31, 2010, our most significant investments in one industry were our investment securities in the electric industry with a fair value of $6.7 billion, or 8% of our invested assets portfolio, and our investment securities in the collateralized mortgage obligation (“CMO”) industry with a fair value of $6.5 billion, or 8% of our invested assets portfolio.  As of December 31, 2009, our most significant investment in one industry was our investment securities in the CMO industry with a fair value of $6.9 billion, or 9% of the invested assets portfolio.



For additional information on our investments, including carrying values by category, quality ratings and net investment income, see “Consolidated Investments” in the MD&A, as well as Notes 1 and 5.



RATINGS



The Nationally Recognized Statistical Ratings Organizations rate the financial strength of our principal insurance subsidiaries and the debt of LNC.  Ratings are not recommendations to buy our securities.



Rating agencies rate insurance companies based on financial strength and the ability to pay claims, factors more relevant to contract holders than investors.  We believe that the ratings assigned by nationally recognized, independent rating agencies are material to our operations.  There may be other rating agencies that also rate our securities, which we do not disclose in our reports.



Insurer Financial Strength Ratings



The insurer financial strength rating scales of A.M. Best, Fitch Ratings (“Fitch”), Moody’s Investors Service (“Moody’s”) and S&P are characterized as follows:



·A.M. Best – A++ to S

·Fitch – AAA to C

·Moody’s – Aaa to C

·S&P – AAA to R



As of February 18, 2011, the financial strength ratings of our principal insurance subsidiaries, as published by the principal rating agencies that rate our securities, or us, were as follows:



A.M. BestFitchMoody'sS&PInsurer Financial Strength RatingsLNLA+A+A2AA-(2nd of 16)(5th of 21)(6th of 21)(4th of 21)Lincoln Life & Annuity Co. of New York ("LLANY")A+A+A2AA-(2nd of 16)(5th of 21)(6th of 21)(4th of 21)First Penn-Pacific Life Insurance Co. ("FPP")A+A+A2A+(2nd of 16)(5th of 21)(6th of 21)(5th of 21)



A downgrade of the financial strength rating of one of our principal insurance subsidiaries could affect our competitive position in the insurance industry and make it more difficult for us to market our products, as potential customers may select companies with higher financial strength ratings.



Debt Ratings



The long-term credit rating scales of A.M. Best, Fitch, Moody’s and S&P are characterized as follows:



·A.M. Best – aaa to d

·Fitch – AAA to D

·Moody’s – Aaa to C

·S&P – AAA to D






As of February 18, 2011, our long-term credit ratings, as published by the principal rating agencies that rate our long-term credit, were as follows:



A.M. BestFitchMoody'sS&Pa-BBB+Baa2A-(7th of 22)(9th of 21)(9th of 21)(7th of 21)



The short-term credit rating scales of A.M. Best, Fitch, Moody’s and S&P are characterized as follows:



·A.M. Best – AMB-1+ to d

·Fitch – F1+ to D

·Moody’s – P-1 to NP

·S&P – A-1+ to D



As of February 18, 2011, our short-term credit ratings, as published by the principal rating agencies that rate our short-term credit, were as follows:



A.M. BestFitchMoody'sS&PAMB-1F-2P-2A-2(2nd of 6)(2nd of 8)(2nd of 3)(2nd of 8)



A downgrade of our debt ratings could affect our ability to raise additional debt with terms and conditions similar to our current debt, and accordingly, likely increase our cost of capital.  In addition, a downgrade of these ratings could make it more difficult to raise capital to refinance any maturing debt obligations, to support business growth at our insurance subsidiaries and to maintain or improve the current financial strength ratings of our principal insurance subsidiaries described above.



All ratings are on outlook stable.  All of our ratings are subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the rating agencies, and therefore, no assurance can be given that our principal insurance subsidiaries or LNC can maintain these ratings.  Each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating.



REGULATORY



Insurance Regulation



Our insurance subsidiaries, like other insurance companies, are subject to regulation and supervision by the states, territories and countries in which they are licensed to do business.  The extent of such regulation varies, but generally has its source in statutes that delegate regulatory, supervisory and administrative authority to supervisory agencies.  In the U.S., this power is vested in state insurance departments.



In supervising and regulating insurance companies, state insurance departments, charged primarily with protecting contract holders and the public rather than investors, enjoy broad authority and discretion in applying applicable insurance laws and regulation for that purpose.  Our principal insurance subsidiaries, LNL, LLANY and FPP, are domiciled in the states of Indiana, New York and Indiana, respectively.



The insurance departments of the domiciliary states exercise principal regulatory jurisdiction over our insurance subsidiaries.  The extent of regulation by the states varies, but in general, most jurisdictions have laws and regulations governing standards of solvency, adequacy of reserves, reinsurance, capital adequacy, licensing of companies and agents to transact business, prescribing and approving policy forms, regulating premium rates for some lines of business, prescribing the form and content of financial statements and reports, regulating the type and amount of investments permitted and standards of business conduct.   Insurance company regulation is discussed further under “Insurance Holding Company Regulation” and “Restrictions on Subsidiaries’ Dividends and Other Payments.”



As part of their regulatory oversight process, state insurance departments conduct periodic, generally once every three to five years, examinations of the books, records, accounts, and business practices of insurers domiciled in their states.  During the three-year period ended December 31, 2010, we have not received any material adverse findings resulting from state insurance department examinations of our insurance subsidiaries conducted during this three-year period.



State insurance laws and regulations require our U.S. insurance companies to file financial statements with state insurance departments everywhere they do business, and the operations of our U.S. insurance companies and accounts are subject to examination by those departments at any time.  Our U.S. insurance companies prepare statutory financial statements in accordance with accounting practices and procedures prescribed or permitted by these departments.  The National Association of Insurance






Commissioners (“NAIC”) has approved a series of statutory accounting principles that have been adopted, in some cases with minor modifications, by virtually all state insurance departments.



The NAIC allows our U.S. insurance subsidiaries to include certain deferred tax assets in our statutory capital and surplus, but we are not able to consider the benefit from this when calculating available dividends.



Statutory reserves established for variable annuity contracts and riders are sensitive to changes in the equity markets and are affected by the level of account values relative to the level of any guarantees, product design and reinsurance arrangements.  As a result, the relationship between reserve changes and equity market performance is non-linear during any given reporting period.



For more information on statutory reserving and our use of captive reinsurance structures, see “Review of Consolidated Financial Condition – Liquidity and Capital Resources” in the MD&A.



Insurance Holding Company Regulation



LNC and its primary insurance subsidiaries are subject to regulation pursuant to the insurance holding company laws of the states of Indiana and New York.  These insurance holding company laws generally require an insurance holding company and insurers that are members of such insurance holding company’s system to register with the insurance department authorities, to file with it certain reports disclosing information, including their capital structure, ownership, management, financial condition, and certain inter-company transactions, including material transfers of assets and inter-company business agreements and to report material changes in that information.  These laws also require that inter-company transactions be fair and reasonable and, under certain circumstances, prior approval of the insurance departments must be received before entering into an inter-company transaction.  Further, these laws require that an insurer’s contract holders’ surplus following any dividends or distributions to shareholder affiliates is reasonable in relation to the insurer’s outstanding liabilities and adequate for its financial needs.



In general, under state holding company regulations, no person may acquire, directly or indirectly, a controlling interest in our capital stock unless such person, corporation or other entity has obtained prior approval from the applicable insurance commissioner for such acquisition of control.  Pursuant to such laws, in general, any person acquiring, controlling or holding the power to vote, directly or indirectly, 10% or more of the voting securities of an insurance company, is presumed to have “control” of such company.  This presumption may be rebutted by a showing that control does not exist in fact.  The insurance commissioner, however, may find that “control” exists in circumstances in which a person owns or controls a smaller amount of voting securities.  To obtain approval from the insurance commissioner of any acquisition of control of an insurance company, the proposed acquirer must file with the applicable commissioner an application containing information regarding:  the identity and background of the acquirer and its affiliates; the nature, source and amount of funds to be used to carry out the acquisition; the financial statements of the acquirer and its affiliates; any potential plans for disposition of the securities or business of the insurer; the number and type of securities to be acquired; any contracts with respect to the securities to be acquired; any agreements with broker-dealers; and other matters.



Other jurisdictions in which our insurance subsidiaries are licensed to transact business may have similar or additional requirements for prior approval of any acquisition of control of an insurance or reinsurance company licensed or authorized to transact business in those jurisdictions.  Additional requirements in those jurisdictions may include re-licensing or subsequent approval for renewal of existing licenses upon an acquisition of control.  As further described below, laws that govern the holding company structure also govern payment of dividends to us by our insurance subsidiaries.



Restrictions on Subsidiaries’ Dividends and Other Payments



We are a holding company that transacts substantially all of our business directly and indirectly through subsidiaries.  Our primary assets are the stock of our operating subsidiaries.  Our ability to meet our obligations on our outstanding debt and to pay dividends and our general and administrative expenses depends on the surplus and earnings of our subsidiaries and the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or to advance or repay funds to us.



Our insurance subsidiaries are subject to certain insurance department regulatory restrictions as to the transfer of funds and payment of dividends to the holding company.  Under Indiana laws and regulations, our Indiana insurance subsidiaries, including our primary insurance subsidiary, LNL, may pay dividends to LNC without prior approval of the Indiana Insurance Commissioner (the “Commissioner”), only from unassigned surplus or must receive prior approval of the Commissioner to pay a dividend if such dividend, along with all other dividends paid within the preceding 12 consecutive months, would exceed the statutory limitation.  The current statutory limitation is the greater of 10% of the insurer’s contract holders’ surplus, as shown on its last annual statement on file with the Commissioner or the insurer’s statutory net gain from operations for the previous 12 months, but in no event to exceed statutory unassigned surplus.  As discussed above, we may not consider the benefit from the statutory accounting principles relating to our insurance subsidiaries’ deferred tax assets in calculating available dividends.  Indiana law gives the Commissioner broad discretion to disapprove requests for dividends in excess of these limits.  New York, the state of domicile of our other major insurance subsidiary, LLANY, has similar restrictions, except that in New York it is the lesser of 10% of surplus to






contract holders as of the immediately preceding calendar year or net gain from operations for the immediately preceding calendar year, not including realized capital gains.



Indiana law also provides that following the payment of any dividend, the insurer’s contract holders’ surplus must be reasonable in relation to its outstanding liabilities and adequate for its financial needs, and permits the Commissioner to bring an action to rescind a dividend which violates these standards.  In the event that the Commissioner determines that the contract holders’ surplus of one subsidiary is inadequate, the Commissioner could use his or her broad discretionary authority to seek to require us to apply payments received from another subsidiary for the benefit of that insurance subsidiary.  For information regarding dividends paid to us during 2010 from our insurance subsidiaries, see “Review of Consolidated Financial Condition – Liquidity and Capital Resources – Sources of Liquidity and Cash Flow” in the MD&A.



Risk-Based Capital (“RBC”)



The NAIC has adopted RBC requirements for life insurance companies to evaluate the adequacy of statutory capital and surplus in relation to investment and insurance risks.  The requirements provide a means of measuring the minimum amount of statutory surplus appropriate for an insurance company to support its overall business operations based on its size and risk profile.  There are five major risks involved in determining the requirements:



CategoryNameDescriptionAsset risk - affiliatesC-0Risk of assets' default for certain affiliated investmentsAsset risk - othersC-1Risk of assets' default of principal and interest or fluctuation infair valueInsurance riskC-2Risk of underestimating liabilities from business already writtenor inadequately pricing business to be written in the futureInterest rate risk, health creditC-3Risk of losses due to changes in interest rate levels, risk thatrisk and market riskhealth benefits prepaid to providers become the obligation ofthe health insurer once again and risk of loss due to changes inmarket levels associated with variable products with guaranteesBusiness riskC-4Risk of general business



A company’s risk-based statutory surplus is calculated by applying factors and performing calculations relating to various asset, premium, claim, expense and reserve items.  Regulators can then measure adequacy of a company’s statutory surplus by comparing it to the RBC determined by the formula.  Under RBC requirements, regulatory compliance is determined by the ratio of a company’s total adjusted capital, as defined by the NAIC, to its company action level of RBC (known as the RBC ratio), also as defined by the NAIC.  Accordingly, factors that have an impact on the total adjusted capital of our insurance subsidiaries, such as the permitted practices discussed above, will also affect their RBC levels.



Four levels of regulatory attention may be triggered if the RBC ratio is insufficient:



·“Company action level” – If the RBC ratio is between 75% and 100%, then the insurer must submit a plan to the regulator detailing corrective action it proposes to undertake;

·“Regulatory action level” – If the RBC ratio is between 50% and 75%, then the insurer must submit a plan, but a regulator may also issue a corrective order requiring the insurer to comply within a specified period;

·“Authorized control level” – If the RBC ratio is between 35% and 50%, then the regulatory response is the same as at the “Regulatory action level,” but in addition, the regulator may take action to rehabilitate or liquidate the insurer; and

·“Mandatory control level” – If the RBC ratio is less than 35%, then the regulator must rehabilitate or liquidate the insurer.



As of December 31, 2010, the RBC ratios of LNL, LLANY and FPP reported to their respective states of domicile and the NAIC all exceeded the “company action level.”  We believe that we will be able to maintain the RBC ratios of our insurance subsidiaries in excess of “company action level” through prudent underwriting, claims handling, investing and capital management.  However, no assurances can be given that developments affecting the insurance subsidiaries, many of which could be outside of our control, will not cause the RBC ratios to fall below our targeted levels.  These developments may include, but may not be limited to:  changes to the manner in which the RBC ratio is calculated; new regulatory requirements for calculating reserves, such as principles based reserving; economic conditions leading to higher levels of impairments of securities in our insurance subsidiaries’ general accounts; and an inability to finance life reserves including the issuing of letters of credit supporting captive reinsurance structures.



See “Item 1A. Risk Factors – A decrease in the capital and surplus of our insurance subsidiaries may result in a downgrade to our credit and insurer financial strength ratings.”








Privacy Regulations



In the course of our business, we collect and maintain personal data from our customers including personally identifiable non-public financial and health information, which subjects us to regulation under federal and state privacy laws.  These laws require that we institute certain policies and procedures in our business to safeguard this information from improper use or disclosure.  If the federal or state regulators establish further regulations for addressing customer privacy, we may need to amend our policies and adapt our internal procedures.



Federal Initiatives



The U.S. federal government does not directly regulate the insurance industry; however, federal initiatives from time to time can impact the insurance industry.



Health Care Reform Legislation



In March 2010, the President signed into law the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act which was subsequently amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act.  This legislation includes a number of provisions that provide for new or increased taxes to help finance the cost of these reforms, substantive changes to existing health care laws and the addition of new health care and related laws, each of which could potentially impact some of our lines of businesses.



Financial Reform Legislation



In July 2010, the President signed into law the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, H.R. 4173, (“Dodd-Frank Act”), wide ranging legislation that includes a number of reforms of the financial services industry and financial products.  Many of the provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act require substantial regulatory work prior to implementation, and we cannot predict at this time all of the ways or the extent to which financial markets in general, or our business, financial condition and results of operations, may be affected following its full implementation.



Some requirements of the Dodd-Frank Act apply to us as a result of our status as a thrift holding company.  The Dodd-Frank Act eliminates the OTS and reallocates the supervisory and regulatory authority over (i) federally chartered thrifts to the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and (ii) thrift holding companies to the Federal Reserve Board.  Enactment of this provision ensures that we and NCLS will each have a new regulator and may be subject to additional and/or enhanced regulation, including new capital and leverage requirements.  We will also be subject to the provisions of the “Volcker Rule,” which restricts, subject to exceptions for various permitted activities, proprietary trading and certain investment activities by holding companies containing an insured depository institution.  Although we presently believe that the Volcker Rule will not require significant change in our investment and trading activities, rulemaking is not scheduled to be completed until late 2011, and the ultimate outcome of the rulemaking process cannot be predicted.



The Dodd-Frank Act also mandates a new regulatory framework for over-the-counter derivatives transactions.  Subject to applicable insurance laws, we use derivatives for a number of reasons including, but not limited to, hedging certain portions of our exposure to changes in our GDB, GWB and GIB liabilities, interest rate fluctuations, the widening of bond yield spreads over comparable maturity U.S. Government obligations, credit, foreign exchange and equity risks.  The new regulatory scheme will impose clearing and centralized execution requirements on a wide range of derivatives transactions that are currently conducted over-the-counter, with the likely result that costs and margin requirements will increase for market participants across the board.  As rulemaking on the Dodd-Frank derivatives provisions is still in progress, it is premature to determine the extent to which our derivatives costs and strategies may change, and the extent to which those changes may ultimately affect the range of products we offer to our customers.



In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act requires new regulations governing broker-dealers and investment advisers.  In particular, the fiduciary standard rulemaking could potentially have broad implications for how our products are designed and sold in the future.  In January 2011, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) released a study on the obligations and standards of conduct of financial professionals, as required under the Dodd-Frank Act.  The SEC staff recommended establishing a uniform fiduciary standard for investment advisers and broker-dealers when providing investment advice about securities, including guidance for principal trading and definitions of the duties of loyalty and care owed to retail customers that would be consistent with the standard that currently applies to investment advisers.  A more uniform fiduciary standard could potentially affect our business in areas including, but not limited to:  design and availability of proprietary products; commission-based compensation arrangements; advertising and other communications; use of finders or solicitors of clients (i.e., business contacts who provide referrals); and continuing education requirements for advisors.



Additional provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act include, among other things, the creation of a new Federal Insurance Office within the U.S. Department of the Treasury ( “U.S. Treasury”) to gather information regarding the insurance industry; the creation of a resolution authority to unwind failing institutions, funded on a post-event basis; the creation of a new Consumer Financial






Protection Bureau to protect consumers of certain financial products; and changes to executive compensation and certain corporate governance rules.  Given the current state of the rulemaking and implementation process, the ultimate impact on our business is undeterminable at this time.



Department of Labor Regulation



In October 2010, the U.S. Department of Labor (“DOL”) issued a proposed regulation that would, if finalized in current form, substantially expand the range of activities that would be considered to be fiduciary investment advice under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (“ERISA”) and the Internal Revenue Code.  If finalized as proposed, the investment-related information and support that our advisors and employees could provide to plan sponsors, participants and IRA holders on a non-fiduciary basis could be substantially limited beyond what is allowed under current law.  This could have a material impact on the level and type of services we can provide as well as the nature and amount of compensation and fees us and our advisors and employees may receive for investment-related services.  This proposal has generated substantial public comment and as a result, it is likely that any final regulation will be different from the proposal.  What the differences will be, as well as the timing of any final regulation, are unknown at this time.  We do not expect the DOL to issue a final regulation in 2011.



Stimulus Legislation



In reaction to the recession, credit market illiquidity and global financial crisis experienced during the latter part of 2008 and into 2009, Congress enacted the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 (“EESA”) on October 3, 2008, and the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (“ARRA”), which was signed into law on February 17, 2009, in an effort to restore liquidity to the U.S. credit markets and to stimulate the U.S. economy.  The ARRA and the Troubled Asset Relief Program (“TARP”) authorized the purchase of “troubled assets” from financial institutions, including insurance companies.  Pursuant to the authority granted under the TARP, the U.S. Treasury also adopted the Capital Purchase Program (“CPP”).



TARP CPP



On July 10, 2009, we issued, in a private placement, $950 million of Series B preferred stock and a warrant for 13,049,451 shares of our common stock with an exercise price of $10.92 per share to the U.S. Treasury under the CPP.  On June 30, 2010, we redeemed in full the Series B preferred stock from the U.S. Treasury.  Prior to the redemption of the Series B preferred stock, we were subject to certain restrictions applicable under the CPP, including limits on incentive compensation for certain executives and employees.  See “Review of Consolidated Financial Condition – Liquidity and Capital Resources – Sources of Liquidity and Cash Flow – Financing Activities” for more information about our preferred stock redemption.



Federal Tax Legislation



In May 2003, the Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2003 (“JGTRRA”) was enacted.  Individual taxpayers are the principal beneficiaries of JGTRRA, which accelerated certain of the income tax rate reductions enacted originally under the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 ( “EGTRRA”), as well as reduced the long-term capital gains and dividend tax rates to 15%.  On May 17, 2006, the Tax Increase Prevention and Reconciliation Act of 2006 (“TIPRA”) was signed into law.  TIPRA extended the lower capital gains and dividends rates through the end of 2010.  EGTRRA also included provisions that eliminated the estate tax for a single year in 2010, while also replacing the step-up in basis rule applicable to property held in a decedent’s estate with a modified carryover basis rule.  The Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization and Job Creation Act of 2010 extended for two years through 2012 all of the lower individual tax rates and set the estate tax rate at 35% with a personal exemption of $5 million for the next two years.  Should these provisions not be extended beyond 2012, the higher marginal tax rates on individuals could have a positive impact upon the sale of insurance and annuity products.










Patriot Act



The USA PATRIOT Act of 2001 (“Patriot Act”) contains anti-money laundering and financial transparency laws and mandates the implementation of various new regulations applicable to broker-dealers and other financial services companies, including insurance companies.  The Patriot Act seeks to promote cooperation among financial institutions, regulators and law enforcement entities in identifying parties that may be involved in terrorism or money laundering.  Anti-money laundering laws outside of the U.S. contain provisions that may be different, conflicting or more rigorous.  The increased obligations of financial institutions to identify their customers, watch for and report suspicious transactions, respond to requests for information by regulatory authorities and law enforcement agencies, and share information with other financial institutions require the implementation and maintenance of internal practices, procedures and controls.



Employee Retirement Income Security Act (“ERISA”) Considerations



ERISA is a comprehensive federal statute that applies to U.S. employee benefit plans sponsored by private employers and labor unions.  Plans subject to ERISA include pension and profit sharing plans and welfare plans, including health, life and disability plans.  ERISA provisions include reporting and disclosure rules, standards of conduct that apply to plan fiduciaries and prohibitions on transactions known as “prohibited transactions,” such as conflict-of-interest transactions and certain transactions between a benefit plan and a party in interest.  ERISA also provides for a scheme of civil and criminal penalties and enforcement.  Our insurance, asset management, plan administrative services and other businesses provide services to employee benefit plans subject to ERISA, including services where we may act as an ERISA fiduciary.  In addition to ERISA regulation of businesses providing products and services to ERISA plans, we become subject to ERISA’s prohibited transaction rules for transactions with those plans, which may affect our ability to enter transactions, or the terms on which transactions may be entered, with those plans, even in businesses unrelated to those giving rise to party in interest status.



Broker-Dealer, Securities and Savings and Loan Regulation



In addition to being registered under the Securities Act of 1933, some of our separate accounts as well as mutual funds that we sponsor are registered as investment companies under the Investment Company Act of 1940, and the shares of certain of these entities are qualified for sale in some or all states and the District of Columbia.  We also have several subsidiaries that are registered as broker-dealers under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”) and are subject to federal and state regulation, including but not limited to the Financial Industry Regulation Authority’s (“FINRA”) net capital rules.  In addition, we have several subsidiaries that are investment advisors registered under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.  Agents and employees registered or associated with any of our broker-dealer subsidiaries are subject to the Exchange Act and to examination requirements and regulation by the SEC, FINRA and state securities commissioners.  Regulation also extends to various LNC entities that employ or control those individuals.  The SEC and other governmental agencies and self-regulatory organizations, as well as state securities commissions in the U.S., have the power to conduct administrative proceedings that can result in censure, fines, the issuance of cease-and-desist orders or suspension and termination or limitation of the activities of the regulated entity or its employees.



Our U.S. banking operations are subject to federal and state regulation.  As a result of its ownership of NCLS, LNC is considered to be a savings and loan holding company and, along with NCLS, is subject to supervision, regulation and examination by the OTS of the U.S. Treasury, or going forward by the Federal Reserve Board or the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, as appropriate.  Federal and state banking laws generally provide that no person may acquire control of LNC, and gain indirect control of NCLS, without prior regulatory approval.  “Control” will be deemed to exist in the case of any person having the power to vote 25% or more of any class of “voting securities,” having the power to control the election of a majority of the Board or if the applicable regulatory authority determines that such person has the power to directly or indirectly exercise a controlling influence over the management or policies of the holding company or thrift.



Environmental Considerations



Federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations apply to our ownership and operation of real property.  Inherent in owning and operating real property are the risk of hidden environmental liabilities and the costs of any required clean-up.  Under the laws of certain states, contamination of a property may give rise to a lien on the property to secure recovery of the costs of clean-up, which could adversely affect our commercial mortgage lending.  In several states, this lien has priority over the lien of an existing mortgage against such property.  In addition, in some states and under the federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (“CERCLA”), we may be liable, as an “owner” or “operator,” for costs of cleaning-up releases or threatened releases of hazardous substances at a property mortgaged to us.  We also risk environmental liability when we foreclose on a property mortgaged to us.  Federal legislation provides for a safe harbor from CERCLA liability for secured lenders that foreclose and sell the mortgaged real estate, provided that certain requirements are met.  However, there are circumstances in which actions taken could still expose us to CERCLA liability.  Application of various other federal and state environmental laws could also result in the imposition of liability on us for costs associated with environmental hazards.








We routinely conduct environmental assessments for real estate we acquire for investment and before taking title through foreclosure to real property collateralizing mortgages that we hold.  Although unexpected environmental liabilities can always arise, based on these environmental assessments and compliance with our internal procedures, we believe that any costs associated with compliance with environmental laws and regulations or any clean-up of properties would not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.



Intellectual Property

We rely on a combination of copyright, trademark, patent and trade secret laws to establish and protect our intellectual property.  We have implemented a patent strategy designed to protect innovative aspects of our products and processes which we believe distinguish us from competitors.  We currently own four issued U.S. patents and have additional patent applications pending in the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office.  We intend to continue to file patent applications as we develop new products, technologies and patentable enhancements.



We regard our patents as valuable assets and intend to vigorously protect them against infringement.  However, complex legal and factual determinations and evolving laws make patent protection uncertain, and while we believe our patents provide us with a competitive advantage, we cannot be certain that patents will be issued from any of our pending patent applications or that any issued patents will have sufficient breadth to offer meaningful protection.  In addition, our issued patents may be successfully challenged, invalidated, circumvented or found unenforceable so that our patent rights would not create an effective competitive barrier.



Finally, we have an extensive portfolio of trademarks and service marks that we consider important in the marketing of our products and services, including, among others, the trademarks of the Lincoln National and Lincoln Financial names, the Lincoln silhouette logo and the combination of these marks.  Trademark registrations may be renewed indefinitely subject to continued use and registration requirements.  We regard our trademarks as valuable assets in marketing our products and services and intend to protect them against infringement and dilution.



EMPLOYEES



As of December 31, 2010, we had a total of 8,270 employees.  In addition, we had a total of 1,230 planners and agents who had active sales contracts with one of our insurance subsidiaries.  None of our employees are represented by a labor union, and we are not a party to any collective bargaining agreements.  We consider our employee relations to be good.



AVAILABLE INFORMATION
