The Lam Research logo, Lam Research, and all product and service names used in this report
are either registered trademarks or trademarks of Lam Research Corporation or its subsidiaries in the United States and/or other countries. All other marks mentioned herein are the property of their respective holders.

Lam Research is a global supplier of innovative wafer fabrication equipment and services to the semiconductor industry. We design,
manufacture, market, refurbish, and service semiconductor processing systems that are used in the fabrication of integrated circuits (“ICs”). Our market-leading products are designed to help our customers build smaller, faster, and more
power-efficient devices that are used in a variety of electronic products, including cell phones, tablets, computers, storage devices, and networking equipment.

The Company’s customer base includes leading semiconductor memory, foundry, and integrated device manufacturers (“IDMs”) that make products such as DRAM, NAND memory, and logic devices.
Semiconductor manufacturing, our customers’ business, involves the complete fabrication of multiple die, or ICs, on a wafer. This involves the repetition of a set of core processes and can require hundreds of individual steps. On a silicon
wafer, a tiny, intricate pattern is precisely replicated across the wafer surface to create identical miniature devices, where features can be 1,000 times smaller than a grain of sand. Fabricating these devices requires highly sophisticated process
technologies and precision control at the atomic scale. Along with meeting technical requirements, wafer processing equipment must deliver high productivity and be cost-effective.

At Lam Research, we leverage our expertise in semiconductor device processing to develop enabling technology and productivity solutions
that typically benefit our customers through lower defect rates, enhanced yields, faster processing time, and/or reduced cost. We offer a broad portfolio of complementary products that are used in several areas of the semiconductor manufacturing
process flow, including thin film deposition, plasma etch, and wafer cleaning. These processes, which are repeated numerous times during the wafer fabrication cycle, are utilized to manufacture every type of semiconductor device.

Our products are used primarily in front-end wafer processing, which involves the steps that create the active components of a device
(transistor, capacitor) and their wiring (interconnect). Market demand for ever-smaller IC designs is driving the development of and migration to new fabrication strategies, such as three-dimensional (“3D”) architectures and multiple
patterning. We also address processes for back-end wafer-level packaging (“WLP”), which is an alternative to traditional two dimensional packaging and can offer a smaller form factor, increased interconnect speed and bandwidth, and lower
power consumption, among other benefits. In addition, our products are well-suited for related markets that rely on semiconductor processes and require production-proven manufacturing capability, such as micro-electromechanical systems
(“MEMS”).

The Company’s high-productivity thin film deposition systems form a device’s sub-microscopic
layers of conducting (metal) or insulating (dielectric) materials. Lam is the market leader in plasma etch, a highly critical process step that selectively removes materials from the wafer to create the features and patterns of a device. Our
photoresist strip systems remove the photoresist mask before a wafer proceeds to the next processing step. Lam’s wet spin clean and plasma-based bevel clean products remove particles, residues and film from the wafer surface before or after
adjacent processes.

Our Customer Support Business Group (“CSBG”) provides products and services to maximize
installed equipment performance and operational efficiency. We offer a broad range of services to deliver value throughout the lifecycle of our equipment, including customer service, spares, upgrades, and refurbishment of our deposition, etch,
photoresist strip, and clean products. Many of the technical advances that we introduce in our newest products are also available as upgrades, which provide customers with a cost-effective strategy for extending the performance and capabilities of
their existing wafer fabrication lines. CSBG also offers refurbished and newly built previous-generation (legacy) equipment for those applications that do not require the most advanced wafer processing capability.

Silfex Inc. (“Silfex”) is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Lam. Silfex is a leading provider of high-purity custom silicon
components and assemblies that serve technology markets such as semiconductor equipment. Peter Wolters







was a wholly-owned subsidiary of Lam until we sold substantially all of Peter Wolters on July 2, 2014. Peter Wolters designs and manufactures high-precision grinding, lapping, polishing, and
deburring systems used in the automotive, aerospace, medical, semiconductor manufacturing and other industries.

Products

Thin Film Deposition

In leading-edge semiconductor designs, metal deposition processes face significant scaling and integration challenges. For advanced copper interconnect structures, challenges for electrochemical
deposition (“ECD”) include providing complete, void-free fill of high aspect ratio (“HAR”) structures with low defectivity and high productivity. Electroplating of copper and other metals is also used for through-silicon via
(“TSV”) and WLP applications, such as forming conductive bumps and redistribution layers (“RDLs”). These applications require excellent within-wafer uniformity at high plating rates, minimal defects, and cost competitiveness. For
tungsten chemical vapor deposition (“CVD”)/atomic layer deposition (“ALD”) processes, key requirements are minimizing contact resistance to meet lower power consumption requirements and achieving void-free fill for narrow
nanoscale structures. In addition, good barrier step coverage at reduced thicknesses relative to physical vapor deposition/CVD barrier films is also needed to improve contact fill and reduce resistivity.

In dielectric deposition, high-productivity, high-quality films are needed for a number of critical process steps. For example,
next-generation FinFET transistor structures and back-end-of-line (“BEOL”) self-aligned double patterning require highly conformal film deposition and atomic-scale control of film dimensions to ensure device performance. The numerous
alternating film layers used in new 3D NAND designs require exceptional stress and defectivity control and ultra-smooth film deposition. Plasma-enhanced CVD (“PECVD”) is often used for these applications, as well as for advanced WLP, where
depositing high-quality films without exceeding thermal budgets is essential. In addition, ALD processes are often used to deposit very thin, highly conformal films for applications such as multiple patterning. For gapfill deposition, achieving
defect-free fills while maintaining high throughput is essential. Preferred approaches are to use high-density plasma CVD (“HDP-CVD”) either as a complete gapfill solution or as a cap over other gapfill technologies to enhance process
control and mitigate integration risks. Lastly, innovative post-deposition film treatments such as ultraviolet thermal processing (“UVTP”) are being used to improve low-k film integrity and increase strain in nitride layers for improved
device performance.

Copper Metal Films — SABRE®Product Family

The SABRE
ECD product family is the industry’s productivity-leading platform for copper damascene manufacturing. Electrofill®technology provides high-throughput, void-free fill with superior defect density performance for advanced
technology nodes. SABRE chemistry packages provide leading-edge fill performance for the lowest defectivity, widest process window, and highest rates of bottom-up growth to fill the most challenging HAR features. System capabilities include
deposition of copper directly on various liner materials, important for next-generation metallization schemes. The number of yielding ICs per wafer has also been improved by increasing the usable die area through industry-leading process edge
exclusion engineering. Applications include copper deposition for both advanced logic and memory interconnect. We also offer the SABRE 3D system to address TSV and WLP applications, such as copper pillar, RDL, underbump metallization, bumping, and
microbumps used in post-TSV processing.

Tungsten Metal Films — ALTUS®Product Family

unique source design provides excellent particle performance, while the ability to customize the deposition andin situetching profile ensures best-of-breed across-wafer thickness and gapfill uniformity. Together, the chamber and plasma
source designs allow large batch sizes between cleans and faster cleans to deliver superior throughput. Broad process flexibility is available on the same platform, without requiring major hardware changes. Applications include STI, pre-metal
dielectrics, inter-layer dielectrics, inter-metal dielectrics, and passivation layers.

Film Treatment — SOLA®Product Family

The SOLA UVTP product family is
used for treatment of BEOL low-k dielectric films and front-end-of-line (“FEOL”) silicon nitride strained films. The systems incorporate a proprietary treatment process that modifies the physical characteristics of a previously deposited
film through exposure to ultraviolet light, gases and vapors, and heat. The Multi-Station Sequential Processing (“MSSP”) architecture allows independent control of temperature, wavelength, and intensity at each station of the wafer path.
This enables delivery of best-in-class film properties, within-wafer and wafer-to-wafer uniformity, and productivity.

Plasma Etch

As the semiconductor industry continues to improve device performance and shrink critical feature sizes, plasma etch
faces multiple challenges. These include processing smaller features, new materials, new transistor structures, increasingly complex film stacks, and ever higher aspect ratio structures. For conductor etch, requirements include delivering
atomic-scale control for etching FinFET/3D gate transistors, multi–film stacks for high-k/metal gate structures, and multiple patterning structures. Dielectric etch processes must be able to maintain etch profiles on increasingly HAR structures
such as in 3D NAND devices, etch new multi-layer photoresist materials and amorphous carbon hardmasks, and avoid damaging fragile low-k materials. In emerging 3D integrated circuits (“3D ICs”), TSVs are now used to provide interconnect
capability for die-to-die and wafer-to-wafer stacking. Critical factors for TSV are etching a variety of materials in the same chamber (in situ), as well as being able to use both conventional and special techniques for deep silicon
etching. For all etch processes, it is important to provide excellent profile control and across-wafer uniformity while maintaining high productivity and cost efficiency.







Conductor Etch — 2300®Kiyo®Product Family, 2300®Versys®Metal Product Family

The 2300 Kiyo product family delivers high-performance, high-productivity, low-risk solutions for conductor etch applications. Superior
uniformity, uniformity control, and repeatability are enabled by a symmetrical chamber design, leading electrostatic chuck technology, and independent tuning features. The Kiyo products deliver high productivity with low defectivity on multi-film

return on investment. Applications include low-k and ultra low-k dual damascene, self-aligned contacts, capacitor cell, mask open, 3D NAND HAR hole, trench, and contact.

TSV Etch — 2300®Syndion®Product
Family

Based on Lam’s production-proven conductor etch products, the 2300 Syndion TSV etch family provides low-risk,
flexible solutions to address multiple TSV etch applications. The Syndion products provide a low cost of ownership due to high etch rates, excellent repeatability, andin situetching of multiple materials in the TSV stack (silicon,
dielectrics, conducting films). The systems support both conventional single-step etch and rapidly alternating process (“RAP”). High process flexibility, superior profile control, and excellent uniformity enable successful TSV
implementation for a variety of CMOS 3D IC and image sensor applications.

Photoresist Strip

With the semiconductor industry’s migration to ultra-shallow junctions, multiple patterning, ultra low-k dielectrics, and 3D
architectures, photoresist strip processes need to manage more complex device structures. At the transistor level, small changes can affect junction resistivity, junction depth, and dopant activation, thereby affecting device performance. For
interconnect structures, unwanted changes in the properties of low-k dielectrics can also impact performance. These concerns are driving the development of new photoresist strip processes for advanced technology nodes. Challenges include removing
residues, minimizing oxidation and silicon loss, and providing damage-free results, while at the same time delivering high throughput and low cost of ownership.

Photoresist Strip — G400®,GxT®,G3D®

Lam’s photoresist strip systems are
based on our production-proven MSSP platform. The MSSP architecture provides multiple process stations, where both temperature and chemistry may be independently controlled, allowing bulk strip, high-dose implant strip (“HDIS”), and dry
clean processes to be performed all on the same platform. The high-productivity G400 is targeted for bulk strip and HDIS applications, primarily in large DRAM and NAND memory fabs. Enhanced source technology combined with faster wafer heating
provides high throughput for bulk strip and implant strip applications. The GxT system is designed for critical logic device manufacturing process steps that demand low silicon loss and ultra-low defectivity.







Single-Wafer Clean

Wafer cleaning is a critical function that must be repeated many times during the semiconductor manufacturing process, from device fabrication through packaging. As device geometries shrink and new
materials are introduced, the number of cleaning steps continues to grow. Furthermore, each step has different selectivity and defectivity requirements that add to manufacturing complexity. For next-generation devices, fragile structures need to be
cleaned without causing damage. In addition, cleaning steps that target the bevel region can help eliminate the potential source of yield-limiting defects at the wafer’s edge, as well as, increase the number of good die at the wafer’s edge
to improve yield.

Wet Clean — DV-Prime®,Da Vinci®,SP Series

Lam’s single-wafer spin technology pioneered the industry transition from batch to single-wafer wet processing. These
production-proven spin wet clean systems provide the productivity and flexibility needed for both high-volume manufacturing and leading-edge development across multiple technology nodes and for all device types. The products deliver excellent
process uniformity across the wafer, wafer-to-wafer, and lot-to-lot. Proprietary technologies enhance damage-free particle removal and enable wafer drying without pattern collapse or watermarks. Offering the latest in dilute chemistry and solvent
systems, the products meet defectivity and material integrity requirements. Applications include particle, polymer, and residue removal; photoresist removal; and wafer backside/bevel cleaning. Our wet clean systems are also used for multiple wet
etch and clean applications for WLP, including silicon substrate thinning, wafer stress relief, underbump metallization etch, and photoresist removal.

Plasma Bevel Clean — 2300®Coronus®Product Family

The 2300 Coronus plasma-based bevel clean products enhance die yield by removing particles, residues and
unwanted films from the wafer’s edge that can impact the device area. The system combines the ability of plasma to selectively remove a wide variety of materials with a proprietary confinement technology that protects the die area. High system
uptime and throughput, excellent process repeatability, and efficientin situremoval of multi-material film stacks and residues ensure high productivity for increased wafer output. Applications include post-etch, pre- and post-deposition,
pre-lithography, and metal film removal to prevent arcing during plasma etch or deposition steps. It is also the industry’s only bevel clean product that removes amorphous-carbon films and carbon-rich residues.

Legacy Products

For applications that do not require the most advanced wafer processing capability, semiconductor manufacturers can benefit from the
proven performance of previous-generation products to increase their production capacity at a reduced economic investment. Purchasing through an original equipment manufacturer (“OEM”) like Lam Research minimizes the risks of unexpected
costs and unpredictable time to production that are typically associated with used systems purchases. To meet semiconductor manufacturers’ needs for high-performance, maximum-predictability, and low-risk equipment, Lam provides refurbished and
newly built legacy products. Our products also provide production-worthy, cost-effective solutions for the MEMS and light emitting diode (“LED”) markets.

Fiscal Periods Presented

All references to fiscal years apply to our fiscal years, which ended June 29, 2014, June 30, 2013, and June 24, 2012. In all sections of this document, the fiscal 2012 information
presented reflects 20 days of Novellus related activity, as Novellus was purchased on June 4, 2012. There is no Novellus related activity reflected in periods prior to fiscal year 2012.

Research and Development

The market for semiconductor capital equipment is
characterized by rapid technological change and product innovation. Our ability to achieve and maintain our competitive advantage depends in part on our continued and timely development of new products and enhancements to existing products.
Accordingly, we devote a significant portion of our personnel and financial resources to research and development (“R&D”) programs and seek to maintain close and responsive relationships with our customers and suppliers.

Our R&D expenses during fiscal years 2014, 2013, and 2012 were $716.5 million, $683.7 million, and $444.6 million, respectively. The
majority of R&D spending over the past three years has been targeted at deposition, etch, single-wafer clean, and other semiconductor manufacturing products. We believe current challenges for customers at various points in the semiconductor
manufacturing process present opportunities for us.

We expect to continue to make substantial investments in R&D to meet
our customers’ product needs, support our growth strategy, and enhance our competitive position.

Long-Lived Assets

Refer to Note 17 of our Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 15 of this report, for information concerning the geographic locations of long-lived assets.

Customers

Our customers
include all of the world’s leading semiconductor manufacturers. Customers continue to establish joint ventures, alliances and licensing arrangements which have the potential to positively or negatively impact our competitive position and market
opportunities. In fiscal years 2014, 2013, and 2012, three customers, Samsung Electronics Company, Ltd., SK Hynix Inc., and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, Ltd., each individually represented greater than 10% of total revenues.

A material reduction in orders from our customers could adversely affect our results of operations and projected financial
condition. Our business depends upon the expenditures of semiconductor manufacturers.







Semiconductor manufacturers’ businesses, in turn, depend on many factors, including their economic capability, the current and anticipated market demand for integrated circuits and the
availability of equipment capacity to support that demand.

Backlog

Manufacturing

Our manufacturing operations consist mainly of assembling and testing components, sub-assemblies, and modules that are then integrated into finished systems prior to shipment to or at the location of our
customers. Most of the assembly and testing of our products is conducted in cleanroom environments.

We have agreements with
third parties to outsource certain aspects of our manufacturing, production warehousing, and logistics functions. We believe that these outsourcing contracts provide us more flexibility to scale our operations up or down in a timely and cost
effective manner, enabling us to respond quickly to any changes in our business. We believe that we have selected reputable providers and have secured their performance on terms documented in written contracts. However, it is possible that one or
more of these providers could fail to perform as we expect, and such failure could have an adverse impact on our business and have a negative effect on our operating results and financial condition. Overall, we believe we have effective mechanisms
to manage risks associated with our outsourcing relationships. Refer to Note 14 of our Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 15 of this report, for further information concerning our outsourcing commitments.

Certain components and sub-assemblies that we include in our products may only be obtained from a single supplier. We believe that, in
many cases, we could obtain and qualify alternative sources to supply these products. Nevertheless, any prolonged inability to obtain these components could have an adverse effect on our operating results and could unfavorably impact our customer
relationships.

Environmental Matters

We are subject to a variety of governmental regulations related to the management of hazardous materials that we use in our business operations. We are currently not aware of any pending notices of
violation, fines, lawsuits, or investigations arising from environmental matters that would have a material effect on our business. We believe that we are generally in compliance with these regulations and that we have obtained (or will obtain or
are otherwise addressing) all necessary environmental permits to conduct our business. Nevertheless, the failure to comply with present or future regulations could result in fines being imposed on us, require us to







suspend production or cease operations or cause our customers to not accept our products. These regulations could require us to alter our current operations, to acquire significant additional
equipment, or to incur substantial other expenses to comply with environmental regulations. Our failure to control the use, sale, transport or disposal of hazardous substances could subject us to future liabilities.

Employees

As of
August 19, 2014, we had approximately 6,500 regular employees globally. Although we have employment-related agreements with a number of key employees, these agreements do not guarantee continued service. Each of our employees is required to
comply with our policies relating to maintaining the confidentiality of our non-public information.

In the semiconductor and
semiconductor equipment industries, competition for highly skilled employees is intense. Our future success depends, to a significant extent, upon our continued ability to attract and retain qualified employees particularly in the R&D and
customer support functions.

Competition

We face significant competition with all of our products and services. Our
primary competitors in the etch market are Tokyo Electron, Ltd. and Applied Materials, Inc. Our primary competitors in the single-wafer wet clean market are Dainippon Screen Manufacturing Co. Ltd., Semes, and Tokyo Electron, Ltd. In the tungsten
CVD, PECVD, HDP-CVD, ECD and PVD markets, our primary competitor is Applied Materials, Inc. In the PECVD market, we also compete against ASM International and Wonik IPS.

Certain of our existing and potential competitors have substantially greater financial resources and larger engineering, manufacturing, marketing, and customer service and support organizations than we
do. In addition, we face competition from a number of emerging companies in the industry. We expect our competitors to continue to improve the design and performance of their current products and processes and to introduce new products and processes
with enhanced price/performance characteristics. If our competitors make acquisitions or enter into strategic relationships with leading semiconductor manufacturers, or other entities, covering products similar to those we sell, our ability to sell
our products to those customers could be adversely affected. There can be no assurance that we will continue to compete successfully in the future.







Patents and Licenses

Our policy is to seek patents on inventions relating to new or enhanced products and processes developed as part of our ongoing research, engineering, manufacturing, and support activities. We currently
hold a number of United States and foreign patents covering various aspects of our products and processes. We believe that the duration of our patents generally exceeds the useful life of the technologies and processes disclosed and claimed in them.
Our patents, which cover material aspects of our past and present core products, have current durations ranging from approximately one to twenty years. We believe that, although the patents we own and may obtain in the future will be of value, they
alone will not determine our success. Our success depends principally upon our engineering, marketing, support, and delivery skills. However, in the absence of patent protection, we may be vulnerable to competitors who attempt to imitate our
products, manufacturing techniques, and processes. In addition, other companies and inventors may receive patents that contain claims applicable or similar to our products and processes. The sale of products covered by patents of others could
require licenses that may not be available on terms acceptable to us, or at all. For further discussion of legal matters, see Item 3, “Legal Proceedings,” of this report.
