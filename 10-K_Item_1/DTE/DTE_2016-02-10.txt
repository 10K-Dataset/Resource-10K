ELECTRIC

Description

DTE Energy's Electric segment consists principally of DTE Electric, an electric utility engaged in the generation, purchase, distribution, and sale of electricity to approximately2.2 millioncustomers in southeastern Michigan.  DTE Electric is regulated by numerous federal and state governmental agencies, including, but not limited to, the MPSC, the FERC, the NRC, the EPA, and the MDEQ.  Electricity is generated from fossil-fuel plants, a hydroelectric pumped storage plant, a nuclear plant, wind and other renewable assets and is supplemented with purchased power.  The electricity is sold, or distributed through the retail access program, to three major classes of customers: residential, commercial, and industrial, throughout southeastern Michigan.

(a)Includes revenue associated with the under or over recoveries of tracking mechanisms and deferred gain amortization of the previously reversed RDM liability.

(b)Represents power that is not distributed by DTE Electric.










Weather, economic factors, competition, energy efficiency initiatives, and electricity prices affect sales levels to customers.  DTE Electric's peak load and highest total system sales generally occur during the third quarter of the year, driven by air conditioning and other cooling-related demands.  DTE Electric's operations are not dependent upon a limited number of customers, and the loss of any one or a few customers would not have a material adverse effect on the results of DTE Electric.

Fuel Supply and Purchased Power

DTE Electric's power is generated from a variety of fuels and is supplemented with purchased power.  DTE Electric expects to have an adequate supply of fuel and purchased power to meet its obligation to serve customers.  DTE Electric's generating capability is heavily dependent upon the availability of coal.  Coal is purchased from various sources in different geographic areas under agreements that vary in both pricing and terms.  DTE Electric expects to obtain the majority of its coal requirements through long-term contracts, with the balance to be obtained through short-term agreements and spot purchases.  DTE Electric has long-term and short-term contracts for the purchase of approximately 37.9 million tons of low-sulfur western coal and approximately 3.0 million tons of Appalachian coal to be delivered from 2016 to 2021.  All of these contracts have pricing schedules.  DTE Electric has approximately 98% of the expected coal requirements for 2016 under contract.  Given the geographic diversity of supply, DTE Electric believes it can meet its expected generation requirements.  DTE Electric leases a fleet of rail cars and has the expected western coal rail requirements under contract through 2018.  All of the expected eastern coal rail requirements are under contract through 2016.  Contracts covering expected vessel transportation requirements for delivery of purchased coal to electric generating facilities are under contract through 2019.

DTE Electric participates in the energy market through MISO.  DTE Electric offers its generation in the market on a day-ahead and real-time basis and bids for power in the market to serve its load.  DTE Electric is a net purchaser of power that supplements its generation capability to meet customer demand during peak cycles or during major plant outages.
