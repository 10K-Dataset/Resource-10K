Item 1. BUSINESS

Overview

Twitter is a global platform for public self-expression and conversation in real time. By developing a fundamentally new way for people to create, distribute and discover content, we have democratized content creation and distribution, enabling any voice to echo around the world instantly and unfiltered.

Our platform is unique in its simplicity: Tweets are limited to 140 characters of text. This constraint makes it easy for anyone to quickly create, distribute and discover content that is consistent across our platform and optimized for mobile devices. As a result, Tweets drive a high velocity of information exchange that makes Twitter uniquely “live.” We aim to become an indispensable daily companion to live human experiences.

People are at the heart of Twitter. People come to Twitter for many reasons, and we believe that two of the most significant are the breadth of Twitter content and our broad reach. We have already achieved significant global scale, and we continue to grow. We have more than240 million MAUs spanning nearly every country. Our users include millions of people from around the world, as well as influential individuals and organizations, such as world leaders, government officials, celebrities, athletes, journalists, sports teams, media outlets and brands. Our users create approximately 500 million Tweets every day.

Twitter is a public, real-time platform where any user can create a Tweet and any user can follow other users. We do not impose restrictions on whom a user can follow, which greatly enhances the breadth and depth of available content and allows users to discover the content they care about most. Additionally, users can be followed by thousands or millions of other users without requiring a reciprocal relationship, which we referto as an asymmetric follow model. This asymmetric follow model significantly enhances the ability of our users to reach a broad audience. The public nature of our platform allows us and others to extend the reach of Twitter content beyond our properties. Media outlets distribute Tweets beyond our properties to complement their content by making it more timely, relevant and comprehensive. Tweets have appeared on over eight million third-party websites, and in the fourth quarter of 2013 there were approximately 67 billion online impressions of Tweets off of our properties.

Twitter provides a compelling and efficient way for people to stay informed about their interests, discover what is happening in their world right now and interact directly with each other. We enable the timely creation and distribution of ideas and information among people and organizations at a local and global scale. Our platform allows users to browse through Tweets quickly and explore content more deeply through links, photos, media and other applications that can be attached to each Tweet. As a result, when events happen in the world, whether planned, like sporting events and television shows, or unplanned, like natural disasters and political revolutions, the digital experience of those events happens in real time on Twitter. People can communicate with each other during these events as they occur, creating powerful shared experiences.

Our platform partners and advertisers enhance the value we create for our users.

·Platform Partners.Our platform partners add value to our user experience by contributing content to our platform, broadly distributing content from our platform across their properties and using Twitter content and tools to enhance their websites and applications. Many of the world’s most trusted media outlets, including the BBC, CNN and Times of India, regularly use Twitter as a platform for content distribution.

·Advertisers.Advertisers use our Promoted Products, the majority of which are pay-for-performance, to promote their brands, products and services, amplify their visibility and reach, and complement and extend the conversation around their advertising campaigns. We enable our advertisers to target an audience based on a variety of factors, including a user’s Interest Graph. The Interest Graph maps, among other things, interests based on users followed and actions taken on our platform, such as Tweets created and engagement with Tweets. We believe a user’s Interest Graph produces a clear and real-time signal of a user’s interests, greatly enhancing the relevance of the ads we can display for users and enhancing our targeting capabilities for advertisers. Our Promoted Products are incorporated into our platform without disrupting or detracting from the user experience and are designed to be as compelling and useful to our users as organic content on our platform.

Although we do not generate revenue directly from users or platform partners, we benefit from network effects where more activity on Twitter results in the creation and distribution of more content, which attracts more users, platform partners and advertisers, resulting in a virtuous cycle of value creation.




Mobile has become the primary driver of our business. Our mobile products are critical to the value we create for our users, and they enable our users to create, distribute and discover content in the moment and on-the-go. The 140 character constraint of a Tweet emanates from our origins as an SMS-based messaging system,and we leverage this simplicity to develop products that seamlessly bridge our user experience across all devices. In the three months ended December 31, 2013, 76% of our average MAUs accessed Twitter from a mobile device and over 75% of our advertising revenue was generated from mobile devices.

In the three months ended December 31, 2013, our average MAUs increased by 30% to 240.9 million, compared to the three months ended December 31, 2012. From 2011 to 2012, revenue increased by 198% to $316.9 million, net loss decreased by 38% to $79.4 million and Adjusted EBITDA increased by 149% to $21.2 million. From 2012 to 2013, revenue increased by 110% to $664.9 million, net loss increased by 713% to $645.3 million and Adjusted EBITDA increased by $54.3 million to $75.4 million. For information on how we define and calculate the number of MAUs and factors that can affect this metric, see the section titled “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations”. For information on how we define and calculate Adjusted EBITDA, and a reconciliation of net loss to Adjusted EBITDA, see the section titled “Selected Financial Data.”

Twitter, Inc. was incorporated in Delaware in April 2007. Our principal executive offices are located at 1355 Market Street, Suite 900, San Francisco, California 94103, and our telephone number is (415) 222-9670. Our website address is www.twitter.com. Information contained on, or that can be accessed through, our websiteis not intended to be incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K and inclusion of our website address in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are inactive textual references only.  We completed our initial public offering in November 2013 and our common stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol “TWTR”. Unless the context requires otherwise, the words “Twitter,” “we,” “Company,” “us” and “our” refer to Twitter, Inc. and our wholly owned subsidiaries.

Content Creation, Distribution and Discovery

Twitter combines the following four elements at scale to create a global platform for public self-expression and conversation in real time. We believe Twitter can be the content creation, distribution and discovery platform for the Internet and evolving mobileecosystem.

·Public.Twitter is open to the world.

Content on Twitter is broadly accessible to our users and unregistered visitors. All users can create Tweets and follow other users. Since the vast majority of users on Twitter choose to communicate publicly on our platform, users can follow other users without requiring a reciprocal relationship. This asymmetric follow model significantly increases the breadth and depth of content available to users on our properties. In addition, the public nature of Twitter allows people to benefit from Twitter content even if they are not Twitter users or following the user that originally tweeted, as that content can travel virally on and off our properties to other websites and media, such as television and print.

·Real-Time.News breaks on Twitter.

Real-time content allows our users to enhance experiences by digitally connecting to a global conversation as events unfold, and enables our users to engage with each other directly and instantly in the moment and on-the-go. The combination of our tools, technology and format enables our users to quickly create and distribute content globally in real time with 140 keystrokes or the flash of a photo, and the click of a button. The ease with which our users can create content combined with our broad reach results in users often receiving content faster than other forms of media. Additionally, because our platform allows any of our more than 240 million MAUs to contribute content, we have a vastly larger production capability than traditional media and news outlets.

·Conversational.Twitter is where users come to express themselves and interact with the world.

Our users can interact on Twitter directly with other users, including people from around the world, as well as influential individuals and organizations. Importantly, these interactions can occur in public view, thereby creating an opportunity for all users to follow and participate in conversations on Twitter. These public conversations offer a complementary communication channel to media companies and advertisers and an opportunity for them to increase their ad engagement and reach through Twitter.




·Distributed.Tweets go everywhere.

Tweets are distributed not only on Twitter, but also off our properties by millions of websites around the world. Media outlets distribute Tweets beyond our properties to complement their content by making it more timely, relevant and comprehensive. The simple format of a Tweet, the public nature of content on Twitter and the ease of distribution off our properties allow media outlets to display Tweets on their online and offline properties, thereby extending the reach of Tweets beyond our properties.

The combination of being public, real-time, conversational and distributed forms the foundation of our ability to provide value to our users, platform partners and advertisers.

Our Products and Services

We design our products to create a user-centric, interactive experience. Our development efforts focus on simplicity and ensuring that content can be accessed on any platform.

Products for Users

Twitter.Twitter allows users to express themselves and create, distribute and discover content.

·Home Timeline. The timeline is a key component of the user experience. A user’s timeline displays the user’s individual Tweets as well as Tweets from the users they follow, with the most recent Tweets appearing at the top of the timeline. The timeline prompts the user to refresh whenever a followed user sends a new Tweet. The timeline is designed to be simple and easy to digest, and displays only the user profile picture and text content of each Tweet. Most rich media content in a Tweet is previewed in a timeline. If a Tweet contains rich media content or is part of a broader conversation involving favorites, replies and Retweets, the user can expand the Tweet to display this content in the timeline.

·Timelines on Mobile.The timeline interface on our mobile apps allows users to swipe from their Home timeline to their Discover timeline, where they can find trends, popular Tweets and new accounts tailored for their interests, and then to their Activity timeline, where they can see Tweets and accounts that popular among their followed accounts.

·Self-Expression Mechanisms.

·Tweet Composer.When a user wants to create a Tweet, they can do so by simply clicking on the “Compose new Tweet” box or icon, composing a Tweet and clicking “Tweet” to send the Tweet to their followers.

·Profile.The user profile includes a user’s name, Twitter username, location, website, photograph and short biography, and also includes lists of the accounts that the user is following, the user’s followers, the user’s Tweets and media gallery.

·Lists.A list is a curated group of Twitter users. Users can create their own lists or subscribe to lists created by other users. Viewing a list timeline will show the user a stream of Tweets from only the users on that list.

·Social Mechanisms.

·Follow.Users select which other users they want to follow based on what interests them. The Tweets of the users they follow are displayed in their timeline.

·Who to Follow.Our user recommendation engine, “Who to Follow,” provides users with recommendations for other users to follow based on their interests and who they are currently following.

·Favorites, @Replies and Retweets.Various features enable users to interact with Tweets created by other users. Users can click on the “Favorite” button on a Tweet to demonstrate their support of or interest in the Tweet. Users can also reply to a Tweet created by another user by clicking the “Reply” button on the Tweet, which we refer to as an @reply, building on the original content and sharing their thoughts and opinions with the sender. A Tweet can also be resent, or retweeted, by a user that has received it by clicking the “Retweet” button on the Tweet, which enables users to redistribute the original Tweet to their followers.




·Mentions.Users can refer to, or mention, other users in their Tweets and Retweets by denoting the recipient with the “@” symbol followed by their username. We display mentions, including @replies, on the @Connect page of the user mentioned.

·@Connect. Users can see their history of interactions with other Twitter users by going to their @Connectpage, which collects and displays information about a user’s followers and interactions with other users on Twitter.

·Direct Messages.In order to allow non-public communication among Twitter users, Twitter allows users to send private messages, known as direct messages. Users can only send a direct message to a user who is following them and can only receive direct messages from users they follow.

·Protected Tweets.Twitter also provides its users with the ability to make their Tweets private. A user who chooses to utilize this feature must choose to accept a new follower request before his or her Tweets are visible to that follower.

·Discovery Mechanisms.

·Trends.Topics that are tweeted about at a high rate can become trends on Twitter. Trends are often indicators of what is current and popular at any given moment in a particular country or worldwide. Some trends are preceded by “#,” which we refer to as a hashtag. The use of hashtags on our platform was initiated by our users and hashtags are included in Tweets to mark them as relating to a topic, enabling trends to be more easily identified and conversations on a given topic to be more easily found.

·Search.Twitter Search enables users to find a real-time targeted list of the Tweets and users most relevant to their search topic by keyword, hashtag or username.

·#Discover.The Twitter #Discover tool enables users to find interesting and relevant information that they may not have found in their own timeline or through searches. A user’s interests, their followers and activity determine what is displayed on the user’s #Discover page.

·Notifications.

·Email, SMS and Push Notifications.Users can customize how they are notified about activity on Twitter. They may elect to receive email notifications, SMS messages and mobile push notifications, which are alerts sent to the home screen of a mobile device by a mobile application.

·Platform Ubiquity.We make Twitter available across a variety of mobile and desktop applications and websites.

·Mobile Applications. Twitter is available across a wide range of mobile devices, including Android phones and tablets, iPhone, iPad, Blackberry, Windows Phone, Nokia S40 and Nokia X. We tailor our products and services to each system to create a rich Twitter experience for our users, taking advantage of the capabilities of each device and its operating system.

·Mobile Web and Twitter.com.Twitter is available on the web at mobile.twitter.com and twitter.com. We operate tailored versions of our mobile website for smartphone browsers and feature phone browsers to deliver a compelling user experience for users, regardless of how they access our platform.

·SMS.Users in many countries around the world can register, follow accounts, receive notifications and send Tweets entirely through SMS. Our relationships with many mobile carriers enable users who are customers of these carriers to engage with Twitter through SMS.

·Desktop Applications.Our TweetDeck application enables users to view multiple streams of Tweets in real time, and execute custom search queries against real-time content. A Twitter application is available on the Mac OS and Windows 8 platforms.

Vine.Vine is a mobile application available on the iOS, Android and Windows operating systems that enables users to create and distribute short looping videos of up to six seconds in length. Vine users create and distribute their videos to their followers on Vine, with the option of tweeting them to their Twitter followers and sharing them on social networks. Users on Vine can follow other users, re-broadcast to their followers by revining, comment on videos and embed videos on websites. We do not currently place, or currently plan to place, ads on Vine.




#Music.#Music is a mobile application that helps users discover new music and artists based on Tweets. #Music is available on the iOS platform. #Music uses data from the Twitter API to surface trending music artists in a variety of genres, and allows users to browse through artists based on social relationships on Twitter. We do not currently place, or currently plan to place, ads on #Music.

Our terms of service govern our users’ access to and use of our products and services, as well as any content uploaded, downloaded or appearing on our products and services. By agreeing to our terms of service, our users agree to be responsible for their use of our products and services, for any content they post to our products and services and for any consequences thereof. Our terms of service allow us to alter or limit use of our products and services or terminate a user’s right to use them at our sole discretion. We have the right to remove or refuse to distribute any content and to suspend or terminate users at any time. Our users retain their rights to any content they submit, post or display on our products and services and grant us a license to use, publish and distribute such content, including to our third-party partners. Our users also agree to our privacy policy which describes our collection and use of their information. Our users agree that we, and the third parties with whom we partner, may place targeted advertising on our products and services. Any user may terminate this agreement with us at any time for any reason by deactivating their account and discontinuing their use of our products and services.

Products for Platform Partners

We provide a set of tools, public APIs and embeddable widgets that developers can use to contribute their content to our platform, distribute Twitter content across their properties and enhance their websites and applications with Twitter content. Websites integrating with Twitter add value to our user experience. Indeed many applications have been registered by developers to enable them to integrate with our platform, and leverage Twitter content to enhance and extend their applications in new and creative ways. The goal of our platform product development is to make it easy for developers to integrate seamlessly with Twitter.

Key elements of the Twitter platform products include:

·Twitter Cards.Twitter Cards enable developers to attach content and functionality to Tweets, and have that content appear wherever a Tweet is displayed throughout web and mobile applications. Developers can link Twitter Cards directly to their own mobile application or website, in order to drive visits and application installs.

·The Twitter Public API.The Twitter public API allows platform partners to integrate Twitter content and follower relationships into their applications. For example, a platform partner can connect to the Twitter public API in order to collect, filter and integrate real-time content from Twitter into a live television program or a third-party website to integrate Tweets into a sentiment monitoring application to help companies monitor and measure conversation on Twitter about their brand.

·Twitter for Websites.Twitter for Websites is a set of tools that enable platform partners to integrate Twitter content and functionality into their websites. Sites can embed single Tweets or timelines of Tweets, or add Tweet buttons to their websites that make it easy for visitors to follow particular accounts or Tweet about the content they are viewing.

Products and Services for Advertisers

Our Promoted Products enable our advertisers to promote their brands, products and services, amplify their visibility and reach, and extend the conversation around their advertising message. Currently, our Promoted Products consist of the following:

·Promoted Tweets.Promoted Tweets, which are labeled as “promoted,” appear within a user’s timeline or search results just like an ordinary Tweet regardless of device, whether it be desktop or mobile. Using our proprietary algorithm and understanding of the interests of each user, we can deliver Promoted Tweets that are intended to be relevant to a particular user.

·Promoted Accounts. Promoted Accounts, which are labeled as “promoted,” appear in the same format and place as accounts suggested by our Who to Follow recommendation engine, or in some cases, in Tweets in a user’s timeline. Promoted Accounts provide a way for our advertisers to grow a community of users who are interested in their business, products or services.




·Promoted Trends.Promoted Trends, which are labeled as “promoted,” appear at the top of the list of trending topics for an entire day in a particular country or on a global basis. When a user clicks on a Promoted Trend, search results for that trend are shown in a timeline and a Promoted Tweet created by our advertisers is displayed to the user at the top of those search results. We feature one Promoted Trend per day per geography.

Our technology platform and information database enable us to provide targeting capabilities that make it possible for advertisers to promote their brands, products and services, amplify their visibility and reach, and complement and extend the conversation around their advertising campaigns, including the following:

·Interest and Gender Targeting.Advertisers can target Promoted Tweets and Promoted Account campaigns based on interests and gender of users, which we predict based on the accounts that a user follows, and their history of interaction with content on Twitter.

·Geographic Targeting.Advertisers can target Promoted Tweet and Promoted Account campaigns based on user geography. Advertisers can also purchase a Promoted Trend on a country-by-country or worldwide basis. We receive information regarding a user’s location based upon the user’s IP address or, if the user has turned on location services on their mobile device, the location of the user’s mobile device at the time of user engagement to the extent possible. In the event that real-time location information is not available, we estimate the user’s location based upon an aggregation of IP addresses from which the user has recently accessed Twitter. If a user’s current geographic location is not available or we are unable to assign a geographic location to a user at the time the user engages with Twitter based on recent data, we deliver advertising that is based on the geographic location of the user at the time that such user initially registered for an account on Twitter based on the user’s IP address.

·Keyword Targeting.Advertisers can target specific words that users engage with on Twitter, including words marked with a hashtag, either through search queries, the Tweets a user creates or the Tweets a user engages with.

·Television Conversation Targeting.Advertisers can target users who have been exposed to their ads on television. We provide advertisers with this targeting capability by analyzing a user’s Tweets to determine which television shows a user has tweeted about and matching this information with information regarding which commercials were aired during these shows.

·Device Targeting.Advertisers can target based on specific mobile or desktop devices to reach users in specific contexts.

When our customers purchase advertising services they have the ability to monitor their advertising campaigns as follows:

·Campaign Management.Our campaign management capability tools allow advertisers to monitor and make changes to campaigns in real time as ads are delivered. This allows advertisers to actively manage their campaigns as they gain deeper insight into their target audience and react to events and user reactions as they unfold.

·Real-Time Analytics.Our analytics tools give our advertisers insight into user response to their ads, which helps them to understand the success of campaigns as well as customer preferences.

·Advertiser API.Our APIs enable advertisers to integrate with Twitter and build websites and applications that integrate our campaign management and analytics tools.

·Mobile Advertising Exchange.In October 2013, we acquired MoPub, Inc., or MoPub, a mobile-focused advertising exchange. We plan to invest in and grow MoPub’s current business, including by extending advertising across the mobile ecosystem through the MoPub advertising exchange. We also plan to use MoPub’s technology to build real-time bidding into the Twitter ads platform so that our advertisers can more easily automate and scale their advertising purchases.

Products for Data Partners

We offer subscription access to our data feed for data partners who wish to access data beyond the public API.

Competition

We face significant competition for users, advertisers and personnel.




Users.We compete against many companies to attract and engage users, some of which have greater financial resources and substantially larger user bases, such as Facebook (including Instagram), Google, LinkedIn, Yahoo! and Microsoft. We also compete against smaller companies such as Sina Weibo, LINE and Kakao, each of which is based in Asia.

We believe that our ability to compete effectively for users depends upon many factors, including the usefulness, ease of use, performance and reliability of our products and services; the amount, quality and timeliness of content generated by our users; our ability to establish and maintain relationships with platform partners that integrate with our platform; and our reputation and the strength of our brand.

Advertisers. We also face significant competition for advertiser spend. The substantial majority of our revenue is generated from the sale of advertising services, and we compete against online and mobile businesses and traditional media outlets, such as television, radio and print, for spending on advertising.

We believe that our ability to compete effectively for advertiser spend depends upon many factors, including the size and composition of our user base; our ad targeting capabilities; the timing and market acceptance of our advertising services; our marketing and selling efforts; the return our advertisers receive from our advertising services; and our reputation and the strength of our brand.

Personnel. We also experience significant competition for highly skilled personnel, including senior management, engineers, designers and product managers. Our growth strategy depends in part on our ability to retain our existing personnel and add additional highly skilled employees. Competition for highly skilled personnel is intense, particularly in the San Francisco Bay Area, where our headquarters is located, and we compete for personnel against online and mobile businesses, other companies in the technology industry and traditional media businesses, such as television, radio and print.

We believe that our ability to compete effectively for highly skilled personnel depends upon many factors, including a work environment that encourages independence, creativity and innovation; opportunities to work on challenging, meaningful and important products; the reputation and strength of our brand; and compensation.

We believe that we compete favorably on the factors described above. However, our industry is evolving rapidly and is becoming increasingly competitive. See the sections titled “Risk Factors—If we are unable to compete effectively for users and advertiser spend, our business and operating results could be harmed” and “Risk Factors—We depend on highly skilled personnel to grow and operate our business, and if we are unableto hire, retain and motivate our personnel, we may not be able to grow effectively.”

Technology, Research and Development

Twitter is composed of a set of core, scalable and distributed services that are built from proprietary and open source technologies. These systems are capable of delivering billions of short messages to hundreds of millions of people a day in an efficient and reliable way.

·Twitter’s Scale.Tweets are delivered to users via the twitter.com website, through over a dozen owned and operated Twitter applications, and through widgets that appear on third party websites. Each time a user creates a Tweet, it is delivered to each follower of such user that requests a timeline. If a follower then retweets it, the Tweet is delivered to each of their followers who request a timeline. In addition, we deliver to users any Tweets that may be generated through our trends, search or #Discover functions. This process requires our infrastructure to collect and efficiently deliver large volumes of information daily.

·Real-time, Service Oriented Architecture.Twitter’s architecture is optimized so users perceive instantaneous change. The time between a Tweet being created and having it available for users to see and interact with in the product is measured in tenths of a second. In general, the latency between two events occurring in our infrastructure is measured in millisecond increments.

·Foundational Infrastructure and Data.Our customized technology replicates and balances this data across multiple geographically distributed databases and allows us to store, access and modify it at scale.

·Relevancy and Content Analysis.We have built systems and algorithms to organize content to enable users to find and discover the most relevant content, people and topics on Twitter. Our key technologies include a distributed, fixed-latency, high performance search system that allows us to efficiently index, retrieve and score users and their content in real time. We have also built a trending platform to determine trending topics on Twitter.




·Advertising Technology.Our advertising platform allows advertisers to reach users based on many factors, including their Interest Graphs. We use sophisticated algorithms to determine the likelihood of user engagement with specific ads. We use these algorithms to match advertiser demand with Twitter users by placing Promoted Tweets and Promoted Accounts into a user’s Twitter experience in a way that optimizes for both user experience and the value we deliver to advertisers.

Sales and Marketing

We have a global sales force and sales support staff that is focused on attracting and retaining advertisers. Our sales force and sales support staff assists advertisers throughout the advertising campaign cycle, from pre-purchase decision making to real-time optimizations as they utilize our campaign management tools, and to post-campaign analytics reports to assess the effectiveness of their advertising campaigns. Our advertisers also use our self-serve advertising platform to launch and manage their advertising campaigns.

Since our inception, our user base has grown primarily by word-of-mouth. Our marketing efforts to date have focused on amplifying and accelerating this word-of-mouth momentum. Through these efforts and people’s increased usage of Twitter worldwide, we have been able to build our brand with relatively minimal marketing costs.

Intellectual Property

We seek to protect our intellectual property rights by relying on federal, state and common law rights in the United States and other countries, as well as contractual restrictions. We generally enter into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our employees and contractors, and confidentiality agreements with other third parties, in order to limit access to, and disclosure and use of, our confidential information and proprietary technology. In addition to these contractual arrangements, we also rely on a combination of trademarks, trade dress, domain names, copyrights, trade secrets and patents to help protect our brand and our other intellectual property.

As of December 31, 2013, we had 956 issued patents and approximately 100 filed patent applications in the United States and foreign countries relating to message distribution, graphical user interfaces, security and related technologies. Our issued United States patents are expected to expire between 2016 and 2031.

We may be unable to obtain patent or trademark protection for our technologies and brands, and our existing patents and trademarks, and any patents or trademarks that may be issued in the future, may not provide us with competitive advantages or distinguish our products and services from those of our competitors. In addition, any patents and trademarks may be contested, circumvented or found unenforceable or invalid, and we may not be able to prevent third parties from infringing, diluting or otherwise violating them.

In May 2013, we implemented our Innovator’s Patent Agreement, or IPA, which we enter into with our employees and consultants, including our founders. We implemented the IPA because we were concerned about the recent proliferation of offensive patent lawsuits, including lawsuits by “non-practicing entities.” We are also encouraging other companies to implement the IPA in an effort to reduce the number of patents with offensive rights which may be transferred to third parties, including non-practicing entities. We believe that a reduction in the number of patents with transferrable offensive rights may reduce the number of offensive lawsuits that may be filed, particularly by non-practicing entities.

The IPA, which applies to our current and future patents of inventions created by our employees, allows us to assert our patents defensively. The IPA also allows us to assert our patents offensively with the permission of the inventors of that particular patent. Under the IPA, an assertion of claims is considered for a defensive purpose if the claims are asserted: (i) against an entity that has filed, maintained, threatened or voluntarily participated in a patent infringement lawsuit against us or any of our users, affiliates, customers, suppliers or distributors; (ii) against an entity that has used its patents offensively against any other party in the past ten years, so long as the entity has not instituted the patent infringement lawsuit defensively in response to a patent litigation threat against the entity; or (iii) otherwise to deter a patent litigation threat against us or our users, affiliates, customers, suppliers or distributors. In addition, the IPA provides that the above limitations apply to any future owner or exclusive licensee of any of our patents, which could limit our ability to sell or license our patents to third parties including to non-practicing entities.




Companies in the Internet, technology and media industries own large numbers of patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets, and frequently enter into litigation based on allegations of infringement, misappropriation, or other violations of intellectual property or other rights. In addition, various “non-practicing entities” that own patents and other intellectual property rights often attempt to aggressively assert their rights in order to extract value from technology companies. We are presently involved in a number of intellectual property lawsuits, and from time to time we face, and we expect to face in the future, allegations that we have infringed or otherwise violated the patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, and other intellectual property rights of third parties, including our competitors and non-practicing entities. As we face increasing competition and as our business grows, we will likely face more intellectual property-related claims and litigation matters. For additional information, see the sections titled “Risk Factors—We are currently, and expect to be in the future, party to intellectual property rights claims that are expensive and time consuming to defend, and, if resolved adversely, could have a significant impact on our business, financial condition or operating results” and “Legal Proceedings.”

Government Regulation

We are subject to a number of U.S. federal and state and foreign laws and regulations that involve matters central to our business. These laws and regulations may involve privacy, rights of publicity, data protection, content regulation, intellectual property, competition, protection of minors, consumer protection, taxation or other subjects. Many of these laws and regulations are still evolving and being tested in courts and could be interpreted in ways that could harm our business. In addition, the application and interpretation of these laws and regulations often are uncertain, particularly in the new and rapidly evolving industry in which we operate.

We are also subject to federal, state and foreign laws regarding privacy and the protection of user data. Foreign data protection, privacy, consumer protection, content regulation and other laws and regulations are often more restrictive than those in the United States. There are also a number of legislative proposals pending before the U.S. Congress, various state legislative bodies and foreign governments concerning data protection that could affect us. For example, regulation relating to the 1995 European Union Data Protection Directive is currently being considered by European legislative bodies that may include more stringent operational requirements for entities processing personal information and significant penalties for non-compliance.

In March 2011, to resolve an investigation into various incidents, we entered into a settlement agreement with the Federal Trade Commission, or FTC, that, among other things, requires us to establish an information security program designed to protect non-public consumer information and also requires that we obtain biennial independent security assessments. The FTC investigation was the result of two separate incidents in which unauthorized intruders obtained administrative passwords of certain Twitter employees. In one of the incidents, the intruder accessed the employee’s administrative capabilities to fraudulently reset various user passwords and post unauthorized Tweets. The obligations under the settlement agreement remain in effect until the later of March 2, 2031, or the date 20 years after the date, if any, on which the U.S. government or the FTC files a complaint in federal court alleging any violation of the order. Violation of existing or future regulatory orders, settlements, or consent decrees could subject us to substantial monetary fines and other penalties that could negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations.

Twitter users may be restricted from accessing Twitter from certain countries, and other countries have intermittently restricted access to Twitter. For example, Twitter is not directly accessible in China. It is possible that other governments may seek to restrict access to or our block our website or mobile applications, censor content available through our products or impose other restrictions that may affect the accessibility or usability of Twitter for an extended period of time or indefinitely.

We have a public policy team that monitors legal and regulatory developments in the U.S., as well as a number of foreign countries, and works with policymakers and regulators in the U.S. and internationally.

For additional information, see the section titled “Risk Factors—Our business is subject to complex and evolving U.S. and foreign laws and regulations.
