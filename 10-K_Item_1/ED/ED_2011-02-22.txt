Item 1: Business

Overview

Consolidated Edison, Inc. (Con Edison), incorporated in New York State in
1997, is a holding company which owns all of the outstanding common stock of Consolidated Edison Company of New York, Inc. (CECONY), Orange and Rockland Utilities, Inc. (O&R) and the competitive energy businesses. As used in this report, the
term the “Companies” refers to Con Edison and CECONY.





CECONY’s principal business operations are its
regulated electric, gas and steam delivery businesses. O&R’s principal business operations are its regulated electric and gas delivery businesses. The competitive energy businesses sell electricity to wholesale and retail customers, provide
certain energy-related services, and participate in energy infrastructure projects. Con Edison is evaluating additional opportunities to invest in electric and gas-related businesses.

Con Edison’s strategy is to provide reliable energy services, maintain public and employee safety, promote energy efficiency, and develop cost-effective ways of performing its business. Con Edison
seeks to be a responsible steward of the environment and enhance its relationships with customers, regulators and members of the communities it serves.

CECONY

Electric

CECONY provides electric service to approximately 3.3 million customers in all of New York City (except part of Queens) and most of Westchester
County, an approximately 660 square mile service area with a population of more than nine million.

Gas

CECONY delivers gas to approximately 1.1 million customers in Manhattan, the Bronx and parts of Queens and Westchester County.

Steam

CECONY operates
the largest steam distribution system in the United States by producing and delivering more than 23,000 MMlbs of steam annually to approximately 1,760 customers in parts of Manhattan.

O&R

Electric

O&R and its utility subsidiaries, Rockland Electric Company (RECO) and Pike County Power & Light Company (Pike) (together referred to herein
as O&R) provide electric service to approximately 0.3 million customers in southeastern New York and in adjacent areas of northern New Jersey and northeastern Pennsylvania, an approximately 1,350 square mile service area.







Gas

O&R delivers gas to over 0.1 million customers in southeastern New York and adjacent areas of northeastern Pennsylvania.

Competitive Energy Businesses

Con Edison pursues competitive energy opportunities through
three wholly-owned subsidiaries: Con Edison Solutions, Con Edison Energy and Con Edison Development. These businesses include the sales and related hedging of electricity to wholesale and retail customers, sales of certain energy-related products
and services, and participation in energy infrastructure projects. At December 31, 2010, Con Edison’s equity investment in its competitive energy businesses was $337 million and their assets amounted to $807 million.

In 2008, Con Edison Development and its subsidiary, CED/SCS Newington, LLC, completed the sale of their ownership interests in electricity generating
plants with an aggregate capacity of approximately 1,706 MW. See Note U to the financial statements in Item 8.

Utility
Regulation

State Utility Regulation

Regulators

The Utilities are subject to regulation by the New York State
Public Service Commission (NYSPSC), which under the New York Public Service Law, is authorized to set the terms of service and the rates the Utilities charge for providing service in New York. It also approves the issuance of the Utilities’
securities. It exercises jurisdiction over the siting of the Utilities’ electric transmission lines and approves mergers or other business combinations involving New York utilities. O&R’s New Jersey subsidiary, RECO, is subject to
similar regulation by the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities (NJBPU). O&R’s Pennsylvania subsidiary, Pike, is subject to similar regulation by the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission (PAPUC). The NYSPSC, together with the NJBPU and the
PAPUC, are referred to herein as state utility regulators.

Utility Industry Restructuring In New York

In the 1990s, the NYSPSC restructured the electric utility industry in the state. In accordance with NYSPSC orders, the Utilities sold all of their
electric generating facilities other than those that also produce steam for CECONY’s steam business (see Electric Operations – Electric Facilities below) and provided all of their customers the choice to buy electricity or gas from the
Utilities or other suppliers (see Electric Operations – Electric Sales and Deliveries and Gas Operations – Gas Sales and Deliveries below).

Following adoption of NYSPSC industry restructuring, there were several utility mergers as a result of which substantially all of the electric and gas delivery service in New York State is now provided by
one of three investor-owned utility companies – Con Edison, National Grid plc and Iberdrola, S.A. – or one of two state authorities – New York Power Authority (NYPA) or Long Island Power Authority.

Rate Plans

Investor-owned utilities in the United States provide service to customers according to the terms of tariffs approved by the appropriate state utility
regulator. The tariffs include schedules of rates for service that are designed to permit the utilities to recover from their customers the approved anticipated costs, including capital costs, of providing service to customers as defined by the
tariff. The tariffs implement rate plans, that result from rate orders, settlements, or joint proposals developed during rate proceedings. The utilities’ earnings depend on the rate levels authorized in the rate plans and their ability to
operate their businesses in a manner consistent with their rate plans.

The utilities’ rate plans each cover specified periods, but rates
determined pursuant to a plan generally continue in effect until a new rate plan is approved by the state utility regulator. In New York, either the utility or the NYSPSC can commence a proceeding for a new rate plan, and a new rate plan filed by
the utility will take effect automatically in 11 months unless prior to such time the NYSPSC approves a rate plan.

In each rate proceeding,
rates are determined by the state utility regulator following the submission by the utility of testimony and supporting information, which are subject to review by the staff of the regulator. Other parties with an interest in the proceeding can







also review the utility’s proposal and become involved in the rate case. The review process is overseen by an Administrative Law Judge. After an Administrative Law Judge issues a decision,
that generally considers the interests of the utility, the regulatory staff, other parties, and legal requisites, the regulator will issue a rate order. The utility and the regulator’s staff and interested parties may enter into a settlement
agreement or joint proposal prior to the completion of this administrative process, in which case the agreement would be subject to approval of the regulator.

For each rate plan, the revenues needed to provide the utility a return on invested capital is determined by multiplying the utilities’ forecasted rate base by the utility’s pre-tax weighted
average cost of capital. In general, rate base is the amount of the utility’s net plant, deferred taxes and working capital. The NYSPSC uses a forecast of rate base for the rate year. The weighted average cost of capital is determined based on
the forecasted amounts and costs of long-term debt and preferred equity, the forecasted amount of common equity and an allowed return on common equity determined by the state utility regulator. The NYSPSC’s current methodology for determining
the allowed return on common equity assigns a one-third weight to an estimate determined from a capital asset pricing model applied to a peer group of utility companies and a two-thirds weight to an estimate determined from a dividend discount model
using stock prices and dividend forecasts for a peer group of utility companies.

Pursuant to the Utilities’ rate plans, there generally
can be no change to the charges to customers during the respective terms of the rate plans other than for recovery of the costs incurred for energy supply and specified adjustments provided for in the rate plans.

Common provisions of the Utilities’ rate plans may include:

“Recoverable energy cost clauses”that allow the Utilities to recover on a current basis the costs for the energy they supply with no mark-up to their full-service customers.

“Other cost reconciliations”that reconcile pension and other postretirement costs, environmental remediation costs, and certain other
costs to amounts reflected in delivery rates for such costs. Utilities generally retain the right to petition for recovery or accounting deferral of extraordinary and material cost increases and provision is sometimes made for the utility to retain
a share of cost reductions, for example, property tax refunds.

“Revenue decoupling mechanisms”under which actual energy
delivery revenues will be compared, on a periodic basis, with the authorized delivery revenues. The difference is accrued with interest for refund to, or recovery from customers, as applicable.

“Earnings sharing provisions”require the Utilities to defer for customer benefit earnings over specified rates of return on common
equity. There is no symmetric mechanism for earnings below specified rates of return on common equity.

“Negative earnings
adjustments”for failure to meet certain performance standards relating to service reliability, safety and other matters.







The following table should be read in conjunction with, and is subject to, the more detailed discussion of
the Utilities’ rate plans in Note B to the financial statements in Item 8 (which information is incorporated by reference herein).

Liability for Service Interruptions and Other Non-rate Conditions of Service

The tariff provisions under which CECONY provides electric, gas and steam service limit the company’s liability to pay for damages resulting from
service interruptions to circumstances resulting from its gross negligence or willful misconduct.

CECONY’s tariff for electric service
provides for reimbursement to electric customers for spoilage losses resulting from service interruptions in certain circumstances. In general, the company is obligated to reimburse affected residential and commercial customers for food spoilage of
up to $450 and $9,000, respectively, and reimburse affected residential customers for prescription medicine spoilage losses without limitation on amount per claim. The company’s maximum aggregate liability for such reimbursement for an incident
is $15 million. The company is not required to provide reimbursement to electric customers for outages attributable to generation or transmission system facilities or events beyond its control, such as storms, provided the company makes reasonable
efforts to restore service as soon as practicable.







Generic Proceedings

The NYSPSC from time to time conducts “generic” proceedings to consider issues relating to all electric and gas utilities operating in New York State. Pending proceedings have included those
relating to utilities exiting the service of selling electric energy and gas at retail (including an examination of utilities’ provider of last resort responsibility, the utilities’ vision for the ‘smart grid’, the implementation
of energy efficiency and renewable energy programs and consumer protections) and addressing any rate disincentives to the promotion of energy efficiency and distributed generation. The Utilities are typically active participants in such proceedings.
The Utilities do not expect that these pending generic proceedings will have a material adverse effect on their financial positions, results of operation or liquidity. In February 2011, the NYSPSC initiated a proceeding to examine the existing
mechanisms pursuant to which utilities recover site investigation and remediation costs and possible alternatives. See “Environmental Matters – CECONY” and “Environmental Matters – O&R,” below, and Note G to the
financial statements in Item 8.

Federal Utility Regulation

The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), among other things, regulates the transmission and wholesale sales of electricity in interstate commerce and the transmission and sale of natural gas for
resale in interstate commerce. In addition, the FERC has the authority to impose penalties, which could be substantial, including penalties for the violation of reliability rules. Certain activities of the Utilities and the competitive energy
businesses are subject to the jurisdiction of FERC. The Utilities are subject to regulation by the FERC with respect to electric transmission rates and to regulation by the NYSPSC with respect to electric and gas retail commodity sales and local
delivery service. As a matter of practice, the NYSPSC has approved delivery service rates that include both distribution and transmission costs.

New York Independent System Operator (NYISO)

The NYISO is a not-for-profit organization that controls and operates most of the electric transmission facilities in New York State, including those of the Utilities, as an integrated system and
administers wholesale markets for electricity in New York State. In addition to operating the state’s high voltage grid, the NYISO administers the energy, ancillary services and capacity markets. The New York State Reliability Council (NYSRC)
promulgates reliability standards subject to FERC oversight. Pursuant to a requirement that is set annually by the NYSRC, the NYISO requires that entities supplying electricity to customers in New York State have generating capacity (either owned or
contracted for) in an amount equal to the peak demand of their customers plus the applicable reserve margin. In addition, the NYISO has determined that entities that serve customers in New York City must have enough capacity that is electrically
located in New York City to cover a substantial percentage (currently 80 percent; 81 percent effective May 2011) of the peak demands of their New York City customers. These requirements apply both to regulated utilities such as CECONY and O&R
for the customers they supply under regulated tariffs and to companies such as Con Edison Solutions that supply customers on market terms. RECO, O&R’s New Jersey subsidiary, provides electric service in an area that has a different
independent system operator – PJM Interconnection LLC (PJM).

Competition

Competition from suppliers of oil and other sources of energy, including distributed generation (such as solar, fuel cells and micro-turbines), may provide alternatives for the Utilities’ delivery
customers. See “Rate Agreements” in Note B and “Recoverable Energy Costs” in Note A to the financial statements in Item 8.

The Utilities do not consider it reasonably likely that another company would be authorized to provide utility delivery service of electricity, natural gas or steam where the company already provides
service. Any such other company would need to obtain NYSPSC consent, satisfy applicable local requirements, install facilities to provide the service, meet applicable services standards, and charge customers comparable taxes and other fees and costs
imposed on the service.







A new delivery company would also be subject to extensive ongoing regulation by the NYSPSC.

The competitive energy businesses participate in competitive energy supply and services businesses that are subject to different risks than those found in the businesses of the Utilities.

The Utilities

CECONY

CECONY, incorporated in New York State in 1884, is a subsidiary of Con Edison and has no significant subsidiaries of its own. Its
principal business segments are its regulated electric, gas and steam businesses.

For a discussion of the company’s operating revenues
and operating income for each segment, see “Results of Operations” in Item 7. For additional information about the segments, see Note N to the financial statements in Item 8.

Electric Operations

Electric Facilities

CECONY’s
capitalized costs for utility plant, net of accumulated depreciation, for distribution facilities were $12,549 million and $11,824 million at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. For its transmission facilities, the costs for utility
plant, net of accumulated depreciation, were $2,150 million and $1,953 million at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively, and for its generation facilities, the costs for utility plant, net of accumulated depreciation, were $396 million and
$392 million, at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.

Distribution Facilities.CECONY owns 62 area distribution substations and various distribution facilities located throughout New York City and Westchester County. At December 31, 2010, the company’s distribution system
had a transformer capacity of 28,997 MVA, with 36,781 miles of overhead distribution lines and 96,324 miles of underground distribution lines. The underground distribution lines represent the single longest underground electric delivery system in
the United States. To continue its commitment to upgrade and reinforce its energy delivery infrastructure so that it can continue to safely and reliably meet electric demand, the company added one new substation, Newtown, in Queens in 2010.

Transmission Facilities.The company’s transmission facilities are located in New York City and Westchester, Orange, Rockland, Putnam and Dutchess counties in New York State. At December 31, 2010, CECONY owned or
jointly owned 438 miles of overhead circuits operating at 138, 230, 345 and 500 kV and 740 miles of underground circuits operating at 69, 138 and 345 kV. The company’s 38 transmission substations and 62 area stations are supplied by circuits
operated at 69 kV and above. In 2011, the company expects to complete a 91/2mile transmission line connecting its Sprainbrook substation in Westchester County with the new Academy substation being constructed in upper Manhattan.

CECONY’s transmission facilities interconnect with those of National Grid, Central Hudson Gas & Electric Corporation, O&R, Iberdrola
USA, Connecticut Light and Power Company, Long Island Power Authority, NYPA and Public Service Electric and Gas Company.

Generating Facilities.CECONY’s electric generating facilities consist of plants located in Manhattan with an
aggregate capacity of 698 MW. The company expects to have sufficient amounts of gas and fuel oil available in 2011 for use in these facilities.

Electric Sales and Deliveries

CECONY delivers electricity to its full service customers who purchase electricity from the company. The company also delivers electricity to its
customers who purchase electricity from other suppliers through the company’s retail access plan. In addition, the company delivers electricity to state and municipal customers of NYPA and economic development customers of municipal electric
agencies.







The company charges all customers in its service area for the delivery of electricity. The company generally
recovers, on a current basis, the cost of the electricity that it buys and then sells to its full-service customers. It does not make any margin or profit on the electricity it sells. Effective April 2008, CECONY’s electric revenues became
subject to a revenue decoupling mechanism. As a result, its electric delivery revenues are generally not affected by changes in delivery volumes from levels assumed when rates were approved. CECONY’s electric sales and deliveries, excluding
off-system sales, for the last five years were:

For further discussion of the company’s electric operating revenues and its electric results, see “Results of Operations” in Item 7. For additional segment information, see Note N to
the financial statements in Item 8.

Electric Peak Demand

Electric Supply

Most of the
electricity sold by CECONY to its customers in 2010 was purchased under firm power contracts or through the wholesale electricity market







administered by the NYISO. Con Edison expects that these resources will again be adequate to meet the requirements of its customers in 2011. The company plans to meet its continuing obligation to
supply electricity to its customers through a combination of electricity purchased under contracts, purchased through the NYISO’s wholesale electricity market, or generated from its electricity generating facilities. For information about the
company’s contracts for approximately 3,320 MW of electric generating capacity, see Notes I and O to the financial statements in Item 8. To reduce the volatility of its customers’ electric energy costs, the company has contracts to
purchase electric energy and enters into derivative transactions to hedge the costs of a portion of its expected purchases under these contracts and through the NYISO’s wholesale electricity market.

CECONY owns generating stations in New York City associated primarily with its steam system. As of December 31, 2010, the generating stations had a
combined electric capacity of approximately 698 MW, based on 2010 summer test ratings. For information about electric generating capacity owned by the company, see “Electric Operations – Electric Facilities – Generating
Facilities”, above.

In general, the Utilities recover their purchased power costs, including the cost of hedging purchase prices,
pursuant to rate provisions approved by the state public utility regulatory authority having jurisdiction. See “Financial and Commodity Market Risks – Commodity Price Risk,” in Item 7 and “Recoverable Energy Costs” in
Note A to the financial statements in Item 8. From time to time, certain parties have petitioned the NYSPSC to review these provisions, the elimination of which could have a material adverse effect on the Companies’ financial position,
results of operations or liquidity.

In a July 1998 order, the NYSPSC indicated that it “agree(s) generally that CECONY need not plan on
constructing new generation as the competitive market develops,” but considers “overly broad” and did not adopt CECONY’s request for a declaration that, solely with respect to providing generating capacity, it will no longer be
required to engage in long-range planning to meet potential demand and, in particular, that it will no longer have the obligation to construct new generating facilities, regardless of the market price of capacity. CECONY monitors the adequacy of the
electric capacity resources and related developments in its service area, and works with other parties on long-term resource adequacy issues within the framework of the NYISO. In addition, the NYISO has adopted reliability rules that include
obligations on transmission owners (such as CECONY) to construct facilities that may be needed for system reliability if the market does not solve a reliability need identified by the NYISO.







These surcharges will increase as NYSERDA increases its renewables energy purchases. The NYSPSC issued an order in January 2010 formally increasing the RPS target to 30 percent by 2015 and
requiring NYSPSC staff to develop a program to address the geographic balance of the RPS, setting-aside up to $30 million per year to be spent in the downstate region (including in the Utilities’ service territories) until 2015 for this
purpose. Large renewable resources are grid-connected and sell their energy output in the wholesale energy market administered by the NYISO. As a result of the Utilities participation in the NYISO wholesale markets, a portion of the Utilities’
NYISO energy purchases are sourced from renewable resources. The energy produced by customer-sited renewables offsets the energy which the Utilities would otherwise have procured, thereby reducing the overall level of non-renewable energy consumed.
In 2008, the NYSPSC issued an order authorizing the Utilities to begin implementing energy efficiency programs. Costs of the programs will be recovered primarily through a separate non-bypassable charge.

Gas Operations

Gas Facilities

CECONY’s
capitalized costs for utility plant, net of accumulated depreciation, for gas facilities, which are primarily distribution facilities, were $3,153 million and $2,892 million at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.

Natural gas is delivered by pipeline to CECONY at various points in its service territory and is distributed to customers by the company through an
estimated 4,340 miles of mains and 385,396 service lines. The company owns a natural gas liquefaction facility and storage tank at its Astoria property in Queens, New York. The plant can store approximately 1,000 mdths of which a maximum of about
250 mdths can be withdrawn per day. The company has about 1,226 mdths of additional natural gas storage capacity at a field in upstate New York, owned and operated by Honeoye Storage Corporation, a corporation 28.8 percent owned by CECONY and 71.2
percent owned by Con Edison Development.

Gas Sales and Deliveries

The company generally recovers the cost of the gas that it buys and then sells to its firm sales customers. It does not make any margin or profit on the gas it sells. CECONY’s gas revenues are
subject to a weather normalization clause and, effective October 2007, a revenue decoupling mechanism. As a result, its gas delivery revenues are generally not affected by changes in delivery volumes from levels assumed when rates were approved.



CECONY’s gas sales and deliveries for the last five years were:

For further discussion of the company’s gas operating revenues and its gas results, see “Results of Operations” in Item 7. For
additional segment information, see Note N to the financial statements in Item 8.

Gas Peak Demand

The gas peak demand for firm service customers in CECONY’s service area occurs during the winter heating season. The daily peak day demand during the
winter 2010/2011 (through January 25, 2011) occurred on January 23, 2011 when the demand reached 891 mdths. The 2010/2011 winter demand included an estimated 587 mdths for CECONY’s full-service customers and 304 mdths for customers
participating in its gas retail access program. “Design weather” for the gas system is a standard to which the actual peak demand is adjusted for evaluation and planning purposes. The company estimates that under design weather conditions
the 2011/2012 service area peak demand will be 1,151 mdths, including an estimated 675 mdths for its full-service customers and 475 mdths for its retail access customers. The company forecasts average annual growth of the peak gas demand over the
next five years at design conditions to be approximately 1.1 percent in its service area. The forecasted peak demand at design conditions does not include gas used by interruptible gas customers or in generating stations (electricity and steam). The
company continues to monitor the potential impact on customer demand from the current economic conditions.

Gas Supply

CECONY and O&R have combined their gas requirements, and contracts to meet those requirements, into a single portfolio. The
combined portfolio is administered by, and related management services are provided by, CECONY (for itself and as agent for O&R) and costs are allocated between the Utilities in accordance with provisions approved by the NYSPSC. See Note S to
the financial statements in Item 8.

Charges from suppliers for the firm purchase of gas, which are based on formulas or indexes or are
subject to negotiation, are generally designed to approximate market prices. The gas supply contracts are for various terms extending to 2014. The Utilities have contracts with interstate pipeline companies for the purchase of firm transportation
from upstream points where gas has been purchased to the Utilities’ distribution systems, and for upstream storage services. Charges under these transportation and storage contracts are approved by the FERC. Such contracts are for various terms
extending to 2023. The Utilities are required to pay certain fixed charges under the supply, transportation and storage contracts whether or not the contracted capacity is actually used. These fixed charges amounted to approximately $246 million in
2010, including $205 million for CECONY. See “Contractual Obligations” below. In addition, the Utilities purchase gas on the spot market and contract for interruptible gas transportation. See “Recoverable Energy Costs” in Note A
to the financial statements in Item 8.







Steam Operations

Steam Facilities

CECONY’s capitalized costs for utility plant, net of
accumulated depreciation for steam facilities were $1,617 million and $1,555 million at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.

CECONY
generates steam at one steam-electric generating station and five steam-only generating stations and distributes steam to its customers through approximately 106 miles of transmission, distribution, and service piping.



Steam Sales and Deliveries

CECONY’s steam sales and deliveries for the last five years were:

additional segment information, see Note N to the financial statements in Item 8.

Steam Peak Demand and Capacity

Demand for steam in CECONY’s service area peaks during the winter heating season. The one-hour peak demand during the winter of
2010/2011 (through January 25, 2011) occurred on January 24, 2011 when the demand reached 8,924 MMlbs per hour. The company’s estimate for the winter of 2011/2012 peak demand of its steam customers is 9,780 MMlbs per hour under design
criteria, which assumes severe weather.

On December 31, 2010, the steam system had the capability of delivering approximately 13.3 MMlbs
of steam per hour, and CECONY estimates that the system will have the capability to deliver 11.8 MMlbs of steam per hour in the 2011/2012 winter.

Steam Supply

Forty-four percent of the steam produced by CECONY in 2010 was
supplied by the company’s steam-only generating assets; 41 percent was produced by the company’s steam-electric generating assets, where steam and electricity are primarily cogenerated; and 15 percent was purchased under an agreement with
Brooklyn Navy Yard Cogeneration Partners L.P.

O&R

Electric Operations

Electric Facilities

O&R’s capitalized costs for utility plant, net of accumulated depreciation, for distribution facilities were $642 million and $618 million at
December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. For its transmission facilities, the costs for utility plant, net of accumulated depreciation, were $134 million and $137 million at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.

O&R, RECO and Pike, own, in whole or in part, transmission and distribution facilities which include 554 circuit miles of transmission lines, 13
transmission substations, 61 distribution substations, 84,809 in-service line transformers, 3,774 pole miles of overhead distribution lines and 1,727 miles of underground distribution lines. O&R’s transmission







system is part of the NYISO system except that portions of RECO’s system are located within the transmission area controlled by the PJM.

Electric Sales and Deliveries

O&R generally recovers, on a current basis, the cost of the electricity that it buys and then sells to its full-service customers. It does not make
any margin or profit on the electricity it sells. Effective July 2008, O&R’s New York electric revenues (which accounted for 66.7 percent of O&R’s electric revenues in 2010) became subject to a revenue decoupling mechanism. As a
result, O&R’s New York electric delivery revenues are generally not affected by charges in delivery volumes from levels assumed when rates were approved. O&R’s electric sales in New Jersey and Pennsylvania are not subject to a
decoupling mechanism. O&R’s electric sales and deliveries, excluding off-system sales for the last five years were:

For further discussion of the company’s electric operating revenues and its electric results, see “Results of Operations” in Item 7.
For additional segment information, see Note N to the financial statements in Item 8.

Electric Peak Demand

The electric peak demand in O&R’s service area occurs during the summer air conditioning season. The 2010 service area peak demand, which
occurred on July 6, 2010, was 1,572 MW. The 2010 peak demand included an estimated 1,034 MW for O&R’s full-service customers and 538 MW for customers participating in its electric retail access program. The NYISO did not invoke demand
reduction programs. “Design weather” for the electric system is a standard to which the actual peak demand is adjusted for evaluation and planning purposes. Since the majority of demand reduction programs are invoked only in specific
circumstances, design conditions do not include these programs’ potential impact. However, the O&R forecasted peak demand at design conditions does include the impact of permanent demand reduction programs. The company estimates that, under
design weather conditions, the 2011 service area peak demand will be 1,600 MW, including an estimated 1,046 MW for its full-service customers and 554 MW for its electric retail access customers. The company forecasts average annual growth of the
peak electric demand in the company’s service area over the next five years at design conditions to be approximately 1.7 percent per year. The company continues to monitor the potential impact on customer demand from the current economic
conditions.

Electric Supply

The electricity O&R sold to its customers in 2010 was purchased under firm power contracts or through the wholesale electricity markets administered by the NYISO and PJM. The company expects that
these resources will again be adequate to meet the requirements of its customers in 2011. O&R does not own any electric generating capacity.







Gas Operations

Gas Facilities

O&R’s capitalized costs for utility plant, net of
accumulated depreciation for gas facilities, which are primarily distribution facilities, were $382 million and $334 million at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. O&R and Pike own their gas distribution systems, which include 1,744
miles of mains. In addition, O&R owns a gas transmission system, which includes 81 miles of mains.



Gas Sales and Deliveries

O&R generally recovers the cost of the gas that it
buys and then sells to its firm sales customers. It does not make any margin or profit on the gas it sells. O&R’s gas revenues are subject to a weather normalization clause. Effective November 2009, O&R’s New York gas revenues
(which accounted for substantially all of O&R’s gas revenues in 2009) became subject to a revenue decoupling mechanism. As a result, its gas delivery revenues are generally not affected by changes in delivery volumes from levels assumed
when rates were approved. O&R’s gas deliveries and sales for the last five years were:

For further discussion of the company’s gas operating revenues and its gas results, see “Results of Operations” in Item 7. For
additional segment information, see Note N to the financial statements in Item 8.

Gas Peak Demand

The gas peak demand for firm service customers in O&R’s service area occurs during the winter heating season. The daily peak day demand during
the winter 2010/2011 (through January 31, 2011) occurred on January 23, 2011 when the demand reached 176 mdths. The 2010/2011 winter demand included an estimated 87 mdths for O&R’s full-service customers and 89 mdths for customers
participating in its gas retail access program. “Design weather” for the gas system is a standard to which the actual peak demand is adjusted







for evaluation and planning purposes. The company estimates that under design weather conditions the 2011/2012 service area peak demand will be 224 mdths, including an estimated 110 mdths for its
full-service customers and 114 mdths for its retail access customers. The company forecasts average annual growth of the peak gas demand over the next five years at design conditions to be approximately 1.6 percent in the company’s service
area. The forecasted peak demand at design conditions does not include gas used by interruptible gas customers or in generating stations. The company continues to monitor the potential impact on customer demand from the current economic conditions.

Gas Supply

O&R
and CECONY have combined their gas requirements and purchase contracts to meet those requirements into a single portfolio. See “CECONY – Gas Operations – Gas Supply” above.

Competitive Energy Businesses

Con
Edison pursues competitive energy opportunities through three wholly-owned subsidiaries: Con Edison Solutions, Con Edison Energy and Con Edison Development. These businesses include the sales and related hedging of electricity to wholesale and
retail customers, sales of certain energy-related products and services, and participation in energy infrastructure projects. At December 31, 2010, Con Edison’s equity investment in its competitive energy businesses was $337 million and
their assets amounted to $807 million.

The competitive energy businesses are pursuing opportunities to invest in renewable generation and
energy-related infrastructure projects.

Con Edison Solutions

Con Edison Solutions primarily sells electricity to industrial, commercial and governmental customers in the northeastern United States and Texas. It also sells electricity to residential and small
commercial customers in the northeastern United States. Con Edison Solutions does not sell electricity to the Utilities. Con Edison Solutions sells electricity to customers who are provided delivery service by the Utilities. It also provides energy
efficiency services, procurement and management services to companies and governmental entities throughout most of the United States.

Con
Edison Solutions was reported by KEMA, Inc. in September 2010 to be the 9th largest non-residential retail electricity provider in the United States. Most of the company’s electricity sales volumes are to industrial, large commercial and
government customers. The company also sells to two retail aggregation entities in Massachusetts and to individual residential and small commercial (mass market) customers in the northeastern United States. At December 31, 2010, it served
approximately 115,000 customers, not including approximately 165,000 served under the two aggregation agreements. Con Edison Solutions sold 15,993 million kWhs of electricity in 2010, a 26 percent increase from 2009 volumes.

Con Edison Solutions seeks to serve customers in utility service territories that encourage retail competition through transparent pricing, purchase of
receivables programs or utility-sponsored customer acquisition programs. The company currently sells electricity in the service territories of 43 utilities in the states of New York, Massachusetts, Connecticut, New Hampshire, Maine, New Jersey,
Delaware, Maryland, Illinois, Pennsylvania and Texas, as well as the District of Columbia.

Total peak load at the end of 2010 was 5,300 MWs.
Approximately 34 percent of the sales volumes were in New York, 27 percent in New England, 31 percent in PJM and the remainder in Texas.







Con Edison Solutions offers the choice of green power to customers. In 2010, it sold approximately
233 million kWhs of green power, ending the year with almost 24,000 customers. Green power is a term used by electricity suppliers to describe electricity produced from renewable energy sources, including wind, hydro and solar.

Con Edison Solutions also provides energy- efficiency services to government and commercial customers. The services include the design and installation of
lighting retrofits, high-efficiency heating, ventilating and air conditioning equipment and other energy saving technologies. The company is compensated for their services based primarily on the increased energy efficiency of the installed equipment
over a multi-year period. Con Edison Solutions has won competitive solicitations for energy savings contracts with the Department of Energy and the Department of Defense, and a shared energy savings contract with the United States Postal Service.

Con Edison Energy

Con Edison
Energy manages the output and fuel requirements for over 7,700 MW of third-party generating plants in the northeastern United States. The company also provides wholesale hedging and risk management services to Con Edison Solutions and Con Edison
Development. In addition, the company sells electricity to utilities in the northeastern United States, primarily under fixed price contracts, which they use to supply their full-service customers.

The Utilities have an ongoing need for substantial capital investment in order to
meet the growth in demand for electricity, and electric, gas and steam reliability needs.



The estimated capital expenditures for the competitive energy businesses reflect potential investments in renewable generation and energy infrastructure projects and could significantly increase or
decrease from the amounts estimated depending on market conditions and opportunities.



Contractual Obligations

The following table summarizes the Companies’ material
obligations at December 31, 2010 to make payments pursuant to contracts. Long-term debt, capital lease obligations and other long-term liabilities are included on their balance sheets. Operating leases and electricity purchase agreements (for
which undiscounted future annual payments are shown) are described in the notes to the financial statements.

(b)Included in these amounts is the cost of minimum quantities of energy that the company is obligated to purchase at both fixed and variable prices.

(c)Included in these amounts is the cost of minimum quantities of natural gas supply, transportation and storage that the Utilities are obligated to purchase at both fixed and
variable prices.

(d)Amounts shown for other purchase obligations, which reflect capital and operations and maintenance costs incurred by the Utilities in running their day-to-day operations, were
derived from the Utilities’ purchasing systems as the difference between the amounts authorized and the amounts paid (or vouchered to be paid) for each obligation. For many of these obligations, the Utilities are committed to purchase less than
the amount authorized. Payments for the “Other Purchase Obligations” are generally assumed to be made ratably over the term of the obligations. The Utilities believe that unreasonable effort and expense would be involved to modify their
purchasing systems to enable them to report their “Other Purchase Obligations” in a different manner.

(e)Amounts represent commitments to purchase minimum quantities of electric energy and capacity, renewable energy certificates, natural gas, natural gas pipeline capacity, energy
efficiency services and construction services entered into by Con Edison’s competitive energy businesses.



The Companies’ commitments to make payments in addition to these contractual commitments include their other liabilities reflected in their balance
sheets, any funding obligations for their pension and other postretirement benefit plans, financial hedging activities, their collective bargaining agreements and Con Edison’s guarantees of certain obligations of its businesses. See Notes E, F,
O and “Guarantees” in Note H to the financial statements in Item 8.

Capital Resources

Con Edison is a holding company that operates only through its subsidiaries and has no material assets other than its interests in its subsidiaries. Con
Edison expects to finance its capital requirements primarily through internally-generated funds and the sale of its securities, including meeting all of its common equity needs in 2011 by issuing shares under its dividend reinvestment and employee
stock plans. Con Edison’s ability to make payments on its external borrowings and dividends on its common shares is also dependent on its receipt of dividends from its subsidiaries or proceeds from the sale of its securities or its interests in
its subsidiaries.

For information about restrictions on the payment of dividends by the Utilities and significant debt covenants, see Note C
to the financial statements in Item 8.

For information on the Companies’ commercial paper program and revolving credit agreements
with banks, see Note D to the financial statements in Item 8.

The Utilities expect to finance their operations, capital requirements and
payment of dividends to Con Edison from internally-generated funds (see “Liquidity and Capital Resources – Cash Flows from Operating Activities” in Item 7), contributions of equity capital from Con Edison and external borrowings,
including the issuance in 2011 of long-term debt of up to $600 million.

The Companies require access to the capital markets to fund capital
requirements that are substantially in excess of available internally-generated funds. See “Capital Requirements,” above. Each of the Companies believes that it will continue to be able to access capital, although capital market conditions
may affect the timing of the Companies’ financing activities. The Companies monitor the availability and costs of various forms of capital, and will seek to issue Con Edison common stock and other securities when it is necessary or advantageous
to do so. For information about the Companies’ long-term debt and short-term borrowing, see Notes C and D to the financial statements in Item 8.







In 2009, the NYSPSC authorized CECONY and O&R to issue up to $4,800 million and $500 million of
securities, respectively (of which up to $550 million and $100 million, respectively, may be preferred stock and up to the entire amount authorized may be debt securities). At December 31, 2010, CECONY and O&R had issued $1,470 million and
$190 million, respectively, of debt securities pursuant to such authorization. In addition, the NYSPSC has authorized the Utilities’ to refund outstanding debt securities and preferred stock should the Utilities determine that it is economic to
do so.

Con Edison’s competitive energy businesses have financed their operations and capital requirements primarily with capital
contributions and borrowings from Con Edison, internally-generated funds and external borrowings.

For each of the Companies, the ratio of
earnings to fixed charges (SEC basis) for the last five years was:

The
commercial paper of the Companies is rated P-2, A-2 and F2, respectively, by Moody’s, S&P and Fitch. Con Edison’s long-term credit rating is Baa1, BBB+ and BBB+, respectively, by Moody’s, S&P and Fitch. The unsecured debt of
CECONY is rated A3, A- and A-, respectively, by Moody’s, S&P and Fitch. The unsecured debt of O&R is rated Baa1, A- and A-, respectively, by Moody’s, S&P and Fitch. Securities ratings assigned by rating organizations are
expressions of opinion and are not recommendations to buy, sell or hold securities. A securities rating is subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization. Each rating should be evaluated independently of any other
rating.

CECONY has $636 million of tax-exempt debt for which the interest rates are to be determined pursuant to periodic auctions. Of this
amount, $391 million is insured by Ambac Assurance Corporation and $245 million is insured by Syncora Guarantee Inc. (formerly XL Capital Assurance Inc.). Credit rating agencies have downgraded the ratings of these insurers from AAA to lower levels.
Subsequently, there have not been sufficient bids to determine the interest rates pursuant to auctions, and interest rates have been determined by reference to a variable rate index. The weighted average annual interest rate on this tax-exempt debt
was 0.54 percent on December 31, 2010. The weighted average interest rate was 0.45 percent, 0.80 percent and 3.94 percent for the years 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Under CECONY’s current gas and steam and (beginning in April 2011)
electric rate orders, variations in auction rate debt interest expense are reconciled to the levels set in rates.

Environmental
Matters

Climate Change

As indicated in 2007 by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, emissions of greenhouse gases, including carbon dioxide, are very likely changing
the world’s climate.

Climate change could affect customer demand for the Companies’ energy services. The effects of climate change
might also include physical damage to the Companies’ facilities and disruption of their operations due to the impact of more extreme weather-related events.

Based on the most recent data (2008) published by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Con Edison estimates that its greenhouse gas emissions constitute less than 0.1 percent of the
nation’s greenhouse gas emissions. Con Edison’s emissions of greenhouse gases during the past five years (expressed in terms of millions of tons of carbon dioxide equivalent) were:



20062007200820092010CO2equivalent
emissions5.45.34.64.24.3







The 35 percent decrease in Con Edison’s greenhouse gas emissions since 2005 (6.6 million tons)
reflects the emission reductions resulting from equipment and repair projects, including projects to reduce sulfur hexafluoride emissions, and increased use of natural gas at CECONY’s steam production facilities. Emissions from electric
generation at the Con Edison Development electric generating plants (which were sold in 2008 – see Note U to the financial statements in Item 8) have been removed from the above data for 2008 and prior years.

The Companies are working to further reduce greenhouse gas emissions. CECONY has participated for several years in voluntary initiatives with the EPA to
reduce its methane and sulfur hexafluoride emissions. The Utilities reduce methane emissions from the operation of their gas distribution systems through pipe maintenance and replacement programs, by operating system components at lower pressure,
and by introducing new technologies. The Utilities reduce emissions of sulfur hexafluoride, which is used for arc suppression in substation circuit breakers and switches, by using improved technologies to locate and repair leaks, and by replacing
older equipment. The Utilities also promote energy efficiency programs for customers that help them reduce their greenhouse gas emissions.

Beginning in 2009, CECONY is subject to carbon dioxide emissions regulations established by New York State under the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative.
The initiative, a cooperative effort by Northeastern and Mid-Atlantic states, establishes a decreasing cap on carbon dioxide emissions resulting from the generation of electricity to a level ten percent below the Initiative’s baseline by 2018.
Under the initiative, affected electric generators are required to obtain emission allowances to cover their carbon dioxide emissions, available primarily through auctions administered by participating states or a secondary market.

The EPA has started regulating greenhouse gas emissions from major sources. Also, New York State has announced a goal to reduce greenhouse gas emissions
80 percent below 1990 levels by 2050, and New York City plans to reduce greenhouse gas emissions within the City 30 percent below 2005 levels by 2030. The cost to comply with legislation, regulations or initiatives limiting the Companies’
greenhouse gas emissions could be substantial.

Environmental Sustainability

Con Edison seeks to improve the environmental sustainability of its businesses. CECONY is piloting smart grid technologies to demonstrate the interoperability of distributed generation and the exchange of
information between customers and utilities. The smart grid will give customers the tools to be smarter consumers of energy and will allow the utility to more quickly identify and isolate problems. The company recycles clean non-hazardous waste
materials in more than a dozen categories and recycled more than 59,000 tons of waste in 2009. More than 40 percent of the company’s vehicles are now using alternative-energy technology. New environmentally friendly white roofs are in place at
the corporate headquarters and more than 20 other facilities, and others are underway. A white roof reflects sunlight, lowering indoor temperatures on hot days, which reduces the need to cool the building, resulting in fewer carbon dioxide
emissions.

CECONY

Superfund

The Federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation
and Liability Act of 1980 and similar state statutes (Superfund) impose joint and several liability, regardless of fault, upon generators of hazardous substances for investigation costs, remediation costs and environmental damages. The sites as to
which CECONY has been asserted to have liability under Superfund include its and its predecessor companies’ former manufactured gas sites, its multi-purpose Astoria site, its former Arthur Kill electric generation plant site, its former
Flushing Service Center site, the Gowanus Canal site, and other Superfund sites discussed below. There may be additional sites as to which assertions will be made that the Company has liability. For a further discussion of claims and possible claims
against the Company under Superfund, estimated liability accrued for Superfund claims and recovery from customers of site







investigation and remediation costs, see Note G to the financial statements in Item 8 (which information is incorporated herein by reference).

Manufactured Gas Sites

CECONY and its predecessors formerly manufactured gas and maintained storage holders for gas manufactured at sites in New York City and Westchester County
(MGP Sites). Many of these sites are now owned by parties other than CECONY and have been redeveloped by them for other uses, including schools, residential and commercial developments and hospitals. The New York State Department of Environmental
Conservation (NYSDEC) requires the company to investigate, and if necessary, develop and implement remediation programs for the sites, which include 34 manufactured gas plant sites and 17 storage holder sites and any neighboring areas to which
contamination may have migrated.

The information available to CECONY for many of the MGP Sites is incomplete as to the extent of contamination
and scope of the remediation likely to be required. Through the end of 2010, investigations have been started for all or portions of all 51 MGP Sites, and have been completed at 23 of the sites. Coal tar and/or other manufactured gas
production/storage-related environmental contaminants have been detected at 36 MGP Sites, including locations within Manhattan and other parts of New York City, and in Westchester County. Remediation has been completed at six sites and portions of
six other sites.

Astoria Site

CECONY is permitted by the NYSDEC to operate a hazardous waste storage facility on property the company owns in the Astoria section of Queens, New York. Portions of the property were formerly the location
of a manufactured gas plant and also have been used or are being used for, among other things, electric generation operations, electric substation operations, the storage of fuel oil and liquefied natural gas, and the maintenance and storage of
electric equipment. As a condition of its NYSDEC permit, the company is required to investigate the property and, where environmental contamination is found and action is necessary, to conduct corrective action to remediate the contamination. The
company has investigated various sections of the property and is performing additional investigations. The company has submitted to the NYSDEC and the New York State Department of Health reports identifying the known areas of contamination. The
company estimates that its undiscounted potential liability for the completion of the site investigation and cleanup of the known contamination on the property will be at least $38 million.

Arthur Kill Site

Following a September 1998 transformer fire at
CECONY’s former Arthur Kill Generating Station, it was determined that oil containing high levels of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) was released to the environment during the incident. The company has completed NYSDEC-approved cleanup
programs for the station’s facilities and various soil and pavement areas of the site affected by the PCB release. Pursuant to a July 1999 NYSDEC consent order, the company completed a NYSDEC-approved assessment of the nature and extent of the
contamination in the waterfront area of the station. The NYSDEC selected a remediation program for the waterfront area, and the company has implemented it pursuant to an additional consent order entered into during 2005. Field work associated with
the waterfront remediation program has been completed and a final engineering report has been submitted to and approved by the NYSDEC. In 2010, the NYSDEC informed the company that additional remediation is required in upland areas. The company
estimates that its undiscounted potential future liability for additional upland remediation, site monitoring, maintenance, and reporting to the NYSDEC will be approximately $0.2 million.

Flushing Service Center Site

The owner of a former CECONY service center
facility in Flushing, New York, informed the company that PCB contamination had been detected on a substantial portion of the property, which the owner remediated pursuant to the New York State Brownfield Cleanup Program administered by the







NYSDEC and is redeveloping for residential and commercial use. The property owner’s claim against the company for the cost of its environmental response costs for the site has been resolved.
In September 2007, the NYSDEC demanded that the company investigate and remediate PCB contamination that may have migrated into the adjacent Flushing River from the site. In April 2008, the company and NYSDEC entered into a consent order under which
the company has agreed to implement a NYSDEC-approved investigation program for the Flushing River and, if deemed necessary by the NYSDEC to protect human health and the environment from such contamination, to implement a NYSDEC-approved remediation
program for any PCB contamination in the river attributable to the site. At this time, the company cannot estimate its liability for the investigation and cleanup of any PCB contamination that may have migrated to the Flushing River from the site,
but such liability may be substantial.

Gowanus Canal

In August 2009, CECONY received a notice of potential liability and request for information from the EPA about the operations of the company and its predecessors at sites adjacent or near the 1.8 mile
Gowanus Canal in Brooklyn, New York. The company understands that the EPA also has provided or will provide notices of potential liability and information requests to other parties. In March 2010, the EPA added the Gowanus Canal to its National
Priorities List of Superfund sites. The canal’s adjacent waterfront is primarily commercial and industrial, currently consisting of concrete plants, warehouses, and parking lots, and the canal is near several residential neighborhoods. In
February 2011, the EPA released a report of its remedial investigation that confirmed there is significant contamination in the Gowanus Canal. The company expects that the cost of assessment and remediation of hazardous substances in and around the
Gowanus Canal will be substantial. CECONY is unable to predict its exposure to liability with respect to the Gowanus Canal site.

Other Superfund Sites

CECONY is a potentially responsible party (PRP) with
respect to other Superfund sites where there are other PRPs and where it is generally not responsible for managing the site investigation and remediation. Work at these sites is in various stages, with the company participating in PRP groups at some
of the sites. Investigation, remediation and monitoring at some of these sites have been, and are expected to continue to be, conducted over extended periods of time. The company does not believe that it is reasonably likely that monetary sanctions,
such as penalties, will be imposed upon it by any governmental authority with respect to these sites.

The following table lists each of
CECONY’s other Superfund sites for which the company anticipates it may have a liability. The table also shows for each such site, its location, the year in which the company was designated or alleged to be a PRP or to otherwise have
responsibilities with respect to the site (shown in the table under “Start”), the name of the court or agency in which proceedings with respect to the site are pending and CECONY’s estimated percentage of total liability for each
site. The company currently estimates that its potential liability for investigation, remediation, monitoring and environmental damages at each site is less than $200,000, with the exception of the Cortese Landfill site, for which the estimate is
$1.2 million and the Curcio Scrap Metal site, for which the estimate is $0.4 million. Superfund liability is joint and several. The company’s estimate of its liability for each site was determined pursuant to consent decrees, settlement
agreements or otherwise and in light of the financial condition of other PRPs. The company’s actual liability could differ substantially from amounts estimated.

O&R

Superfund

The sites at which O&R has been asserted to have liability
under Superfund include its manufactured gas sites, its West Nyack site, the Newark Bay site, and other Superfund sites discussed below. There may be additional sites as to which assertions will be made that O&R has liability. For a further
discussion of claims and possible claims against O&R under Superfund, see Note G to the financial statements in Item 8 (which information is incorporated herein by reference).

Manufactured Gas Sites

O&R and its predecessors formerly owned and
operated manufactured gas plants at seven sites (O&R MGP Sites) in Orange County and Rockland County, New York. Three of these sites are now owned by parties other than O&R, and have been redeveloped by them for residential, commercial or
industrial uses. The NYSDEC is requiring O&R to develop and implement remediation programs for the O&R MGP Sites including any neighboring areas to which contamination may have migrated.

Through the end of 2010, O&R has completed remedial investigations at all seven O&R MGP Sites O&R has completed the remediation at one of its
sites; has completed the NYSDEC-approved remediation program for the land portion of its Nyack site; and has received NYSDEC’s decision regarding the remedial work to be done at two other sites. Remedial design is ongoing for two of the sites
and will be initiated in 2011 for the shoreline/sediment portion of the Nyack site. Feasibility studies are expected to be completed in 2011 for the remaining sites.

West Nyack Site

In 1994 and 1997, O&R entered into consent orders with
the NYSDEC pursuant to which O&R agreed to conduct a remedial investigation and remediate certain property it owns in West Nyack, New York at which PCBs were discovered. Petroleum contamination related to a leaking underground storage tank was
found as well. O&R has completed all remediation at the site that the NYSDEC has required to date. O&R is continuing a supplemental groundwater investigation and on-site vapor intrusion monitoring as required by the NYSDEC.

Newark Bay

Approximately 300 parties, including O&R (which was served with a third-party complaint in June 2009), were sued as third-party defendants by Tierra
Solutions, Inc. (Tierra) and Maxus Energy Corporation (Maxus), successors to the Occidental Chemical Corporation and Diamond Shamrock Chemical Company. Tierra and Maxus were themselves sued in 2005 by the New Jersey Department of Environmental
Protection and others for removal and cleanup costs, punitive damages, penalties, and economic losses allegedly arising from the dioxin contamination their predecessors’ pesticide/herbicide plant allegedly released to the “Newark Bay
Complex,” a system of waterways including Newark Bay, the Arthur Kill, the Kill Van Kull, and lower portions of the Passaic and Hackensack Rivers. Tierra and Maxus are seeking equitable contribution from the third-party defendants for such
costs, damages, penalties and losses, which are likely to be substantial. As to O&R, Tierra and Maxus allege that 1975 and 1976 shipments of waste oil by O&R from an electricity generating plant in Haverstraw, New York to the Borne Chemical
Company in Elizabeth, New Jersey was a source of petroleum discharges to the Arthur Kill. Con Edison is unable to predict O&R’s exposure to liability with respect to the Newark Bay Complex.

Other Superfund Sites

O&R is a PRP with respect to other Superfund sites where there are other PRPs and it is not managing the site investigation and remediation. Work at
these sites is in various stages, with the company participating in PRP groups at some of the sites. Investigation, remediation and monitoring at some of these sites have been, and are expected to continue to be, conducted over extended periods of
time. The company does not believe that it is reasonably likely that monetary sanctions, such as penalties, will be imposed upon it by any governmental authority with respect to these sites.

The following table lists each of O&R’s other Superfund sites for which the company anticipates it may have liability. The table also shows for each such







site, its location, the year in which the company was designated or alleged to be a PRP or to otherwise have responsibilities with respect to the site (shown in the table under
“Start”), the name of the court or agency in which proceedings with respect to the site are pending and O&R’s estimated percentage of total liability for each site. The company currently estimates that its potential liability for
investigation, remediation, monitoring and environmental damages at each site is less than $0.5 million. Superfund liability is joint and several. The company’s estimate of its anticipated share of the total liability for each site was
determined pursuant to consent decrees, settlement agreements or otherwise and in light of the financial condition of other PRPs. The company’s actual liability could differ substantially from amounts estimated.

Other
Federal, State and Local Environmental Provisions

Toxic Substances Control Act

Virtually all electric utilities, including CECONY, own equipment containing PCBs. PCBs are regulated under the Federal Toxic Substances Control Act of
1976.

Water Quality

Certain governmental authorities are investigating contamination in the Hudson River and the New York Harbor. These waters run through portions of CECONY’s service area. Governmental authorities
could require entities that released hazardous substances that contaminated these waters to bear the cost of investigation and remediation, which could be substantial.

Air Quality

State Anti-Takeover Law

New York State law provides that a “domestic corporation,” such as Con Edison, may not consummate a merger, consolidation or similar transaction with the beneficial owner of a 20 percent or
greater voting stock interest in the corporation, or with an affiliate of the owner, for five years after the acquisition of the voting stock interest, unless the transaction or the acquisition of the voting stock interest was approved by the
corporation’s board of directors prior to the acquisition of the voting stock interest. After the expiration of the five-year period, the transaction may be consummated only pursuant to a stringent “fair price” formula or with the
approval of a majority of the disinterested stockholders.







Employees

Con Edison has no employees other than those of CECONY, O&R and Con Edison’s competitive energy businesses (which at December 31, 2010 had 13,795, 1,093 and 292, employees, respectively). Of
the 13,795 CECONY employees and 1,093 O&R employees, 8,613 and 649 were represented by a collective bargaining unit, respectively. The collective bargaining agreements covering these employees expire in June 2012 and June 2014, respectively.
