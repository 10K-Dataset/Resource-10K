Utility Regulation

State Utility Regulation

Regulators

The Utilities are subject to
regulation by the New York State Public Service Commission (NYSPSC), which under the New York Public Service Law, is authorized to set the terms of service and the rates the Utilities charge for providing service in New York. It also approves the
issuance of the Utilities’ securities. It exercises jurisdiction over the siting of the Utilities’ electric transmission lines and approves mergers or other business combinations involving New York utilities. In addition, it has the
authority to impose penalties on utilities, which could be substantial, for violating state utility laws and regulations and its orders. O&R’s New Jersey subsidiary, RECO, is subject to similar regulation by the New Jersey Board of Public
Utilities (NJBPU). O&R’s Pennsylvania subsidiary, Pike, is subject to similar regulation by the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission (PAPUC). The NYSPSC, together with the NJBPU and the PAPUC, are referred to herein as state utility
regulators.

Utility Industry Restructuring In New York

In the 1990s, the NYSPSC restructured the electric utility industry in the state.
In accordance with NYSPSC orders, the Utilities sold all of their electric generating facilities other than those that also produce steam for CECONY’s steam business (see Electric Operations – Electric Facilities below) and provided all of
their customers the choice to buy electricity or gas from the Utilities or other suppliers (see Electric Operations – Electric Sales and Deliveries and Gas Operations – Gas Sales and Deliveries below).

Following adoption of NYSPSC industry restructuring, there were several utility mergers as a result of which substantially all of the electric and
gas delivery service in New York State is now provided by one of four investor-owned utility companies – Con Edison, National Grid plc, Iberdrola, S.A. and Fortis Inc. – or one of two state authorities – New York Power Authority
(NYPA) or Long Island Power Authority.

Rate Plans

Investor-owned utilities in the United States provide service to customers according to the terms of tariffs approved by the appropriate state
utility regulator. The tariffs include schedules of rates for service that are designed to permit the utilities to recover from their customers the approved anticipated costs, including capital costs, of providing service to customers as defined by
the tariff. The tariffs implement rate plans adopted by state utility regulators in rate orders issued at the conclusion of rate proceedings. The utilities’ earnings depend on the rate levels authorized in their rate plans and their ability to
operate their businesses in a manner consistent with such rate plans.

The utilities’ rate plans each cover specified periods, but
rates determined pursuant to a plan generally continue in effect until a new rate plan is approved by the state utility regulator. In New York, either the utility or the NYSPSC can commence a proceeding for a new rate plan, and a new rate plan filed
by the utility will generally take effect automatically in 11 months unless prior to such time the NYSPSC approves a rate plan.

In each
rate proceeding, rates are determined by the state utility regulator following the submission by the utility of testimony and supporting information, which are subject to review by the staff of the regulator. Other parties with an interest in the
proceeding can also review the utility’s proposal and become involved in the rate proceeding. The review process is overseen by an Administrative Law Judge. After an Administrative Law Judge issues a recommended decision, that generally
considers the interests of the utility, the regulatory staff, other parties, and legal requisites, the regulator will issue a rate order. The utility and the regulator’s staff and interested parties may enter into a settlement agreement or
joint proposal prior to the completion of this administrative process, in which case the agreement would be subject to approval of the regulator.

For each rate plan, the revenues needed to provide the utility a return on invested capital is determined by multiplying the utilities’ forecasted rate base by the utility’s pre-tax
weighted average cost of capital. In general, rate base is the amount of the utility’s net plant, deferred taxes and working capital. The NYSPSC uses a forecast of the average rate base for the year



12CON EDISON ANNUAL REPORT




that new rates would be in effect (“rate year”). The NJBPU and the PAPUC use the rate base balances that would exist at the beginning of the rate year. The capital structure used in the
weighted average cost of capital is determined utilizing actual and forecast data for the same time periods as rate base. The cost of long-term debt, customer deposits and the allowed return on common equity represents a combination of actual and
forecast financing information. The allowed return on common equity is determined by each state’s respective utility regulator. The NYSPSC’s current methodology for determining the allowed return on common equity assigns a one-third weight
to an estimate determined from a capital asset pricing model applied to a peer group of utility companies and a two-thirds weight to an estimate determined from a dividend discount model using stock prices and dividend forecasts for a peer group of
utility companies.

Pursuant to the Utilities’ rate plans, there generally can be no change to the charges to customers during the
respective terms of the rate plans other than for recovery of the costs incurred for energy supply and specified adjustments provided for in the rate plans.

Common provisions of the Utilities’ rate plans may include:

“Recoverable
energy cost clauses”that allow the Utilities to recover on a current basis the costs for the energy they supply with no mark-up to their full-service customers.

“Other cost reconciliations”that reconcile pension and other postretirement benefit costs, environmental remediation costs, and certain other costs to amounts reflected in delivery
rates for such costs. Utilities generally retain the right to petition for recovery or accounting deferral of extraordinary and material cost increases for items such as major storm events and provision is sometimes made for the utility to retain a
share of cost reductions, for example, property tax refunds.

“Revenue decoupling mechanisms”under which actual energy
delivery revenues will be compared with the authorized delivery revenues. The difference is accrued with interest for refund to, or recovery from customers, as applicable.

“Earnings sharing provisions”that require the Utilities to defer for customer benefit earnings over specified rates of return on common equity. There is no symmetric mechanism for
earnings below specified rates of return on common equity.

“Negative earnings adjustments”for failure to meet certain
performance standards relating to service, reliability, safety and other matters.



The following table includes information about the Utilities’ current rate plans and should be read in conjunction with, and is subject to, the more detailed discussion of the Utilities’
rate plans in Note B to the financial statements in Item 8 (which information is incorporated by reference herein).

CON EDISON ANNUAL REPORT13




Liability for Service Interruptions and Other Non-rate Conditions of
Service

The tariff provisions under which CECONY provides electric, gas and steam service limit the company’s liability to
pay for damages resulting from service interruptions to circumstances resulting from its gross negligence or willful misconduct.

CECONY’s tariff for electric service provides for reimbursement to electric customers for spoilage losses resulting from service interruptions
in certain circumstances. In general, the company is obligated to reimburse affected residential and commercial customers for food spoilage of up to $450 and $9,000, respectively, and reimburse affected residential customers for prescription
medicine spoilage losses without limitation on amount per claim. The company’s maximum aggregate liability for such reimbursement for an incident is $15 million. The company is not required to provide reimbursement to electric customers for
outages attributable to generation or transmission system facilities or events beyond its control, such as storms, provided the company makes reasonable efforts to restore service as soon as practicable.

In June 2013, a commission established by the Governor of New York issued its final report on utility storm preparation and response. The
commission made recommendations regarding, among other things, preparation and response to flooding; estimation of customer restoration times; reliability of website outage maps; coordination with local governments and providers of other utility
services; availability and allocation of staffing and other resources (including the utility industry’s mutual aid process); and communications with affected communities and local officials. The commission’s report also addressed the Long
Island Power Authority, energy efficiency programs, utility infrastructure investment and regulatory deficiencies.

In August 2013, the
NYSPSC approved emergency response plans submitted by the Utilities, subject to certain modifications. Pursuant to the New York Public Service Law, as amended in 2013 (see “Regulators,” above), each electric utility is required to submit
to the NYSPSC annually a plan for the reasonably prompt restoration of service in the case of widespread outages in the utility’s service territory due to storms or other events beyond the control of the utility. If, after evidentiary hearings
or other investigatory proceedings, the NYSPSC finds that the utility failed to implement its plan reasonably, the NYSPSC may deny recovery of any part of the service restoration costs caused by such failure.

In November 2013, the NYSPSC adopted statewide policies pursuant to which the Utilities are required to provide credits to customers who are
without electric service for more than three days; adjust rate plan revenue targets so the credits would not be recovered pursuant to revenue decoupling mechanisms; and temporarily suspend collection-related activities and service terminations for
such customers (or, if the NYSPSC determines, to all residential customers in a designated area and certain other customers). The credit to a customer would equal the portion of the monthly customer charge attributable to the period the customer was
without service. If an extraordinary event occurs, the NYSPSC may direct New York gas utilities to implement the same policies.

In
December 2013, the NYSPSC approved a scorecard for use as a guide in assessing electric utility performance in restoring electric service during outages that result from a major storm event, to assist in holding the utilities accountable to certain
performance levels, and to guide utilities as to the NYSPSC’s expectations for their restoration efforts. The order indicated that the scorecard, which could also be applied by the NYSPSC for other outages or actions, was developed to work with
the penalty and emergency response plan provisions of the New York Public Service Law, as amended in 2013 (see “Regulators,” above). The scorecard includes performance metrics in categories for preparation, operational response and
communications. Within 30 days of the completion of customer restoration, electric utilities are required to provide data for the scorecard. The NYSPSC staff would use the data to assess performance against the metrics and determine a score for each
such event for each electric utility.

Generic Proceedings

The NYSPSC from time to time conducts “generic” proceedings to consider issues relating to all electric and gas utilities operating in New
York State. Pending proceedings include those relating to utilities exiting the service of selling electric energy and gas at retail (including an examination of utilities’ provider of last resort responsibility); the utilities’ vision for
the “smart grid”; utility staffing levels; and the implementation of energy efficiency and renewable energy programs and consumer protections. The Utilities are typically active participants in such proceedings. The Utilities do not expect
that these pending generic proceedings will have a material adverse effect on their financial positions, results of operation or liquidity.

In February 2011, the NYSPSC initiated a proceeding to examine the existing mechanisms pursuant to which utilities recover site investigation and remediation costs and possible alternatives. In
November 2012, the NYSPSC adopted an order in which it, among other things, declined to adopt a generic policy requiring sharing such costs between utilities and their customers and indicated that sharing may be appropriate in specific company and
rate case circumstances (for example, to serve as an incentive to a utility that has failed to adequately constrain such costs or, in the context of a multi-year rate plan, where some allocation of earnings in excess of the allowed rate of return
could be used toward payment of such costs). See



14CON EDISON ANNUAL REPORT




“Environmental Matters – CECONY” and “Environmental Matters – O&R,” below, and Note G to the financial statements in Item 8.

Federal Utility Regulation

The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), among other things, regulates the transmission and wholesale sales of electricity in interstate commerce and the transmission and sale of natural gas
for resale in interstate commerce. In addition, the FERC has the authority to impose penalties, which could be substantial, including penalties for the violation of reliability and cyber security rules. Certain activities of the Utilities and the
competitive energy businesses are subject to the jurisdiction of the FERC. The Utilities are subject to regulation by the FERC with respect to electric transmission rates and to regulation by the NYSPSC with respect to electric and gas retail
commodity sales and local delivery service. As a matter of practice, the NYSPSC has approved delivery service rates that include both distribution and transmission costs. In 2013, the NYSPSC approved certain transmission projects for which it
endorsed a different method. See “CECONY – Electric Operations – Electric Supply,” below.

New York Independent System Operator (NYISO)

New York Energy Highway

In October 2012, the Energy Highway Task Force appointed by the Governor of New York issued its Blueprint containing recommendations to modernize New York’s energy systems. The recommended
actions included electric transmission construction and upgrades to electric and natural gas infrastructure.

In November 2012, the
NYSPSC established a proceeding to review specific proposals from utilities and private developers for new electric transmission lines and upgrades to existing facilities that will address transmission congestion between upstate and downstate. In
January 2013, the owners of transmission facilities in New York (including the Utilities), on behalf of the proposed New York transmission company (New York Transco) that is to be owned by their affiliates, submitted a statement of intent to
construct five transmission projects, with an aggregate estimated cost of $1,300 million. The projects, which could be completed in the 2016 to 2019 timeframe, will require authorizations from the NYSPSC (including its determination that the
projects meet public policy goals), the FERC, as well as other federal, state and local agencies. In October 2013, two of these projects, with an aggregate estimated cost of approximately $200 million, were approved by the NYSPSC in a separate
proceeding. See “CECONY – Electric Operations – Electric Supply,” below.

Competition

Competition from suppliers of oil and other sources of energy, including distributed generation (such as solar, fuel cells and
micro-turbines), may provide alternatives for the Utilities’ delivery customers. See “Rate Plans” in Note B and “Recoverable Energy Costs” in Note A to the financial statements in Item 8.



CON EDISON ANNUAL REPORT15




The Utilities do not consider it reasonably likely that another company would be authorized to provide
utility delivery service of electricity, natural gas or steam where the company already provides service. Any such other company would need to obtain NYSPSC consent, satisfy applicable local requirements, install facilities to provide the service,
meet applicable services standards, and charge customers comparable taxes and other fees and costs imposed on the service. A new delivery company would also be subject to extensive ongoing regulation by the NYSPSC. See “Utility Regulation
– State Utility Regulation – Regulators”.

The competitive energy businesses participate in competitive energy supply and
services businesses and energy infrastructure projects that are subject to different risks than those found in the businesses of the Utilities.

The Utilities

CECONY

CECONY, incorporated in New York State in 1884, is a subsidiary of Con Edison and has no significant subsidiaries of its own. Its
principal business segments are its regulated electric, gas and steam businesses.

For a discussion of the company’s operating
revenues and operating income for each segment, see “Results of Operations” in Item 7. For additional information about the segments, see Note N to the financial statements in Item 8.

Electric Operations

Electric Facilities

CECONY’s capitalized
costs for utility plant, net of accumulated depreciation, for distribution facilities were $14,496 million and $13,930 million at December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. For its transmission facilities, the costs for utility plant, net of
accumulated depreciation, were $2,597 million and $2,518 million at December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively, and for its generation facilities, the costs for utility plant, net of accumulated depreciation, were $452 million and $434 million,
at December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively.

Distribution Facilities.CECONY owns 62 area
distribution substations and various distribution facilities located throughout New York City and Westchester County. At December 31, 2013, the company’s distribution system had a transformer capacity of 29,125 MVA, with 36,782 miles of
overhead distribution lines and 97,120 miles of underground distribution lines. The underground distribution lines represent the single longest underground electric delivery system in the United States.

Transmission Facilities.The company’s transmission facilities are located in New York City and Westchester,
Orange, Rockland, Putnam and Dutchess counties in New York State. At December 31, 2013, CECONY owned or jointly owned 438 miles of overhead circuits operating at 138, 230, 345 and 500 kV and 749 miles of underground circuits operating at 69,
138 and 345 kV. The company’s 39 transmission substations and 62 area stations are supplied by circuits operated at 69 kV and above. In 2013, the NYSPSC approved transmission projects to address, among other things, reliability concerns
associated with the potential closure of the Indian Point Energy Center (which is owned by Entergy Corporation subsidiaries). See “CECONY – Electric Operations – Electric Supply,” below.

CECONY’s transmission facilities interconnect with those of National Grid, Central Hudson Gas & Electric Corporation, O&R, New
York State Electric & Gas (NYSEG), Connecticut Light & Power Company, Long Island Power Authority, NYPA and Public Service Electric and Gas Company.

Generating Facilities.CECONY’s electric generating facilities consist of plants located in Manhattan with an aggregate capacity of 702 MW. The company expects to
have sufficient amounts of gas and fuel oil available in 2014 for use in these facilities.

Electric Sales and Deliveries

CECONY delivers electricity to its full-service customers who purchase electricity from the company. The company also delivers electricity to its
customers who purchase electricity from other suppliers through the company’s retail access plan. In addition, the company delivers electricity to state and municipal customers of NYPA and economic development customers of municipal electric
agencies.



16CON EDISON ANNUAL REPORT




The company charges all customers in its service area for the delivery of electricity. The company
generally recovers, on a current basis, the cost of the electricity that it buys and then sells to its full-service customers. It does not make any margin or profit on the electricity it sells. CECONY’s electric revenues are subject to a
revenue decoupling mechanism. As a result, its electric delivery revenues are generally not affected by changes in delivery volumes from levels assumed when rates were approved. CECONY’s electric sales and deliveries, excluding off-system
sales, for the last five years were:

Item 7. For additional segment information, see Note N to the financial statements in Item 8.

Electric Peak Demand

Electric Supply

Most of the electricity sold by CECONY to its customers in 2013 was purchased under firm power contracts or through the wholesale electricity market administered by the NYISO. Con Edison expects
that these resources will again be adequate to meet the requirements of its customers in 2014. The company plans to meet its continuing obligation to supply electricity to its customers through a combination of electricity purchased under contracts,
purchased through the NYISO’s wholesale electricity market, or generated from its electricity generating facilities. For information about the company’s contracts for approximately 2,849 MW of electric generating capacity, see Notes I and
O to the financial statements in Item 8. To reduce the volatility of its customers’ electric energy costs, the company has contracts to purchase electric energy and enters into derivative transactions to hedge the costs of a portion of its
expected purchases under these contracts and through the NYISO’s wholesale electricity market.



CON EDISON ANNUAL REPORT17




CECONY owns generating stations in New York City associated primarily with its steam system. As of
December 31, 2013, the generating stations had a combined electric capacity of approximately 702 MW, based on 2013 summer test ratings. For information about electric generating capacity owned by the company, see “Electric Operations
– Electric Facilities – Generating Facilities”, above.

In general, the Utilities recover their purchased power costs,
including the cost of hedging purchase prices, pursuant to rate provisions approved by the state public utility regulatory authority having jurisdiction. See “Financial and Commodity Market Risks – Commodity Price Risk,” in
Item 7 and “Recoverable Energy Costs” in Note A to the financial statements in Item 8. From time to time, certain parties have petitioned the NYSPSC to review these provisions, the elimination of which could have a material
adverse effect on the Companies’ financial position, results of operations or liquidity.

In a July 1998 order, the NYSPSC
indicated that it “agree(s) generally that CECONY need not plan on constructing new generation as the competitive market develops,” but considers “overly broad” and did not adopt CECONY’s request for a declaration that,
solely with respect to providing generating capacity, it will no longer be required to engage in long-range planning to meet potential demand and, in particular, that it will no longer have the obligation to construct new generating facilities,
regardless of the market price of capacity. CECONY monitors the adequacy of the electric capacity resources and related developments in its service area, and works with other parties on long-term resource adequacy issues within the framework of the
NYISO. In addition, the NYISO has adopted reliability rules that include obligations on transmission owners (such as CECONY) to construct facilities that may be needed for system reliability if the market does not solve a reliability need identified
by the NYISO. See “NYISO” above.

In 2009, the then Governor of New York announced a new goal of meeting 45 percent of the State’s electricity needs with energy efficiency or
renewable resources by 2015. The goal is to be achieved by reducing electricity consumption by 15 percent, and having 30 percent of the electricity used in New York provided by renewable resources. For information about the Utilities’
participation in New York State’s clean energy programs, see “Environmental Matters – Climate Change,” below.

Gas Operations

Gas Facilities

CECONY’s capitalized
costs for utility plant, net of accumulated depreciation, for gas facilities, which are primarily distribution facilities, were $4,013 million and $3,735 million at December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively.

Natural gas is delivered by pipeline to CECONY at various points in its service territory and is distributed to customers by the company through an
estimated 4,307 miles of mains and 367,555 service lines. The company owns a natural gas liquefaction facility and storage tank at its Astoria property in Queens, New York. The plant can store approximately 1,000 mdths of which a maximum of about
250 mdths can be withdrawn per day. The company has about 1,226 mdths of additional natural gas storage capacity at a field in upstate New York, owned and operated by Honeoye Storage Corporation, a corporation 28.8 percent owned by CECONY and 71.2
percent owned by Con Edison Development.

Gas Sales and Deliveries

The company generally recovers the cost of the gas that it buys and then sells to its firm sales customers. It does not make any margin or profit on
the gas it sells. CECONY’s gas revenues are subject to a weather normalization clause and a revenue decoupling mechanism. As a result, its gas delivery revenues are generally not affected by changes in delivery volumes from levels assumed when
rates were approved.

Gas Peak Demand

The gas peak demand for firm
service customers in CECONY’s service area occurs during the winter heating season. The daily peak day demand during the winter 2013/2014 (through January 31, 2014) occurred on January 7, 2014 when the demand reached 1,104 mdths. The
2013/2014 peak demand included 574 mdths for CECONY’s full-service customers and 530 mdths for customers participating in its gas retail access program. “Design weather” for the gas system is a standard to which the actual peak demand
is adjusted for evaluation and planning purposes. The company estimates that, under design weather conditions, the 2014/2015 service area peak demand will be 1,340 mdths, including an estimated 699 mdths for its full-service customers and 641 mdths
for its retail access customers. The company forecasts average annual growth of the peak gas demand over the next five years at design conditions to be approximately 3.8 percent in its service area. The forecasted peak demand at design conditions
does not include gas used by interruptible gas customers or in generating stations (electricity and steam).

Gas Supply

CECONY and O&R have combined their gas requirements, and contracts to meet those requirements, into a single
portfolio.



CON EDISON ANNUAL REPORT19




The combined portfolio is administered by, and related management services are provided by, CECONY (for itself and as agent for O&R) and costs are allocated between the Utilities in
accordance with provisions approved by the NYSPSC. See Note S to the financial statements in Item 8.

Charges from suppliers for
the firm purchase of gas, which are based on formulas or indexes or are subject to negotiation, are generally designed to approximate market prices. The gas supply contracts are for various terms extending to 2015. The Utilities have contracts with
interstate pipeline companies for the purchase of firm transportation from upstream points where gas has been purchased to the Utilities’ distribution systems, and for upstream storage services. Charges under these transportation and storage
contracts are approved by the FERC. Such contracts are for various terms extending to 2027. The Utilities are required to pay certain fixed charges under the supply, transportation and storage contracts whether or not the contracted capacity is
actually used. These fixed charges amounted to approximately $270 million in 2013, including $230 million for CECONY. See “Contractual Obligations” below. In addition, the Utilities purchase gas on the spot market and contract for
interruptible gas transportation. See “Recoverable Energy Costs” in Note A to the financial statements in Item 
8.

Steam Operations

Steam Facilities

CECONY’s capitalized
costs for utility plant, net of accumulated depreciation for steam facilities were $1,790 million and $1,674 million at December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively.

CECONY generates steam at one steam-electric generating station and five steam-only generating stations and distributes steam to its customers through approximately 105 miles of transmission,
distribution, and service piping.



Steam Sales and Deliveries

CECONY’s steam sales and deliveries for the last five years were:

For further discussion of the company’s
steam operating revenues and its steam results, see “Results of Operations” in Item 7. For additional segment information, see Note N to the financial statements in Item 8.

Steam Peak Demand and Capacity

Demand for steam in CECONY’s service area peaks during the winter heating season. The one-hour peak demand during the winter of 2013/2014 (through January 31, 2014) occurred on
January 23, 2014 when the demand reached 8.9 MMlbs per hour. The company’s estimate for the winter of 2014/2015 peak demand of its steam customers is 9.3 MMlbs per hour under design criteria, which assumes severe weather.

On December 31, 2013, the steam system had the capability of delivering approximately 11.7 MMlbs of steam per hour, and CECONY estimates that
the system will have the capability to deliver 11.7 MMlbs of steam per hour in the 2014/2015 winter.

Steam Supply

Thirty-six percent of the steam produced by CECONY in 2013 was supplied by the company’s steam-only generating assets; 47 percent was produced by the company’s steam-electric generating
assets, where steam and electricity are primarily cogenerated; and 17 percent was purchased under an agreement with Brooklyn Navy Yard Cogeneration Partners L.P.

O&R

Electric
Operations

Electric Facilities

O&R’s capitalized costs for utility plant, net of accumulated depreciation, for distribution facilities were $781 million and



20CON EDISON ANNUAL REPORT




$728 million at December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. For its transmission facilities, the costs for utility plant, net of accumulated depreciation, were $179 million and $180 million at
December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively.

O&R, RECO and Pike, own, in whole or in part, transmission and distribution
facilities which include 557 circuit miles of transmission lines, 14 transmission substations, 61 distribution substations, 85,986 in-service line transformers, 3,828 pole miles of overhead distribution lines and 1,827 miles of underground
distribution lines. O&R’s transmission system is part of the NYISO system except that portions of RECO’s system are located within the transmission area controlled by PJM.



Electric Sales and Deliveries

O&R generally recovers, on a current basis, the cost of the electricity that it buys and then sells to its full-service
customers. It does not make any margin or profit on the electricity it sells. O&R’s New York electric revenues (which accounted for 74.3 percent of O&R’s electric revenues in 2013) are subject to a revenue decoupling mechanism. As
a result, O&R’s New York electric delivery revenues are generally not affected by changes in delivery volumes from levels assumed when rates were approved. O&R’s electric sales in New Jersey and Pennsylvania are not subject to a
decoupling mechanism. O&R’s electric sales and deliveries, excluding off-system sales for the last five years were:

electric operating revenues and its electric results, see “Results of Operations” in Item 7. For additional segment information, see Note N to the financial statements in Item 8.

Electric Peak Demand

The electric peak demand in O&R’s service area occurs during the summer air conditioning season. O&R’s highest service area peak demand, which occurred in 2006, was 1,617 MW. The
2013 service area peak demand, which occurred on July 18, 2013, was 1,561 MW. The 2013 peak demand included an estimated 702 MW for O&R’s full-service customers and 859 MW for customers participating in its electric retail access
program. The NYISO invoked demand reduction programs on July 18, 2013, as it had on peak demand days in some previous years. “Design weather” for the electric system is a standard to which the actual peak demand is adjusted for
evaluation and planning purposes. Since the majority of demand reduction programs are invoked only in specific circumstances, design conditions do not include these programs’ potential impact. However, the O&R forecasted peak demand at
design conditions does include the impact of permanent demand reduction programs. The company estimates that, under design weather conditions, the 2014 service area peak demand will be 1,630 MW, including an estimated 701 MW for its full-service
customers and 929 MW for its electric retail access customers. The company forecasts average annual growth of the peak electric demand in the company’s service area over the next five years at design conditions to be approximately 0.9 percent
per year.

Electric Supply

The electricity O&R sold to its customers in 2013 was purchased under firm power contracts or through the wholesale electricity markets administered by the NYISO and PJM. The company expects
that these resources will again be adequate to meet the requirements of its customers in 2014. O&R does not own any electric generating capacity.

Gas Operations

Gas Facilities

O&R’s capitalized costs for utility plant, net of accumulated depreciation for gas facilities, which are primarily distribution



CON EDISON ANNUAL REPORT21




facilities, were $456 million and $435 million at December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. O&R and Pike own their gas distribution systems and O&R owns a gas transmission system,
which together include 1,862 miles of mains. Natural gas is delivered to customers by the company through an estimated 104,713 service lines.



Gas Sales and Deliveries

O&R generally recovers the cost of the gas that it buys and then sells to its firm sales customers. It does not make any margin or profit on the gas it sells. O&R’s gas revenues are
subject to a weather normalization clause. Effective November 2009, O&R’s New York gas revenues (which accounted for substantially all of O&R’s gas revenues in 2013) became subject to a revenue decoupling mechanism. As a result,
its gas delivery revenues are generally not affected by changes in delivery volumes from levels assumed when rates were approved. O&R’s gas deliveries and sales for the last five years were:

gas operating revenues and its gas results, see “Results of Operations” in Item 7. For additional segment information, see Note N to the financial statements in Item 8.

Gas Peak Demand

The gas peak demand for firm
service customers in O&R’s service area occurs during the winter heating season. The daily peak day demand during the winter 2013/2014 (through January 31, 2014) occurred on January 7, 2014 when the demand reached 202 mdths. The
2013/2014 peak demand included an estimated 92 mdths for O&R’s full-service customers and 110 mdths for customers participating in its gas retail access program. “Design weather” for the gas system is a standard to which the
actual peak demand is adjusted for evaluation and planning purposes. The company estimates that, under design weather conditions, the 2014/2015 service area peak demand will be 218 mdths, including an estimated 100 mdths for its full-service
customers and 118 mdths for its retail access customers. The company forecasts average annual growth of the peak gas demand over the next five years at design conditions to be approximately 0.7 percent in the



22CON EDISON ANNUAL REPORT




company’s service area. The forecasted peak demand at design conditions does not include gas used by interruptible gas customers or in generating stations.

Gas Supply

O&R and CECONY have combined their gas requirements and purchase contracts to meet those requirements into a single portfolio. See “CECONY – Gas Operations – Gas Supply”
above.

Competitive Energy Businesses

Con Edison pursues competitive energy opportunities through three wholly-owned subsidiaries: Con Edison Solutions, Con Edison Energy and Con Edison Development. These businesses sell to retail
customers electricity purchased in wholesale markets and enter into related hedging transactions, provide energy-related products and services to wholesale and retail customers, and participate in energy infrastructure projects. At December 31,
2013, Con Edison’s equity investment in its competitive energy businesses was $488 million and their assets amounted to $1,314 million.

Con Edison Solutions

Con Edison Solutions primarily
sells electricity to industrial, commercial and governmental customers in the northeastern United States and Texas. It also sells electricity to residential and small commercial customers in the northeastern United States. Con Edison Solutions does
not sell electricity to the Utilities. Con Edison Solutions sells electricity to customers who are provided delivery service by the Utilities. It also provides energy efficiency services, procurement and management services to companies and
governmental entities throughout most of the United States.



Con
Edison Solutions was reported by KEMA, Inc. in September 2013 to be the 10th largest non-residential retail electricity provider in the United States. The company sells to retail aggregation entities in Massachusetts, Illinois, and New Jersey as
well as to individual residential and small commercial (mass market) customers in the northeastern United States. At December 31, 2013, it served approximately 159,000 customers, not including approximately 148,000 served under the four
aggregation agreements. Con Edison Solutions’ electricity sales for the last five years were:

(a)Excludes aggregation agreement customers



Con Edison Solutions seeks to serve customers in utility service territories that encourage retail competition through transparent pricing, purchase
of receivables programs or utility-sponsored customer acquisition programs. The company currently sells electricity in the service territories of 50 utilities in the states of New York, Massachusetts, Connecticut, New Hampshire, Maine, New Jersey,
Delaware, Maryland, Illinois, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Ohio and Texas, as well as the District of Columbia. Approximately 28 percent of the sales volumes were in New York, 28 percent in New England, 35 percent in the District of Columbia,
Maryland, New Jersey and Pennsylvania and 9 percent in Texas.

The electricity Con Edison Solutions sold to its customers in 2013 was
purchased primarily through wholesale electricity markets administered by the NYISO, PJM, Independent System Operator New England and Electric Reliability Council of Texas. The company expects that these resources will again be adequate to meet the
requirements of its customers in 2014. Con Edison Energy provides hedging and risk management services to Con Edison Solutions.

Con
Edison Solutions also provides energy-efficiency services to government and commercial customers. The services include the design and installation of lighting retrofits, high-efficiency heating, ventilating and air conditioning equipment and other
energy saving technologies. The company is compensated for its services based primarily on the increased energy efficiency of the installed equipment over a multi-year period. Con Edison Solutions has won competitive solicitations for energy savings
contracts with the Department of Energy and the Department of Defense, and a shared energy savings contract with the United States Postal Service. The company owns renewable energy projects predominately in Massachusetts and California with an
aggregate capacity of 18 MW (AC).



CON EDISON ANNUAL REPORT23




Con Edison Energy

Con Edison Energy provides services to manage the output, fuel requirements and risk management activities for 12,153 MW of generating plants in the
northeastern United States owned by unrelated parties. Among other things, the company also provides wholesale hedging and risk management services to Con Edison Solutions and Con Edison Development. The company, beginning during 2013, no longer
engages in the sale of electricity to utilities. The company had sold electricity that it had purchased in wholesale markets to utilities in the northeastern United States, primarily under fixed and indexed price contracts, which they used to supply
their full-service customers.

(b)CECONY’s capital expenditures for environmental protection facilities and related studies were $178 million, $194 million and $149 million in 2013, 2012 and
2011, respectively, and are estimated to be $202 million in 2014.

(c)Estimates for 2014-2016 include an aggregate $371 million for transmission projects the NYSPSC approved to address, among other things, reliability concerns
associated with the potential closure of the Indian Point Energy Center. Estimates do not include amounts for the energy efficiency, demand reduction and combined heat and power programs the NYSPSC approved to address these concerns or the other
transmission projects that New York transmission owners, including the Utilities have proposed. See “CECONY – Electric Operations – Electric Supply” and “New York Energy Highway,” above.

(d)For 2012, includes $239 million for the May 2012 redemption of all of its preferred stock and $224.6 million tax-exempt debt which was subject to mandatory tender
by bondholders in November 2012.



The Utilities have
an ongoing need for substantial capital investment in order to meet the growth in demand for electricity and gas, and for electric, gas and steam reliability needs, including programs to strengthen the storm resiliency of their infrastructure. The
estimated capital expenditures for the competitive energy businesses reflect potential investments in renewable generation and energy infrastructure projects and could significantly increase or decrease from the amounts estimated depending on market
conditions and opportunities.



Contractual Obligations

The following table summarizes the Companies’ material obligations at December 31, 2013 to make payments pursuant to
contracts. Long-term debt, capital lease obligations and other long-term liabilities are included on their balance sheets. Operating leases and electricity purchase agreements (for which undiscounted future annual payments are shown) are described

(d)Amounts shown for other purchase obligations, which reflect capital and operations and maintenance costs incurred by the Utilities in running their day-to-day
operations, were derived from the Utilities’ purchasing system as the difference between the amounts authorized and the amounts paid (or vouchered to be paid) for each obligation. For many of these obligations, the Utilities are committed to
purchase less than the amount authorized. Payments for the “Other Purchase Obligations” are generally assumed to be made ratably over the term of the obligations. The Utilities believe that unreasonable effort and expense would be involved
to enable them to report their “Other Purchase Obligations” in a different manner.

(e)Amounts represent commitments to purchase minimum quantities of electric energy and capacity, renewable energy certificates, natural gas, natural gas pipeline
capacity, energy efficiency services and construction services entered into by Con Edison’s competitive energy businesses.



The Companies’ commitments to make payments in addition to these contractual commitments include their other liabilities reflected in their
balance sheets, any funding obligations for their pension and other postretirement benefit plans, financial hedging activities, their collective bargaining agreements and Con Edison’s guarantees of certain obligations of its competitive energy
businesses. See Notes E, F, O and “Guarantees” in Note H to the financial statements in Item 8.

Capital Resources

Con Edison is a holding company that operates only through its subsidiaries and has no material assets other than its interests in
its subsidiaries. Con Edison expects to finance its capital requirements primarily through internally-generated funds and the sale of its securities. The company does not expect to need to issue common equity in 2014. Con Edison’s ability to
make payments on external borrowings and dividends on its common shares depends on receipt of dividends from its subsidiaries or proceeds from the sale of Con Edison’s securities or its interests in its subsidiaries.

For information about restrictions on the payment of dividends by the Utilities and significant debt covenants, see Note C to the financial
statements in Item 8.

For information on the Companies’ commercial paper program and revolving credit agreements with banks,
see Note D to the financial statements in Item 8.

The Utilities finance their operations, capital requirements and payment of
dividends to Con Edison from internally-generated funds (see “Liquidity and Capital Resources – Cash Flows from Operating Activities” in Item 7), contributions of equity capital from Con Edison, if any, and external borrowings.

The Companies expect to meet their 2014 capital requirements, including for maturing securities, through internally-generated funds and
the issuance of between $1,500 million and $2,000 million of long-term debt.

The Companies require access to the capital markets to
fund capital requirements that are substantially in excess of available internally-generated funds. See “Capital Requirements,” above. Each of the Companies believes that it will continue to be able to access capital, although capital
market conditions may affect the timing and cost of the Companies’ financing activities. The Companies monitor the availability and costs of various forms of capital, and will seek to issue Con Edison common stock and other securities when it
is necessary or advantageous to do so. For information about the Companies’ long-term debt and short-term borrowing, see Notes C and D to the financial statements in Item 8.

In 2012, the NYSPSC authorized CECONY, through 2016, to issue up to $3,500 million of debt securities ($700 million of which the company had issued as of December 31, 2013). In 2013, the NYSPSC
authorized O&R, through 2017, to issue up to $305 million of debt securities (none of which the company had issued as of December 31, 2013). The NYSPSC also authorized CECONY and O&R for such periods to issue up to $2,500 million and
$125 million, respectively, of debt securities to refund existing debt securities. At December 31, 2013, the Utilities had not refunded any securities pursuant to this authorization.

Con Edison’s competitive energy businesses have financed their operations and capital requirements primarily with capital contributions and borrowings from Con Edison, internally-generated
funds and external borrowings. In April 2013, a Con Edison Development subsidiary issued $219 million aggregate principal amount of 4.78 percent senior notes secured by the company’s California solar projects.

rated A2, A- and A-, respectively, by Moody’s, S&P and Fitch. The unsecured debt of O&R is rated A3, A- and A-, respectively, by Moody’s, S&P and Fitch. Securities ratings
assigned by rating organizations are expressions of opinion and are not recommendations to buy, sell or hold securities. A securities rating is subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization. Each rating should be
evaluated independently of any other rating.

CECONY has $636 million of tax-exempt debt for which the interest rates are to be
determined pursuant to periodic auctions. Of this amount, $391 million is insured by Ambac Assurance Corporation and $245 million is insured by Syncora Guarantee Inc. (formerly XL Capital Assurance Inc.). Credit rating agencies have withdrawn the
ratings of these insurers. Subsequently, there have not been sufficient bids to determine the interest rates pursuant to auctions, and interest rates have been determined by reference to a variable rate index. The weighted average annual interest
rate on this tax-exempt debt was 0.10 percent on December 31, 2013. The weighted average interest rate was 0.17 percent, 0.29 percent and 0.34 percent for the years 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. Under CECONY’s current electric, gas
and steam rate plans, variations in auction rate debt interest expense are reconciled to the levels set in rates.

Environmental Matters

Climate Change

As indicated by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, emissions of greenhouse gases, including carbon dioxide, are very likely changing the world’s climate.

Climate change could affect customer demand for the Companies’ energy services. The effects of climate change might also include physical
damage to the Companies’ facilities and disruption of their operations due to the impact of more frequent and more extreme weather-related events. In late October 2012, Superstorm Sandy caused extensive damage to the Utilities’ electric
distribution system. Superstorm Sandy interrupted service to approximately 1.4 million of the Utilities’ customers – more than four times the number of customers impacted by the Utilities’ previous worst storm event (Hurricane
Irene in 2011). See “Other Regulatory Matters” in Note B to the financial statements in Item 8.

Based on the most recent
data (2013) published by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Con Edison estimates that its direct greenhouse gas emissions constitute less than 0.1 percent of the nation’s greenhouse gas emissions. Con Edison’s estimated
emissions of greenhouse gases during the past five years were:



(metric tons, in millions(a))20092010201120122013CO2equivalent emissions3.73.83.43.33.4



(a)Emissions, as previously reported in tons (instead of metric tons), were 4.2, 4.3, 3.7 and 3.6 for the years 2009 to 2012, respectively. Estimated emissions for
2013, which are subject to third-party verification, expressed in tons were 3.7.

Con Edison’s 44 percent decrease in
direct greenhouse gas emissions since 2005 (6.0 million metric tons) reflects the emission reductions resulting from equipment and repair projects, including projects to reduce sulfur hexafluoride emissions, and increased use of natural gas at
CECONY’s steam production facilities.

CECONY has participated for several years in voluntary initiatives with the EPA to reduce
its methane and sulfur hexafluoride emissions. The Utilities reduce methane emissions from the operation of their gas distribution systems through pipe maintenance and replacement programs, by operating system components at lower pressure, and by
introducing new technologies. The Utilities reduce emissions of sulfur hexafluoride, which is used for arc suppression in substation circuit breakers and switches, by using improved technologies to locate and repair leaks, and by replacing older
equipment. The Utilities also actively promote the use of energy efficiency and renewable generation to further reduce their customers’ greenhouse gas emissions.

NYSERDA and New York utilities are responsible for implementing the Energy Efficiency Portfolio Standard (EEPS) established by the NYSPSC through energy efficiency, targeted demand-side management
and demand-response programs. The Utilities billed customers EEPS surcharges of approximately $100 million and $90 million in 2013 and 2012, respectively, to fund these programs. Through the Utilities’ energy-efficiency programs, end-use
customers reduced their annual energy use by approximately 585,000 MWh and 750,000 dths from the programs’ inception in 2009 through 2013, resulting in their avoiding their release of approximately 247,000 tons of greenhouse gases into the
atmosphere every year. CECONY’s targeted demand-side management programs assisted customers in reducing their annual energy use by approximately 281,000 MWh from the programs’ inception in 2004 through 2013, resulting in their avoiding
their release of approximately 99,000 tons of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere every year.

Emissions are also avoided through the
development of renewable generation. NYSERDA is responsible for implementing the renewable portfolio standard (RPS) established by the NYSPSC. For large renewable resources, NYSERDA enters into long-term agreements with developers, and pays the
developers renewable premiums based on the facilities’ energy output. Large renewable resources are grid-connected and sell their energy output in the wholesale energy market administered by the NYISO. As a result of the Utilities’
participation in the NYISO wholesale markets, a portion of the Utilities’ NYISO energy purchases are sourced from renewable resources. For customer-sited resources, NYSERDA provides rebates when customers install eligible renewable
technologies. The energy produced by customer-sited renewables offsets the energy which the Utilities would otherwise have procured, thereby reducing the overall level of non-renewable energy consumed.



CON EDISON ANNUAL REPORT27




The Utilities billed customers RPS surcharges of $109 million and $92 million in 2013 and 2012, respectively, (and approximately $365 million cumulatively from 2006) to fund these NYSERDA
programs. In 2013, NYSERDA reported that the environmental benefits of having electricity generated by renewable generation from 2006 through 2012, as opposed to the State’s “system-mix,” amounts to approximately 4,028 tons of
nitrogen oxides, 8,853 tons of sulfur dioxides, and 4.1 million tons of carbon dioxide in reduced emissions over this time period.

Beginning in 2009, CECONY is subject to carbon dioxide emissions regulations established by New York State under the Regional Greenhouse Gas
Initiative (RGGI). The Initiative, a cooperative effort by Northeastern and Mid-Atlantic states, established a decreasing cap on carbon dioxide emissions resulting from the generation of electricity to a level fifteen percent below the
Initiative’s baseline by 2020. Under the Initiative, affected electric generators are required to obtain emission allowances to cover their carbon dioxide emissions, available primarily through auctions administered by participating states or a
secondary market. CECONY met its requirement of 6.3 million allowances for the first RGGI compliance period (2009—2011) and is managing auction purchases in preparation for complying with the second compliance period (2012—2014). In
February 2013, RGGI released a model rule for adoption by the participating states that includes a 45 percent reduction in the emissions cap for 2014 and further reductions of 2.5 percent each year from 2015 to 2020. New York State adopted the model
rule, and the lower, 91-million ton cap is effective as of January 1, 2014.

The EPA has started regulating greenhouse gas
emissions from major sources, requiring existing sources to report emissions and subjecting certain new sources to emissions limitations. Also, New York State has announced a goal to reduce greenhouse gas emissions 80 percent below 1990 levels by
2050, and New York City plans to reduce greenhouse gas emissions within the City 30 percent below 2005 levels by 2030. The cost to comply with legislation, regulations or initiatives limiting the Companies’ greenhouse gas emissions could be
substantial.

Environmental Sustainability

Con Edison’s sustainability strategy, as it relates to environmental sustainability, provides that the company seeks to reduce its environmental footprint by making effective use of natural
resources and to address the challenges of climate change and its impact on the company’s business. As part of its strategy, the company seeks, among other things, to reduce direct and indirect emissions; enhance the efficiency of its water
use; minimize its impact to natural ecosystems; focus on reducing, reusing, and recycling to minimize consumption; and design its work in consideration of climate forecasts.

CECONY

Superfund

The Federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 and similar state statutes (Superfund) impose joint and
several liability, regardless of fault, upon generators of hazardous substances for investigation costs, remediation costs and environmental damages. The sites as to which CECONY has been asserted to have liability under Superfund include its and
its predecessor companies’ former manufactured gas sites, its multi-purpose Astoria site, its former Flushing Service Center site, the Gowanus Canal site, and other Superfund sites discussed below. There may be additional sites as to which
assertions will be made that the Company has liability. For a further discussion of claims and possible claims against the Company under Superfund, estimated liability accrued for Superfund claims and recovery from customers of site investigation
and remediation costs, see Note G to the financial statements in Item 8 (which information is incorporated herein by reference).

Manufactured Gas Sites

CECONY and its predecessors formerly manufactured gas and maintained storage holders for gas manufactured at sites in New York City and Westchester
County (MGP Sites). Many of these sites have been subdivided and are now owned by parties other than CECONY and have been redeveloped by them for other uses, including schools, residential and commercial developments and hospitals. The New York
State Department of Environmental Conservation (NYSDEC) requires the company to investigate, and if necessary, develop and implement remediation programs for the sites, which include 34 manufactured gas plant sites and 17 storage holder sites and
any neighboring areas to which contamination may have migrated.

The information available to CECONY for many of the MGP Sites is
incomplete as to the extent of contamination and scope of the remediation likely to be required. Through the end of 2013, investigations have been started for all 51 MGP Sites, and have been completed at all or portions of 32 of the sites. Coal tar
and/or other manufactured gas production/storage-related environmental contaminants have been detected at 35 sites including locations within Manhattan and other parts of New York City, and in Westchester County. Remediation has been completed at
six sites and portions of nine other sites.

Astoria Site

CECONY is permitted by the NYSDEC to operate a hazardous waste storage facility on property the company owns in the Astoria section of Queens, New York. Portions of the property were formerly the
location of a manufactured gas plant and also have been used or are being used for, among other things, electric generation operations, electric substation operations, the storage of fuel oil and liquefied natural gas, and the maintenance and
storage of electric equipment. As a condition of its NYSDEC



28CON EDISON ANNUAL REPORT




permit, the company is required to investigate the property and, where environmental contamination is found and action is necessary, to conduct corrective action to remediate the contamination.
The company has investigated various sections of the property and is performing additional investigations. The company has submitted to the NYSDEC and the New York State Department of Health reports and in the future will be submitting additional
reports identifying the known areas of contamination. The company estimates that its undiscounted potential liability for the completion of the site investigation and cleanup of the known contamination on the property could range from $152 million
to $451 million.

Flushing Service Center Site

Gowanus Canal

Other Superfund Sites

CECONY is a potentially responsible party (PRP) with respect to other Superfund sites where there are other PRPs and where it is generally not
responsible for managing the site investigation and remediation. Work at these sites is in various stages, with the company participating in PRP groups at some of the sites. Investigation, remediation and monitoring at some of these sites have been,
and are expected to continue to be, conducted over extended periods of time. The company does not believe that it is reasonably likely that monetary sanctions, such as penalties, will be imposed upon it by any governmental authority with respect to
these sites.

The following table lists each of CECONY’s other Superfund sites for which the company anticipates it may have a
liability. The table also shows for each such site, its location, the year in which the company was designated or alleged to be a PRP or to otherwise have responsibilities with respect to the site (shown in the table under “Start”), the
name of the court or agency in which proceedings with respect to the site are pending and CECONY’s estimated percentage of total liability for each site. The company currently estimates that its potential liability for investigation,
remediation, monitoring and environmental damages at each site is $0.2 million or less, with the exception of the Cortese Landfill site for which the estimate is $1 million. Superfund liability is joint and several. The company’s estimate of
its liability for each site was determined pursuant to consent decrees, settlement agreements or otherwise and in light of the financial condition of other PRPs. The company’s actual liability could differ substantially from amounts estimated.

O&R

Superfund

The sites at which O&R has been asserted to have
liability under Superfund include its manufactured gas sites and the Superfund sites discussed below. There may be additional sites as to which assertions will be made that O&R has liability. For a further discussion of claims and possible
claims against O&R under Superfund, see Note G to the financial statements in Item 8 (which information is incorporated herein by reference).

Manufactured Gas Sites

O&R and its predecessors
formerly owned and operated manufactured gas plants at seven sites (O&R MGP Sites) in Orange County and Rockland County, New York. Three of these sites are now owned by parties other than O&R, and have been redeveloped by them for
residential, commercial or industrial uses. The NYSDEC is requiring O&R to develop and implement remediation programs for the O&R MGP Sites including any neighboring areas to which contamination may have migrated.

O&R has completed remedial investigations at all seven O&R MGP Sites and has received NYSDEC’s decision regarding the remedial work to
be performed at five of the sites. Of the five sites, O&R has completed remediation at one site, remediation work is in process at two sites and remedial design is ongoing for the remaining two sites.

Superfund Sites

O&R is a PRP with respect to Superfund sites where there are other PRPs and it is not managing the site investigation and remediation. Work at
these sites is in various stages, with the company participating in PRP groups at some of the sites. Investigation, remediation and monitoring at some of these sites have been, and are expected to continue to be, conducted over extended periods of
time. The company does not believe that it is reasonably likely that monetary sanctions, such as penalties, will be imposed upon it by any governmental authority with respect to these sites.

The following table lists each of these Superfund sites for which the company anticipates it may have liability. The table also shows for each such site, its location, the year in which the company
was designated or alleged to be a PRP or to otherwise have responsibilities with respect to the site (shown in the table under “Start”), the name of the court or agency in which proceedings with respect to the site are pending and
O&R’s estimated percentage of total liability for each site. The company currently estimates that its potential liability for investigation, remediation, monitoring and environmental damages at each site is less than $0.3 million. Superfund
liability is joint and several. The company’s estimate of its anticipated share of the total liability for each site was determined pursuant to consent decrees, settlement agreements or otherwise and in light of the financial condition of other
PRPs. The company’s actual liability could differ substantially from amounts estimated.

Other Federal, State and Local Environmental Provisions

Toxic Substances Control Act

Virtually all electric utilities, including CECONY, own equipment containing PCBs. PCBs are regulated under the Federal Toxic Substances Control Act of 1976.

Water Quality

Under
NYSDEC regulations, the operation of the CECONY generating facilities require permits for water discharges. Regulations that became effective in 2013 require permits for water withdrawals. Conditions to the renewal of such permits may include
limitations on the operations of the permitted facility or requirements to install certain equipment, the cost of which could be substantial. For information about the company’s generating facilities, see “CECONY – Electric Operations
– Electric Facilities” and “Steam Operations – Steam Facilities” above in this Item 1.

Certain
governmental authorities are investigating contamination in the Hudson River and the New York Harbor. These waters run through portions of CECONY’s service area. Governmental authorities could require entities that released hazardous substances
that contaminated these waters to bear the cost of investigation and remediation, which could be substantial.

Air Quality

Under new source review regulations, an owner of a large generating facility, including CECONY’s steam and steam-electric
generating facilities, is required to obtain a permit before making modifications to the facility, other than routine maintenance, repair, or replacement, that increase emissions of pollutants from the facility above specified thresholds. To obtain
a permit, the facility owner could be required to install additional pollution controls or otherwise limit emissions from the facility. The company reviews on an on-going basis its planned modifications to its generating facilities to determine the
potential applicability of new source review and similar regulations. In December 2011, the company filed its proposed plan to comply with revised New York State nitrogen oxides reasonably available control technology regulations (NOx RACT) and is
incorporating the plan provisions into its existing air quality permits as they are renewed. In 2011, the EPA adopted regulations establishing maximum achievable control technology standards for utility and industrial boilers. The regulations apply
to major air emissions sources, including CECONY’s generating facilities. In 2013, CECONY complied with these regulations and the regulations



30CON EDISON ANNUAL REPORT




known as the Clean Air Interstate Rule (CAIR) largely through the modification of certain of its generating facilities which enables the facilities to increase the use of natural gas, decreasing
the use of fuel oil. In 2011, the EPA also adopted additional regulations known as the Cross State Air Pollution Rule (CSAPR), which established a new cap and trade program requiring further reductions in air emissions than CAIR (which CSAPR was to
have replaced). In August 2012, CSAPR was overturned by an appellate court. The EPA subsequently appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, which heard oral arguments in the case in December 2013. CAIR will remain in effect pending further action by the
EPA and the U.S. Supreme Court. For information about the company’s generating facilities, see “CECONY– Electric Operations – Electric Facilities” and “Steam Operations – Steam Facilities” above in this
Item 1. The company is unable to predict the impact on its operations of any regulations that may be adopted to replace CSAPR or the additional costs, which could be substantial, it could incur to comply with any such regulations.

State Anti-Takeover Law

New York State law provides that a “domestic corporation,” such as Con Edison, may not consummate a merger, consolidation or similar transaction with the beneficial owner of a 20 percent
or greater voting stock interest in the corporation, or with an affiliate of the owner, for five years after the acquisition of the voting stock interest, unless the transaction or the acquisition of the voting stock interest was approved by the
corporation’s board of directors prior to the acquisition of the voting stock interest. After the expiration of the five-year period, the transaction may be consummated only pursuant to a stringent “fair price” formula or with the
approval of a majority of the disinterested stockholders.

Employees

Con Edison has no employees other than those of CECONY, O&R and Con Edison’s competitive energy businesses (which at December 31, 2013
had 13,235, 1,114 and 299 employees, respectively). Of the 13,235 CECONY employees and 1,114 O&R employees, 8,200 and 618 were represented by a collective bargaining unit, respectively. The collective bargaining agreement covering most of these
CECONY employees expires in June 2016. Agreements covering other CECONY employees and O&R employees expire in June 2017 and June 2014, respectively.
