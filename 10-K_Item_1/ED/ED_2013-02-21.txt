Utility Regulation

State Utility Regulation

Regulators

The Utilities are subject to
regulation by the New York State Public Service Commission (NYSPSC), which under the New York Public Service Law, is authorized to set the terms of service and the rates the Utilities charge for providing service in New York. It also approves the
issuance of the Utilities’ securities. It exercises jurisdiction over the siting of the Utilities’ electric transmission lines and approves mergers or other business combinations involving New York utilities. In addition, it has the
authority to impose penalties on utilities, which could be substantial, for violating state utility laws and regulations. O&R’s New Jersey subsidiary, RECO, is subject to similar regulation by the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities
(NJBPU). O&R’s Pennsylvania subsidiary, Pike, is subject to similar regulation by the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission (PAPUC). The NYSPSC, together with the NJBPU and the PAPUC, are referred to herein as state utility regulators.

In November 2012, the Governor of New York established a commission to review actions taken by New York utilities relating to
emergency weather events, including Superstorm Sandy and other major storms, and to make recommendations regarding, among other things, the oversight, management and legal framework governing power delivery services in New York. See “Other
Regulatory Matters” in Note B to the financial statements in Item 8. In January 2013, following the issuance of recommendations by the commission, the Governor submitted a bill to the State legislature that, among other things, would
authorize the NYSPSC to (i) levy expanded penalties against utilities; (ii) review, at least every five years, a utility’s capability to provide safe, adequate and reliable service, and order the utility to comply with additional and
more stringent terms of service than existed prior to the review or cause the utility to divest some or all of its utility assets, including franchise territories (based on standards established by the NYSPSC to ensure continuity of service, due
process and fair and just compensation); and (iii) revoke or modify an operating certificate issued to the utility by the NYSPSC (following consideration of certain factors, including public interest and standards deemed necessary by the NYSPSC
to ensure continuity of service, and due process).

Utility Industry Restructuring In New York

In the 1990s, the NYSPSC restructured the electric utility industry in the state. In accordance with NYSPSC orders, the
Utilities sold all of their electric generating facilities other than those that also produce steam for CECONY’s steam business (see Electric Operations – Electric Facilities below) and provided all of their customers the choice to buy
electricity or gas from the Utilities or other suppliers (see Electric Operations – Electric Sales and Deliveries and Gas Operations – Gas Sales and Deliveries below).

Following adoption of NYSPSC industry restructuring, there were several utility mergers as a result of which substantially all of the electric and
gas delivery service in New York State is now provided by one of three investor-owned utility companies – Con Edison, National Grid plc and Iberdrola, S.A. – or one of two state authorities – New York Power Authority (NYPA) or Long
Island Power Authority.

Rate Plans

Investor-owned utilities in the United States provide service to customers according to the terms of tariffs approved by the appropriate state utility regulator. The tariffs include schedules of
rates for service that are designed to permit the utilities to recover from their customers the approved anticipated costs, including capital costs, of providing service to customers as defined by the tariff. The tariffs implement rate plans, that
result from rate orders, settlements, or joint proposals developed during rate proceedings. The utilities’ earnings depend on the rate levels authorized in the rate plans and their ability to operate their businesses in a manner consistent with
their rate plans.

The utilities’ rate plans each cover specified periods, but rates determined pursuant to a plan generally
continue in effect until a new rate plan is approved by the state utility regulator. In New York, either the utility or the NYSPSC can commence a proceeding for a new rate plan, and a new rate plan filed by the utility will take effect automatically
in 11 months unless prior to such time the NYSPSC approves a rate plan.

In each rate proceeding, rates are determined by the state
utility regulator following the submission by the utility of testimony and supporting information, which are subject to review by the staff of the regulator. Other parties with an interest in the proceeding can also review the utility’s
proposal and become involved in the rate case. The review process is overseen by an Administrative Law Judge. After an Administrative Law Judge issues a decision, that generally considers the interests of the utility, the regulatory staff, other
parties, and legal requisites, the regulator will issue a rate order. The utility and the regulator’s staff and interested parties may enter into a settlement agreement or joint proposal prior to the completion of this administrative process,
in which case the agreement would be subject to approval of the regulator.

For each rate plan, the revenues needed to provide the
utility a return on invested capital is determined by multiplying the utilities’ forecasted rate base by the utility’s pre-tax weighted average cost of capital. In general, rate base is the amount of the utility’s net plant, deferred
taxes and working capital. The NYSPSC uses a forecast of rate base for the rate year. The weighted average cost of capital is determined based on the forecasted amounts and costs of long-term debt and customer deposits, the forecasted amount of
common equity and an allowed return on common equity determined by the state utility regulator. The NYSPSC’s current methodology for determining the allowed return on common equity assigns a one-third weight to an estimate determined from a
capital asset pricing model applied to a peer group of utility companies and a two-thirds weight to an estimate



12CON EDISON ANNUAL REPORT




determined from a dividend discount model using stock prices and dividend forecasts for a peer group of utility companies.

Pursuant to the Utilities’ rate plans, there generally can be no change to the charges to customers during the respective terms of the rate plans other than for recovery of the costs incurred
for energy supply and specified adjustments provided for in the rate plans.

Common provisions of the Utilities’ rate plans may
include:

“Recoverable energy cost clauses”that allow the Utilities to recover on a current basis the costs for the
energy they supply with no mark-up to their full-service customers.

“Other cost reconciliations”that reconcile pension
and other postretirement benefit costs, environmental remediation costs, and certain other costs to amounts reflected in delivery rates for such costs. Utilities generally retain the right to petition for recovery or accounting deferral of
extraordinary and material cost increases for items such as major storm events and provision is sometimes made for the utility to retain a share of cost reductions, for example, property tax refunds.

“Revenue decoupling mechanisms”under which actual energy delivery revenues will be compared, on a periodic basis, with the
authorized delivery revenues. The difference is accrued with interest for refund to, or recovery from customers, as applicable.

“Earnings sharing provisions”require the Utilities to defer for customer benefit earnings over specified rates of return on common
equity. There is no symmetric mechanism for earnings below specified rates of return on common equity.

“Negative earnings
adjustments”for failure to meet certain performance standards relating to service, reliability, safety and other matters.



The following table should be read in conjunction with, and is subject to, the more detailed discussion of the Utilities’ rate plans in Note B
to the financial statements in Item 8 (which information is incorporated by reference herein).

CON EDISON ANNUAL REPORT13




In January 2013, CECONY filed a request with the NYSPSC for new electric, gas and steam rate plans.
See Note B to the financial statements (which information is incorporated by reference herein).

Liability for Service Interruptions and Other Non-rate Conditions of Service

The tariff provisions under which CECONY provides electric, gas and steam service limit the company’s liability to pay for damages resulting
from service interruptions to circumstances resulting from its gross negligence or willful misconduct.

CECONY’s tariff for
electric service provides for reimbursement to electric customers for spoilage losses resulting from service interruptions in certain circumstances. In general, the company is obligated to reimburse affected residential and commercial customers for
food spoilage of up to $450 and $9,000, respectively, and reimburse affected residential customers for prescription medicine spoilage losses without limitation on amount per claim. The company’s maximum aggregate liability for such
reimbursement for an incident is $15 million. The company is not required to provide reimbursement to electric customers for outages attributable to generation or transmission system facilities or events beyond its control, such as storms, provided
the company makes reasonable efforts to restore service as soon as practicable.

Generic Proceedings

Federal Utility Regulation

The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), among other things, regulates the transmission and wholesale sales of electricity in interstate
commerce and the transmission and sale of natural gas for resale in interstate commerce. In addition, the FERC has the authority to impose penalties, which could be substantial, including penalties for the violation of reliability and cyber security
rules. Certain activities of the Utilities and the competitive energy businesses are subject to the jurisdiction of the FERC. The Utilities are subject to regulation by the FERC with respect to electric transmission rates and to regulation by the
NYSPSC with respect to electric and gas retail commodity sales and local delivery service. As a matter of practice, the NYSPSC has approved delivery service rates that include both distribution and transmission costs.

New York Independent System Operator (NYISO)

New York Energy Highway

In October 2012, the Energy Highway Task Force appointed by the Governor of New York issued its Blueprint containing recommendations to modernize New York’s energy systems. The recommended
actions included electric transmission construction and upgrades to electric and natural gas infrastructure.

In November 2012, the
NYSPSC established a proceeding to review specific proposals from utilities and private developers



14CON EDISON ANNUAL REPORT




for new electric transmission lines and upgrades to existing facilities that will address transmission congestion between upstate and downstate. In January 2013, the owners of transmission
facilities in New York (including the Utilities), on behalf of the proposed New York Transmission Company that is to be owned by their affiliates, submitted a statement of intent to construct five transmission projects, with an aggregate estimated
cost of $1,300 million. The projects, which could be completed in the 2016 to 2019 timeframe, will require authorizations from the NYSPSC (including its determination that the projects meet public policy goals), the FERC, as well as other federal,
state and local agencies.

Competition

Competition from suppliers of oil and other sources of energy, including distributed generation (such as solar, fuel cells and micro-turbines), may provide alternatives for the Utilities’
delivery customers. See “Rate Agreements” in Note B and “Recoverable Energy Costs” in Note A to the financial statements in Item 8.

The Utilities do not consider it reasonably likely that another company would be authorized to provide utility delivery service of electricity, natural gas or steam where the company already
provides service. Any such other company would need to obtain NYSPSC consent, satisfy applicable local requirements, install facilities to provide the service, meet applicable services standards, and charge customers comparable taxes and other fees
and costs imposed on the service. A new delivery company would also be subject to extensive ongoing regulation by the NYSPSC. See “Utility Regulation – State Utility Regulation – Regulators”.

The competitive energy businesses participate in competitive energy supply and services businesses that are subject to different risks than those
found in the businesses of the Utilities.

The Utilities

CECONY

CECONY, incorporated in New York State in 1884, is a subsidiary of Con Edison and has no significant subsidiaries of its own. Its principal business segments are its regulated electric, gas and
steam businesses.

For a discussion of the company’s operating revenues and operating income for each segment, see “Results of
Operations” in Item 7. For additional information about the segments, see Note N to the financial statements in Item 8.

Electric Operations

Electric Facilities

CECONY’s capitalized costs
for utility plant, net of accumulated depreciation, for distribution facilities were $13,930 million and $13,125 million at December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. For its transmission facilities, the costs for utility plant, net of
accumulated depreciation, were $2,518 million and $2,476 million at December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively, and for its generation facilities, the costs for utility plant, net of accumulated depreciation, were $434 million and $400 million,
at December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively.

Distribution Facilities.CECONY owns 62 area
distribution substations and various distribution facilities located throughout New York City and Westchester County. At December 31, 2012, the company’s distribution system had a transformer capacity of 28,899 MVA, with 36,825 miles of
overhead distribution lines and 96,907 miles of underground distribution lines. The underground distribution lines represent the single longest underground electric delivery system in the United States. In late October 2012, Superstorm Sandy caused
extensive damage to the company’s electric distribution system, See “Other Regulatory Matters” in Note B to the financial statements in Item 8.

Transmission Facilities.    The company’s transmission facilities are located in New York City and Westchester, Orange, Rockland, Putnam and Dutchess counties in New
York State. At December 31, 2012, CECONY owned or jointly owned 438 miles of overhead circuits operating at 138, 230, 345 and 500 kV and 750 miles of underground circuits operating at 69, 138 and 345 kV. The company’s 39 transmission
substations and 62 area stations are supplied by circuits operated at 69 kV and above. In 2011, the company completed and placed in service a 91/2mile transmission line connecting its Sprainbrook substation in Westchester
County with the new Academy substation in upper Manhattan.

CECONY’s transmission facilities interconnect with those of
National Grid, Central Hudson Gas & Electric Corporation, O&R, New York State Electric & Gas, Connecticut Light & Power Company, Long Island Power Authority, NYPA and Public Service Electric and Gas Company.

Generating Facilities.CECONY’s electric generating facilities consist of plants located in
Manhattan with an aggregate capacity of 706 MW. The company expects to have sufficient amounts of gas and fuel oil available in 2013 for use in these facilities.

Electric Sales and Deliveries

CECONY delivers electricity to its full-service customers who purchase electricity from the company. The company also delivers electricity to its
customers who purchase electricity from other suppliers through the company’s retail access plan. In addition, the company delivers electricity to state and municipal customers of NYPA and economic development customers of municipal electric
agencies.



CON EDISON ANNUAL REPORT15




The company charges all customers in its service area for the delivery of electricity. The company
generally recovers, on a current basis, the cost of the electricity that it buys and then sells to its full-service customers. It does not make any margin or profit on the electricity it sells. Effective April 2008, CECONY’s electric revenues
became subject to a revenue decoupling mechanism. As a result, its electric delivery revenues are generally not affected by changes in delivery volumes from levels assumed when rates were approved. CECONY’s electric sales and deliveries,
excluding off-system sales, for the last five years were:

Item 7. For additional segment information, see Note N to the financial statements in Item 8.

Electric Peak Demand

Electric Supply

Most of the electricity sold by CECONY to its customers in 2012 was purchased under firm power contracts or through the wholesale electricity market administered by the NYISO. Con Edison expects
that these resources will again be adequate to meet the requirements of its customers in 2013. The company plans to meet its continuing obligation to supply electricity to its customers through a combination of electricity purchased under contracts,
purchased through the NYISO’s wholesale electricity market, or generated from its electricity generating facilities. For information about the company’s contracts for approximately 2,835 MW of electric generating capacity, see Notes I and
O to the financial statements in Item 8. To reduce the volatility of its customers’ electric energy costs, the company has contracts to purchase electric energy and enters into derivative transactions to hedge the costs of a portion of its
expected purchases under these contracts and through the NYISO’s wholesale electricity market.



16CON EDISON ANNUAL REPORT




CECONY owns generating stations in New York City associated primarily with its steam system. As of
December 31, 2012, the generating stations had a combined electric capacity of approximately 706 MW, based on 2012 summer test ratings. For information about electric generating capacity owned by the company, see “Electric Operations
– Electric Facilities – Generating Facilities”, above.

In general, the Utilities recover their purchased power costs,
including the cost of hedging purchase prices, pursuant to rate provisions approved by the state public utility regulatory authority having jurisdiction. See “Financial and Commodity Market Risks – Commodity Price Risk,” in
Item 7 and “Recoverable Energy Costs” in Note A to the financial statements in Item 8. From time to time, certain parties have petitioned the NYSPSC to review these provisions, the elimination of which could have a material
adverse effect on the Companies’ financial position, results of operations or liquidity.

In a July 1998 order, the NYSPSC
indicated that it “agree(s) generally that CECONY need not plan on constructing new generation as the competitive market develops,” but considers “overly broad” and did not adopt CECONY’s request for a declaration that,
solely with respect to providing generating capacity, it will no longer be required to engage in long-range planning to meet potential demand and, in particular, that it will no longer have the obligation to construct new generating facilities,
regardless of the market price of capacity. CECONY monitors the adequacy of the electric capacity resources and related developments in its service area, and works with other parties on long-term resource adequacy issues within the framework of the
NYISO. In addition, the NYISO has adopted reliability rules that include obligations on transmission owners (such as CECONY) to construct facilities that may be needed for system reliability if the market does not solve a reliability need identified
by the NYISO. See “NYISO” above.

In November 2012, the NYSPSC directed CECONY to work with NYPA to develop a contingency plan
to address reliability concerns associated with the potential closure by the end of 2015 of the nuclear power plants at the Indian Point Energy Center (which is owned by Entergy Corporation subsidiaries). In February 2013, CECONY and NYPA submitted
their plan, which takes into account incremental CECONY energy efficiency and demand management programs. The plan provides for the New York transmission owners, subject to required approvals, to begin developing three proposed transmission projects
for implementation by 2016. These projects, which include two projects included in the statement of intent discussed under “New York Energy Highway” above, subsequently would be transferred to the proposed New York Transmission Company.
The plan also provides for the issuance by NYPA of a request for proposals for generation and transmission projects that could also be in service by 2016. Under the plan, the NYSPSC is to designate which projects are authorized to be implemented.

Gas Operations

Gas Facilities

CECONY’s capitalized
costs for utility plant, net of accumulated depreciation, for gas facilities, which are primarily distribution



CON EDISON ANNUAL REPORT17




facilities, were $3,735 million and $3,455 million at December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively.

Natural gas is delivered by pipeline to CECONY at various points in its service territory and is distributed to customers by the company through an estimated 4,360 miles of mains and 387,881 service
lines. The company owns a natural gas liquefaction facility and storage tank at its Astoria property in Queens, New York. The plant can store approximately 1,000 mdths of which a maximum of about 250 mdths can be withdrawn per day. The company has
about 1,226 mdths of additional natural gas storage capacity at a field in upstate New York, owned and operated by Honeoye Storage Corporation, a corporation 28.8 percent owned by CECONY and 71.2 percent owned by Con Edison Development.

Gas Sales and Deliveries

The company generally recovers the cost of the gas that it buys and then sells to its firm sales customers. It does not make any margin or profit on the gas it sells. CECONY’s gas revenues are
subject to a weather normalization clause and a revenue decoupling mechanism. As a result, its gas delivery revenues are generally not affected by changes in delivery volumes from levels assumed when rates were approved.



CECONY’s gas sales and deliveries for the last five years were:

Gas Peak Demand

The gas peak demand for firm service customers in CECONY’s service area occurs during the winter heating season. The daily peak day demand
during the winter 2012/2013 (through January 31, 2013) occurred on January 24, 2013 when the demand reached 941 mdths. The 2012/2013 winter demand included 621 mdths for CECONY’s full-service customers and 320 mdths for customers
participating in its gas retail access program. “Design weather” for the gas system is a standard to which the actual peak demand is adjusted for evaluation and planning purposes. The company estimates that, under design weather
conditions, the 2013/2014 service area peak demand will be 1,274 mdths, including an estimated 689 mdths for its full-service customers and 585 mdths for its retail access customers. The company forecasts average annual growth of the peak gas demand
over the next five years at design conditions to be approximately 4.3 percent in its service area. The forecasted peak demand at design conditions does not include gas used by interruptible gas customers or in generating stations (electricity and
steam).

Gas Supply

CECONY and O&R have combined their gas requirements, and contracts to meet those requirements, into a single portfolio. The combined portfolio is administered by, and related management services
are provided by, CECONY (for itself and as agent for O&R) and costs are allocated between the Utilities in accordance with provisions approved by the NYSPSC. See Note S to the financial statements in Item 8.

Charges from suppliers for the firm purchase of gas, which are based on formulas or indexes or are subject to negotiation, are generally designed
to approximate market prices. The gas supply contracts are for various terms extending to 2015. The Utilities have contracts with interstate pipeline companies for the purchase of firm transportation from upstream points where gas has been purchased
to the Utilities’ distribution systems, and for upstream storage services. Charges under these transportation and storage contracts are approved by the FERC. Such contracts are for various terms extending to 2027. The Utilities are required to
pay certain fixed charges under the supply, transportation and storage contracts whether or not the contracted capacity is actually used. These fixed charges amounted to approximately $253 million in 2012, including $213 million for CECONY. See
“Contractual Obligations” below. In addition, the Utilities purchase gas on the spot market and contract for interruptible gas transportation. See “Recoverable Energy Costs” in Note A to the financial statements in Item 8.

Steam Operations

Steam Facilities

CECONY’s capitalized
costs for utility plant, net of accumulated depreciation for steam facilities were $1,674 million and $1,651 million at December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively.

CECONY generates steam at one steam-electric generating station and five steam-only generating stations and distributes steam to its customers through approximately 105 miles of transmission,
distribution, and service piping.

Steam Sales and Deliveries

CECONY’s steam sales and deliveries for the last five years were:

steam operating revenues and its steam results, see “Results of Operations” in Item 7. For additional segment information, see Note N to the financial statements in Item 8.

Steam Peak Demand and Capacity

Demand for steam in CECONY’s service area peaks during the winter heating season. The one-hour peak demand during the winter of 2012/2013 (through January 31, 2013) occurred on



CON EDISON ANNUAL REPORT19




January 25, 2013 when the demand reached 8.1 MMlbs per hour. The company’s estimate for the winter of 2013/2014 peak demand of its steam customers is 9.2 MMlbs per hour under design
criteria, which assumes severe weather.

On December 31, 2012, the steam system had the capability of delivering approximately 10.0
MMlbs of steam per hour. This reduction from the prior year’s capability (11.7 MMlbs of steam per hour on December 31, 2011) is due to damage to stations caused by Superstorm Sandy. (For additional information, see “Other Regulatory
Matters” in Note B to the financial statements in Item 8). In January 2013, the steam system was restored to its full capacity. The steam system is expected to have the capability to deliver 11.7 MMlbs of steam per hour for the remainder
of the 2012/2013 winter. CECONY estimates that the system will have the capability to deliver 11.7 MMlbs of steam per hour in the 2013/2014 winter.

Steam Supply

Thirty-six percent of the steam
produced by CECONY in 2012 was supplied by the company’s steam-only generating assets; 49 percent was produced by the company’s steam-electric generating assets, where steam and electricity are primarily cogenerated; and 15 percent was
purchased under an agreement with Brooklyn Navy Yard Cogeneration Partners L.P.

O&R

Electric Operations

Electric Facilities

O&R’s
capitalized costs for utility plant, net of accumulated depreciation, for distribution facilities were $728 million and $680 million at December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. For its transmission facilities, the costs for utility plant, net
of accumulated depreciation, were $180 million and $178 million at December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively.

O&R, RECO and
Pike, own, in whole or in part, transmission and distribution facilities which include 555 circuit miles of transmission lines, 14 transmission substations, 62 distribution substations, 85,474 in-service line transformers, 3,781 pole miles of
overhead distribution lines and 1,794 miles of underground distribution lines. O&R’s transmission system is part of the NYISO system except that portions of RECO’s system are located within the transmission area controlled by PJM. In
late October 2012, Superstorm Sandy caused extensive damage to the company’s electric distribution system, See “Other Regulatory Matters” in Note B to the financial statements in Item 8.



Electric Sales and Deliveries

O&R generally recovers, on a current basis, the cost of the electricity that it buys and then sells to its full-service
customers. It does not make any margin or profit on the electricity it sells. Effective July 2008, O&R’s New York electric revenues (which accounted for 70.7 percent of O&R’s electric revenues in 2012) became subject to a revenue
decoupling mechanism. As a result, O&R’s New York electric delivery revenues are generally not affected by changes in delivery volumes from levels assumed when rates were approved. O&R’s electric sales in New Jersey and
Pennsylvania are not subject to a decoupling mechanism. O&R’s electric sales and deliveries, excluding off-system sales for the last five years were:

20CON EDISON ANNUAL REPORT




Electric Peak Demand

The electric peak demand in O&R’s service area occurs during the summer air conditioning season. O&R’s highest service area peak
demand, which occurred in 2006, was 1,617 MW. The 2012 service area peak demand, which occurred on July 18, 2012, was 1,508 MW. The 2012 peak demand included an estimated 980 MW for O&R’s full-service customers and 528 MW for customers
participating in its electric retail access program. The NYISO invoked demand reduction programs on July 18, 2012, as it had on peak demand days in some previous years. “Design weather” for the electric system is a standard to which
the actual peak demand is adjusted for evaluation and planning purposes. Since the majority of demand reduction programs are invoked only in specific circumstances, design conditions do not include these programs’ potential impact. However, the
O&R forecasted peak demand at design conditions does include the impact of permanent demand reduction programs. The company estimates that, under design weather conditions, the 2013 service area peak demand will be 1,600 MW, including an
estimated 1,040 MW for its full-service customers and 560 MW for its electric retail access customers. The company forecasts average annual growth of the peak electric demand in the company’s service area over the next five years at design
conditions to be approximately 0.9 percent per year.

Electric Supply

The electricity O&R sold to its customers in 2012 was purchased under firm power contracts or through the wholesale electricity markets
administered by the NYISO and PJM. The company expects that these resources will again be adequate to meet the requirements of its customers in 2013. O&R does not own any electric generating capacity.

Gas Operations

Gas Facilities

O&R’s capitalized
costs for utility plant, net of accumulated depreciation for gas facilities, which are primarily distribution facilities, were $435 million and $403 million at December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. O&R and Pike own their gas
distribution systems, which include 1,777 miles of mains. In addition, O&R owns a gas transmission system, which includes 77 miles of mains.



Gas Sales and Deliveries

O&R generally recovers the cost of the gas that it buys and then sells to its firm sales customers. It does not make any margin or profit on the gas it sells. O&R’s gas revenues are
subject to a weather normalization clause. Effective November 2009, O&R’s New York gas revenues (which accounted for substantially all of O&R’s gas revenues in 2012) became subject to a revenue decoupling mechanism. As a result,
its gas delivery revenues are generally not affected by changes in delivery volumes from levels assumed when rates were approved. O&R’s gas deliveries and sales for the last five years were:

Gas Peak Demand

The gas peak demand for firm
service customers in O&R’s service area occurs during the winter heating season. The daily peak day demand during the winter 2012/2013 (through January 31, 2013) occurred on January 23, 2013 when the demand reached 179 mdths. The
2012/2013 winter demand included an estimated 90 mdths for O&R’s full-service customers and 89 mdths for customers participating in its gas retail access program. “Design weather” for the gas system is a standard to which the
actual peak demand is adjusted for evaluation and planning purposes. The company estimates that, under design weather conditions, the 2013/2014 service area peak demand will be 214 mdths, including an estimated 107 mdths for its full-service
customers and 107 mdths for its retail access customers. The company forecasts average annual growth of the peak gas demand over the next five years at design conditions to be approximately 0.8 percent in the company’s service area. The
forecasted peak demand at design conditions does not include gas used by interruptible gas customers or in generating stations.

CON EDISON ANNUAL REPORT25




The Companies’ commitments to make payments in addition to these contractual commitments include
their other liabilities reflected in their balance sheets, any funding obligations for their pension and other postretirement benefit plans, financial hedging activities, their collective bargaining agreements and Con Edison’s guarantees of
certain obligations of its businesses. See Notes E, F, O and “Guarantees” in Note H to the financial statements in Item 8.

Capital Resources

Con
Edison is a holding company that operates only through its subsidiaries and has no material assets other than its interests in its subsidiaries. Con Edison expects to finance its capital requirements primarily through internally-generated funds and
the sale of its securities. The company does not expect to need to issue additional common equity in 2013. Con Edison’s ability to make payments on its external borrowings and dividends on its common shares is also dependent on its receipt of
dividends from its subsidiaries or proceeds from the sale of its securities or its interests in its subsidiaries.

For information about
restrictions on the payment of dividends by the Utilities and significant debt covenants, see Note C to the financial statements in Item 8.

For information on the Companies’ commercial paper program and revolving credit agreements with banks, see Note D to the financial statements in Item 8.

The Utilities may finance their operations, capital requirements and payment of dividends to Con Edison from internally-generated funds (see
“Liquidity and Capital Resources – Cash Flows from Operating Activities” in Item 7), contributions of equity capital from Con Edison and external borrowings.

The Companies expect to meet their 2013 external financing requirements, including for maturing securities, through the issuance of between $1,000 million and $1,500 million of long-term debt.

The Companies require access to the capital markets to fund capital requirements that are substantially in excess of available
internally-generated funds. See “Capital Requirements,” above. Each of the Companies believes that it will continue to be able to access capital, although capital market conditions may affect the timing of the Companies’ financing
activities. The Companies monitor the availability and costs of various forms of capital, and will seek to issue Con Edison common stock and other securities when it is necessary or advantageous to do so. For information about the Companies’
long-term debt and short-term borrowing, see Notes C and D to the financial statements in Item 8.

In 2012, the NYSPSC authorized
CECONY, through 2016, to issue up to $3,500 million of debt securities and to issue up to $2,500 million of debt securities to refund existing debt securities. At December 31, 2012, CECONY had not issued any securities pursuant to such
authorization. In 2009, the NYSPSC authorized O&R, through 2013, to issue up to $500 million of securities (of which up to $100 million may be preferred stock and up to the entire amount authorized may be debt securities) and to issue up to $389
million of debt securities to refund existing debt securities. At December 31, 2012, O&R had issued $190 million of debt securities pursuant to such authorization.

Con Edison’s competitive energy businesses have financed their operations and capital requirements primarily with capital contributions and borrowings from Con Edison, internally-generated
funds and external borrowings. Con Edison Development is evaluating long-term debt financing for the solar projects it acquired in 2012.

CECONY has $636 million of tax-exempt debt for which the interest rates are to be determined pursuant to periodic auctions. Of this amount, $391 million is insured by Ambac Assurance Corporation and
$245 million is insured by Syncora Guarantee Inc. (formerly XL Capital Assurance Inc.). Credit rating agencies have withdrawn the ratings of these insurers. Subsequently,



26CON EDISON ANNUAL REPORT




there have not been sufficient bids to determine the interest rates pursuant to auctions, and interest rates have been determined by reference to a variable rate index. The weighted average
annual interest rate on this tax-exempt debt was 0.27 percent on December 31, 2012. The weighted average interest rate was 0.29 percent, 0.34 percent and 0.45 percent for the years 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Under CECONY’s current
electric, gas and steam rate plans, variations in auction rate debt interest expense are reconciled to the levels set in rates.

Environmental Matters

Climate Change

As indicated in 2007 by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, emissions of greenhouse gases, including carbon dioxide, are very likely changing the world’s climate.

Climate change could affect customer demand for the Companies’ energy services. The effects of climate change might also include physical
damage to the Companies’ facilities and disruption of their operations due to the impact of more frequent and more extreme weather-related events. In late October 2012, Superstorm Sandy caused extensive damage to the Utilities’ electric
distribution system. Superstorm Sandy interrupted service to approximately 1.4 million of the Utilities’ customers – more than four times the number of customers impacted by the Utilities’ previous worst storm event (Hurricane Irene
in 2011). See “Other Regulatory Matters” in Note B to the financial statements in Item 8.

Based on the most recent data
(2009) published by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Con Edison estimates that its greenhouse gas emissions constitute less than 0.1 percent of the nation’s greenhouse gas emissions. Con Edison’s emissions of greenhouse
gases during the past five years (expressed in terms of millions of tons of carbon dioxide equivalent) were:



20082009201020112012CO2equivalent emissions4.64.24.33.73.6

The 45 percent decrease in Con Edison’s greenhouse gas emissions since 2005 (6.6 million tons) reflects the
emission reductions resulting from equipment and repair projects, including projects to reduce sulfur hexafluoride emissions, and increased use of natural gas at CECONY’s steam production facilities. Emissions from electric generation at the
Con Edison Development electric generating plants, which were sold in 2008, have been removed from the above data set.

The Companies
are working to further reduce greenhouse gas emissions. CECONY has participated for several years in voluntary initiatives with the EPA to reduce its methane and sulfur hexafluoride emissions. The Utilities reduce methane emissions from the
operation of their gas distribution systems through pipe maintenance and replacement programs, by operating system components at lower pressure, and by introducing new technologies. The Utilities reduce emissions of sulfur hexafluoride, which is
used for arc suppression in substation circuit breakers and switches, by using improved technologies to locate and repair leaks, and by replacing older equipment. The Utilities also promote energy efficiency programs for customers that help them
reduce their greenhouse gas emissions.

Beginning in 2009, CECONY is subject to carbon dioxide emissions regulations established by New
York State under the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI). The Initiative, a cooperative effort by Northeastern and Mid-Atlantic states, established a decreasing cap on carbon dioxide emissions resulting from the generation of electricity to a
level ten percent below the Initiative’s baseline by 2018. Under the Initiative, affected electric generators are required to obtain emission allowances to cover their carbon dioxide emissions, available primarily through auctions administered
by participating states or a secondary market. CECONY met its requirement of 6.3 million allowances for the first RGGI compliance period (2009 – 2011). In February 2013, RGGI released a model rule for adoption by the participating
states that includes a 45 percent reduction in the emissions cap for 2014 and further reductions of 2.5 percent each year from 2015 to 2020.

The EPA has started regulating greenhouse gas emissions from major sources, requiring existing sources to report emissions and subjecting certain new sources to emissions limitations. Also, New York
State has announced a goal to reduce greenhouse gas emissions 80 percent below 1990 levels by 2050, and New York City plans to reduce greenhouse gas emissions within the City 30 percent below 2005 levels by 2030. The cost to comply with legislation,
regulations or initiatives limiting the Companies’ greenhouse gas emissions could be substantial.

Environmental Sustainability

Con Edison seeks to improve the environmental sustainability of its businesses. CECONY is piloting smart grid technologies to demonstrate the interoperability of distributed generation and the
exchange of information between customers and utilities. The smart grid will give customers the tools to be smarter consumers of energy and will allow the utility to identify and isolate problems more quickly. The company recycles clean
non-hazardous waste materials in more than a dozen categories and recycled an estimated 50,000 tons of waste in 2012. More than 38 percent of the company’s vehicles now use alternative-energy technology. New environmentally friendly white roofs
are in place at the corporate headquarters and more than 20 other company facilities, and others are underway. A white roof reflects sunlight, lowering indoor temperatures on hot days, which reduces the need to cool the building, resulting in fewer
carbon dioxide emissions.

CECONY

Superfund

The Federal Comprehensive Environmental Response,
Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 and similar state statutes (Superfund) impose joint and several liability, regardless of fault,



CON EDISON ANNUAL REPORT27




upon generators of hazardous substances for investigation costs, remediation costs and environmental damages. The sites as to which CECONY has been asserted to have liability under Superfund
include its and its predecessor companies’ former manufactured gas sites, its multi-purpose Astoria site, its former Flushing Service Center site, the Gowanus Canal site, and other Superfund sites discussed below. There may be additional sites
as to which assertions will be made that the Company has liability. For a further discussion of claims and possible claims against the Company under Superfund, estimated liability accrued for Superfund claims and recovery from customers of site
investigation and remediation costs, see Note G to the financial statements in Item 8 (which information is incorporated herein by reference).

Manufactured Gas Sites

CECONY and its predecessors formerly
manufactured gas and maintained storage holders for gas manufactured at sites in New York City and Westchester County (MGP Sites). Many of these sites have been subdivided and are now owned by parties other than CECONY and have been redeveloped by
them for other uses, including schools, residential and commercial developments and hospitals. The New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (NYSDEC) requires the company to investigate, and if necessary, develop and implement
remediation programs for the sites, which include 34 manufactured gas plant sites and 17 storage holder sites and any neighboring areas to which contamination may have migrated.

The information available to CECONY for many of the MGP Sites is incomplete as to the extent of contamination and scope of the remediation likely to be required. Through the end of 2012,
investigations have been started for all 51 MGP Sites, and have been completed at all or portions of 31 of the sites. Coal tar and/or other manufactured gas production/storage-related environmental contaminants have been detected at 35 MGP Sites,
including locations within Manhattan and other parts of New York City, and in Westchester County. Remediation has been completed at six sites and portions of seven other sites.

Astoria Site

CECONY is permitted by the NYSDEC to operate a hazardous
waste storage facility on property the company owns in the Astoria section of Queens, New York. Portions of the property were formerly the location of a manufactured gas plant and also have been used or are being used for, among other things,
electric generation operations, electric substation operations, the storage of fuel oil and liquefied natural gas, and the maintenance and storage of electric equipment. As a condition of its NYSDEC permit, the company is required to investigate the
property and, where environmental contamination is found and action is necessary, to conduct corrective action to remediate the contamination. The company has investigated various sections of the property and is performing additional investigations.
The company has submitted to the NYSDEC and the New York State Department of Health reports identifying the known areas of contamination. The company estimates that its undiscounted potential liability for the completion of the site investigation
and cleanup of the known contamination on the property will be at least $53 million.

Flushing Service Center Site

Gowanus Canal

In August 2009, CECONY received a notice of potential liability and request for information from the EPA about the operations of the company and its
predecessors at sites adjacent or near the 1.8 mile Gowanus Canal in Brooklyn, New York. The company understands that the EPA also has provided or will provide notices of potential liability and information requests to other parties. In March 2010,
the EPA added the Gowanus Canal to its National Priorities List of Superfund sites. The canal’s adjacent waterfront is primarily commercial and industrial, currently consisting of concrete plants, warehouses, and parking lots, and the canal is
near several residential neighborhoods. In February 2011, the EPA released a report of its remedial investigation that confirmed there was significant contamination in the Gowanus Canal. In December 2011, the EPA released a draft feasibility study
that evaluated remedial alternatives. In December 2012, the EPA released its proposed remedial action plan for the site. The EPA estimated that the cost of assessment and remediation



28CON EDISON ANNUAL REPORT




of hazardous substances in and around the Gowanus Canal will be between $466.7 million and $503.7 million, and indicated that the cost could be significantly higher. CECONY is unable to predict
its exposure to liability with respect to the Gowanus Canal site.

Other Superfund Sites

CECONY is a potentially responsible party (PRP) with respect to other Superfund sites where there are other PRPs and where it is generally not
responsible for managing the site investigation and remediation. Work at these sites is in various stages, with the company participating in PRP groups at some of the sites. Investigation, remediation and monitoring at some of these sites have been,
and are expected to continue to be, conducted over extended periods of time. The company does not believe that it is reasonably likely that monetary sanctions, such as penalties, will be imposed upon it by any governmental authority with respect to
these sites.

The following table lists each of CECONY’s other Superfund sites for which the company anticipates it may have a
liability. The table also shows for each such site, its location, the year in which the company was designated or alleged to be a PRP or to otherwise have responsibilities with respect to the site (shown in the table under “Start”), the
name of the court or agency in which proceedings with respect to the site are pending and CECONY’s estimated percentage of total liability for each site. The company currently estimates that its potential liability for investigation,
remediation, monitoring and environmental damages at each site is less than $0.2 million, with the exception of the Cortese Landfill site, for which the estimate is $1 million, and the Curcio Scrap Metal site, for which the estimate is $0.2 million.
Superfund liability is joint and several. The company’s estimate of its liability for each site was determined pursuant to consent decrees, settlement agreements or otherwise and in light of the financial condition of other PRPs. The
company’s actual liability could differ substantially from amounts estimated.

O&R

Superfund

The sites at which O&R has been asserted to have
liability under Superfund include its manufactured gas sites, its West Nyack site, the Newark Bay site, and other Superfund sites discussed below. There may be additional sites as to which assertions will be made that O&R has liability. For a
further discussion of claims and possible claims against O&R under Superfund, see Note G to the financial statements in Item 8 (which information is incorporated herein by reference).

Manufactured Gas Sites

O&R and its predecessors formerly owned and operated manufactured gas plants at seven sites (O&R MGP Sites) in Orange County and Rockland
County, New York. Three of these sites are now owned by parties other than O&R, and have been redeveloped by them for residential, commercial or industrial uses. The NYSDEC is requiring O&R to develop and implement remediation programs for
the O&R MGP Sites including any neighboring areas to which contamination may have migrated.

O&R has completed remedial
investigations at all seven O&R MGP Sites and has completed the remediation at one of the sites and a portion of another. O&R has received NYSDEC’s decision regarding the remedial work to be performed at three of the sites and a portion
of another. Remedial construction at the Port Jervis MGP site began in July 2012 and the excavation phase of the remedy is expected to be completed by May 2013. Remedial design is ongoing for three of the sites. A feasibility study was completed for
one site in 2012 and is currently being reviewed by NYSDEC. A feasibility study for one site will be completed in 2013.

West
Nyack Site

In 1991, 1994 and 1997, O&R entered into consent orders with the NYSDEC pursuant to which O&R agreed to
conduct a remedial investigation and remediate certain property it owns in West Nyack, New York at which PCBs were discovered. Petroleum contamination related to a leaking underground storage tank was found as well. O&R has completed all
remediation at the site that the NYSDEC has required to date. In 2012, NYSDEC reclassified the West Nyack site to a Class 4 site, meaning that the site has been properly closed but requires continued site management. Annual inspections and
certification of compliance with the Site Management Plan will be required.

Newark Bay

Approximately 300 parties, including O&R (which was served with a third-party complaint in June 2009), were sued as third-party defendants by
Tierra Solutions, Inc. (Tierra) and Maxus Energy Corporation (Maxus), successors to the Occidental Chemical Corporation and Diamond Shamrock Chemical Company. Tierra and Maxus were themselves sued in 2005 by the New Jersey Department of
Environmental Protection and others for removal and cleanup costs, punitive damages, penalties, and economic losses allegedly arising from the dioxin contamination their predecessors’ pesticide/herbicide plant allegedly released to the
“Newark Bay Complex,” a system of



CON EDISON ANNUAL REPORT29




waterways including Newark Bay, the Arthur Kill, the Kill Van Kull, and lower portions of the Passaic and Hackensack Rivers. Tierra and Maxus are seeking equitable contribution from the
third-party defendants for such costs, damages, penalties and losses, which are likely to be substantial. As to O&R, Tierra and Maxus allege that 1975 and 1976 shipments of waste oil by O&R from an electricity generating plant in Haverstraw,
New York to the Borne Chemical Company in Elizabeth, New Jersey was a source of petroleum discharges to the Arthur Kill. Con Edison is unable to predict O&R’s exposure to liability with respect to the Newark Bay Complex.

Other Superfund Sites

O&R is a PRP with respect to other Superfund sites where there are other PRPs and it is not managing the site investigation and remediation.
Work at these sites is in various stages, with the company participating in PRP groups at some of the sites. Investigation, remediation and monitoring at some of these sites have been, and are expected to continue to be, conducted over extended
periods of time. The company does not believe that it is reasonably likely that monetary sanctions, such as penalties, will be imposed upon it by any governmental authority with respect to these sites.

The following table lists each of O&R’s other Superfund sites for which the company anticipates it may have liability. The table also
shows for each such site, its location, the year in which the company was designated or alleged to be a PRP or to otherwise have responsibilities with respect to the site (shown in the table under “Start”), the name of the court or agency
in which proceedings with respect to the site are pending and O&R’s estimated percentage of total liability for each site. The company currently estimates that its potential liability for investigation, remediation, monitoring and
environmental damages at each site is less than $0.3 million. Superfund liability is joint and several. The company’s estimate of its anticipated share of the total liability for each site was determined pursuant to consent decrees, settlement
agreements or otherwise and in light of the financial condition of other PRPs. The company’s actual liability could differ substantially from amounts estimated.

Other Federal, State and Local Environmental Provisions

Toxic Substances Control Act

Virtually all electric utilities, including CECONY, own equipment containing PCBs. PCBs are regulated under the Federal Toxic Substances Control Act of 1976.

Water Quality

Under
NYSDEC regulations, the operation of certain CECONY generating facilities requires permits for water discharges. Regulations that will become effective in 2013 will begin to require permits for water withdrawals. Conditions to the issuance or
renewal of such permits may include limitations on the operations of the permitted facility or requirements to install certain equipment, the cost of which could be substantial. For information about the company’s generating facilities, see
“CECONY – Electric Operations – Electric Facilities” and “Steam Operations – Steam Facilities” above in this Item 1.

Certain governmental authorities are investigating contamination in the Hudson River and the New York Harbor. These waters run through portions of CECONY’s service area. Governmental
authorities could require entities that released hazardous substances that contaminated these waters to bear the cost of investigation and remediation, which could be substantial.

Air Quality



30CON EDISON ANNUAL REPORT






to replace CSAPR or the additional costs, which could be substantial, it could incur to comply with any such regulations.

State Anti-Takeover Law

New York State law provides
that a “domestic corporation,” such as Con Edison, may not consummate a merger, consolidation or similar transaction with the beneficial owner of a 20 percent or greater voting stock interest in the corporation, or with an affiliate of the
owner, for five years after the acquisition of the voting stock interest, unless the transaction or the acquisition of the voting stock interest was approved by the corporation’s board of directors prior to the acquisition of the voting stock
interest. After the expiration of the five-year period, the transaction may be consummated only pursuant to a stringent “fair price” formula or with the approval of a majority of the disinterested stockholders.

Employees

Con Edison has no employees other than those of CECONY, O&R and Con Edison’s competitive energy businesses (which at December 31, 2012 had 13,130, 1,096 and 303 employees,
respectively). Of the 13,130 CECONY employees and 1,096 O&R employees, 8,143 and 622 were represented by a collective bargaining unit, respectively. The collective bargaining agreement covering most of these CECONY employees expires in June
2016. Agreements covering other CECONY employees and O&R employees expire in June 2013 and June 2014, respectively.
