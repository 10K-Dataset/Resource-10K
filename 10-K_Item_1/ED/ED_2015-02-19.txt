Item 1: Business

Overview

Consolidated Edison, Inc. (Con Edison), incorporated in New York State in 1997, is a holding company that owns all of the outstanding common stock
of Consolidated Edison Company of New York, Inc. (CECONY), Orange and Rockland Utilities, Inc. (O&R) and the competitive energy businesses. In addition, in 2014 Con Edison formed Consolidated Edison Transmission LLC (Con Edison Transmission) to
invest in a transmission company. As used in this report, the term the “Companies” refers to Con Edison and CECONY.







Con Edison’s principal business
operations are those of CECONY, O&R and the Competitive Energy Businesses. CECONY’s principal business operations are its regulated electric, gas and steam delivery businesses. O&R’s principal business operations are its regulated
electric and gas delivery businesses. The competitive energy businesses sell electricity to retail customers, provide energy-related products and services, and develop, own and operate renewable and energy infrastructure projects.

Con Edison seeks to provide shareholder value through continued dividend growth, supported by earnings growth in regulated utilities and contracted
assets. The company invests to provide reliable, resilient, safe, and clean energy critical for New York City’s growing economy. The company is an industry leading owner and operator of contracted, large-scale solar generation in the U.S. Con
Edison is a responsible neighbor, helping the communities it serves become more sustainable.

CECONY

Utility Regulation

State Utility Regulation

Regulators

The Utilities are subject to regulation by the NYSPSC, which under the New York Public Service Law, is authorized to set the terms of service and the rates the Utilities charge for providing service in New York. It also approves the
issuance of the Utilities’ securities. It exercises jurisdiction over the siting of the Utilities’ electric transmission lines and approves mergers or other business combinations involving New York utilities. In addition, it has the
authority to impose penalties on utilities, which could be substantial, for violating state utility laws and regulations and its orders. O&R’s New Jersey subsidiary, RECO, is subject to similar regulation by the New Jersey Board of Public
Utilities (NJBPU). O&R’s Pennsylvania subsidiary, Pike, is subject to similar regulation by the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission (PAPUC). The NYSPSC, together with the NJBPU and the PAPUC, are referred to herein as state utility
regulators.

In March 2013, following the issuance of recommendations by a commission established by the Governor of New York and
submission by the Governor of a bill to the State legislature, the New York Public Service Law was amended to, among other things, authorize the NYSPSC to (i) levy expanded penalties against combination gas and electric utilities;
(ii) review, at least every five years, an electric utility’s capability to provide safe, adequate and reliable service, order the utility to comply with additional and more stringent terms of service than existed prior to the review,
assess the continued operation of the utility as the provider of electric service in its service territory and propose, and act upon, such measures as are necessary to ensure safe and adequate service; and (iii) based on findings of repeated
violations of the New York Public Service Law or rules or regulations adopted thereto that demonstrate a failure of a combination gas and electric utility to continue to provide safe and adequate service, revoke or modify an operating certificate
issued to the utility by the NYSPSC (following consideration of certain factors, including public interest and standards deemed necessary by the NYSPSC to ensure continuity of service, and due process).

Electric Utility Industry Restructuring In New York

In the 1990s, the NYSPSC restructured the electric utility industry in the state. In accordance with NYSPSC orders, the Utilities sold all of their
electric generating facilities other than those that also produce steam for CECONY’s steam business (see Electric Operations – Electric Facilities below) and provided all of their customers the choice to buy electricity or gas from the
Utilities or other suppliers (see Electric Operations – Electric Sales and Deliveries and Gas Operations – Gas Sales and Deliveries below). In addition, the Utilities no longer control and operate their electric transmission facilities.
See “New York Independent System Operator (NYISO),” below.

Following industry restructuring, there were several utility
mergers as a result of which substantially all of the electric and gas delivery service in New York State is now provided by one of four investor-owned utility companies – Con Edison, National Grid plc, Iberdrola, S.A. and Fortis Inc. – or
one of two state authorities – New York Power Authority (NYPA) or Long Island Power Authority.

Reforming the Energy Vision
Proceeding

In April 2014, the NYSPSC instituted its Reforming the Energy Vision (REV) proceeding, the goals of which are to
improve electric system efficiency and reliability, encourage renewable energy resources, support distributed energy resources (DER), and empower customer choice. In this proceeding, the NYSPSC is examining the establishment of a Distributed System
Platform (DSP) to manage and coordinate DER, and provide customers with market data and tools to manage their energy use. The NYSPSC also is examining how its regulatory practices should be modified to incent utility practices to promote REV
objectives. The proceeding will follow a two-phased schedule with policy determinations for DSP and related matters expected in early 2015 and for regulatory design and regulatory matters, later in 2015.

In August 2014, the NYSPSC staff issued a straw proposal in the REV proceeding in which it indicated that “[t]he reforms envisioned in this
proceeding are comprehensive and transformative, and the on-going design and pragmatic implementation of them will take years.” The NYSPSC staff recommended, among other things, that:



•The NYSPSC should adopt the basic elements of the REV vision and proceed with implementation as proposed in the straw proposal;



•Existing utilities should serve as DSPs subject to performance reviews;



•Customers and energy service providers should have access to energy usage information to enable customers to assess the economic value of off-peak usage;



•Where utility affiliates participate in DSP markets within the service territory operated by their parent company, appropriate market power protections must be in place; and



•As a transition toward market-based approaches to increase levels of efficiency and renewable energy, utilities should integrate energy efficiency into their regular operations and should take
responsibility for procurement of renewable energy.

In December 2014, the NYSPSC encouraged utilities and third parties
to begin working together to develop potential



12CON EDISON ANNUAL REPORT 2014




demonstration projects that will inform decisions with respect to developing DSP functionalities, measuring customer response to programs and prices associated with REV markets, and determining
the most effective implementation of DER.

The Companies are not able to predict the outcome of the REV proceeding or its impact.

Rate Plans

Investor-owned utilities in the United States provide service to customers according to the terms of tariffs approved by the appropriate state
utility regulator. The tariffs include schedules of rates for service that limit the rates charged by the utilities to amounts that recover from their customers costs approved by the regulator, including capital costs, of providing service to
customers as defined by the tariff. The tariffs implement rate plans adopted by state utility regulators in rate orders issued at the conclusion of rate proceedings. The utilities’ earnings depend on the limits on rates authorized in their rate
plans and their ability to operate their businesses in a manner consistent with such rate plans.

The utilities’ rate plans cover
specified periods, but rates determined pursuant to a plan generally continue in effect until a new rate plan is approved by the state utility regulator. In New York, either the utility or the NYSPSC can commence a proceeding for a new rate
plan, and a new rate plan filed by the utility will generally take effect automatically in approximately 11 months unless prior to such time the NYSPSC approves a rate plan.

In each rate proceeding, rates are determined by the state utility regulator following the submission by the utility of testimony and supporting
information, which are subject to review by the staff of the regulator. Other parties with an interest in the proceeding can also review the utility’s proposal and become involved in the rate proceeding. The review process is overseen by an
Administrative Law Judge. After an Administrative Law Judge issues a recommended decision, that generally considers the interests of the utility, the regulatory staff, other parties, and legal requisites, the regulator will issue a rate order. The
utility and the regulator’s staff and interested parties may enter jointly into a proposed settlement agreement prior to the completion of this administrative process, in which case the agreement could be approved by the regulator with or
without modification.

Pursuant to the Utilities’ rate plans, there generally can be no change to the rates charged to customers during the respective terms of the
rate plans other than specified adjustments provided for in the rate plans.

For information about the Utilities’ rate plans see
Note B to the financial statements in Item 
8 (which information is incorporated by reference herein).

Liability for Service Interruptions and
Other Non-rate Conditions of Service

The tariff provisions under which CECONY provides electric, gas and steam service limit the
company’s liability to pay for damages resulting from service interruptions to circumstances resulting from its gross negligence or willful misconduct.

CECONY’s tariff for electric service also provides for reimbursement to electric customers for spoilage losses resulting from service interruptions in certain circumstances. In general, the company is obligated to reimburse
affected residential and commercial customers for food spoilage of up to $450 and $9,000, respectively, and reimburse affected residential customers for prescription medicine spoilage losses without limitation on amount per claim. The company’s
maximum aggregate liability for such reimbursement for an incident is $15 million. The company is not required to provide reimbursement to electric customers for outages attributable to generation or transmission system facilities or events beyond
its control, such as storms, provided the company makes reasonable efforts to restore service as soon as practicable.

In June 2013, a
commission established by the Governor of New York issued its final report on utility storm preparation and



CON EDISON ANNUAL REPORT 201413




response. The commission made recommendations regarding, among other things, preparation and response to flooding; estimation of customer restoration times; reliability of website outage maps;
coordination with local governments and providers of other utility services; availability and allocation of staffing and other resources (including the utility industry’s mutual aid process); and communications with affected communities and
local officials. The commission’s report also addressed the Long Island Power Authority, energy efficiency programs, utility infrastructure investment and regulatory deficiencies.

In August 2013, the NYSPSC approved emergency response plans submitted by the Utilities, subject to certain modifications. Pursuant to the New York
Public Service Law, as amended in 2013 (see “Regulators,” above), each electric utility is required to submit to the NYSPSC annually a plan for the reasonably prompt restoration of service in the case of widespread outages in the
utility’s service territory due to storms or other events beyond the control of the utility. If, after evidentiary hearings or other investigatory proceedings, the NYSPSC finds that the utility failed to implement its plan reasonably, the
NYSPSC may deny recovery of any part of the service restoration costs caused by such failure.

In November 2013, the NYSPSC adopted
statewide policies pursuant to which the Utilities are required to provide credits to customers who are without electric service for more than three days; adjust rate plan revenue targets so the credits would not be recovered pursuant to revenue
decoupling mechanisms; and temporarily suspend collection-related activities and service terminations for such customers (or, if the NYSPSC determines, to all residential customers in a designated area and certain other customers). The credit to a
customer would equal the portion of the monthly customer charge attributable to the period the customer was without service. If an extraordinary event occurs, the NYSPSC may direct New York gas utilities to implement the same policies.

In December 2013, the NYSPSC approved a scorecard for use as a guide in assessing electric utility performance in restoring electric service during
outages that result from a major storm event, to assist in holding the utilities accountable to certain performance levels, and to guide utilities as to the NYSPSC’s expectations for their restoration efforts. The order indicated that the
scorecard, which could also be applied by the NYSPSC for other outages or actions, was developed to work with the penalty and emergency response plan provisions of the New York Public Service Law, as amended in 2013 (see “Regulators,”
above). The scorecard includes performance metrics in categories for preparation, operations response and communications. Within 30 days of the completion of customer restoration, electric utilities are required to provide data for the scorecard.
The NYSPSC staff would use the data to assess performance against the metrics and determine a score for each such event for each electric utility.

Generic Proceedings

The NYSPSC from time to time conducts “generic”
proceedings to consider issues relating to all electric and gas utilities operating in New York State. Pending proceedings include the REV proceeding, discussed above, and proceedings relating to utilities exiting the service of selling electric
energy and gas at retail (including an examination of utilities’ existing responsibility to act as provider of last resort); the utilities’ vision for the “smart grid”; utility staffing levels; and the implementation of energy
efficiency and renewable energy programs and consumer protections. The Utilities are typically active participants in such proceedings.

Federal Utility Regulation

The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), among other things, regulates the transmission and wholesale sales of electricity in interstate
commerce and the transmission and sale of natural gas for resale in interstate commerce. In addition, the FERC has the authority to impose penalties, which could be substantial, including penalties for the violation of reliability and cyber security
rules. Certain activities of the Utilities and the competitive energy businesses are subject to the jurisdiction of the FERC. The Utilities are subject to regulation by the FERC with respect to electric transmission rates and to regulation by the
NYSPSC with respect to electric and gas retail commodity sales and local delivery service. As a matter of practice, the NYSPSC has approved delivery service rates that include both distribution and transmission costs. FERC approval is being sought
to recover costs for certain transmission projects. See “Con Edison Transmission,” below

New
York Independent System Operator (NYISO)

The NYISO is a not-for-profit organization that controls and operates most of the electric
transmission facilities in New York State, including those of the Utilities, as an integrated system and administers wholesale markets for electricity in New York State. In addition to operating the state’s high voltage grid, the NYISO
administers the energy, ancillary services and capacity markets. The New York State Reliability Council (NYSRC) promulgates reliability standards subject to FERC oversight. Pursuant to a requirement that is set annually by the NYSRC, the NYISO
requires that entities supplying electricity to customers in New York State have generating capacity (owned, procured through the NYISO capacity markets or contracted for) in an amount equal to the peak demand of their customers plus the applicable
reserve margin. In addition, the NYISO has determined that entities that serve customers in New York City must have enough capacity that is electrically located in New York City to cover a substantial percentage (currently 85 percent; 83.5
percent effective May 2015) of the peak demands of their New York City customers. These



14CON EDISON ANNUAL REPORT 2014




requirements apply both to regulated utilities such as CECONY and O&R for the customers they supply under regulated tariffs and to companies such as Con Edison Solutions that supply customers
on market terms. To address the possibility of a disruption due to the unavailability of gas, generating units located in New York City that are capable of using either gas or oil as fuel may be required to use oil as fuel for certain periods and
new generating units are required to have dual fuel capability. RECO, O&R’s New Jersey subsidiary, provides electric service in an area that has a different independent system operator – PJM Interconnection LLC (PJM). See “CECONY
– Electric Operations – Electric Supply” and “O&R – Electric Operations – Electric Supply,” below.

New York Energy Highway

In October 2012, the Energy Highway Task Force appointed by
the Governor of New York issued its Blueprint containing recommendations to modernize New York’s energy systems. The recommended actions included electric transmission construction and upgrades to electric and natural gas infrastructure. In
November 2012, the NYSPSC established a proceeding to review specific proposals from utilities and private developers for new electric transmission lines and upgrades to existing facilities that will address transmission congestion between upstate
and downstate. See “Con Edison Transmission,” below.

Competition

Distributed generation, such as solar energy production facilities, fuel cells and micro-turbines, provide alternative sources of energy for the
Utilities’ electric delivery customers, as does oil for the Utilities’ gas delivery customers. Other distributed energy resources, such as demand reduction and energy efficiency programs, also provide alternatives for the Utilities’
delivery customers. In its ongoing REV proceeding, the NYSPSC is considering the extent to which New York electric distribution utilities and their affiliates will be permitted to compete with other providers of distributed energy resources. See
“Reforming the Energy Vision Proceeding” above. At December 31, 2014, there were 4,200 and 1,953 distributed generation projects interconnected with CECONY and O&R, respectively, with aggregate capacities as shown on the following
table:

The Utilities do not consider it reasonably
likely that another company would be authorized to provide utility delivery service of electricity, natural gas or steam where the company already provides service. Any such other company would need to obtain NYSPSC consent, satisfy applicable local
requirements, install facilities to provide the service, meet applicable services standards, and charge customers comparable taxes and other fees and costs imposed on the service. A new delivery company would also be subject to extensive ongoing
regulation by the NYSPSC. See “Utility Regulation – State Utility Regulation – Regulators”.

The competitive energy
businesses participate in competitive energy supply and services businesses and renewable and energy infrastructure projects that are subject to different risks than those found in the businesses of the Utilities.

The Utilities

CECONY

CECONY, incorporated in New York State in 1884, is a subsidiary of Con Edison
and has no significant subsidiaries of its own. Its principal business segments are its regulated electric, gas and steam businesses.

For a discussion of the company’s operating revenues and operating income for each segment, see “Results of Operations” in
Item 7. For additional information about the segments, see Note N to the financial statements in Item 
8.

Electric Operations

Electric Facilities

CECONY’s capitalized costs for utility plant, net of accumulated depreciation, for distribution facilities were $15,531 million and $14,496
million at December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. For its transmission facilities, the costs for utility plant, net of accumulated depreciation, were $2,744 million and $2,597 million at December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively,
and for its portion of the steam-electric generation facilities, the costs for utility plant, net of accumulated depreciation, were $451 million and $452 million, at December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.



CON EDISON ANNUAL REPORT 201415




Distribution Facilities.CECONY owns 62 area distribution substations
and various distribution facilities located throughout New York City and Westchester County. At December 31, 2014, the company’s distribution system had a transformer capacity of 29,474 MVA, with 36,934 miles of overhead distribution lines
and 98,327 miles of underground distribution lines. The underground distribution lines represent the single longest underground electric delivery system in the United States.

Transmission Facilities.The company’s transmission facilities are located in New York City and Westchester,
Orange, Rockland, Putnam and Dutchess counties in New York State. At December 31, 2014, CECONY owned or jointly owned 438 miles of overhead circuits operating at 138, 230, 345 and 500 kV and 749 miles of underground circuits operating at
69, 138 and 345 kV. The company’s 39 transmission substations and 62 area stations are supplied by circuits operated at 69 kV and above. In 2013, the NYSPSC approved transmission projects to address, among other things, reliability
concerns associated with the potential closure of the Indian Point Energy Center (which is owned by Entergy Corporation subsidiaries). See “CECONY – Electric Operations – Electric Supply” and “Con Edison
Transmission,” below.

CECONY’s transmission facilities interconnect with those of National Grid, Central Hudson
Gas & Electric Corporation, O&R, New York State Electric & Gas (NYSEG), Connecticut Light & Power Company, Long Island Power Authority, NYPA and Public Service Electric and Gas Company.

Generating Facilities.CECONY’s electric generating facilities consist of plants located in Manhattan with an
aggregate capacity of 705 MW. The company expects to have sufficient amounts of gas and fuel oil available in 2015 for use in these facilities.

Electric Sales and Deliveries

CECONY delivers electricity to its full-service
customers who purchase electricity from the company. The company also delivers electricity to its customers who choose to purchase electricity from other energy suppliers (energy choice program). In addition, the company delivers electricity to
state and municipal customers of NYPA and economic development customers of municipal electric agencies.



The company charges all customers in its service area for the delivery of electricity. The company generally recovers, on a current basis, the cost
of the electricity that it buys and then sells to its full-service customers. It does not make any margin or profit on the electricity it sells. CECONY’s electric revenues are subject to a revenue decoupling mechanism. As a result, its electric
delivery revenues are generally not affected by changes in delivery volumes from levels assumed when rates were approved. CECONY’s electric sales and deliveries for the last five years were:

see “Results of Operations” in Item 7. For additional segment information, see Note N to the financial statements in Item 8.

Electric Peak Demand

The electric peak demand in CECONY’s service area
generally occurs during the summer air conditioning season. The weather during the summer of 2014 was cooler than design conditions. CECONY’s 2014 service area peak demand was 12,198 MW, which occurred on September 2, 2014. The 2014 peak
demand included an estimated 4,937 MW for CECONY’s full-service customers, 5,435 MW for customers participating in its electric energy choice program and 1,825 MW for NYPA’s electric commodity customers and municipal electric agency
customers. “Design weather” for the electric system is a standard to which the actual peak demand is adjusted for evaluation and planning purposes. Since the NYISO can invoke demand reduction programs under specific circumstances, design
conditions do not include these programs’ potential impact. However, the CECONY forecasted peak demand at design conditions does include the impact of other demand reduction programs. The company estimates that, under design weather conditions,
the 2015 service area peak demand will be 13,775 MW, including an estimated 5,750 MW for its full-service customers, 5,960 MW for its electric energy choice customers and 2,065 MW for NYPA’s customers and municipal electric agency customers.
The company forecasts average annual growth in electric peak demand in its service area at design conditions over the next five years to be approximately 0.9 percent per year.

Electric Supply

Most of the electricity sold by CECONY to its full-service customers in 2014 was purchased under firm power contracts or through the wholesale
electricity market administered by the NYISO. The company expects that these resources will again be adequate to meet the requirements of its customers in 2015. The company plans to meet its continuing obligation to supply electricity to its
customers through a combination of electricity purchased under contracts, purchased through the NYISO’s wholesale electricity market, or generated from its electricity generating facilities. For information about the company’s contracts
for approximately 2,029 MW of electric generating capacity, see Notes I and O to the financial statements in Item 8. To reduce the volatility of its customers’ electric energy costs, the company has contracts to purchase electric energy
and enters into derivative transactions to hedge the costs of a portion of its expected purchases under these contracts and through the NYISO’s wholesale electricity market.

CECONY owns generating stations in New York City associated primarily with its steam system. As of December 31, 2014, the generating stations
had a combined electric capacity of approximately 705 MW, based on 2014 summer test ratings. For information about electric generating capacity owned by the company, see “Electric Operations – Electric Facilities – Generating
Facilities”, above.

In general, the Utilities recover their purchased power costs, including the cost of hedging purchase prices,
pursuant to rate provisions approved by the state public utility regulatory authority having jurisdiction. See “Financial and Commodity Market Risks – Commodity Price Risk,” in Item 7 and “Recoverable Energy Costs” in
Note A to the financial statements in Item 8. From time to time, certain parties have petitioned the NYSPSC to review these provisions, the elimination of which could have a material adverse effect on the Companies’ financial position,
results of operations or liquidity.

CECONY monitors the adequacy of the electric capacity resources and related developments in its
service area, and works with other parties on long-term resource adequacy issues within the framework of the NYISO. In addition, the NYISO has adopted reliability rules that include obligations on transmission owners (such as CECONY) to construct
facilities that may be needed for system reliability if the market does not solve a reliability need identified by the NYISO. See “New York Independent System Operator” above. In a July 1998 order, the NYSPSC indicated that it
“agree(s) generally that CECONY need not plan on constructing new generation as the competitive market develops,” but considers “overly broad” and did not adopt CECONY’s request for a declaration that, solely with respect to
providing generating capacity, it will no longer be required to engage in long-range planning to meet potential demand and, in particular, that it will no longer have the obligation to construct new generating facilities, regardless of the market
price of capacity.

In November 2012, the NYSPSC directed CECONY to work with NYPA to develop a contingency plan to address reliability
concerns associated with the potential closure by the end of 2015 of the nuclear power plants at the Indian Point Energy Center (which is owned by Entergy Corporation subsidiaries). In February 2013, CECONY and NYPA submitted their plan, and, in
October 2013, the NYSPSC approved three transmission projects and several energy efficiency, demand reduction and combined heat and power programs to address concerns associated with the potential closure. The transmission projects, which also
address transmission congestion between upstate and downstate and make available more generation from Staten Island, are scheduled to be placed into service by 2016. See “Con Edison Transmission” below.

In February 2014, CECONY submitted to the NYSPSC the implementation plan for the energy efficiency, demand reduction and combined heat and power
programs, which are



CON EDISON ANNUAL REPORT 201417




estimated to cost up to $285 million. In April 2014, the NYSPSC authorized CECONY to recover its program costs, the majority of which are expected to be incurred from 2014 through 2016, over a
ten-year period through a surcharge billed to its electric delivery customers.

In 2009, the then Governor of New York announced a new
goal of meeting 45 percent of the State’s electricity needs with energy efficiency or renewable resources by 2015. The goal is to be achieved by reducing electricity consumption by 15 percent, and having 30 percent of the electricity used
in New York provided by renewable resources. The New York State Energy Research and Development Authority (NYSERDA) reported that as of the second quarter of 2014, the State had achieved 91 percent of its natural gas efficiency goal and
77 percent of its electric efficiency goal and that the State is unlikely to achieve the 30 percent renewable electricity goal. In March 2014, NYSERDA reported as of the fourth quarter of 2013 it had achieved 49 percent of its renewable
electricity goal, and expects to achieve 86 percent or less of the 30 percent renewable electricity goal by the end of 2015. For information about the Utilities’ participation in New York State’s clean energy programs, see
“Environmental Matters – Climate Change,” below.

Gas Operations

Gas Facilities

CECONY’s capitalized costs for utility plant, net of accumulated depreciation, for gas facilities, which are primarily distribution facilities, were $4,530 million and $4,013 million at December 31, 2014 and 2013,
respectively.

Natural gas is delivered by pipeline to CECONY at various points in or near its service territory and is distributed to
customers by the company through an estimated 4,330 miles of mains and 369,339 service lines. The company owns a natural gas liquefaction facility and storage tank at its Astoria property in Queens, New York. The plant can store 1,062 MDt of which a
maximum of about 250 MDt can be withdrawn per day. The company has about 1,226 MDt of additional natural gas storage capacity at a field in upstate New York, owned and operated by Honeoye Storage Corporation, a corporation 28.8 percent owned by
CECONY and 71.2 percent owned by Con Edison Development.



Gas Sales and Deliveries

The company generally recovers the cost of the gas that it buys and then sells to its full-service customers. It does not make any margin or profit

Gas Peak Demand

The gas peak demand for firm sales customers in CECONY’s service area occurs during the winter heating season. The peak day demand during the
winter 2014/2015 (through February 2, 2015) occurred on January 7, 2015 when the demand reached 1,118 MDt. The 2014/2015 peak demand included 574 MDt for CECONY’s full-service customers and 544 MDt for customers participating in its
gas energy choice program. “Design weather” for the gas system is a standard to which the actual peak demand is adjusted for evaluation and planning purposes. The company estimates that, under design weather conditions, the 2015/2016
service area peak demand will be 1,408 MDt, including an estimated 729 MDt for its full-service customers and 679 MDt for its gas energy choice customers. The company forecasts average annual growth of the peak gas demand over the next five years at
design conditions to be approximately 2.8 percent in its service area. The forecasted peak demand at design conditions does not include gas used by interruptible gas customers including generating stations (electricity and steam).

Gas Supply

CECONY and O&R have combined their gas requirements, and contracts to meet those requirements, into a single portfolio. The combined portfolio is administered by, and related management services are provided by, CECONY (for
itself and as agent for O&R) and costs are allocated between the Utilities in accordance with provisions approved by the NYSPSC. See Note S to the financial statements in Item 8.

Charges from suppliers for the firm purchase of gas, which are based on formulas or indexes or are subject to negotiation, are generally designed
to approximate market prices. The gas supply contracts are for various terms extending to 2016. The Utilities have contracts with interstate pipeline companies for the purchase of firm transportation from upstream points where gas has been purchased
to the Utilities’ distribution systems, and for upstream storage services. Charges under these transportation and storage contracts are approved by the FERC. Such contracts are for various terms extending to 2027. The Utilities are required to
pay certain fixed charges under the supply, transportation and storage contracts whether or not the contracted capacity is actually used. These fixed charges amounted to approximately $286 million in 2014, including $246 million for CECONY. See
“Contractual Obligations” below. In addition, the Utilities purchase gas on the spot market and contract for interruptible gas transportation. See “Recoverable Energy Costs” in Note A to the financial statements in Item 8.

Steam Operations

Steam Facilities

CECONY’s capitalized costs for utility plant, net of accumulated depreciation, for its portion of the steam-electric generation facilities were
$1,795 million and $1,790 million at December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.

CECONY generates steam at one steam-electric
generating station and five steam-only generating stations and distributes steam to its customers through approximately 105 miles of transmission, distribution, and service piping.

steam operating revenues and its steam results, see “Results of Operations” in Item 7. For additional segment information, see Note N to the financial statements in Item 8.

Steam Peak Demand and Capacity

Demand for steam in CECONY’s service area peaks during the winter heating season. The one-hour peak demand during the winter of 2014/2015
(through February 2, 2015) occurred on January 8, 2015 when the demand reached 8.4 MMlb per hour. “Design weather” for the steam system is a standard to which the actual peak demand is adjusted for evaluation and planning
purposes. The company’s estimate for the winter of 2015/2016 peak demand of its steam customers is about 9.0 MMlb per hour under design conditions. The company forecasts average annual decrease in steam peak demand in its service area at design
conditions over the next five years to be approximately 0.8 percent.

On December 31, 2014, the steam system was capable of
delivering approximately 11.6 MMlb of steam per hour, and CECONY estimates that the system will have the same capability in the 2015/2016 winter.

Steam Supply

Forty-two percent of the steam produced by CECONY in 2014 was
supplied by the company’s steam-only generating assets; 41 percent was produced by the company’s steam-electric generating assets, where steam and electricity are primarily cogenerated; and 17 percent was purchased under an agreement with
Brooklyn Navy Yard Cogeneration Partners L.P.

O&R

Electric Operations

Electric Facilities

O&R’s capitalized costs for utility plant, net of accumulated depreciation, for distribution facilities were $830 million and $781 million
at December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. For its transmission facilities, the costs for utility plant, net of accumulated depreciation, were $212 million and $179 million at December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.

O&R, RECO and Pike, own, in whole or in part, transmission and distribution facilities which include 572 circuit miles of transmission lines,
14 transmission substations, 62 distribution substations, 86,379 in-service line transformers, 3,991 pole miles of overhead distribution lines and 1,869 miles of underground distribution lines. O&R’s transmission system is part of the NYISO
system except that portions of RECO’s system are located within the transmission area controlled by PJM.



20CON EDISON ANNUAL REPORT 2014




Electric Sales and Deliveries

O&R delivers electricity to its full-service customers who purchase electricity from the company. The company also delivers electricity to its
customers who purchase electricity from other suppliers through the company’s energy choice program.

The company charges all
customers in its service area for the delivery of electricity. O&R generally recovers, on a current basis, the cost of the electricity that it buys and then sells to its full-service customers. It does not make any margin or profit on the
electricity it sells. O&R’s New York electric revenues (which accounted for 77.2 percent of O&R’s electric revenues in 2014) are subject to a revenue decoupling mechanism. As a result, O&R’s New York electric delivery
revenues are generally not affected by changes in delivery volumes from levels assumed when rates were approved. O&R’s electric sales in New Jersey and Pennsylvania are not subject to a decoupling mechanism. O&R’s electric sales
and deliveries for the last five years were:

For further discussion of the company’s
electric operating revenues and its electric results, see “Results of Operations” in Item 7. For additional segment information, see Note N to the financial statements in Item 8.

Electric Peak Demand

The electric peak demand in O&R’s service area occurs during the summer air conditioning season. The weather during the summer of 2014 was
cooler than design conditions. O&R’s 2014 service area peak demand was 1,370 MW, which occurred on July 2, 2014. The 2014 peak demand included an estimated 697 MW for O&R’s full-service customers and 673 MW for customers
participating in its electric energy choice program. “Design weather” for the electric system is a standard to which the actual peak demand is adjusted for evaluation and planning purposes. Since the NYISO can invoke demand reduction
programs under specific circumstances, design conditions do not include these programs’ potential impact. However, the O&R forecasted peak demand at design conditions does include the impact of permanent demand reduction programs. The
company estimates that, under design weather conditions, the 2015 service area peak demand will be 1,645 MW, including an estimated 819 MW for its full-service customers and 826 MW for its electric energy choice customers. The company forecasts
average annual growth of the peak electric demand in the company’s service area over the next five years at design conditions to be approximately 0.9 percent per year.

Electric Supply

The electricity O&R sold to its full-service customers in 2014 was purchased under firm power contracts or through the wholesale electricity
markets administered by the NYISO and PJM. The company expects that these resources will again be adequate to meet the requirements of its customers in 2015. O&R does not own any electric generating capacity. The company plans to meet its
continuing obligation to supply electricity to its customers through a combination of electricity purchased under contracts or purchased through the NYISO or PJM’s wholesale electricity market. To reduce the volatility of its customers’
electric energy costs, the company has contracts to purchase electric energy and enters into derivative transactions to hedge the costs of a portion of its expected purchases under these contracts and through the NYISO and PJM’s wholesale
electricity market. For information about the company’s contracts, see Note O to the financial statements in Item 8.

In
general, the Utilities recover their purchased power costs, including the cost of hedging purchase prices, pursuant to rate provisions approved by the state public utility regulatory authority having jurisdiction. See “Financial and Commodity
Market Risks – Commodity Price Risk,” in Item 7 and “Recoverable Energy Costs” in Note A to the financial statements in Item 8. From time to time, certain parties have petitioned the NYSPSC to review these provisions,
the elimination of which could have a material adverse effect on the Companies’ financial position, results of operations or liquidity.

Gas Facilities

O&R’s capitalized costs for utility plant, net of accumulated depreciation for gas facilities, which are primarily distribution facilities, were $476 million and $456 million at December 31, 2014 and 2013,
respectively. O&R and Pike own their gas distribution systems and O&R owns a gas transmission system. Natural gas is delivered by pipeline to O&R at various points in or near its service territory and is distributed to customers by the
company through an estimated 1,867 miles of mains and 105,077 service lines.



Gas Sales and Deliveries

O&R generally recovers the cost of the gas that
it buys and then sells to its full-service customers. It does not make any margin or profit on the gas it sells. O&R’s gas revenues are subject to a weather normalization clause. O&R’s New York gas revenues (which accounted for
substantially all of O&R’s gas revenues in 2014) are subject to a revenue decoupling mechanism. As a result, its gas delivery revenues are generally not affected by changes in delivery volumes from levels assumed when rates were approved.

Competitive Energy Businesses

Con Edison Solutions

Con Edison Solutions primarily sells electricity to industrial, commercial and governmental customers in the northeastern United States and Texas. It also sells electricity to residential and small commercial customers in the
northeastern United States. Con Edison Solutions does not sell electricity to the Utilities. Con Edison Solutions does sell electricity to customers who are provided delivery service by the Utilities. It also provides energy efficiency services,
procurement and management services to companies and governmental entities throughout most of the United States.



Con Edison Solutions was reported by DNV GL in September 2014 to be the 14th largest non-residential retail electricity provider in the United
States. The company sells to retail aggregation entities in Massachusetts, Illinois and New Jersey as well as to individual residential and small commercial (mass market) customers in the northeastern United States. At December 31, 2014, it
served approximately 123,000 customers, excluding approximately 154,000 served under the five aggregation agreements. Con Edison Solutions’ electricity sales for the last five years were:

Con Edison Solutions seeks to serve customers in utility service territories that encourage retail competition through transparent pricing, purchase
of receivables programs or utility-sponsored customer acquisition programs. The company currently sells electricity in the service territories of 53 utilities in the states of New York, Massachusetts, Connecticut, New Hampshire, Maine, New Jersey,
Delaware, Maryland, Illinois, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Ohio and Texas, as well as the District of Columbia. In 2014, approximately 29 percent of the sales volumes were in New York, 29 percent in New England, 34 percent in the District of
Columbia, Maryland, New Jersey and Pennsylvania and 8 percent in Texas.

The electricity Con Edison Solutions sold to its customers in
2014 was purchased primarily through wholesale electricity markets administered by the NYISO, PJM, Independent System Operator New England and Electric Reliability Council of Texas. The company expects that these resources will again be adequate to
meet the requirements of its customers in 2015. Con Edison Energy provides hedging and risk management services to Con Edison Solutions.

Con Edison Solutions also provides energy-efficiency services to government and commercial customers. The services include the design and
installation of lighting retrofits, high-efficiency heating, ventilating and air conditioning equipment and other energy saving technologies. The company is compensated for its services based primarily on the increased energy efficiency of the
installed equipment over a multi-year period. Con Edison Solutions has won competitive solicitations for energy savings contracts with the Department of Energy and the Department of Defense, and a shared energy savings contract with the United
States Postal Service. The company owns renewable energy projects predominately in Massachusetts and California with an aggregate capacity of 20 MW (AC).

Con Edison Energy

Con Edison Energy provides services to manage the dispatch, fuel requirements and risk management activities for 5,005 MW of generating plants in the northeastern United States owned by unrelated parties and manages energy supply
assets leased from others. Among other things, the company also provides wholesale hedging and risk management services to Con Edison Solutions and Con Edison Development. The company, beginning during 2013, no longer engages in the sale of
electricity to utilities. The company had sold electricity that it had purchased in wholesale markets to utilities in the northeastern United States, primarily under fixed and indexed price contracts, which they used to supply their full-service
customers.

Con Edison Transmission

In September 2014, Con Edison formed a wholly-owned subsidiary, Con Edison Transmission. In November 2014, Con Edison Transmission, along with
affiliates of certain other New York transmission owners, formed New York Transco LLC (NY Transco). NY Transco’s transmission projects are expected to be developed initially by CECONY and other New York transmission owners and then
sold to NY Transco, a transaction that is subject to authorizations from the NYSPSC and FERC. In December 2014, CECONY, certain other New York transmission owners and NY Transco made filings with the FERC to establish NY Transco’s transmission
rate and authorize the sale of the projects to NY Transco.

NY Transco projects may include three projects ($450 million aggregate
estimated cost) the NYSPSC approved in October 2013 in its proceeding to address potential needs that could arise should the Indian Point Energy Center (which is owned by Entergy Corporation subsidiaries) no longer be able to operate. These
projects, which are scheduled to be placed into service by Summer 2016, include two projects ($383 million aggregate estimated cost) that CECONY is developing and one project that two other New York transmission owners are developing.

NY Transco’s projects may also include one or more projects proposed on behalf of the NY Transco for consideration by the NYSPSC in its
competitive proceeding to select transmission projects that would relieve transmission congestion between upstate and downstate. Depending on the project alternative(s), if any, selected by the NYSPSC, the aggregate estimated costs of the NY Transco
projects could range up to approximately $1,200 million. The NY Transco projects, which could be completed in the 2019 to 2021 timeframe, would be developed, at least initially, by New York transmission owners other than CECONY until they are sold
to NY Transco.

(d)Amounts shown for other purchase obligations, which reflect capital and operations and maintenance costs incurred by the Utilities in running their day-to-day operations, were derived from the
Utilities’ purchasing system as the difference between the amounts authorized and the amounts paid (or vouchered to be paid) for each obligation. For many of these obligations, the Utilities are committed to purchase less than the amount
authorized. Payments for the “Other Purchase Obligations” are generally assumed to be made ratably over the term of the obligations. The Utilities believe that unreasonable effort and expense would be involved to enable them to report
their “Other Purchase Obligations” in a different manner.

(e)Amounts represent commitments to purchase minimum quantities of electric energy and capacity, renewable energy certificates, natural gas, natural gas pipeline capacity, energy efficiency services
and construction services entered into by Con Edison’s competitive energy businesses.



The Companies’ commitments to make payments in addition to these contractual commitments include their other liabilities reflected in their

26CON EDISON ANNUAL REPORT 2014




Capital Resources

Con Edison is a holding company that operates only through its subsidiaries and has no material assets other than its interests in its subsidiaries.
Con Edison finances its capital requirements primarily through internally-generated funds and the sale of its securities. Con Edison’s ability to make payments on external borrowings and dividends on its common shares depends on receipt of
dividends from its subsidiaries or proceeds from the sale of its securities or its interests in its subsidiaries.

For information about
restrictions on the payment of dividends by the Utilities and significant debt covenants, see Note C to the financial statements in Item 8.

For information on the Companies’ commercial paper program and revolving credit agreements with banks, see Note D to the financial statements in Item 8.

The Utilities finance their operations, capital requirements and payment of dividends to Con Edison from internally-generated funds (see
“Liquidity and Capital Resources – Cash Flows from Operating Activities” in Item 7), contributions of equity capital from Con Edison, if any, and external borrowings.

The Companies expect to meet their 2015 capital requirements, including for maturing securities, through internally-generated funds and the
issuance of between $1,000 million and $1,500 million of long-term debt. Con Edison does not expect to need to issue common equity in 2015 other than through its dividend reinvestment, employee stock purchase and long term incentive plans.

The Companies require access to the capital markets to fund capital requirements that are substantially in excess of available
internally-generated funds. See “Capital Requirements,” above. Each of the Companies believes that it will continue to be able to access capital, although capital market conditions may affect the timing and cost of the Companies’
financing activities. The Companies monitor the availability and costs of various forms of capital, and will seek to issue Con Edison common stock and other securities when it is necessary or advantageous to do so. For information about the
Companies’ long-term debt and short-term borrowing, see Notes C and D to the financial statements in Item 8.

In 2012, the
NYSPSC authorized CECONY, through 2016, to issue up to $3,500 million of debt securities ($2,550 million of which the company had issued as of December 31, 2014). In 2013, the NYSPSC authorized O&R, through 2017, to issue up to $305 million
of debt securities (none of which the company had issued as of December 31, 2014). The NYSPSC also authorized CECONY and O&R for such periods to issue up to $2,500 million and $125 million, respectively, of debt securities to refund
existing debt securities. At December 31, 2014, the Utilities had not refunded any securities pursuant to this authorization.

Con
Edison’s competitive energy businesses have financed their operations and capital requirements primarily with capital contributions and borrowings from Con Edison, internally-generated funds and external borrowings. In April 2013, a Con Edison
Development subsidiary issued $219 million aggregate principal amount of 4.78 percent senior notes secured by certain of the company’s California solar electric production projects. In 2014, the company sold a 50 percent interest in the
subsidiary. See Note Q to the financial statements in Item 8.

For each of the Companies, the ratio of earnings to fixed charges (SEC
basis) for the last five years was:

The commercial paper of Con Edison and O&R is rated P-2,A-2and F2,
respectively, by Moody’s, S&P and Fitch. The commercial paper of CECONY is rated P-1, A-2 and F2 by Moody’s, S&P and Fitch, respectively. Con Edison’s long-term credit rating is A3, BBB+ and BBB+ by Moody’s,
S&P and Fitch, respectively. The unsecured debt of CECONY is rated A2, A- and A- by Moody’s, S&P and Fitch, respectively. The unsecured debt of O&R is rated A3, A- and A- by Moody’s, S&P and Fitch, respectively. Securities
ratings assigned by rating organizations are expressions of opinion and are not recommendations to buy, sell or hold securities. A securities rating is subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization. Each rating
should be evaluated independently of any other rating.

CECONY has $636 million of tax-exempt debt for which the interest rates are to
be determined pursuant to periodic auctions. Of this amount, $391 million is insured by Ambac Assurance Corporation and $245 million is insured by Syncora Guarantee Inc. (formerly XL Capital Assurance Inc.). Credit rating agencies have withdrawn the
ratings of these insurers. Subsequently, there have not been sufficient bids to determine the interest rates pursuant to auctions, and interest rates have



CON EDISON ANNUAL REPORT 201427




been determined by reference to a variable rate index. The weighted average annual interest rate on this tax-exempt debt was 0.13 percent on December 31, 2014. The weighted average interest
rate was 0.10 percent, 0.17 percent, and 0.29 percent for the years 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. Under CECONY’s current electric, gas and steam rate plans, variations in auction rate debt interest expense are reconciled to the levels
set in rates.

Environmental Matters

Climate Change

As indicated by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, emissions of greenhouse gases (GHG), including carbon dioxide, are very likely changing the world’s climate.

Climate change could affect customer demand for the Companies’ energy services. It might also cause physical damage to the Companies’
facilities and disruption of their operations due to more frequent and more extreme weather-related events. In late October 2012, Superstorm Sandy caused extensive damage to the Utilities’ electric distribution system. Superstorm Sandy
interrupted service to approximately 1.4 million of the Utilities’ customers – more than four times the number of customers impacted by the Utilities’ previous worst storm event (Hurricane Irene in 2011). See “Other
Regulatory Matters” in Note B to the financial statements in Item 8.

Based on the most recent data (2014) published by
the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Con Edison estimates that its direct GHG emissions constitute less than 0.1 percent of the nation’s GHG emissions. Con Edison’s estimated emissions of GHG during the past five years were:



(metric tons, in millions(a))20102011201220132014CO2equivalent
emissions3.83.43.33.43.2



(a)Estimated emissions for 2014 are subject to third-party verification.

Con Edison’s 47 percent decrease in direct GHG emissions (carbon dioxide, methane and sulfur hexafluoride) since 2005 (6.0 million metric
tons) reflects the emission reductions resulting from equipment and repair projects, reduced steam demand, the increased use of natural gas in lieu of fuel oil at CECONY’s steam production facilities as well as projects to reduce sulfur
hexafluoride emissions and to replace gas distribution pipes.

CECONY has participated for several years in voluntary initiatives with
the EPA to reduce its methane and sulfur hexafluoride emissions. The Utilities reduce methane emissions from the operation of their gas distribution systems through pipe maintenance and replacement programs, by operating system components at lower
pressure, and by introducing new technologies for leak repair prioritization and to reduce work-related losses. The Utilities reduce emissions of sulfur hexafluoride, which is used for arc suppression in substation circuit breakers and switches, by
using improved technologies to locate and repair leaks, and by replacing older equipment. The Utilities also actively promote energy efficiency and the use of renewable generation to help their customers’ reduce their GHG emissions.

NYSERDA and New York utilities are responsible for implementing the Energy Efficiency Portfolio Standard (EEPS) established by the NYSPSC through
energy efficiency, targeted demand-side management and demand-response programs. The Utilities billed customers EEPS surcharges of approximately $103 million and $100 million in 2014 and 2013, respectively, to fund these programs. Through the
Utilities’ energy-efficiency programs, customers reduced their annual energy use by approximately 2,390,000 MWh of electricity and 3,670,000 Dt of gas from the programs’ inception in 2009 through 2014, resulting in their avoiding their
release of approximately 1,055,000 tons of GHG into the atmosphere every year. CECONY’s demand-side management programs assisted customers in reducing their annual energy use by approximately 295,000 MWh of electricity from the programs’
inception in 2004 through 2014, resulting in their avoiding their release of approximately 105,000 tons of GHG into the atmosphere every year.

In May
2014, the NYSPSC directed NYSERDA to submit for its consideration a proposal for a comprehensive clean energy



28CON EDISON ANNUAL REPORT 2014




fund. In September 2014, NYSERDA submitted its clean energy fund proposal seeking a 10-year program that it indicated is designed to pursue greater scale for clean energy in the
New York economy; foster new investment opportunities to attract private capital to invest in clean energy in New York; and significantly reduce GHG emissions from New York’s energy sector.

In June 2014, the EPA proposed its Clean Power Plan to reduce carbon dioxide emissions from existing power plants 30 percent from 2005 levels
by 2030. As proposed, each state will be required to submit for EPA approval a plan to reduce its emissions rate (as determined in accordance with the Clean Power Plan) to a specified target level applicable to the state. For New York State, the
emissions rate target level for 2030 would be 44 percent below its 2012 level. State plans may, among other things, include participation in regional cap-and-trade programs, such as the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (in which New York State
participates), and renewable energy and energy efficiency programs. Initial state plans would be due by June 2016, with single-state plans to be finalized by June 2017 and multi-state plans to be finalized by June 2018. The costs resulting from the
Clean Power Plan could be substantial.

Beginning in 2009 CECONY became subject to carbon dioxide emissions regulations established by
New York State under the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI). The Initiative, a cooperative effort by Northeastern and Mid-Atlantic states, established a decreasing cap on carbon dioxide emissions resulting from the generation of electricity
to a level fifteen percent below the Initiative’s baseline by 2020. Under the Initiative, affected electric generators are required to obtain emission allowances to cover their carbon dioxide emissions, available primarily through auctions
administered by participating states or a secondary market. CECONY met its requirement of 6.3 million allowances for the first RGGI compliance period (2009-2011) and has purchased sufficient allowances to meet its requirement for the second
compliance period (2012-2014). In February 2013, RGGI released a model rule for adoption by the participating states that includes a 45 percent reduction in the emissions cap for 2014 and further reductions of 2.5 percent each year from 2015 to
2020. New York State adopted the model rule, and the lower cap was effective as of January 1, 2014.

Also, New York State and
New York City have announced goals to reduce GHG emissions 80 percent below 1990 and 2005 levels respectively, by 2050. The cost to comply with legislation, regulations or initiatives limiting the Companies’ GHG emissions could be substantial.



Environmental Sustainability

Con Edison’s sustainability strategy, as it relates to the environment, provides that the company seeks to reduce its
environmental footprint by making effective use of natural resources to address the challenges of climate change and its impact on the company’s business. As part of its strategy, the company seeks, among other things, to reduce direct and
indirect emissions; enhance the efficiency of its water use; minimize its impact to natural ecosystems; focus on reducing, reusing, and recycling to minimize consumption; and design its work in consideration of climate forecasts.

CECONY

Superfund

The Federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 and
similar state statutes (Superfund) impose joint and several liability, regardless of fault, upon generators of hazardous substances for investigation costs, remediation costs and environmental damages. The sites as to which CECONY has been asserted
to have liability under Superfund include its and its predecessor companies’ former manufactured gas sites, its multi-purpose Astoria site, its former Flushing Service Center site, the Gowanus Canal site, and other Superfund sites discussed
below. There may be additional sites as to which assertions will be made that the Company has liability. For a further discussion of claims and possible claims against the Company under Superfund, estimated liability accrued for Superfund claims and
recovery from customers of site investigation and remediation costs, see Note G to the financial statements in Item 8 (which information is incorporated herein by reference).

Manufactured Gas Sites

CECONY and its predecessors formerly owned and operated manufactured gas plants at 51 sites (MGP Sites) in New York City and Westchester County. Many of these sites have been subdivided and are now owned by parties other than CECONY
and have been redeveloped for other uses, including schools, residential and commercial developments and hospitals. The New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (NYSDEC) is requiring CECONY to investigate, and if necessary, develop
and implement remediation programs for the sites, including any neighboring areas to which contamination may have migrated.

CECONY has
started remedial investigations at all 51 MGP Sites. After investigations, no MGP impacts have been detected at all or portions of 15 sites, and the NYSDEC has issued No Further Action (NFA) letters for these sites.

Coal tar or other MGP-related contaminants have been detected at the remaining 36 sites. Remedial actions have been completed at all or portions of
five sites and the NYSDEC has issued NFA letters for these sites. In addition, remedial actions



CON EDISON ANNUAL REPORT 201429




have been completed by property owners at all or portions of three sites under the NYS Brownfield Cleanup Program and Certificates of Completion have been issued by the NYSDEC for these sites.
Remedial design is ongoing for the remaining sites, however, the information as to the extent of contamination and scope of the remediation likely to be required for many of these sites is incomplete. The company estimates that its undiscounted
potential liability for the completion of the site investigation and cleanup of the known contamination on MGP sites (other than the Astoria site which is discussed below) could range from $490 million to $2,129 million.

Astoria Site

CECONY
is permitted by the NYSDEC to operate a hazardous waste storage facility on property owned by the company in the Astoria section of Queens, New York. Portions of the property were formerly the location of a manufactured gas plant and also have been
used or are being used for, among other things, electric generation operations, electric substation operations, the storage of fuel oil and liquefied natural gas, and the maintenance and storage of electric equipment. As a condition of its NYSDEC
permit, the company is required to investigate the property and, where environmental contamination is found and action is necessary, to remediate the contamination. The company’s investigations are on-going. The company has submitted to the
NYSDEC and the New York State Department of Health reports and in the future will be submitting additional reports identifying the known areas of contamination. The company estimates that its undiscounted potential liability for the completion of
the site investigation and cleanup of the known contamination on the property could range from $156 million to $462 million.

Flushing Service Center Site

In September 2007, the NYSDEC demanded that the company investigate and remediate PCB contamination that may have migrated from a former CECONY service center facility in Flushing New York, into the adjacent Flushing River. In April
2008, the company and NYSDEC entered into a consent order under which the company agreed to implement a NYSDEC-approved investigation program for the Flushing River and, if deemed necessary by the NYSDEC to protect human health and the environment,
to implement a NYSDEC-approved remediation program for any PCB contamination in the river attributable to the site. In March 2011, the company submitted to NYSDEC a report indicating that PCBs had migrated from the site to sediment in a portion of
the river. In August 2013, the NYSDEC selected a remedy that requires the company to submit a remedial design report, remove contaminated sediment, restore the river bed with clean material, prepare a site management plan and implement institutional
controls. The company estimates that its undiscounted potential liability for the completion of the cleanup in Flushing River will be at least $5.3 million.

Gowanus Canal

Other Superfund Sites

CECONY is a PRP with respect to other Superfund sites involving other PRPs and participates in PRP groups at these sites. The
company generally is not responsible for managing the site investigation and remediation at these multiparty sites. Work at these sites is in various stages, and investigation, remediation and monitoring activities at some of these sites can be
expected to continue over extended periods of time. The company believes that it is unlikely that monetary sanctions, such as penalties, will be imposed upon it by any governmental authority with respect to these sites.

The following table lists each of CECONY’s other Superfund sites for which the company anticipates it may have a liability. The table also
shows for each such site, its location, the year in which the company was designated or alleged to be a PRP or to otherwise have responsibilities with respect to the site (shown in the table under “Start”), the name of the court or agency
in which proceedings for the site are pending and CECONY’s estimated percentage of total liability for each site. The company currently estimates that its potential liability for investigation, remediation, monitoring and environmental damages
at each site is $0.2 million or less, with the exception of the Cortese Landfill site for which the estimate is $1 million. Superfund liability is joint and several. The company’s estimate of its liability for each site was determined
pursuant to consent decrees, settlement agreements



30CON EDISON ANNUAL REPORT 2014




or otherwise and in light of the financial condition of other PRPs. The company’s actual liability could differ substantially from amounts estimated.

O&R

Superfund

The sites
at which O&R has been asserted to have liability under Superfund include its manufactured gas sites and the Superfund sites discussed below. There may be additional sites as to which assertions will be made that O&R has liability. For a
further discussion of claims and possible claims against O&R under Superfund, see Note G to the financial statements in Item 8 (which information is incorporated herein by reference).

Manufactured Gas Sites

O&R and its predecessors formerly owned and operated manufactured gas plants at seven sites (O&R MGP Sites) in Orange County and Rockland County, New York. Three of these sites are now owned by parties other than O&R,
and have been redeveloped by them for residential, commercial or industrial uses. The NYSDEC is requiring O&R to develop and implement remediation programs for the O&R MGP Sites including any neighboring areas to which contamination may have
migrated.

O&R has completed remedial investigations at all seven of its MGP sites and has received NYSDEC’s decision regarding
the remedial work to be performed at six of the sites. Of the six sites, O&R has completed remediation at three sites. Remedial design is ongoing for the remaining three sites. The company estimates that its undiscounted potential liability for
the completion of the site investigation and cleanup of the known contamination on MGP sites could range from $96 million to $155 million.

Superfund Sites

O&R is a PRP at Superfund sites involving other PRPs, and participates in PRP groups
at those sites. The company is not managing the site investigation and remediation at these multiparty Superfund sites. Work at these sites is in various stages, and investigation, remediation and monitoring at some of these sites is expected to
continue over extended periods of time. The company believes that it is unlikely that monetary sanctions, such as penalties, will be imposed by any governmental authority with respect to these sites.

The following table lists each of these Superfund sites for which the company anticipates it may have liability. The table also shows for each such
site, its location, the year in which the company was designated or alleged to be a PRP or to otherwise have responsibilities with respect to the site (shown in the table under “Start”), the name of the court or agency in which proceedings
with respect to the site are pending and O&R’s estimated percentage of total liability for each site. The company currently estimates that its potential liability for investigation, remediation, monitoring and environmental damages at each
site is less than $0.3 million. Superfund liability is joint and several. The company’s estimate of its anticipated share of the total liability for each site was determined pursuant to consent decrees, settlement agreements or otherwise and in
light of the financial condition of other PRPs. The company’s actual liability could differ substantially from amounts estimated.

Other Federal, State and Local Environmental Provisions

Toxic Substances Control Act

Virtually all electric utilities, including CECONY, own equipment containing PCBs. PCBs are regulated under the Federal Toxic Substances Control Act of 1976. The Utilities have procedures in place to properly manage and dispose of
oil and equipment containing PCBs when they are removed from service.

Water Quality

Under NYSDEC regulations, the operation of CECONY’s generating facilities requires permits for water discharges. Regulations that became
effective in 2013 require permits for water withdrawals. Conditions to the renewal of such permits may include limitations on the operations of the permitted facility or requirements to install certain equipment, the cost of which could be
substantial. For information about the company’s generating facilities, see “CECONY – Electric Operations – Electric Facilities” and “Steam Operations – Steam Facilities” above in this Item 1.

Certain governmental authorities are investigating contamination in the Hudson River and the New York Harbor. These waters run through portions of
CECONY’s service area. Governmental authorities could require entities that released hazardous substances that contaminated these waters to bear the cost of investigation and remediation, which could be substantial.

Air Quality

Under
new source review regulations, an owner of a large generating facility, including CECONY’s steam and steam-electric generating facilities, is required to obtain a permit before



CON EDISON ANNUAL REPORT 201431




making modifications to the facility, other than routine maintenance, repair, or replacement, that increase emissions of pollutants from the facility above specified thresholds. To obtain a
permit, the facility owner could be required to install additional pollution controls or otherwise limit emissions from the facility. The company reviews on an on-going basis its planned modifications to its generating facilities to determine the
potential applicability of new source review and similar regulations.

In December 2011, the company filed its proposed plan to comply
with revised New York State nitrogen oxides reasonably available control technology regulations (NOx RACT) and is incorporating the plan provisions into its existing air quality permits as they are renewed. In 2011, the EPA adopted regulations
establishing maximum achievable control technology standards for utility and industrial boilers. The regulations apply to major air emissions sources, including CECONY’s generating facilities. CECONY complied with these regulations in 2014, and
expects to comply with them in 2015 For information about the company’s generating facilities, see “CECONY – Electric Operations – Electric Facilities” and “Steam Operations – Steam Facilities” above in this
Item 1.

In October 2014, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia lifted its stay of the Transport Rule (also
referred to as the Cross-State Air Pollution Rule). The appellate court acted on remand from the U.S. Supreme Court, which in April 2014 reversed the appellate court’s August 2012 decision that vacated the rule. The Transport Rule establishes a
new cap and trade program requiring further reductions in air emissions than the Clean Air Intrastate Rule (CAIR) that it replaces. Under the Transport Rule, utilities are to be allocated emissions allowances and may sell the allowances or buy
additional allowances. CECONY requested and received NYSPSC approval to change the provisions under which the company recovers its purchased power costs to provide for costs incurred to purchase emissions allowances and revenues received from the
sale of allowances. Until the Transport Rule was implemented in January 2015, CAIR remained in effect. CECONY complied with CAIR in 2014 and expects to comply with the Transport Rule in 2015.

State Anti-Takeover Law

New York State law provides that a “domestic corporation,” such as Con Edison, may not consummate a merger, consolidation or similar
transaction with the beneficial owner of a 20 percent or greater voting stock interest in the corporation, or with an affiliate of the owner, for five years after the acquisition of the voting stock interest, unless the transaction or the
acquisition of the voting stock interest was approved by the corporation’s board of directors prior to the acquisition of the voting stock interest. After the expiration of the five-year period, the transaction may be consummated only pursuant
to a stringent “fair price” formula or with the approval of a majority of the disinterested stockholders.

Employees

Con Edison has no employees other than those of CECONY, O&R and Con Edison’s competitive energy businesses
(which at December 31, 2014 had 13,200, 1,103 and 298 employees, respectively). Of the 13,200 CECONY employees and 1,103 O&R employees, 8,136 and 594 were represented by a collective bargaining unit, respectively. The collective
bargaining agreement covering most of these CECONY employees expires in June 2016. Agreements covering other CECONY employees and O&R employees expire in June 2017 and May 2017, respectively.
