We
are one of the largest manufacturers and distributors of nitrogen and phosphate fertilizer products in the world. Our operations are organized into two business
segments—the nitrogen segment and the phosphate segment. Our principal customers are cooperatives and independent fertilizer distributors. Our principal fertilizer products in the nitrogen
segment are ammonia, granular urea, urea ammonium nitrate solution, or UAN, and ammonium nitrate, or AN. Our other nitrogen products include urea liquor, diesel exhaust fluid, or DEF, and aqua
ammonia, which are sold primarily to our industrial customers. Our principal fertilizer products in the phosphate segment are diammonium phosphate, or DAP, and monoammonium phosphate, or MAP.

Our
core market and distribution facilities are concentrated in the midwestern United States and other major agricultural areas of the United States and Canada. We also export nitrogen
fertilizer products from our Donaldsonville, Louisiana manufacturing facilities and phosphate fertilizer products from our Florida phosphate operations through our Tampa port facility.

Our
principal nitrogen segment assets include:

•six nitrogen fertilizer manufacturing facilities in Donaldsonville, Louisiana (the largest nitrogen fertilizer complex in
North America), Medicine Hat, Alberta (the largest nitrogen fertilizer complex in Canada), Port Neal, Iowa, Courtright, Ontario, Yazoo City, Mississippi, and Woodward, Oklahoma;









CF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.

•a 75.3% interest in Terra Nitrogen Company, L.P. (TNCLP), a publicly traded limited partnership of which we are the
sole general partner and the majority limited partner and which, through its subsidiary Terra Nitrogen, Limited Partnership (TNLP), operates a nitrogen fertilizer manufacturing facility in Verdigris,
Oklahoma;•an extensive system of terminals and associated transportation equipment located primarily in the midwestern United
States; and•joint venture investments that we account for under the equity method, which consist
of:•a 50% interest in GrowHow UK Limited (GrowHow), a nitrogen products production joint venture located in the United Kingdom

Company History

We were founded in 1946 as a fertilizer brokerage operation by a group of regional agricultural cooperatives. During the 1960s, we
expanded our distribution capabilities and diversified into fertilizer manufacturing through the acquisition of several existing plants and facilities. During the 1970s and again during the 1990s, we
expanded our production and distribution capabilities significantly, spending approximately $1 billion in each of these decades.









CF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.

We
operated as a traditional manufacturing and supply cooperative until 2002, when we adopted a new business model that established financial performance as our principal objective,
rather than assured supply to our owners. A critical aspect of the new business model was to establish a more economically driven approach to the marketplace.

In
August 2005, we completed our initial public offering (IPO) of common stock, which is listed on the New York Stock Exchange. In connection with the IPO, we consummated a
reorganization transaction whereby we ceased to be a cooperative and our pre-IPO owners' equity interests in CF Industries, Inc., now our wholly-owned subsidiary, were cancelled in exchange for
all of the proceeds of the offering and shares of our common stock.

In
April 2010, we acquired Terra Industries Inc. (Terra), a leading North American producer and marketer of nitrogen fertilizer products for a purchase price of
$4.6 billion, which was paid in cash and shares of our common stock. As a result of the Terra acquisition, we acquired five nitrogen fertilizer manufacturing facilities, our 75.3% interest in
TNCLP and certain joint venture interests.

Operating Segments

Our business is divided into two operating segments, the nitrogen segment and the phosphate segment. The nitrogen segment includes the
manufacture and sale of ammonia, granular urea, UAN and AN. The phosphate segment includes the manufacture and sale of DAP and MAP. In October 2013, we entered into a definitive agreement with Mosaic
to sell our entire phosphate mining and manufacturing business, which is located in Florida. For additional details regarding this sale, including the assumption of certain liabilities by Mosaic, see
Note 12—Assets and Liabilities Held for Sale in the consolidated financial statements.

Nitrogen Segment

We are the largest nitrogen fertilizer producer in North America. Our primary nitrogen fertilizer products are ammonia, granular urea,
UAN and AN. Our historical sales of nitrogen fertilizer products are shown in the following table. The sales shown do not reflect amounts used internally, such as ammonia, in the manufacture of other
products.

respectively. Total assets for the nitrogen segment were $6.9 billion as of December 31, 2013 and $6.0 billion as of December 31, 2012 and 2011.









CF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.

We
operate seven nitrogen fertilizer production facilities in North America. We own four production facilities in the Central United States, one in Medicine Hat, Alberta, Canada and one
in Ontario,
Canada. We also have a 75.3% interest in TNCLP and its subsidiary, TNLP, which owns a nitrogen fertilizer facility in Verdigris, Oklahoma. In 2013, the combined production capacity of these seven
facilities represented approximately 39%, 36%, 47% and 22% of North American ammonia, granular urea, UAN and ammonium nitrate production capacity, respectively. Each of our nitrogen fertilizer
production facilities in North America has on-site storage to provide flexibility to manage the flow of outbound shipments without impacting production.

Our
joint venture interests in PLNL and GrowHow provide additional production capacity in three additional nitrogen fertilizer production facilities, one located in the Republic of
Trinidad and Tobago and two located in the United Kingdom.

CF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.

United Kingdom

GrowHow is a 50/50 joint venture between us and Yara International ASA (Yara) that owns and operates the Ince and Billingham
facilities. The Ince facility is located in northwestern England and consists of an ammonia plant, three nitric acid plants, an AN plant and three fertilizer compound plants. The Billingham facility
located in the Teesside chemical area, is geographically split between two primary areas: the main site contains an ammonia plant, three nitric acid plants and a carbon dioxide plant; and the Portrack
site, approximately two miles away, contains an AN fertilizer plant.

Nitrogen Fertilizer Raw Materials

Natural gas is the principal raw material and primary fuel source used in the ammonia production process at our nitrogen fertilizer
manufacturing facilities. In 2013, natural gas accounted for approximately 41% of our total cost of sales for nitrogen fertilizers and a higher percentage of cash production costs (total production
costs less depreciation and amortization). Our nitrogen fertilizer manufacturing facilities have access to abundant, competitively-priced natural gas through a reliable network of pipelines that are
connected to major natural gas trading hubs near the facilities. We have facilities located at or near Henry Hub in Louisiana, ONEOK in Oklahoma, AECO in Alberta, Ventura in Iowa and Dawn in Ontario.

Our
nitrogen manufacturing facilities consume, in the aggregate, in excess of 250 million MMBtus of natural gas annually. We employ a combination of spot and term purchases from a
variety of quality suppliers to maintain a reliable, competitively-priced supply of natural gas. We also use certain financial instruments to hedge natural gas prices. For further information about
our natural gas hedging activities, see Note 24—Derivative Financial Instruments.

Nitrogen Fertilizer Distribution

The safe, efficient and economical distribution of nitrogen fertilizer products is critical for successful operations. Our nitrogen
fertilizer production facilities have access to multiple transportation modes by which we ship fertilizer to terminals, warehouses and customers. Each of our production facilities has a unique
distribution pattern based on its production capability and location.

Our
North American production facilities can ship products via truck and rail to customers and our storage facilities in the U.S. and Canada, with access to our leased railcar fleet of
approximately 5,400 tank and hopper cars, as well as railcars provided by rail carriers.

The
North American waterway system is also used extensively to ship products from our Donaldsonville, Verdigris and Yazoo City facilities. We employ a fleet of ten leased tow boats and
32 river barges to ship ammonia and UAN. We also utilize contract marine services to move urea and phosphate fertilizers.

Three
of our nitrogen production facilities also have access to pipelines for the transportation of ammonia. The Donaldsonville facility is connected to the 2,000-mile long Nustar
pipeline through which we transport ammonia to more than 20 terminals and shipping points in the midwestern U.S. corn belt. Our Verdigris and Port Neal facilities are connected to the 1,100-mile long
Magellan ammonia pipeline that also serves the U.S. Midwest.

Phosphate Segment

We are a major manufacturer of phosphate fertilizer products. Our phosphate fertilizer products are DAP and MAP.









CF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.

Hardee County Phosphate Rock Mine

In 1975, we purchased 20,000 acres of land in Hardee County, Florida that was originally estimated to contain in excess of
100 million tons of recoverable rock reserves. Between 1978 and 1993, we operated a one million ton per year phosphate rock mine on a 5,000-acre portion of these reserves. In 1995, we began
operations at an expanded mine on the remaining 15,000-acre area of the reserve property. Since that time, we have acquired additional rock reserves through acquisitions or exchanges of several
smaller parcels of land.

The
table below shows the estimated reserves at the Hardee phosphate complex as of December 31, 2013. Also reflected in the table is the grade of the reserves, expressed as a
percentage of bone phosphate of lime (BPL) and P2O5. The table also reflects the average values of the following material contaminants contained in the reserves: ferrous oxide

phosphate
rock recovered, new drilling information and other geological or mining data. Estimates for 99% of the reserves are based on 20-acre density drilling.

Plant City Phosphate Complex

Our Plant City phosphate fertilizer complex is one of the largest phosphate fertilizer facilities in North America. At one million tons
per year, its phosphoric acid capacity represents approximately 10% of the total U.S. capacity. All of Plant City's phosphoric acid is converted into ammonium phosphates (DAP and MAP), representing
approximately 13% of U.S. capacity for ammonium phosphate fertilizer products in 2013. The combination of the Plant City phosphate fertilizer complex and the Hardee mine gives us one of the largest
integrated ammonium phosphate fertilizer operations in North America.

Bartow Phosphate Complex

We own a site in Bartow, Florida on which we operated a phosphate manufacturing complex. This complex ceased production in 1999 and the
former manufacturing facilities have been dismantled and disposed of in accordance with local laws and regulations. The related phosphogypsum stack has been closed and the former storage and
distribution facilities were sold along with excess land. We continue to be obligated for the closure of the cooling pond, management of water treatment on the site and providing long-term care for
the site in accordance with regulatory requirements.

Phosphate Raw Materials

Phosphate Rock Supply.Phosphate rock is the basic nutrient source for phosphate fertilizers. Approximately 3.5 tons of phosphate rock
are needed to
produce one ton of P2O5(the measure of nutrient content of phosphate fertilizers). Our Plant City phosphate fertilizer complex typically consumes in excess of three million
tons of rock annually. As of December 31, 2013, our Hardee rock mine had approximately 11 years of fully permitted recoverable phosphate reserves remaining at current operating rates. We
have initiated the process of applying for authorization and permits to expand the geographical area at our Hardee property where we can mine. The expanded area has an estimated 35.3 million
tons of recoverable phosphate reserves. We estimate that we will be able to conduct mining operations at our Hardee property for approximately 10 additional years at current operating rates, assuming
we secure the authorization and permits to mine in this area.

Sulfur Supply.Sulfur is used to produce sulfuric acid, which is combined with phosphate rock to produce phosphoric acid. Approximately
three
quarters of a long ton of sulfur is needed to produce one ton of P2O5. Our Plant City phosphate fertilizer complex uses approximately 800,000 long tons of sulfur annually when
operating at capacity. We obtain molten sulfur from several domestic and foreign producers under contracts of varied duration. In 2013, Martin Sulphur, our largest molten sulfur supplier, supplied
approximately 63% of the molten sulfur used at Plant City.

Ammonia Supply.DAP and MAP have a nitrogen content of 18% and 11%, respectively, and a
phosphate nutrient content of 46% and 52%, respectively. Ammonia is the primary source of nitrogen in DAP and MAP. Operating at capacity, our Plant City phosphate fertilizer complex consumes
approximately 400,000 tons of ammonia annually.

The
ammonia used at our Plant City phosphate fertilizer complex is shipped by rail from our ammonia storage facility located in Tampa, Florida. This facility consists of a 38,000-ton
ammonia storage tank, access to a deep-water dock that is capable of discharging ocean-going vessels, and rail and truck loading facilities. In addition to supplying our Plant City phosphate
fertilizer complex, our Tampa ammonia distribution system has the capacity to support ammonia sales to, and distribution









CF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.

services
for other customers. Sales of ammonia from our Tampa terminal are reported in our nitrogen business segment. The ammonia supply for Tampa is purchased from offshore sources, providing us with
access to the broad international ammonia market.

Phosphate Distribution

We operate a phosphate fertilizer warehouse located at a deep-water port facility in Tampa, Florida. Most of the phosphate fertilizer
produced at Plant City is shipped by truck or rail to our Tampa warehouse, where it is loaded onto vessels for shipment to export customers or for transport across the Gulf of Mexico to the
Mississippi River. In 2013, our Tampa warehouse handled approximately 1.2 million tons of phosphate fertilizers, or about 66% of our production. The remainder of our phosphate fertilizer
production is transported by truck or rail directly to customers or to in-market storage facilities.

Phosphate
fertilizer shipped across the Gulf of Mexico to the Mississippi River is transferred into river barges near New Orleans. Phosphate fertilizer in these river barges is
transported to our storage facilities or delivered directly to customers. River transportation is provided primarily under an agreement with one of the major inland river system barge operators.

Storage Facilities and Other Properties

At December 31, 2013, we owned or leased space at 85 in-market storage terminals and warehouses located in a 20-state region and
Canada. Including storage at our production facilities and at the Tampa warehouse and ammonia terminal, we have an aggregate storage capacity for approximately three million tons of fertilizer. Our
storage capabilities are summarized in the following table.

Customers

The principal customers for our nitrogen and phosphate fertilizers are cooperatives and independent fertilizer distributors. None of
our customers in 2013 accounted for more than ten percent of our consolidated net sales. Sales are generated by our internal marketing and sales force.









CF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.

Competition

Our markets are global and intensely competitive, based primarily on delivered price and to a lesser extent on customer service and
product quality. During the peak demand periods, product availability and delivery time also play a role in the buying decisions of customers.

In
our nitrogen segment, our primary North American-based competitors include Agrium Inc. and Koch Nitrogen Company. There is also significant competition from products sourced
from other regions of the world, including some with lower natural gas costs. Because ammonia, urea and UAN are
widely-traded fertilizer products and there are limited barriers to entry, we experience competition from foreign-sourced products continuously.

In
our phosphate segment, our primary North American-based competitors include Agrium, Mosaic, Potash Corporation of Saskatchewan Inc. and J.R. Simplot Company. The domestic
phosphate industry is tied to the global market through its position as the world's largest exporter of DAP/MAP. Consequently, phosphate fertilizer prices and demand for U.S. DAP/MAP are subject to
considerable volatility and are dependent on a wide variety of factors impacting the world market, including fertilizer and/or trade policies of foreign governments, changes in ocean bound freight
rates and international currency fluctuations.

Seasonality

The sales patterns of our six major products are seasonal. The strongest demand for our products occurs during the spring planting
season, with a second period of strong demand following the fall harvest. We and our customers generally build inventories during the low demand periods of the year in order to ensure timely product
availability during the peak sales seasons. Seasonality is greatest for ammonia due to the limited ability of our customers and their customers to store significant quantities of this product. The
seasonality of fertilizer demand generally results in our sales volumes and net sales being the highest during the spring and our working capital requirements being the highest just prior to the start
of the spring season. Our quarterly financial results can vary significantly from one year to the next due to weather-related shifts in planting schedules and purchasing patterns.

Financial Information About Foreign and Domestic Sales and Operations

The amount of net sales attributable to our sales to foreign and domestic markets over the last three fiscal years and the carrying
value of our foreign and domestic assets are set forth in Note 29—Segment Disclosures.

Environment, Health and Safety

We are subject to numerous environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, including laws and regulations relating to land
reclamation; the generation, treatment,
storage, disposal and handling of hazardous substances and wastes; and the cleanup of hazardous substance releases. These laws include the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the Resource Conservation
and Recovery Act (RCRA), the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA), the Toxic Substances Control Act and various other federal, state, provincial, local and
international statutes. Violations can result in substantial penalties, court orders to install pollution-control equipment, civil and criminal sanctions, permit revocations and facility shutdowns. In
addition, environmental, health and safety laws and regulations may impose joint and several liability, without regard to fault, for cleanup costs on potentially responsible parties who have released
or disposed of hazardous substances into the environment.

Environmental Health and Safety Expenditures

Our environmental, health and safety capital expenditures in 2013 totaled approximately $41.5 million. In 2014, we estimate that
we will spend approximately $38.3 million for environmental, health and safety capital expenditures. Environmental, health and safety laws and regulations are complex, change frequently and
have tended to become more stringent over time. We expect that continued government and public emphasis on environmental issues will result in increased future expenditures for environmental controls
at our operations. Such expenditures could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

Clean Air Act—Section 185 Fee

Our Donaldsonville Nitrogen Complex is located in a five-parish region near Baton Rouge, Louisiana that, as of 2005, was designated as
being in "severe" nonattainment with respect to the national ambient air quality standard (NAAQS) for ozone (the "1-hour ozone standard") pursuant to the Federal Clean Air Act (Clean Air Act).
Section 185 of the Act requires states, in their state implementation plans, to levy a fee (Section 185 fee) on major stationary sources (such as the Donaldsonville facility) located in
a severe nonattainment area that did not meet the 1-hour ozone standard by November 30, 2005. For additional information on the Section 185 fee, see
Note 28—Contingencies.

Clean Air Act Information Request

On February 26, 2009, the Company received a letter from the EPA under Section 114 of the Clean Air Act requesting
information and copies of records relating to compliance with New Source Review and New Source Performance Standards at the Donaldsonville facility. For additional information on the Clean Air Act
Information Request, see Note 28—Contingencies.

Clean Air Act Notice of Violation.

By letter dated June 16, 2010, the Company received a Notice of Violation (NOV) from the EPA alleging violations of the
Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) Clean Air Act regulations relating to certain projects undertaken at the Company's sulfuric acid plants at its Plant City, Florida facility. For
additional information on the Clean Air Act Investigation, see Legal Proceedings—Environmental and Note 28—Contingencies.

EPCRA/CERCLA Notice of Violation

By letter dated July 6, 2010, the EPA issued to the Company a NOV alleging violations of the Emergency Planning and Community
Right-to-know Act (EPCRA) and CERCLA. For additional information on the EPCRA/CERCLA Investigation, see Legal Proceedings—Environmental and Note 28—Contingencies.

CERCLA/Remediation Matters

From time to time, we receive notices from governmental agencies or third parties alleging that we are a potentially responsible party
at certain cleanup sites under CERCLA or other environmental cleanup laws. In 2002 and in 2009, we were asked by the current owner of a former phosphate mine and processing facility that we owned in
the late 1950s and early 1960s located in Georgetown Canyon, Idaho, to contribute to a cleanup of the former processing portion of the site. For additional information on the CERCLA/Remediation
matters, see Note 28—Contingencies.

Federal and State Numeric Nutrient Criteria Regulation

On August 18, 2009, the EPA entered into a consent decree with certain environmental groups with respect to the promulgation of
numeric criteria for nitrogen and phosphorous in surface waters in Florida. The consent decree was approved by a Federal district court judge on November 16, 2009. The EPA adopted final numeric
nutrient criteria for Florida lakes and inland flowing waters on November 14, 2010. On February 18, 2012, the federal district court (Court) upheld parts of the numeric nutrient criteria
regulation, but found that the EPA had not adequately justified the criteria for streams and therefore concluded that the adoption of such criteria was arbitrary and capricious.

Subsequently,
the Florida Department of Environmental Protection (FDEP) adopted its own nitrogen and phosphorous criteria for surface waters and related implementation standards. On
November 30, 2012, the EPA approved Florida's nutrient criteria and, on June 27, 2013, the EPA approved new water quality standards submitted by the FDEP relating to the scope of
coverage of the FDEP's numeric nutrient criteria for surface waters. On January 7, 2014, the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Florida granted the EPA's motion to amend the 2009
consent decree. As a result, the EPA is no longer required by the consent decree to promulgate numeric nitrogen and phosphorous criteria for certain surface waters that the FDEP had determined were
more properly regulated by the state's narrative standard. The Court's order allows the EPA to withdraw its federal numeric nutrient criteria, after which the FDEP's regulations will become effective.

The
2009 consent decree also required the EPA to develop numeric nutrient criteria for Florida coastal and estuarine waters. Although the EPA proposed such criteria in 2012, the FDEP
submitted to the EPA new numeric nutrient water quality standards for those waters on July 31 and August 1, 2013. On September 26, 2013, the EPA approved Florida's new and revised
nutrient water quality standards for estuaries and coastal waters and informed the Court that as a result, it was not required to finalize the federal criteria that it had proposed.

There
is continuing regulatory uncertainty because the EPA's approval of the FDEP nutrient water quality standards is still subject to challenge. Nonetheless, numeric nutrient water
quality criteria for Florida waters, whether federal or state, could result in substantially more stringent nitrogen and phosphorous limits in wastewater discharge permits for our mining,
manufacturing and distribution operations in Florida. More stringent limits on wastewater discharge permits could increase our costs
and limit our operations and, therefore, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

Regulation of Greenhouse Gases

We are subject to regulations in the United Kingdom, Canada and the United States concerning greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.

The
United Kingdom is a party to the Kyoto Protocol. As a result of agreements reached during a conference in Durban, South Africa in 2011, the Kyoto Protocol will continue in force for
a second commitment period, which will expire by 2020, to be replaced by another international agreement to be negotiated by 2015 (which agreement is to go into effect in 2020). The United Kingdom has
adopted GHG emissions regulations, including regulations to implement the European Union Greenhouse Gas Trading System. Our joint venture U.K. manufacturing plants are required to report GHG emissions
annually to the United Kingdom Environment Agency pursuant to their site Environmental Permits and Climate Change Agreement, which specify energy efficiency targets. Failure to meet efficiency targets
may require the joint venture to purchase CO2emissions allowances. The steam boilers at each of our joint venture U.K. sites are also subject to the European Union Emissions Trading
Scheme.









CF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.

In
Canada (which in December 2011 withdrew from further participation in the Kyoto Protocol, but signed the Durban platform to negotiate a new international GHG agreement or protocol by
2015), we are required to conduct an annual review of our operations with respect to compliance with Environment Canada's National Pollutant Release Inventory and Ontario's Mandatory Monitoring and
Reporting Regulation and the GHG Reporting Regulation. Ontario is also a party to the Western Climate Initiative, comprised of California and several Canadian provinces. Parties to the Western Climate
Initiative are working to create a regional program linking the cap and trade emissions programs of its members. Although Ontario has not disavowed its participation in the initiative, it has not
developed regulations to establish a cap and trade program.

In
the United States (not a party to the Kyoto Protocol, but a signatory to the Durban platform with respect to the negotiation of a replacement for the Kyoto Protocol), GHG regulation
is evolving at state, regional and federal levels. The EPA has issued federal GHG regulations that impact our facilities, including a mandatory GHG reporting rule that required all of our U.S.
manufacturing facilities to commence monitoring GHG emissions beginning on January 1, 2010 and begin reporting the previous year's emissions annually starting in 2011. In May 2010, the EPA
issued the Prevention of
Significant Deterioration (PSD) and Title V Greenhouse Gas Tailoring Rule (Tailoring Rule). Pursuant to this regulation, the construction of new or modification of existing major sources of GHG
emissions became subject to the PSD air permitting program (and later, the Title V permitting program) in January 2011, and the regulation could significantly decrease the emissions thresholds that
would subject facilities to these regulations in the future. The United States Supreme Court has accepted a petition for certiorari entertaining certain challenges to the EPA's regulation of GHGs from
new and modified emissions sources and a decision in this case is expected by June 2014. Regulation of GHG emissions pursuant to the PSD program could subject new capital projects to additional
permitting requirements that may result in increased costs or delays in completing such projects.

Under
the Title V provisions of the Tailoring Rule, all of our U.S. manufacturing facilities will be required to include GHG emissions in future Title V air permit applications. Other
than the states' implementation of the Tailoring Rule, none of the states where our U.S. production facilities are located—Florida, Louisiana, Mississippi, Iowa and
Oklahoma—has proposed control regulations limiting GHG emissions.

Revisions to New Source Performance Standards for Nitric Acid Plants.

We operate 13 nitric acid plants in the United States. On August 14, 2012, the EPA issued a final regulation revising air
emission standards applicable to newly constructed, reconstructed or modified nitric acid plants. The regulations will apply to these plants if and when we undertake activities or operations that are
considered modifications, including physical changes that would allow us to increase our production capacity at these plants. The regulations include certain provisions that could make it difficult
for us to meet the limits on emissions of nitrogen oxides (NOx) notwithstanding pollution controls we may add to our plants, and accordingly, the regulations, could impact our ability to
expand production at our existing plants. The EPA regulation did not include a limitation on emissions of nitrous oxide (a greenhouse gas).

Regulatory Permits and Approvals

We hold numerous environmental and mining permits authorizing operations at our facilities. A decision by a government agency to deny
or delay issuing a new or renewed material permit or approval, or to revoke or substantially modify an existing permit, could have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue operations at
the affected facility. Any future expansion of our existing operations is also predicated upon securing the necessary environmental or other permits or approvals.









CF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.

With
the completion of our recent phosphogypsum stack expansion project, this stack has sufficient capacity to meet our requirements through 2026 at current operating rates and subject
to regular renewals of our operating permits. Including additional expansion phases, the estimated stack system capacity is expected to meet our requirements until 2040 at current operating rates and
is subject to securing the corresponding operating permits. This date is approximately six years beyond our current estimate of available phosphate rock reserves at our Hardee mine. A decision by the
state or federal authorities to deny a renewal of our current permits or to deny operating permits for the expansion of our stack system could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
condition, results of operations and cash flows.

In
certain cases, as a condition to procuring such permits and approvals, we may be required to comply with financial assurance regulatory requirements. The purpose of these requirements
is to assure that sufficient company funds will be available for the ultimate closure, post-closure care and/or reclamation at our facilities. We currently utilize a trust established for the benefit
of the EPA and the FDEP and an escrow account established for the benefit of the FDEP as a means of complying with financial assurance requirements for the closure and long-term care of our
phosphogypsum stack systems. For additional information on the cash deposit arrangements, see Note 10—Asset Retirement Obligations.

Several
of our permits, including our mining permit at the Hardee phosphate complex, require us to reclaim any property disturbed by our operations. At our Hardee property, we currently
mine approximately 300 to 500 acres of land each year, all of which must be reclaimed. The costs to reclaim this land vary based on the type of land involved and range from $4,700 to $19,600 an acre,
with an average of $12,200 an acre. For additional information on our Hardee asset retirement obligations, see Note 10—Asset Retirement Obligations.

Our
phosphate operations in Florida are subject to regulations governing the closure and long-term maintenance of our phosphogypsum stack systems. At the site of our former Bartow
phosphate complex, we estimate that we will spend a total of approximately $5 million between 2014 and 2016 to complete closure of the cooling pond and channels. Water treating expenditures at
Bartow









CF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.

are
estimated to require about $10 million over the next 43 years. Post-closure long-term care expenditures at Bartow are estimated to total approximately $48 million for a
49 year period including 2014. To close the phosphogypsum stack at the Plant City phosphate complex including the recently constructed expansion, we estimate that we will spend approximately
$115 million during the years 2038 through 2042, and another $61 million in 2092 to close the cooling pond. Water treating expenditures at Plant City are estimated to approximate
$6 million in 2018, $80 million in 2038 through 2042, and $198 million thereafter through 2092. Post-closure long-term care expenditures at Plant City are estimated to total
$129 million for a 50 year period commencing in 2043. These amounts are in nominal dollars using an assumed inflation rate of 3%.

Cost
estimates for closure of our phosphogypsum stack systems are based on formal closure plans submitted to the State of Florida, which are subject to revision during negotiations over
the next several years. Moreover, the time frame involved in the closure of our phosphogypsum stack systems extends as far as the year 2092. Accordingly, the actual amount to be spent also will depend
upon factors such as the timing of activities, refinements in scope, technological developments, cost inflation and changes in applicable laws and regulations. These cost estimates may also increase
if the Plant City phosphogypsum stack is expanded further. For additional information on asset retirement obligations related to our phosphogypsum systems, see Note 10—Asset
Retirement Obligations.

Employees and Labor Relations

As of December 31, 2013, we employed approximately 2,800 full-time and 100 part-time employees.
