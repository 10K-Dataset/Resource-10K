Company History

We were founded in 1946 as a fertilizer brokerage operation by a group of regional agricultural cooperatives. During the 1960s, we
expanded our distribution capabilities and diversified into fertilizer manufacturing through the acquisition of several existing plants and facilities. During the 1970s and again during the 1990s, we
expanded our production and distribution capabilities significantly, spending approximately $1 billion in each of these decades.

We
operated as a traditional supply cooperative until 2002, when we adopted a new business model that established financial performance as our principal objective, rather than assured
supply to our owners. A critical aspect of the new business model was to establish a more economically driven approach to the marketplace.

In
August 2005, we completed our initial public offering (IPO) of common stock and listing on the New York Stock Exchange. We sold approximately 47.4 million shares of our common
stock in the offering and received net proceeds of approximately $715.4 million. In connection with the IPO, we consummated a reorganization transaction whereby we ceased to be a cooperative
and our pre-IPO owners' equity interests in CF Industries, Inc., now our wholly-owned subsidiary, were cancelled in exchange for all of the proceeds of the offering and
approximately 7.6 million shares of our common stock.

In
April 2010, we acquired Terra pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger for a total purchase price of $4.6 billion, which was paid in cash and shares of our common stock. As
a result of the Terra acquisition, we acquired five nitrogen fertilizer manufacturing facilities, a 75% interest in another nitrogen fertilizer manufacturing facility and certain joint venture
interests.









CF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.

Operating Segments

Our business is divided into two operating segments, the nitrogen segment and the phosphate segment. The nitrogen segment includes the
manufacture and sale of ammonia, urea, UAN and AN. The phosphate segment includes the manufacture and sale of DAP and MAP.

Nitrogen Segment

We are the largest nitrogen fertilizer producer in North America. Our primary nitrogen fertilizer products are ammonia, urea, UAN and
AN. Our historical sales of nitrogen fertilizer products are shown in the following table. The sales shown do not reflect amounts used internally, such as ammonia, in the manufacture of other
products.

Gross
margin for the nitrogen segment was $1,026.7 million, $784.2 million and $770.3 million for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008,
respectively. Total assets for the nitrogen segment were $6,147.5 million and $689.9 million as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.

We
operate seven nitrogen fertilizer production facilities in North America. We own five of those production facilities, four in the Central United States and one in Ontario, Canada. We
also have a 75% interest in TNCLP and its subsidiary, TNLP, which owns a nitrogen fertilizer facility in Verdigris, Oklahoma, and a 66% economic interest in CFL, a variable interest entity that owns
the nitrogen fertilizer complex in Medicine Hat, Alberta, Canada. In 2010, the combined production capacity of these seven facilities represented approximately 39% of North American ammonia capacity,
34% of North American dry urea capacity, 47% of North American UAN capacity and 22% of North American ammonium nitrates products capacity. Each of our nitrogen fertilizer production facilities in
North America has on-site storage to provide flexibility to manage the flow of outbound shipments without impacting production.

Our
joint venture interests in PLNL and GrowHow provide additional production capacity in three additional nitrogen fertilizer production facilities, one located in the Republic of
Trinidad and Tobago and two located in the United Kingdom.

CF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.

Nitrogen Fertilizer Raw Materials

Natural gas is the principal raw material and primary fuel source used in the ammonia production process at our nitrogen fertilizer
manufacturing facilities. In 2010, natural gas accounted for approximately 45% of our total cost of sales for nitrogen fertilizers and a higher percentage of cash production costs (total production
costs less depreciation and amortization). Our nitrogen fertilizer manufacturing facilities access abundant, competitively-priced natural gas through a reliable network of pipelines that are connected
to major natural gas trading hubs near the facilities. We have facilities located at or near Henry Hub in Louisiana, Oneok in Oklahoma, AECO in Alberta, Ventura in Iowa and Dawn in Ontario.

Our
nitrogen manufacturing facilities consume, in the aggregate, in excess of 250 million MMBtus of natural gas annually. We employ a combination of spot and term purchases from a
variety of quality suppliers to maintain a reliable, competitively-priced supply of natural gas. We also use certain financial instruments to hedge natural gas prices. For further information about
our natural gas hedging activities, see Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 28—Derivative Financial Instruments.

Nitrogen Fertilizer Distribution

The safe, efficient and economical distribution of nitrogen fertilizer products is critical for successful operations. Our nitrogen
fertilizer production facilities have access to multiple transportation modes by which we ship fertilizer to terminals, warehouses and customers. Each of our production facilities has a unique
distribution pattern based on production capability and location.

All
seven of our North American production facilities can ship products via truck and rail to customers and our storage facilities in the U.S. and Canada, with access to our leased
railcar fleet that currently approximates 5,000 tank and hopper cars, as well as railcars provided by rail carriers.

The
North American waterway system is also used extensively to ship products from our Donaldsonville, Verdigris and Yazoo City facilities. We employ a fleet of ten leased tow boats and
32 river barges to ship ammonia and UAN, consisting of 26 leased barges and six owned ammonia barges. We also utilize contract marine services to move urea and phosphate fertilizers.

Three
of our nitrogen production facilities also have access to pipelines for the transportation of ammonia. The Donaldsonville facility is connected to the 2,000-mile long
Nustar pipeline through which we transport ammonia to over 20 terminals and shipping points located in the Midwestern U.S. Corn Belt. Our Verdigris and Port Neal facilities are connected
to the 1,100-mile long Magellan ammonia pipeline that also serves the U.S. Midwest.







CF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.

Phosphate Segment

We are a major manufacturer of phosphate fertilizer products. Our main phosphate fertilizer products are DAP and MAP. We also sold
potash fertilizer in 2009 but have ceased sales of this product. Potash results are included in the phosphate segment.

Our
historical sales of phosphate fertilizer products are shown in the table below.

respectively. Total assets for the phosphate segment were $618.3 million and $541.3 million as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.

Our
phosphate fertilizer manufacturing operations are located in central Florida and consist of a phosphate fertilizer chemical complex in Plant City, a phosphate rock mine, a
beneficiation plant and phosphate rock reserves in Hardee County and a deepwater terminal facility in the port of Tampa. We own each of these facilities and properties.

The
following table summarizes our phosphate fertilizer production volumes for the last three years and current production capacities for phosphate-related products.

(1)P2O5is the basic measure of the nutrient content in phosphate fertilizer products.

Hardee County Phosphate Rock Mine

In 1975, we purchased 20,000 acres of land in Hardee County, Florida that was originally estimated to contain in excess of
100 million tons of recoverable rock reserves. Between 1978 and mid-1993, we operated a one million ton per year phosphate rock mine on a 5,000-acre portion of these
reserves.

In
1992, we initiated a project to expand and relocate mining operations to the remaining 15,000-acre area of the reserve property. This phosphate rock mine cost
$135 million and began operations in late 1995. In 1997, we added approximately 20 million tons to our reserve base through









CF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.



an
exchange with a neighboring rock producer. In 1999, we acquired 1,400 acres of land containing an estimated 8 million tons of rock reserves. In 2008, we acquired approximately 800 acres of
land containing an estimated 1.6 million tons of rock reserves, and in 2009, we acquired approximately 175 acres of land containing an estimated 1.4 million tons of rock reserves.

The
table below shows the estimated reserves at the Hardee phosphate complex as of December 31, 2010. Also reflected in the table is the grade of the reserves, expressed as a
percentage of bone phosphate of lime (BPL) and P2O5. The table also reflects the average values of the following material contaminants contained in the reserves: ferrous oxide
(Fe2O3) plus aluminum oxide (Al2O3) and magnesium oxide (MgO).

Our
phosphate reserve estimates are based on geological data assembled and analyzed by our staff geologist as of December 31, 2010. Reserve estimates are updated periodically to
reflect actual phosphate rock recovered, new drilling information and other geological or mining data. Estimates for 99% of the reserves are based on 20-acre density drilling.

Plant City Phosphate Complex

Our Plant City phosphate fertilizer complex is one of the largest phosphate fertilizer facilities in North America. At one million tons
per year, its phosphoric acid capacity represents approximately 10% of the total U.S. capacity. All of Plant City's phosphoric acid is converted into ammonium phosphates (DAP and MAP), representing
approximately 14% of U.S. capacity for ammonium phosphate fertilizer products in 2010. The combination of the Plant City phosphate fertilizer complex and the Hardee mine gives us one of the largest
integrated ammonium phosphate fertilizer operations in North America.

Bartow Phosphate Complex

We own a former phosphate manufacturing complex in Bartow, Florida that ceased production in 1999. The former manufacturing facilities
have since been dismantled and disposed of in accordance with local laws and regulations, the phosphogypsum stack has been closed and the former storage and distribution facilities were sold along
with excess land. We continue to be obligated for the closure of the cooling pond, management of water treatment on the site and providing long-term care for the site in accordance with
regulatory requirements.









CF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.

Phosphate Raw Materials

Phosphate Rock Supply.Phosphate rock is the basic nutrient source for phosphate fertilizers. Approximately 3.5 tons of phosphate rock
are needed to
produce one ton of P2O5(the measure of nutrient content of phosphate fertilizers). Our Plant City phosphate fertilizer complex typically consumes in excess of three million
tons of rock annually. As of December 31, 2010, our Hardee rock mine had approximately 12 years of fully permitted recoverable phosphate reserves remaining at current operating rates. We
have initiated the process of applying for authorization and permits to expand the geographical area at our Hardee property where we can mine. The expanded area has an estimated 34 million tons
of recoverable phosphate reserves. We estimate that we will be able to conduct mining operations at our Hardee property for approximately ten additional years at current operating rates, assuming we
secure the authorization and permits to mine in this area.

Sulfur Supply.Sulfur is used to produce sulfuric acid, which is combined with phosphate rock to produce phosphoric acid. Approximately
three
quarters of a long ton of sulfur is needed to produce one ton of P2O5. Our Plant City phosphate fertilizer complex uses approximately 800,000 long tons of sulfur annually when
operating at capacity. We obtain molten sulfur from several domestic and foreign producers under contracts of varied duration. In 2010, Martin Sulphur, our largest molten sulfur supplier, supplied
approximately 62% of the molten sulfur used at Plant City.

Ammonia Supply.DAP and MAP have a nitrogen content of 18% and 11%, respectively, and a phosphate nutrient content of 46% and 52%,
respectively.
Ammonia is the primary source of nitrogen in DAP and MAP. Operating at capacity, our Plant City phosphate fertilizer complex consumes approximately 400,000 tons of ammonia annually.

The
ammonia used at our Plant City phosphate fertilizer complex is shipped by rail from our ammonia storage facility located in Tampa, Florida. This facility consists of a
38,000-ton ammonia
storage tank, access to a deep-water dock that is capable of discharging ocean-going vessels, and rail and truck loading facilities. In addition to supplying our Plant City phosphate
fertilizer complex, our Tampa ammonia distribution system has the capacity to support ammonia sales to, and distribution services for, other customers. Sales of ammonia from our Tampa terminal are
reported in our nitrogen business segment. The ammonia supply for Tampa is purchased from offshore sources, providing us with access to the broad international ammonia market.

Phosphate Distribution

We operate a phosphate fertilizer warehouse located at a deep-water port facility in Tampa, Florida. Most of the phosphate
fertilizer produced at Plant City is shipped by truck or rail to our Tampa warehouse, where it is loaded onto vessels for shipment to export customers or for transport across the Gulf of Mexico to the
Mississippi River. In 2010, our Tampa warehouse handled approximately 1.2 million tons of phosphate fertilizers, or about 65% of our production. The remainder of our phosphate fertilizer
production is transported by truck or rail directly to customers or to in-market storage facilities.

Phosphate
fertilizer shipped across the Gulf of Mexico to the Mississippi River is transferred into river barges near New Orleans. Phosphate fertilizer in these river barges is
transported to our storage facilities or delivered directly to customers. River transportation is provided primarily under an agreement with one of the major inland river system barge operators.









CF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.

Storage Facilities and Other Properties

At December 31, 2010, we owned or leased space at 85 in-market storage terminals and warehouses located in a
20-state region. Including storage at our production facilities and at the Tampa warehouse and ammonia terminal, we have an aggregate storage capacity for approximately three million tons
of fertilizer. Our storage capabilities are summarized in the following table.

our nitrogen segment, our primary North American-based competitors are Agrium and Koch Nitrogen Fertilizers. There is also significant competition from product sourced from other
regions of









CF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.



the
world, including some with lower natural gas costs. Because urea is a widely-traded fertilizer product and there are limited barriers to entry, competition from foreign-sourced product is
particularly acute with respect to urea.

In
our phosphate segment, our primary North American-based competitors are Agrium, Mosaic, Potash Corp. and Simplot. Historically, imports have not been a significant factor, as the
United States is a large net exporter of phosphate fertilizers.

Seasonality

The sales patterns of all six of our major products are seasonal. The strongest demand for our products occurs during the spring
planting season, with a second period of strong demand following the fall harvest. We and/or our customers generally build inventories during the low demand periods of the year in order to ensure
timely product availability during the peak sales seasons. Seasonality is greatest for ammonia due to the limited ability of our customers and their customers to store significant quantities of this
product. The seasonality of fertilizer demand generally results in our sales volumes and net sales being the highest during the spring and our working capital requirements being the highest just prior
to the start of the spring season. Our quarterly financial results can vary significantly from one year to the next due to weather-related shifts in planting schedules and purchasing patterns.

Financial Information About Foreign and Domestic Sales and Operations

The amount of net sales attributable to our sales to foreign and domestic markets over the last three fiscal years and the carrying
value of our foreign and domestic assets are set forth in Note 33—Segment Disclosures.

Environment, Health and Safety

We are subject to numerous environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, including laws and regulations relating to land
reclamation; the generation, treatment, storage, disposal and handling of hazardous substances and wastes; and the cleanup of hazardous substance releases. These laws include the Clean Air Act, the
Clean Water Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA), the Toxic Substances Control Act and various
other federal, state, provincial, local and international statutes. Violations can result in substantial penalties, court orders to install pollution-control equipment, civil and criminal sanctions,
permit revocations and facility shutdowns. In addition, environmental, health and safety laws and regulations may impose joint and several liability, without regard to fault, for cleanup costs on
potentially responsible parties who have released or disposed of hazardous substances into the environment.

Environmental Health and Safety Expenditures

Our environmental, health and safety capital expenditures in 2010 were approximately $9.8 million. In 2011, we estimate that we
will spend approximately $46.1 million for environmental, health and safety capital expenditures. Environmental, health and safety laws and regulations are complex, change frequently and have
tended to become more stringent over time. We expect that continued government and public emphasis on environmental issues will result in increased future expenditures for environmental controls at
our operations. Such expenditures could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

RCRA Enforcement Initiative (Plant City Consent Decree)

In August 2010, we reached an agreement with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Florida Department of Environmental
Protection (FDEP) on the terms of a Consent Decree (Plant City Consent Decree) with respect to the Company's Florida phosphate fertilizer complex and its compliance with RCRA. For additional
information on the Plant City Consent Decree, see Note 15—Asset Retirement Obligations.

Clean Air Act—Section 185 Fee

Our Donaldsonville Nitrogen Complex is located in a five-parish region near Baton Rouge, Louisiana that, as of 2005, was
designated as being in "severe" nonattainment with respect to the national ambient air quality standard (NAAQS) for ozone (the "1-hour ozone standard") pursuant to the Federal Clean Air
Act (the Act). Section 185 of the Act requires states, in their state implementation plans, to levy a fee (Section 185 fee) on major stationary sources (such as the Donaldsonville
facility) located in a severe nonattainment area that did not meet the 1-hour ozone standard by November 30, 2005. For additional information on the Section 185 fee, see
Note 32—Contingencies.

Clean Air Act Information Request

On February 26, 2009, the Company received a letter from the EPA under Section 114 of the Federal Clean Air Act
requesting information and copies of records relating to compliance with New Source Review and New Source Performance Standards at the Donaldsonville facility. For additional information on the Clean
Air Act Information Request, see Note 32—Contingencies.

Nitric Acid Consent Decree

In October 2007, a request for information was received from the EPA pursuant to Section 114 of the Clean Air Act with respect
to the nitric acid plant at Port Neal, Iowa. Subsequently, a proposal was made to the EPA to resolve a number of potential Clean Air Act violations associated with prior modifications at Terra's other
nitric acid plants. An agreement in principle has been reached with the EPA to resolve this matter, and on February 11, 2011, we executed a consent decree that if finalized, will require the
Company to achieve compliance with significantly lower nitrogen oxide emission standards. The consent decree has yet to be executed by representatives of the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ), the EPA,
as well as the state governments in which each of the nitric acid plants are located and therefore is not final at this time. For additional information on the Nitric Acid Consent Decree, see
Note 32—Contingencies.

Clean Air Act Investigation.

By letter dated June 16, 2010, the Company received a Notice of Violation (NOV) from the EPA alleging violations of the
Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) Clean Air Act regulations relating to certain projects undertaken at the Company's sulfuric acid plants at its Plant City, Florida facility. For
additional information on the Clean Air Act Investigation, see Note 32—Contingencies.

EPCRA/CERCLA Investigation

By letter dated July 6, 2010, the EPA issued to the Company a NOV alleging violations of the Emergency Planning and Community
Right-to-know Act (EPCRA) and CERCLA. For additional information on the EPCRA/CERCLA Investigation, see Note 32—Contingencies.









CF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.

CERCLA/Remediation Matters

From time to time, we receive notices from governmental agencies or third parties alleging that we are a potentially responsible party
at certain cleanup sites under CERCLA or other environmental cleanup laws. In 2002 and in 2009, we were asked by the current owner of a former phosphate mine and processing facility that we are
alleged to have operated in the late 1950s and early 1960s located in Georgetown Canyon, Idaho, to contribute to a remediation of this property. For additional information on the CERCLA/Remediation
matters, see Note 32—Contingencies.

Challenge to Federal Numeric Nutrient Criteria Regulation

On August 18, 2009, the EPA entered into a consent decree with environmental groups with respect to the promulgation of numeric
criteria for nitrogen and phosphorous in surface waters in Florida. The EPA adopted final numeric nutrient criteria for lakes and inland flowing waters on November 14, 2010, which criteria will
become effective March 6, 2012. The EPA intends to propose numeric nutrient criteria for coastal and estuarine waters in 2011 and finalize such criteria in 2012. For additional information on
the Challenge to Federal Numeric Nutrient Criteria Regulation, see Note 32—Contingencies.

Legislation and Regulation of Greenhouse Gasses

Currently, we are subject to regulations in the United Kingdom, Canada and the United States concerning climate change and greenhouse
gas (GHG) emissions. For information regarding this issue, refer to Item 1A, Risk Factors.

Regulatory Permits and Approvals

We hold numerous environmental and mining permits authorizing operations at our facilities. A decision by a government agency to deny
or delay issuing a new or renewed material permit or approval, or to revoke or substantially modify an existing permit, could have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue operations at
the affected facility. Any future expansion of our existing operations is also predicated upon securing the necessary environmental or other permits or approvals.

As
of December 31, 2010, the area permitted for mining at our Hardee phosphate complex had approximately 42.4 million tons of recoverable phosphate rock reserves, which we
expect to meet our requirements, at current production rates, for approximately 12 years. We have secured the necessary permits to mine these reserves from the FDEP and the U.S. Army Corps of
Engineers. We have initiated the process of applying for authorization and permits to expand the geographical area in which we can mine at our Hardee property. The expanded geographical area has an
estimated additional 34 million tons of recoverable phosphate reserves, which we expect will allow us to conduct mining operations at our Hardee property for approximately ten additional years
at current operating rates, assuming we secure the authorization and permits to mine in this area. The estimated recoverable phosphate reserves are reflective of the anticipated permittable mining
areas based on recent similar permitting efforts. In Florida, local community participation has become an important factor in the authorization and permitting process for mining companies. A denial of
the authorizations or permits to continue and/or expand our mining operations at our Hardee property would prevent us from mining all of our reserves and have a material adverse effect on our
business, financial condition and results of operations.

Likewise,
our phosphogypsum stack system at Plant City has sufficient capacity to meet our requirements through 2014 at current operating rates and subject to regular renewals of our
operating permits. We have secured the local development authorization to increase the capacity of this stack









CF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.



system.
Based on this authorization, estimated stack system capacity is expected to meet our requirements until 2040 at current operating rates and is subject to securing the corresponding operating
permits. This time frame is approximately eight years beyond our current estimate of available phosphate rock reserves at our Hardee mine. A decision by the state or federal authorities to deny a
renewal of our current permits or to deny operating permits for the expansion of our stack system could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

In
certain cases, as a condition to procuring such permits and approvals, we may be required to comply with financial assurance regulatory requirements. The purpose of these requirements
is to assure that sufficient company funds will be available for the ultimate closure, post-closure care and/or reclamation at our facilities. We currently utilize a trust established for
the benefit of the EPA and the FDEP and an escrow account established for the benefit of the FDEP as a means of complying with financial assurance requirements for the closure and
long-term care of our phosphogypsum stack systems. For additional information on the cash deposit arrangements, see Note 15—Asset Retirement Obligations.

Several
of our permits, including our mining permit at the Hardee phosphate complex, require us to reclaim any property disturbed by our operations. At our Hardee property, we currently
mine approximately 300 to 400 acres of land each year, all of which must be reclaimed. The costs to reclaim this land vary based on the type of land involved and range from $3,700 to $18,000 an acre,
with an average of $9,800 an acre. For additional information on our Hardee asset retirement obligations, see Note 15—Asset Retirement Obligations.

Our
phosphate operations in Florida are subject to regulations governing the closure and long-term maintenance of our phosphogypsum stack systems. At our Bartow phosphate
complex, we estimate that we will spend a total of approximately $2 million between 2011 and 2016 to complete closure of the cooling pond and channels. Water treating expenditures at Bartow are
estimated to require about $14 million over the next 46 years. Post-closure long-term care expenditures at Bartow are estimated to total approximately
$51 million for a 52 year period including 2011. To close the phosphogypsum stack currently in use at the Plant City phosphate complex, we estimate that we will spend approximately
$65 million during the years 2033 through 2037, and another $45 million in 2087 to close the cooling pond. Water treating expenditures at Plant City are estimated to approximate
$6 million in 2018, $64 million in 2033 through 2037, and $167 million thereafter through 2087. Post-closure long-term care expenditures at Plant City are
estimated to total $107 million for a 50 year period commencing in 2038. These amounts are in nominal dollars using an assumed inflation rate of 3%.

Cost
estimates for closure of our phosphogypsum stack systems are based on formal closure plans submitted to the State of Florida, which are subject to revision during negotiations over
the next several years. Moreover, the time frame involved in the closure of our phosphogypsum stack systems extends as far as the year 2087. Accordingly, the actual amount to be spent also will depend
upon factors such as the timing of activities, refinements in scope, technological developments, cost inflation and changes in applicable laws and regulations. These cost estimates may also increase
if the Plant City phosphogypsum stack is expanded further. For additional information on asset retirement obligations related to our phosphogypsum systems, see Note 15—Asset
Retirement Obligations.

Employees and Labor Relations

As of December 31, 2010, we had approximately 2,400 full-time and 100 part-time employees.
