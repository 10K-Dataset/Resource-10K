ITEM 1.BUSINESS



Overview



ServiceNow is a leading provider of cloud-based services to automate and manage IT service relationships across the global enterprise. Our services include a suite of IT service automation applications built on our proprietary platform that can be rapidly deployed and configured. Customers use our services to create a single system of record for enterprise IT, automate manual tasks, standardize processes and consolidate legacy systems. Using ServiceNow, IT departments can accelerate their shift from  managing IT infrastructure to managing IT service relationships across the enterprise with greater transparency, accountability and auditability. Our proprietary platform enables our customers to create custom applications and evolve the IT service model to service domains inside and outside the enterprise.



We offer our services under a Software-as-a-Service, or SaaS, business model. Customers access our services over the Internet through an easy-to-use, consumer-like interface. We provide our services from servers we manage in co-location facilities. Service upgrades are designed to be compatible with configuration changes and applied with minimal disruption to ongoing operations. Our multi-instance architecture has proven scalability for global enterprises, as well as advantages in security, reliability and deployment location.



We primarily market our services to large enterprises in a wide variety of industries, including financial services, consumer products, IT services, health care and technology. We sell our services through direct field sales and indirect channel sales. We also provide implementation services to customers through our professional services experts and a network of partners.



We were incorporated as Glidesoft, Inc. in California in June 2004 and changed our name to Service-now.com in February 2006. In May 2012, we reincorporated into Delaware as ServiceNow, Inc.



In February 2012, we changed our fiscal year-end from June 30 to December 31. Throughout this filing, references to “fiscal 2009,” “fiscal 2010” and “fiscal 2011” are to the fiscal years ended June 30, 2009, 2010 and 2011, while references to 2011, 2012, 2013 and 2014 refer to the respective years ending on December 31.



Transforming IT



All too often, legacy IT service management products are inflexible and IT demands from lines of business and shared services in the enterprise are unmet. The result has been the proliferation of applications outside the control of the IT organization. IT organizations have often lacked visibility into the full range of applications being used across the enterprise, and have been confronted with the challenge of managing disparate systems and the underlying infrastructure. Further, this fragmentation has resulted in an inability to audit, govern and meet compliance obligations. Work that should flow smoothly from one process to the next with easy-to-use technology and full transparency is forced to migrate through different, opaque and complex data models, interfaces and technologies, often with human involvement.



At the same time, workers are demanding consumer-friendly IT applications that can be customized to meet business requirements.  Users in the enterprise are coming to expect the same intuitive experience with applications they use at work as they have with applications they use at home.

Our Service Automation Platform



The ServiceNow Service Automation Platform is a highly configurable, easy-to-use and extensible cloud platform built on an enterprise-grade infrastructure. All ServiceNow applications, as well as custom applications created by ServiceNow customers and partners, are built on this common, underlying platform. All of these applications leverage one user interface, one code base and one data model to create a single system of record for IT and the enterprise.



Our Technology



We designed our cloud-based service to support large global enterprises. The architecture, design, deployment and management of our services are focused on:



Scalability. Our services are designed to support concurrent user sessions within a global enterprise.  Across our customer base we process billions of record-producing transactions per month and manage multiple petabytes of data while enabling best-in-class transaction processing time.



Availability. Our customers are highly dependent on our services for the day-to-day operations of their IT infrastructure. Our services are designed as an “always on” solution.



Security and Compliance.  We employ a number of technologies, policies and procedures designed to protect customer data. We offer services that have received SSAE 16 (SOC1 Type 1 and  Type 2), SOC 2 and ISO 27001 third-party attestation. Our U.S. federal services have received a FISMA Moderate Authorization (ATO) attestation that can be used by our U.S. federal customer base. Additionally, our data centers have an ISO27001 or SSAE16 attestation or equivalent.



We have a standardized Java-based development environment with the majority of our software written in industry standard software programming languages. We also use Web 2.0 technologies like AJAX and HTML that give users an intuitive and familiar experience. Our hardware primarily consists of industry standard servers and network components. Our standard operating system and database are Linux and MySQL, respectively, and the system is highly portable across multiple platforms including Microsoft Windows, Microsoft SQL Server and Oracle databases.










Unlike many SaaS vendors, we operate a multi-instance architecture that provides all customers with dedicated applications and databases. Most customers run on shared infrastructure servers while larger customers may run on dedicated servers. This architecture reduces risk associated with infrastructure outages, improves system scalability and security, and allows for flexibility in deployment location. We are also investing in enhancements to our cloud architecture, which are designed to provide all our customers with increased data reliability and availability.



For an increased subscription fee, we offer our customers the option to be deployed on dedicated hardware in our data centers. In limited circumstances, we grant certain customers the right to deploy our subscription service on the customers' own servers without significant penalty. Our multi-instance architecture gives us the added flexibility to deploy our applications on-premises at a customer data center in order to support regulatory or security requirements. When our software is installed at the customer site, we define the hardware requirements that the customers must install and manage. We then work with the customers to remotely install the applications and provide ongoing customer support in a similar way to how we support customer instances deployed in our own managed data centers. A small percentage of our customers run an on-premises solution.



Sales and Marketing



We sell our services through direct field sales and indirect channel sales. Our primary sales channel is direct sales, and we also partner with systems integrators, managed services providers and resale partners, particularly in less developed markets. In the past year we have made significant investments in direct sales in many markets outside of the United States, and we intend to continue to invest in our direct sales force globally.



Our marketing efforts and lead generation activities consist primarily of customer referrals, Internet advertising, trade shows, industry events and press releases. We also host our annual Knowledge global user conference, and webinars where customers and partners both participate in and present a variety of programs designed to help accelerate marketing success with our services and platform.



We are investing in new geographies, including investment in direct and indirect sales channels, professional services capabilities, customer support resources and implementation partners. In addition to adding new geographies, we also plan to increase our investment in our existing locations in order to achieve scale efficiencies in our sales and marketing efforts.



Customers



We primarily market our services to large enterprises. We have proven scalability supporting large enterprise-wide deployments.  As ofDecember 31, 2013, we had2,061customers that operate in a wide variety of industries, including financial services, consumer products, IT services, health care and technology.Nosingle customer accounted for more than 10% of our revenue for any of the periods presented.



Backlog



Backlog represents future amounts to be invoiced under our agreements and is not included in deferred revenue.  As ofDecember 31, 2013and2012, we had backlog of approximately$608 millionand$379 million, respectively. We expect backlog will change from period to period for several reasons, including the timing and duration of customer subscription and professional services agreements, varying billing cycles of subscription agreements, and the timing of customer renewals.



Financial Information about Segments and Geographic Areas



We manage our operations and allocate resources as a single reporting segment. For information regarding our revenue, revenue by geographic area and long-lived assets by geographic area, please refer to Note 2 and Note 18 to our consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. For financial information about our segment, please refer to the section entitled “Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Item 7 of Part II and to our consolidated financial statements and the related notes in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. For information regarding risks associated with our international operations, please refer to the section entitled “Risk Factors” in Item 1A of Part I in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.



Data Center Operations



We currently run our services from data centers located in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Switzerland, and Australia. We are also in the process of establishing a data center in Brazil. Our data centers operate in a mirrored








configuration to provide high availability. We plan to add data centers, or expand our existing data center operations, as required to meet regulatory requirements and accommodate growth.



Research and Development



Our research and development organization is responsible for the design, development, testing and certification of our services. We focus on developing new services and core technologies and further enhancing the functionality, reliability, performance and flexibility of existing solutions. We focus our efforts on anticipating customer demand and then bringing new services and new versions of existing services to market quickly in order to remain competitive in the marketplace.  We have made, and will continue to make, significant investments in research and development to strengthen our existing applications, expand the number of applications on our platform and develop additional automation technologies.



Competition



The markets in which we compete to automate and manage IT service relationships are fragmented, rapidly evolving and highly competitive, with relatively low barriers to entry. As the market for automating and managing IT service relationships matures, we expect competition to intensify. We face competition from in-house solutions, large integrated systems vendors, and established and emerging SaaS and software vendors. Our competitors vary in size and in the breadth and scope of the products and services offered.  Our primary competitors include BMC Software, Inc., CA, Inc., Hewlett-Packard Company and International Business Machines Corporation. Further, other potential competitors not currently offering competitive products may expand their services to compete with our services.  Moreover, as we expand the breadth of our services to include offerings for service domains outside of IT, and offerings for small and medium sized businesses, we face and will face additional competition from platform vendors including Salesforce.com and from application development vendors focused on these other markets.



The principal competitive factors in our industry include total cost of ownership, product functionality, breadth of offerings, flexibility and performance. We believe that we compete favorably with our competitors on each of these factors. However, our competitors may be able to respond more quickly and effectively than we can to new or changing opportunities, technologies, standards and customer requirements.  An existing competitor or new entrant could introduce new technology that reduces demand for our services.  In addition, some of our competitors offer their products or services at a lower price, which has resulted in pricing pressures.  Some of our larger competitors have the operating flexibility to bundle competing products and services with other software offerings, including offering them at a lower price as part of a larger sale.



Intellectual Property



We rely upon a combination of copyright, trade secret and trademark laws and contractual restrictions, such as confidentiality agreements and licenses, to establish and protect our proprietary rights.  In addition, we have recently begun to seek patent protection for our technology. We pursue the registration of our domain names and trademarks and service marks in the United States and in certain locations outside the United States.



Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or obtain and use our technology to develop products and services that provide features and functionality that are similar to our service offerings. Policing unauthorized use of our technology is difficult. The laws of the countries in which we market our services may offer little or no effective protection of our proprietary technology. Our competitors could also independently develop services equivalent to ours, and our intellectual property rights may not be broad enough for us to prevent competitors from doing so. Reverse engineering, unauthorized copying or other misappropriation of our proprietary technology could enable third parties to benefit from our technology without paying us for it, which would significantly harm our business.



Companies in our industry own large numbers of patents, copyrights, trademarks, and trade secrets and frequently enter into litigation based on allegations of infringement, misappropriation or other violations of intellectual property or other rights. We currently face, and we expect we will face in the future, allegations that we have infringed the trademarks, copyrights, patents, trade secrets and other intellectual property rights of third parties, including our competitors and non-practicing entities. As we face increasing competition and as our business grows, we will likely face more claims of infringement. For example, on February 6, 2014, Hewlett-Packard Company filed a lawsuit against us in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California that alleges that some of our services infringe the claims of eight of Hewlett-Packard's patents. For additional information, see Item 1A-Risk Factors in this annual report.










Employees



As ofDecember 31, 2013, we had1,830full-time employees worldwide, including636in operations, professional services, training and customer support,615in sales and marketing,352in research and development and227in general and administrative roles. None of our U.S. employees is represented by a labor union with respect to his or her employment. Employees in certain European countries have the benefits of collective bargaining arrangements at the national level. We have not experienced any work stoppages and we believe our relations with our employees to be good.
