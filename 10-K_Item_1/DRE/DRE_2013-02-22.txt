Item 1.  Business

Background

The General Partner is a self-administered and self-managed REIT, which began operations upon completion of an initial public offering in February 1986.

The Partnership was formed in October 1993, when the General Partner contributed all of its properties and related assets and liabilities, together with the net proceeds of $309.2 million from an offering of an additional 14,000,833 shares of its common stock, to the Partnership. Simultaneously, the Partnership completed the acquisition of Duke Associates, a full-service commercial real estate firm operating in the Midwest whose operations began in 1972. The General Partner is the sole general partner of the Partnership owning

98.4%

of the common Partnership interests ("General Partner Units") as of

December 31, 2012

. The remaining

1.6%

of the common Partnership interests ("Limited Partner Units" and, together with the General Partner Units, the "Common Units") are owned by limited partners. Limited Partners have the right to redeem their Limited Partner Units, subject to certain restrictions. Pursuant to the Fourth Amended and Restated Agreement of Limited Partnership, as amended (the "Partnership Agreement"), the General Partner is obligated to redeem the Limited Partner Units in shares of its common stock, unless it determines in its reasonable discretion that the issuance of shares of its common stock could cause it to fail to qualify as a REIT. Each Limited Partner Unit shall be redeemed for one share of the General Partner's common stock, or, in the event that the issuance of shares could cause the General Partner to fail to qualify as a REIT, cash equal to the fair market value of one share of the General Partner's common stock at the time of redemption, in each case, subject to certain adjustments described in the Partnership Agreement. The Limited Partner Units are not required, per the terms of the Partnership Agreement, to be redeemed in registered shares of the General Partner. The General Partner also owns preferred partnership interests in the Partnership ("Preferred Units" and, together with the Common Units, the "Units").

As ofDecember 31, 2012, our diversified portfolio of 774 rental properties (including 126 jointly controlled in-service properties with more than 25.6 million square feet, 17 consolidated properties under development with approximately 3.6 million square feet and two jointly controlled properties under development with approximately 874,000 square feet) encompasses more than 145.6 million rentable square feet and is leased by a diverse base of approximately 3,100 tenants whose businesses include government services, manufacturing, retailing, wholesale trade, distribution, healthcare and professional services. We also own, including through ownership interests in unconsolidated joint ventures, more than 4,600 acres of land and control an additional 1,600 acres through purchase options.

Our headquarters and executive offices are located in Indianapolis, Indiana. In addition, we have 17 regional offices or significant operations in Alexandria, Virginia; Atlanta, Georgia; Baltimore, Maryland; Chicago, Illinois; Cincinnati, Ohio; Columbus, Ohio; Dallas, Texas; Houston, Texas; Minneapolis, Minnesota; Nashville, Tennessee; Orlando, Florida; Phoenix, Arizona; Raleigh, North Carolina; St. Louis, Missouri; Savannah, Georgia; Tampa, Florida; and Weston, Florida. We had more than 840 employees as ofDecember 31, 2012.

See Item 7, "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" for information related to our operational, asset and capital strategies.

Reportable Operating Segments

We have four reportable operating segments atDecember 31, 2012, the first three of which consist of the ownership and rental of (i) industrial, (ii) office and (iii) medical office real estate investments. The operations of our industrial, office and medical office properties, along with our retail properties, are collectively referred to as "Rental Operations." Our retail properties, as well as any other properties not included in our reportable segments,

do not by themselves meet the quantitative thresholds for separate presentation as reportable segments. The fourth reportable segment consists of various real estate services such as property management, asset management, maintenance, leasing, development, general contractor and construction management to third-party property owners and joint ventures, and is collectively referred to as "Service Operations." Our reportable segments offer different products or services and are managed separately because each segment requires different operating strategies and management expertise. Our Service Operations segment also includes our taxable REIT subsidiary, a legal entity through which certain of the segment's aforementioned operations are conducted.

During 2012, one of the quantitative thresholds was triggered, whereby the assets of our medical office property operating segment exceeded 10% of total assets, which required our medical office property operating segment to be presented as a separate reportable segment. As such, our medical office properties are presented as a separate reportable segment for the year ended December 31, 2012, as well as for the comparative prior periods.

We assess and measure our overall operating results based upon an industry performance measure referred to as Funds From Operations ("FFO"), which management believes is a useful indicator of our consolidated operating performance.  See Item 6, "Selected Financial Data," Item 7, "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" and Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" for disclosures and financial information related to our use of FFO as an internal measure of operating performance.

See Item 6, "Selected Financial Data," Item 7, "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" and Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" for financial information related to our reportable segments.

Competitive Conditions

As a fully integrated commercial real estate firm, we provide in-house leasing, management, development and construction services which we believe, coupled with our significant base of commercially zoned and unencumbered land in existing business parks, should give us a competitive advantage as a real estate operator and in future development activities.

We believe that the management of real estate opportunities and risks can be done most effectively at regional or on local levels. As a result, we intend to continue our emphasis on increasing our market share, in alignment with our asset strategy (see Item 7), and effective rents in the primary markets where we own properties. We believe that this regional focus will allow us to assess market supply and demand for real estate more effectively as well as to capitalize on the strong relationships with our tenant base. In addition, we seek to further capitalize on strong customer relationships to provide third-party construction services across the United States. As a fully integrated real estate company, we are able to arrange for or provide to our industrial, office and medical office customers not only well located and well maintained facilities, but also additional services such as build-to-suit construction, tenant finish construction, and expansion flexibility.

All of our properties are located in areas that include competitive properties. Institutional investors, other REITs or local real estate operators generally own such properties; however, no single competitor or small group of competitors is dominant in our current markets. The supply and demand of similar available rental properties may affect the rental rates we will receive on our properties. Other competitive factors include the attractiveness of the property location, the quality of the property and tenant services provided, and the reputation of the owner and operator. In addition, our Service Operations face competition from a considerable number of other real estate companies that provide comparable services, some of whom may have greater marketing and financial resources than are available to us.

Corporate Governance

Since our inception, we not only have strived to be a top-performer operationally, but also to lead in issues important to investors such as disclosure and corporate governance. The General Partner's system of governance reinforces this commitment and, as a limited partnership that has one general partner owning over 90% of the Partnership's common interest, the governance of the Partnership is necessarily linked to the corporate governance of the General Partner. Summarized below are the highlights of the General Partner's Corporate Governance initiatives.

Recent Federal Income Tax Developments

New Tax Rates for U.S. Individuals, Estates and Trusts

On January 2, 2013, President Obama signed into law the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, or the 2012 Relief Act, which, among other things, permanently extends most of the reduced rates for U.S. individuals, estates and



-5-







trusts with respect to ordinary income, qualified dividends and capital gains that had expired on December 31, 2012. The 2012 Relief Act, however, does not extend all of the reduced rates for high-income taxpayers. Beginning January 1, 2013, in the case of married couples filing joint returns with taxable income in excess of $450,000, heads of households with taxable income in excess of $425,000 and other individuals with taxable income in excess of $400,000, the maximum rates on ordinary income will be 39.6% (as compared to 35% prior to 2013) and the maximum rates on long-term capital gains and qualified dividend income will be 20% (as compared to 15% prior to 2013). REIT dividends generally are not treated as qualified dividend income. Estates and trusts have more compressed rate schedules. Shareholders of the General Partner are urged to consult their tax advisors regarding the effect of the new tax rates and other tax provisions in the 2012 Relief Act on an investment in the General Partner's common stock.

Unearned Income Medicare Tax

Under the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, amending the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, high-income U.S. individuals, estates, and trusts will be subject to an additional 3.8% tax on net investment income in tax years beginning after December 31, 2012. For these purposes, net investment income includes dividends and gains from sales of stock. In the case of an individual, the tax will be 3.8% of the lesser of the individuals' net investment income or the excess of the individuals' modified adjusted gross income over $250,000 in the case of a married individual filing a joint return or a surviving spouse, $125,000 in the case of a married individual filing a separate return, or $200,000 in the case of a single individual. U.S. shareholders that are individuals, estates or trusts should consult their tax advisors regarding the effect, if any, of this legislation on their ownership and disposition of the General Partner's common stock.
