Item 1.  Business.

BUSINESS OVERVIEW

CarMax Background.CarMax, Inc. was incorporated under the laws of the Commonwealth of Virginia in 1996.  CarMax, Inc. is a holding company and our operations are conducted through our subsidiaries.  Our home office is located at 12800 Tuckahoe Creek Parkway, Richmond, Virginia.

Under the ownership of Circuit City Stores, Inc. (“Circuit City”), we began operations in 1993 with the opening of our first CarMax superstore in Richmond, Virginia.  In 1997, Circuit City completed the initial public offering of a tracking stock that was intended to track separately the performance of the CarMax operations.  On October 1, 2002, the CarMax business was separated from Circuit City through a tax-free transaction, becoming an independent, publicly traded company.

CarMax Business.We operate in two reportable segments:  CarMax Sales Operations and CarMax Auto Finance (“CAF”).  Our CarMax Sales Operations segment consists of all aspects of our auto merchandising and service operations, excluding financing provided by CAF.  Our CAF segment consists solely of our own finance operation that provides vehicle financing through CarMax superstores.












CarMax Sales Operations:  We are the nation’s largest retailer of used cars, based on the447,728used vehicles we retailed during the fiscal year ended February 28, 2013.  As of the end of fiscal2013, we operated118 usedcar superstores in58metropolitan markets.  In addition, weare one of the nation’s largest wholesale vehicle auction operators, based on the 324,779wholesale vehicleswe soldthroughouron-site auctionsin fiscal 2013.

We were the first used vehicle retailer to offer a large selection of high quality used vehicles at competitively low, “no-haggle” prices using a customer-friendly sales process in an attractive, modern sales facility.  Our consumer offer allows customers to shop for vehicles the same way they shop for items at other “big-box” retailers.  We provide low, no-haggle prices; a broad selection of CarMax Quality Certified vehicles; and superior customer service.  Our strategy is to revolutionize the auto retailing market by addressing the major sources of customer dissatisfaction with traditional auto retailers and to maximize operating efficiencies through the use of standardized operating procedures and store formats enhanced by sophisticated, proprietary management information systems.

Our consumer offer enables customers to evaluate separately each component of the sales process and to make informed decisions based on comprehensive information about the options, terms and associated prices of each component.  The customer can accept or decline any individual element of the offer without affecting the price or terms of any other component of the offer.  Our no-haggle pricing and our commission structure, which is generally based on a fixed dollars-per-unit standard, allow sales consultants to focus solely on meeting customer needs.

All of the used vehicles we retail are thoroughly reconditioned to meet our high standards, and each vehicle must pass a comprehensive inspection before being offered for sale.  In fiscal 2013,87%of the used vehicles we retailed were 0 to 6 years old.

Vehicles purchased through our in-store appraisal process that do not meet our retail standards are sold to licensed dealers through our on-site wholesale auctions.Unlikemany otherauto auctions, we own all the vehicles that we sell in our auctions, which allows us to maintain a high auction sales rate.  This high sales rate, combined with dealer-friendly practices, makesour auctions an attractive source of vehicles for independent used car dealers.As of February 28, 2013, we conducted weekly or bi-weekly auctions at 57 of our 118 used car superstores.

In addition, we sell new vehicles atfourlocations under franchise agreements withthreenew car manufacturers.  In fiscal2013, new vehicles comprisedonly 2% of our total retail vehicle unit sales.

Our finance program provides customers financing alternatives through CAF, our own finance operation, and third-party financing providers.  This program provides access to credit for customers across a wide range of the credit spectrum.  We believe the company’s processes and systems,transparency of pricing, vehicle quality and the integrity of the information collected at the time the customer applies for credit providea unique and ideal environment in which to originate and procure high quality auto loans.  CAF focuses solely on originating loans through CarMax stores, customizing its offers to meet the customer’s risk profile and ensuring credit availability to support CarMax retail vehicle unit sales.  All of the finance offers by CAF and our third-party providers are backed by a 3‑day payoff offer whereby a customer can refinance their loan within three business days at no charge.

We provide customers with a full range of other related products and services, including the appraisal and purchase of vehicles directly from consumers; the sale of extended service plans (“ESP”), guaranteed asset protection (“GAP”) and accessories; and vehicle repair service.

We have separated the practice of trading in a used vehicle in conjunction with the purchase of another vehicle into two distinct and independent transactions.  We will appraise a consumer’s vehicle and make an offer to buy that vehicle regardless of whether the owner is purchasing a vehicle from us.  We acquire a significant percentage of our retail used vehicle inventory through our in-store appraisal process.  We also acquire a large portion of our used vehicle inventory through wholesale auctions and, to a lesser extent, directly from other sources, including wholesalers, dealers and fleet owners.

Our proprietary inventory management and pricing system tracks each vehicle throughout the sales process.  Using the information provided by this system and applying statistical modeling techniques, we are able to optimize our inventory mix, anticipate future inventory needs at each store, evaluate sales consultant and buyer performance and refine our vehicle pricing strategy.  Because of the pricing discipline afforded by the inventory management andpricing system, generally more than 99% of the entire used car inventory offered at retail is sold at retail.














CarMax Auto Finance:  CAF provides financing to qualified customers purchasing vehicles at CarMax.  Because the purchase of a vehicle is generally reliant on the consumer’s ability to obtain on-the-spot financing, it is important to our business that financing be available to creditworthy customers.  CAF offers financing solely to customers purchasing vehicles at CarMax, and offers qualifying customers an array of competitive rates and terms, allowing them to choose the one that best fits their needs.  We believe CAF enables us to capture additional sales, profits and cash flows while managing our reliance on third-party finance sources.  After the effect of 3-day payoffs and vehicle returns, CAF financed 39% of our retail vehicle unit sales in fiscal 2013.  As of February 28, 2013, CAF servicedapproximately 459,000 customer accountsin its $5.93 billion portfolio of managed receivables.

Industry and Competition.CarMax Sales Operations:The U.S. used car marketplace is highly fragmented and competitive.  According to industry sources,as ofDecember 31, 2012,there were approximately17,800franchisedautomotive dealerships, which sell both new and used vehicles.  In addition, used vehicles were sold byapproximately 37,900 independentused vehicle dealers, as well as millions of private individuals.  Our primaryretailcompetitors are the franchised auto dealers, who sell the majority of late-model used vehicles.  Independent used car dealers predominantly sell older, higher mileage cars than we do.The number of franchised and independent auto dealers has gradually declined over the last decade, in large part due to manufacturers’ franchise and brand terminations, as well as dealership closures caused by the stress of the recession.  Despite this reduction in the number of dealers, the automotive retail environment remains highly fragmented.

Based on industry data, there wereapproximately 38million used cars sold in the U.S. in calendar year2012, of whichapproximately 13millionwere estimated to be late-model, 0- to 6-yearold vehiclesand approximately21 million were 0- to 10-year old vehicles.While we are the largest retailer of used vehicles in the U.S., sellingmore than two timesas many used vehicles as the next largest retailer in calendar2012, we representedapproximately3%ofthe total late-model used units sold.Over the last several years, competition has been affected by the increasing use of Internet-based marketing for both used vehicles and vehicle financing.We seek to distinguish ourselves from traditional dealerships through our consumer offer, sales approach and other innovative operating strategies.

We believe that our principal competitive advantages in used vehicle retailing include our ability to provide a high degree of customer satisfaction with the car-buying experience by virtue of our competitively low, no-haggle prices and our customer-friendly sales process; our breadth of selection of the most popular makes and models available both on site and via our website, carmax.com; the quality of our vehicles; our proprietary information systems; CAF; and the locations of our retail stores.

In addition, we believe our willingness to appraise and purchase a customer’s vehicle, whether or not the customer is buying a car from us, provides us a competitive sourcing advantage for retail vehicles.  Our large volume of appraisal purchases supplies not only a large portion of our retail inventory, but also provide

s

the scale that enables us to conduct our own wholesale auctions to dispose of vehicles that don’t meet our retail standards.

Upon request by a customer, we will transfer virtually any used vehicle in our nationwide inventory to a local superstore.

We believe that we are competitive in all of these areas and that we enjoy advantages

over competitors that employ traditional high-pressure, negotiation-oriented sales techniques.

Our sales consultants play a significant role in ensuring a customer-friendly sales process.  A sales consultant is paid a commission, generally based on a fixed dollars-per-unit standard, thereby earning the same dollar sales commission regardless of the gross profit on the vehicle being sold.  In addition, sales consultants do not receive commissions based on the number of credit approvals or the amount a customer finances.This pay structure aligns our sales associates’ interests with those of our customers, in contrast tootherdealerships where sales and finance personnelmayreceive higher commissions for negotiating higher prices and interest rates or steering customers to vehicles with higher gross profits.

In our wholesale auctions, we compete with other automotive auction houses.In contrast with the highly fragmented used vehicle market, the automotive auction markethastwo primary competitors, Manheim, a subsidiary of Cox Enterprises, and KAR Auction Services, Inc.,representing an estimated70%of the U.S. whole car auction market.  These competitors auction vehicles of all ages, while CarMaxpredominantlysellsolder, higher mileage vehicles.We believetheprincipal competitive advantagesof our wholesale auctionsinclude our high vehicle sales rate, ourvehicleconditiondisclosuresand arbitration policies, our broad geographic distribution and










our dealer-friendly practices.  Because we own the cars that we auction, we generally sellmore than 95% of the vehicles offered, which is substantially higher than the sales rate at most other auto auctions.Our policy of making vehicle condition disclosures, noting mechanical and other issues found during our appraisal process, is also not a typical practice used at other auctions of older, higher mileage vehicles.Together, these factors make our auctions attractive to dealers,resulting inahighdealer-to-car attendance ratio.

CarMax Auto Finance:CAF operates in the auto finance sector of the consumer finance market.  This sector is primarily comprised of banks, captive finance divisions of new car manufacturers, credit unions and independent finance companies.  This sectorrepresented approximately $800 billion in outstanding receivables as of December 31, 2012 according to industry data.  As of February 28, 2013, CAF had $5.93 billion in managed receivables, having originated $3.45 billion in loans during the fiscal year.  For loans originated during the calendar quarter ended December 31, 2012, CAF ranked 20th in market share for all vehicle loans and 9th in market share for used vehicle loans.

CAF’s competitive advantage is its strategic position as the primary finance source in CarMax stores.We believe the company’s processes and systems, transparency of pricing, vehicle quality and the integrity of the information collected at the time the customer applies for credit providea unique and ideal environment in which to procurehigh quality auto loans.  CAF utilizes proprietary scoring models based upon the credit history of the customer along with CAF’s historical experience to predict the likelihood of customer repayment.  Because CAF offers financing solely through CarMax stores, scoring models are optimized for the CarMax channel.

CAF’s primary competitors are banks and credit unions that offer direct financing to customers purchasing cars from dealers.  Some of our customers have already obtained financing prior to shopping for a vehicle and do not apply for financing in the store.  We also offer customers the ability to pay off their loans within three days without penalty.  The percentage of customers exercising this option can be an indication of the competitiveness of our rates.

Marketing and Advertising.Our marketing strategies are focused on developing awareness of the advantages of shopping at our stores and on carmax.com and on attracting customers who are already considering buying or selling a vehicle.  Our marketing strategies are implemented primarily through television and radio broadcasts, carmax.com, Internet search engines and online classified listings.We also reach out to customers and potential customers to build awareness and loyalty through Facebook, Twitter and other social media.Television and radio advertisements are designed to build consumer awareness of the CarMax name, carmax.com and key components of the CarMax offer.  Broadcast and Internet advertisements are designed to drive customers to our stores and to carmax.com.

We strive to adjust our marketing programs in response to the evolving media landscape.  We have customized our marketing program based on awareness levels in each market.  We have transitioned a portion of our television and radio advertising to national cable network and national radio programming and we will continue to seek to optimize our media mix between local and national distribution.  In addition to providing cost savings, this transition allows us to build awareness of CarMax prior to our entrance into new markets.  We are also building awareness and driving traffic to our stores and carmax.com by listing retail vehicles on online classified sites.  Our advertising on the Internet also includes advertisements on search engines, such as Google and Yahoo!, as well as online properties such as Pandora and Hulu.

Our website, carmax.com, is a marketing tool for communicating the CarMax consumer offer in detail, a sophisticated search engine for finding the right vehicle and a sales channel for customers who prefer to complete a part of the shopping and sales process online.  The website offers complete inventory and pricing search capabilities.  Information on each of the thousands of cars available in our nationwide inventory is

updated several times per day.

Carmax.com includes detailed information, such as vehicle photos, prices, features, specifications and store locations, as well as advanced feature-based search capabilities, and sorting and comparison tools that allow consumers to easily compare vehicles.  The site also includes features such as detailed vehicle reviews, payment calculators and email alerts when new inventory arrives.

Virtually any used vehicle in our nationwide inventory can be transferred at customer request to their local superstore.

Customers can contact sales consultants in a variety of ways, including online via carmax.com.  Customers can work with these sales consultants from the comfort of home, including applying for financing, and they need to visit the store only

to complete the final steps of the transaction, such as



signing the paperwork and picking up their vehicle.

We also have a mobile website and mobile apps that allow customers to search for and view cars on their smartphones and other mobile devices.

Our survey data indicates that during fiscal 2013, approximately 80% of customers who purchased a vehic

le from us had first visited us

online.












We also maintain a website, carmaxauctions.com, that supports our wholesale auctions.  This website, which is accessible only by authorized dealers, provides listings of all vehicles that will be available in upcoming auctions.  It also has many features similar to our retail website, including vehicle photos, free vehicle history reports and vehicle search and alert capabilities.

Suppliers for Used Vehicles.We acquire used vehicle inventory directly from consumers through our appraisal process, as well as through other sources, including local, regional and online auctions, wholesalers, franchised and independent dealers and fleet owners, such as leasing companies and rental companies.  The supply of used vehicles is influenced by a variety of factors, including the total number of vehicles in operation; the rate of new vehicle sales, which in turn generate used-car trade-ins; and the number of used vehicles sold or remarketed through retail channels, wholesale transactions and at automotive auctions.

Accordingto industry data,as of December 31, 2012,therewere approximately247million light vehicles in operation in the U.S., including approximately78million vehicles thatwere0 to 6years old.Prior to the recession, generally 16 million to 17 million new vehicles and 40 million to 45 million used vehicles were sold annually in the U.S.  In addition, approximately 9 million to 10 million used vehicles were remarketed annually in wholesale auctions.  During the recession, retail vehicle sales dropped sharply, with calendar year 2009 new car sales falling to 10 million and used car sales to 35 million.  New car sales have gradually improved since 2009, but they remain below pre-recession levels.  The resulting decline in the total supply of 0-6 year old vehicles, combined with a reduction in trade-in activity and fewer off-lease vehicles has resulted in a tighter supply of late-model used vehicles in recent years.  While we have maintained steady access to inventory during this period, the used car supply constraints have resulted in strong wholesale valuations, which have increased our acquisition costs and average selling prices for used vehicles.

Our used vehicle inventory acquired directly from consumers through our appraisal process helps provide an inventory of makes and models that reflects the consumer preferences in each market.  We have replaced the traditional “trade-in” transaction with a process in which a CarMax-trained buyer appraises a customer’s vehicle and provides the owner with a written, guaranteed offer that is good for seven days.An appraisal is available to every customer free of charge, whether or not the customer purchases a vehicle from us.  Based on their age, mileage or condition, fewer than half of the vehiclesacquired through this in-store appraisal process meet our high-quality retail standards.  Those vehicles that do not meet our retail standards are sold to licensed dealers through our on-site wholesale auctions.

The inventory purchasing function is primarily performed at the store level and is the responsibility of the buyers, who handle both on-site appraisals and off-site auction purchases.  Our buyers evaluate all used vehiclesbasedoninternal and external auction data and market sales, as well as estimatedreconditioning costs and, for off-site purchases,transportationcosts.Our buyers, in collaboration with our home office staff,utilizethe extensive inventory and sales trend data available through theCarMax information system to decide which inventory to purchase at off-site auctions.  Our inventory and pricing models help the buyers tailor inventories to the buying preferences at each superstore, recommend pricing adjustments and optimize inventory turnover to help maintain gross profit per unit.

Based on consumer acceptance of the in-store appraisal process, our experience and success in acquiring vehicles from auctions and other sources, and the large size of the U.S. auction market relative to our needs, we believe that sources of used vehicles will continue to be sufficient to meet our current and future needs.

Suppliers for New Vehicles.Our new car operations are governed by the terms of the sales, service and dealer agreements.  Among other things, these agreements generally impose operating requirements and restrictions, including inventory levels, working capital, monthly financial reporting, signage and cooperation with marketing strategies.

Seasonality.Historically,our business has been seasonal.  Typically, our superstores experience their strongest traffic and salesin the spring and summer quarters.  Sales are typically slowest in the fall quarter, when used vehicles generally experience proportionately more of their annual depreciation.  We believe this is partly the result of a decline in customer traffic, as well as discounts on model year closeouts that can pressure pricing for late-model used vehicles.  Customer trafficgenerallytends to slow in the fall as the weather changes and as customers shift their spending priorities.  We typically experience an increase in subprime traffic and sales in February and March, coincident with tax refund season.












Products and Services

Merchandising.We offer customers a broad selection of makes and models of used vehicles, including both domestic and imported vehicles, at competitive prices.  Our used car selection covers popular brands from manufacturers such as Chrysler, Ford, General Motors, Honda, Hyundai, Kia, Mazda, Nissan, Toyota and Volkswagen and luxury brands such as Acura, BMW, Infiniti, Lexus and Mercedes-Benz.Our primary focus isvehicles that are 0 to 6 years old and generally range in price from $12,000 to $34,000.  For the more cost-consciousconsumer, we also offer used cars that are more than 6 years old.The mix of our used vehicle inventory by make, model and age will vary from time to time, depending on consumer preferences.

We have implemented an everyday low-price strategy under which we set no-haggle prices on both our used and new vehicles.  We believe that our pricing is competitive.  Prices on all vehicles are clearly displayed on each vehicle’s information sticker, on carmax.com and on applicable online classified sites on which they are listed.  We extend our no-haggle philosophy to every component of the vehicle transaction, including vehicle appraisal offers, financing rates, accessories, and ESP and GAP pricing.

Wholesale Auctions.Vehicles purchased through our in-store appraisal process that do not meet our retail standards are sold through on-site wholesale auctions.  As of February 28, 2013, wholesale auctions were conducted at 57 of our 118 superstores and were generally held on a weekly or bi-weekly basis.  Auction frequency at a given superstore is determined by the number of vehicles to be auctioned, which depends on the number of stores in that market and the consumer awareness of CarMax and our in-store appraisal offer.  The typical wholesale vehicle is approximately 10 years old and has more than 100,000 miles.  Participants in CarMax auctions must be licensed automobile dealers and are required to register with our centralized auction support group.  The majority of the participants are independent automobile dealers.We provide condition disclosures on each vehicle, including those for vehicles with major mechanical issues, possible frame or flood damage, branded titles, salvage history and unknown true mileage.  Professional, licensed auctioneers conduct our auctions.  The average auction sales rate was 97% in fiscal 2013.  Dealers pay a fee to us based on the sales price of the vehicles they purchase.



Extended Service Plans and Guaranteed Asset Protection.At the time of the sale, we offer the customer an ESP.  We sell these plans on behalf of unrelated third parties that are the primary obligors.  Under the third-party service plan programs, we have no contractual liability to the customer.  The ESPs we offer on all used vehicles provide coverage up to 72 months (subject to mileage limitations) and include multiple mileage and deductible options, depending on the vehicle odometer reading, make and model.  We offer ESPs at competitive, fixed prices, which are based primarily on the historical repair record of the vehicle make and model, the mileage option selected and the deductible chosen.  All ESPs that we sell (other than manufacturer programs) have been designed to our specifications and are administered by the third parties through private-label arrangements.  We receive a commission from theadministrator at the timeof sale.In fiscal 2013,more than60%of the customerswhopurchaseda used vehicle also purchased anESP.

OurESPcustomers have access to vehicle repair service at each CarMax store andat thousands ofindependentand franchisedservice providers.  We believe that the quality of the services provided by this network, as well as the broad scope of ourESPs, helps promote customer satisfaction and loyalty,and thus increases the likelihood of repeat andreferral business.

We also offer GAP at the time of the sale.  GAP is a product that will pay the difference between the customer’s insurance settlement and the finance contract payoff amount on their vehicle in the case of a total loss or unrecovered theft.  We sell this product on behalf of an unrelated third party that is the primary obligor, and we have no contractual liability to the customer.  GAP has been designed to our specifications and is administered by the third party through a private-label arrangement.  We receive a commission from the administrator at the time of sale.  Infiscal 2013, more than 20% of customers who purchased a used vehicle also purchased GAP.

Reconditioning and Service.An integral part of our used car consumer offer is the renewal process used to make sure every car meets our high standards before it can become a CarMax Quality Certified (CQC) vehicle.This process includes a comprehensive CarMax Quality Inspection ofthe engine and all major systems, including cooling, fuel, drivetrain, transmission, electronics, suspension, brakes, steering, air conditioning and other equipment, as well as the interior and exterior of the vehicle.  Based on this quality inspection, we determine the reconditioning necessary to bring the vehicle up to our quality standards.  We perform most routine mechanical and minor body repairs in-house; however, for some reconditioning services, we engage third parties specializing in those services.  Manysuperstoresdepend upon nearby, typically larger, superstores forreconditioning, which increases efficiency and reduces overhead.












All CarMax used car superstores provide vehicle repair service, including repairs of vehicles covered by our ESPs.  We also provide factory-authorized service at all new car franchises.  We have developed systems and procedures that are intended to ensure that our retail repair service is conducted in the same customer-friendly and efficient manner as our other operations.

We believe that the efficiency of our reconditioning and service operations is enhanced by our modern facilities, our information systems and our technician training and development process.  The training and development process and our compensation programs are designed to increase the productivity of technicians, identify opportunities for waste reduction and achieve high-quality repairs.  Our information systems allow us to track repair history and enable trend analysis, which guides our continuous improvement efforts.

Customer Credit.We offerfinancing alternatives forretailcustomers across a wide range of the credit spectrum through CAF and our arrangements with several industry-leading financial institutions.Webelieveour program enables us to capture additional sales andenhances the CarMax consumer offer.Credit applications are initially reviewed by CAF.  Customers who are not approved by CAFmay beevaluated bythe other financial institutions.Having anarray of financesources increases discrete approvals,expandsfinance opportunitiesfor our customersand mitigates risk to CarMax.In fiscal 2013,90%of our applicants received an approval from one or more of our sources.  Weperiodically test additional third-party providers.

Retail customers applying for financing provide credit information that is electronically submitted by sales consultants throughour proprietary information system.A majority of applicants receive a response withinfive minutes.Vehicles arefinancedusingretail installment contractssecured by the vehicles.Customers are permitted to refinance or pay off theircontractwithin three business days of a purchase without incurring any finance or related charges.Depending on the credit profile of the customer, third-partyfinanceprovidersgenerally either pay us or are paid a fixed, pre-negotiated fee per contract.  The fee amount is independent of any finance term offered to the customer; it does not vary based on the amount financed, the term of the loan, the interest rate or the loan-to-value ratio.  We refer to the providers who pay us a fee as prime and nonprime providers, and we refer to the providers to whom we pay a fee as subprime providers.We have no recourse liability on retailinstallment contractsarranged with third-partyproviders.

We do not offer financing to dealers purchasing vehicles at our wholesale auctions.  However, we have made arrangements to have third-party financing available to our auction customers.

Systems

Our proprietary inventory management and pricing system is centralized and allows us to buy the mix of makes, models, age, mileage and price points tailored to customer buying preferences at each CarMax location.  This system also generates recommended initial retail price points, as well as retail price markdowns for specific vehicles based on complex algorithms that take into account factors including sales history, consumer interest and seasonal patterns.  We believe this systematic approach to vehicle pricing allows us to optimize inventory turns, which minimizes the depreciation risk inherent in used cars and helps us to achieve our targeted gross profit dollars per unit.












Our Electronic Repair Order system (“ERO”) is used to sequence reconditioning procedures.  ERO provides information that helps increase quality and reduce costs, which further enhances our customer service and profitability.

Through our centralized systems, we are able to quickly integrate new stores into our store network.  We continue to enhance and refine our information systems, which we believe to be a core competitive advantage.  The design of our information systems incorporates off-site backups, redundant processing and other measures to reduce the risk of significant data loss in the event of an emergency or disaster.

Associates

On February 28, 2013, we had a total of18,111full- and part-time associates, including13,705hourly and salaried associates and4,406salesassociates, who worked on a commission basis.  We employ additional associates during peak selling seasons.As of February28, 2013, our location general managers averaged10yearsof CarMax experience, in addition to prior retail management experience.We staff each newly opened store with associates who have extensive CarMax training.

We believe we have created a unique corporate culture and maintain good employee relations.  No associate is subject to a collective bargaining agreement.  We focus on providing our associates with the information and resources they need to offer exceptional customer service.  We reward associates whose behavior exemplifies our culture, and we believe that our favorable working conditions and compensation programs allow us to attract and retain highly qualified individuals.  We have been recognized for the success of our efforts by a number of external organizations.

Training.To further support our emphasis on attracting, developing and retaining qualified associates, we have made a commitment to providing exceptional training programs.  Store associates receive many hours of structured, self-paced training that introduces them to company policies and their specific job responsibilities through KMX University (“KMXU”) – our intranet-based, on-premises learning management system.  KMXU is comprised of customized applications hosted within a learning management system that allow us to author, deliver and track training events and to measure associate competency after training.  KMXU also provides a variety of learning activities and collaborative discussions delivered through an integrated virtual classroom system.  Most new store associates are also assigned mentors who provide on-the-job guidance and support.

We also provide comprehensive, facilitator-led classroom training courses at the associate and manager levels.  All new sales consultants go through an on-boarding process in which they are partnered with a mentor; combining self-paced online training with shadowing and role-playing.  Our professional selling principles (“PSPs”) provide all sales associates the opportunity to learn and practice customer-oriented selling techniques.  This online training program contains modules on a variety of skill sets, including building confidence, connecting with the customer, and listening and persuasion techniques.KMXU also provides access to hundreds of short video-based learning modules that provide focused behavioral examples supporting the PSPs.We also have a call recording and review program to provide constructive feedback to associates on how to improve their interactions with customers.

Buyers-in-training undergo a 6‑ to 18‑month apprenticeship under the supervision of experienced buyers, and they generally will assist with the appraisal of more than 1,000 cars before making their first independent purchase.  Business office associates undergo a 3‑ to 6‑month, on-the-job certification process in order to be fully cross-trained in all functional areas of the business office.  All business office associates and managers also receive regular training through facilitated competency-based training courses.  Reconditioning and service technicians attend in-house and vendor-sponsored training programs designed to develop their skills in performing repairs on the diverse makes and models of vehicles we sell and service.  Technicians at our new car franchises also attend manufacturer-sponsored training programs to stay abreast of current diagnostic, repair and maintenance techniques for those manufacturers’ vehicles.New managers complete intensive training where they meet with senior leaders, participate in hands-on activities and learn fundamental CarMax leadership skills.
