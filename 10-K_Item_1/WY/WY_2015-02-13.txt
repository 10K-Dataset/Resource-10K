Item 1. Business

OUR BUSINESS

We are one of the world's largest private owners of timberlands. We own or control nearly7 millionacres of timberlands, primarily in the U.S., and manage additional timberlands under long-term licenses in Canada. We manage these timberlands on a sustainable basis in compliance with internationally recognized forestry standards. We are also one of the largest manufacturers of wood and specialty cellulose fibers products. Our company is a real estate investment trust (REIT).

We are committed to operate as a sustainable company and are listed on the Dow Jones World Sustainability Index. We focus on increasing energy and resource efficiency, reducing greenhouse gas emissions, reducing water consumption, conserving natural resources, and offering products that meet human needs with superior sustainability attributes. We operate with world class safety results, understand and address the needs of the communities in which we operate, and present ourselves transparently.

In2014, we generated$7.4 billionin net sales and employed approximately12,800people who serve customers worldwide.

This portion of our Annual Report and Form 10-K provides detailed information about who we are, what we do and where we are headed. Unless otherwise specified, current information reported in this Form 10-K is as of the fiscal year endedDecember 31, 2014.

We break out financial information such as revenues, earnings and assets by the business segments that form our company. We also discuss the development of our company and the geographic areas where we do business.

Throughout this Form 10-K, unless specified otherwise, references to “we,” “our,” “us” and “the company” refer to the consolidated company.





WE CAN TELL YOU MORE

AVAILABLE INFORMATION

We meet the information-reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 by filing periodic reports, proxy statements and other information with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). These reports and statements — information about our company’s business, financial results and other matters — are available at:

•the SEC website — www.sec.gov;

•the SEC’s Public Conference Room, 100 F St. N.E., Washington, D.C., 20549, (800) SEC-0330; and

•our website — www.weyerhaeuser.com.

When we file the information electronically with the SEC, it also is added to our website.





WHO WE ARE

We started out as Weyerhaeuser Timber Company, incorporated in the state of Washington in January 1900, when Frederick Weyerhaeuser and 15 partners bought 900,000 acres of timberland. Today, we are working to grow a truly great company for our shareholders, customers and employees. We grow and harvest trees and manufacture and sell products made from trees.





REAL ESTATE INVESTMENT TRUST (REIT) ELECTION

Starting with our 2010 fiscal year, we elected to be taxed as a REIT. We expect to derive most of our REIT income from investments in timberlands, including the sale of standing timber through pay-as-cut sales contracts. REIT income can be distributed to shareholders without first paying corporate level tax, substantially eliminating the double taxation on income. A significant portion of our timberland segment earnings receives this favorable tax treatment. We are, however, subject to corporate taxes on built-in-gains (the excess of fair market value over tax basis at January 1, 2010) on sales of real property (other than standing timber) held by the REIT during the first 10 years following the REIT conversion. We continue to be required to pay federal corporate income taxes on earnings of our Taxable REIT Subsidiary (TRS), which includes our manufacturing businesses and the portion of our Timberlands segment income included in the TRS.





OUR BUSINESS SEGMENTS

In theConsolidated Resultssection ofManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, you will find our overall performance results for our business segments:

•Timberlands,

•Wood Products and

•Cellulose Fibers.

Detailed financial information about our business segments and our geographic locations is inNote 2: Business SegmentsandNote 21: Geographic Areasin theNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements,as well as in this section and in theManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.





EFFECT OF MARKET CONDITIONS

The health of the U.S. housing market strongly affects our Wood Products and Timberlands segments. Wood Products primarily sells into the new residential building and repair and remodel markets. Demand for logs from our Timberlands segment is affected by the production of wood-based building products as well as export demand. Cellulose Fibers is primarily affected by global demand and the relative strength of the U.S. dollar.





WEYERHAEUSER COMPANY >2014 ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K1








COMPETITION IN OUR MARKETS

We operate in highly competitive domestic and foreign markets, with numerous companies selling similar products. Many of our products also face competition from substitutes for wood and wood-fiber products. We compete in our markets primarily through price, product quality and service levels. We are relentlessly focused on improving operational excellence to ensure a competitive cost structure and producing quality products customers want and are wiling to pay for.

Our business segments’ competitive strategies are as follows:

•Timberlands — Extract maximum value from each acre we own or manage.

•Wood Products — Deliver high-quality lumber, structural panels, engineered wood products and complementary building products for residential, multi-family, industrial and light commercial applications at competitive costs.

•Cellulose Fibers — Concentrate on value-added pulp products and low cost manufacturing assets.

WHAT WE DO

This section provides information about how we:

•grow and harvest trees and

•manufacture and sell products made from them.

For each of our business segments, we provide details about what we do, where we do it, how much we sell and where we are headed.





TIMBERLANDS

Our Timberlands segment manages6.9 millionacres of private commercial timberlands worldwide. We own6.2 millionof those acres and have long-term leases on the other0.7 millionacres. In addition, we have renewable, long-term licenses on Canadian timberlands. The tables presented in this section include data from this segment's business units as of the end of2014.

WHAT WE DO

Forestry Management

Our Timberlands segment:

•grows and harvests trees to be converted into lumber, other wood and building products and pulp and paper;

•exports logs to other countries where they are made into products;

•plants seedlings to reforest harvested areas using the most effective regeneration method for the site and species (in parts of Canada natural regeneration is employed);

•monitors and cares for the planted trees as they grow to maturity; and

•strives to sustain and maximize the timber supply from our timberlands while keeping the health of our environment a key priority.

Our goal is to maximize returns by selling logs and stumpage to internal and external customers. We focus on solid wood and use intensive silviculture to improve forest productivity and returns while managing our forests on a sustainable basis to meet customer and public expectations.

Sustainable Forestry Practices

We are committed to responsible environmental stewardship wherever we operate, managing forests to produce financially mature timber while protecting the ecosystem services they provide. Our working forests include places with unique environmental, cultural, historical or recreational value. To protect their unique qualities, we follow regulatory requirements, voluntary standards and implement the Sustainable Forestry Initiative®(SFI) standard. Independent auditing of all of the forests we own or manage in the United States and Canada certifies that we meet the SFI standard. Our timberlands in Uruguay are certified under the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) standard or the Uruguayan national forestry management standard which is endorsed by the Program for the Endorsement of Forest Certification (PEFC).



WEYERHAEUSER COMPANY >2014 ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K2






Canadian Forestry Operations

In Canada, we manage timberlands under long-term licenses that provide raw material for our manufacturing facilities in various provinces. When we harvest trees, we pay the provinces at stumpage rates set by the government, which generally are based on prevailing market prices. We transfer logs to our manufacturing facilities at cost, and do not generate any profit in the Timberlands segment from the harvest of timber from the licensed acres in Canada.

Other Values From Our Timberlands

In the United States, we actively manage mineral, oil and gas leases on our land and use geologic databases to identify and market opportunities for commercial mineral and geothermal development. We recognize leasing revenue over the terms of agreements with customers. Revenue primarily comes from:

•royalty payments on oil and gas production;

•upfront bonus payments from oil and gas leasing and exploration activity;

•royalty payments on hard minerals (rock, sand and gravel);

•geothermal lease and option revenues; and

•the sale of mineral assets.

In managing mineral resources, we generate revenue related to our ownership of the minerals and, separately, related to our ownership of the surface. The ownership of mineral rights and surface acres may be held by two separate parties. Materials that can be mined from the surface, and whose value comes from factors other than their chemical composition, typically belong to the surface owner. Examples of surface materials include rock, sand, gravel, dirt and topsoil. The mineral owner holds the title to commodities that derive value from their unique chemical composition. Examples of mineral rights include oil, gas, coal (even if mined at the surface) and precious metals. If the two types of rights conflict, then mineral rights generally are superior to surface rights. A third type of land right is geothermal, which can belong to either the surface or mineral owner. We routinely reserve mineral and geothermal rights when selling surface timberlands acreage.

HOW WE MEASURE OUR PRODUCT

We report Timberlands data in cubic meters. Cubic meters measure the total volume of wood fiber in a tree or log that we can sell. Cubic meter volume is determined from the large and small-end diameters and length and provides a more consistent and comparative measure of timber and log volume among operating regions, species, size and seasons of the year than other units of measure.

We also use multiple units of measure when transacting business including:

•Thousand board feet (MBF) — used in the West to measure the expected lumber recovery from a tree or log. This measure does not include taper or recovery of non-lumber residual products.

•Hundred cubic feet (CCF) — used in the West to measure the volume of a log. The measure does not include any calculation for expected lumber recovery.

•Green tons (GT) — used in the South to measure weight, but factors used for conversion to product volume can vary by species, size, location and season.

WHERE WE DO IT

Our timberlands assets are located primarily in North America. In the U.S. we own and manage sustainable timberlands in nine states for use in wood products and pulp and paper manufacturing. We own or lease:

•4.0 millionacres in the southern U.S. (Alabama, Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, Oklahoma and Texas); and

•2.6 millionacres in the Pacific Northwest (Oregon and Washington).



We also own and operate nurseries and seed orchards in Washington, Oregon, South Carolina and Georgia.

Our international operations are located in Uruguay, where we own298,000acres and have long-term leases on25,000acres. In Canada, we manage timberlands under long-term licenses that provide raw material for our manufacturing facilities. These licenses are in Alberta, British Columbia, Ontario (license is managed by partnership) and Saskatchewan.

Our total timber inventory — including timber on owned and leased land in our U.S. and international operations — is approximately345 millioncubic meters. The amount of timber inventory does not translate into an amount of lumber or panel products because the quantity of end products:

•varies according to the species, size and quality of the timber; and

•will change through time as the mix of these variables adjust.

The species, size and grade of the trees affects the relative value of our timberlands.

We maintain our timber inventory in an integrated resource inventory and geographic information system (“GIS”). The resource inventory component of the system is proprietary and is largely based on internally developed technologies, including growth and yield models developed by our research and development organization. The GIS component is based on GIS software that is viewed as the standard in our industry.



WEYERHAEUSER COMPANY >2014 ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K3






Timber inventory data collection and verification techniques include the use of industry standard field sampling procedures as well as proprietary remote sensing technologies in some geographies where they generate improved estimates. The data is collected and maintained at the timber stand level.

We provide a constant year round flow of logs to internal and third-party customers. We sell grade logs to mills that manufacture a diverse range of products including lumber, plywood and veneer. We also sell chips and fiber logs to pulp, paper and oriented strand board mills. Our timberlands are well located to take advantage of road, logging and transportation systems for efficient delivery of logs to these customers.

Western United States

Our Western acres are well situated to serve the wood product markets in Oregon and Washington. In addition, our location on the West Coast provides access to higher-value export markets for Douglas fir and whitewood logs in Japan, China and Korea. The size and quality of our Western timberlands, coupled with their proximity to several deep-water port facilities, positions us to meet the needs of Pacific Rim log markets.

Our lands are composed primarily of Douglas fir, a species highly valued for its structural strength. Our coastal lands also contain whitewood and have a higher proportion of whitewood than our interior holdings. Our management systems range from research and forestry, to technical planning models, mechanized harvesting, and marketing and logistics.  They provide us a competitive operating advantage.

On July 23, 2013, we purchased 100 percent of the equity interests in Longview Timber LLC (Longview Timber) for $1.58 billion cash and assumed debt of $1.07 billion, for an aggregate purchase price of $2.65 billion. Longview Timber was a privately-held Delaware limited liability company engaged in the ownership and management of approximately 645,000 acres of timberlands in Oregon and Washington. More information on this transaction can be found inNote 4: Longview Timber Purchasein theNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

2014Western U.S. Inventory by Species



2014Western U.S. Inventory by Age / Species



The average age of timber harvested in2014was 52 years. Most of our U.S. timberland is intensively managed for timber production, but some areas are conserved for environmental, historical, recreational or cultural reasons. Some of our older trees are protected in acreage set aside for conservation, and some are not yet logged due to harvest rate regulations. While over the long term our average harvest age will decrease in accordance with our sustainable forestry practices, we harvest generally 2 percent of our Western acreage each year.

Southern United States

Our Southern acres predominantly contain southern yellow pine and encompass timberlands in seven states.

We intensively manage our timber plantations using forestry research and planning systems to optimize grade log production. We also actively manage our land to capture revenues from our oil, gas and hard minerals resources. We do this while providing quality habitat for a range of animals and birds. We lease more than 93 percent of our acres to the public and state wildlife agencies for recreational purposes.

Our timberland acres in Uruguay are split approximately 50 percent loblolly pine and 50 percent eucalyptus. Loblolly pine comprises more of our timber inventory due to its older age. On average, the timber in Uruguay is in the second third of its rotation age. It is entering into that part of the growth rotation when we will see increased volume accretion. About 96 percent of the area to be planted has been afforested to date.

2014International Inventory by Species (Uruguay)



In Uruguay, the target rotation ages are 21 to 22 years for pine and 14 to 17 years for eucalyptus. We manage both species to a grade (appearance) regime.

We also operate a plywood mill in Uruguay with a production capacity of 250,000 cubic meters. Production volume reached 216,000 cubic meters in2014.

In Brazil, we were a managing partner in a joint venture that operated a hardwood sawmill. We sold our interest in this joint venture during 2014.

Canada — Licensed Timberlands

We manage timberlands under long-term licenses in Canada from the provincial government to secure the volume for our manufacturing facilities in various provinces. The provincial governments regulate the volume of timber that may be harvested each year through the Annual Allowable Cut (AAC) allotment, which is updated every 10 years. As ofDecember 31, 2014, our AAC allotment was:

•Alberta — 3,917 thousand cubic meters,

•British Columbia — 682 thousand cubic meters,

•Ontario — 146 thousand cubic meters and

•Saskatchewan — 755 thousand cubic meters.

When the volume is harvested, we pay the province at stumpage rates set by the government and generally based on prevailing market prices. The harvested logs are transferred to our manufacturing facilities at cost (stumpage plus harvest, haul and overhead costs less any margin on selling logs to third parties). Any profit from harvesting the log through to converting it to a finished product is recognized at the respective mill in either the Cellulose Fibers or Wood Products segment.

Our Timberlands annual fee harvest volumes represents the depletion of the timber assets we own. Depletion is a method of expensing the cost of establishing the fee timber asset base over the harvest or timber sales volume. The increase in fee harvest volumes from 2010 through 2014 reflects improving market conditions. The increase in fee harvest volumes in the West in 2013 and 2014 also reflects the purchase of Longview Timber.

Our fee harvest volumes are managed sustainably across all regions to ensure the preservation of long-term economic value of the timber and to capture maximum value from the markets. This is accomplished by ensuring annual harvest schedules target financially mature timber and reforestation activities align with the growing of timber through its life cycle to financial maturity.

Log Sales Volumes

Logs sold to unaffiliated customers in2014increased1.4 millioncubic meters —10 percent— from2013.

•Sales volumes in the West increased1.3 millioncubic meters —17 percent— primarily due to strong export and domestic demand and the purchase of Longview Timber. Our western sales to unaffiliated customers generally are higher-grade logs sold into the export market and domestic-grade logs sold to West Coast sawmills.

•Sales to unaffiliated customers in the South decreased210 thousandcubic meters —4 percent— primarily due to a shift to stumpage sales.

•Sales volumes from Canada increased81 thousandcubic meters —16 percent— in2014. The increase in volume to unaffiliated customers primarily was due to increased internal mill demand.

•Sales volumes from our international operations increased247 thousandcubic meters —69 percent— in2014. The increase in volume was primarily due to increased fiber log sales in Uruguay.

We sell three grades of logs — domestic grade, domestic fiber and export. Factors that may affect log sales in each of these categories include:

•domestic grade log sales — lumber usage, primarily for housing starts and repair and remodel activity, the needs of our own mills and the availability of logs from both outside markets and our own timberlands;

•domestic fiber log sales — demand for chips by pulp, containerboard mills, and OSB mills; and

•export log sales — the level of housing starts in Japan and construction in China.

Our sales volumes include logs purchased in the open market and all our domestic and export logs that are sold to unaffiliated customers or transferred at market prices to our internal mills by the sales and marketing staff within our Timberlands business units.

Wood Products Prices

Prices for commodity wood products — Structural lumber and Plywood — increased in2014from2013while OSB decreased.

In general, the following factors influence prices for wood products:

•Demand for wood products used in residential and multi-family construction and the repair and remodel of existing homes affects prices. Residential construction is influenced by factors such as population growth and other demographics, the level of employment, consumer confidence, consumer income, availability of financing and interest rate levels, and the supply and pricing of existing homes on the market.  Repair and remodel activity is affected by the size and age of existing housing inventory and access to home equity financing and other credit.

•The availability of supply of commodity building products such as structural lumber, OSB and plywood affects prices. A number of factors can influence supply, including changes in production capacity and utilization rates, weather, raw material supply and availability of transportation.

The North American housing market continued to show sustained improvement in2014. This improvement led to increased demand and resulted in improved pricing for commodity wood products, excluding OSB, in2014. The following graphs reflect product price trends for the past five years.

NATURAL RESOURCE AND ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS

We are subject to a multitude of laws and regulations in the operation of our businesses. We also participate in voluntary certification of our timberlands to assure that we sustain their values including the protection of wildlife and water quality. Changes in law and regulation, or certification standards, can significantly affect our business.





REGULATIONS AFFECTING FORESTRY PRACTICES

In the United States, regulations established by federal, state and local government agencies to protect water quality and wetlands could affect future harvests and forest management practices on some of our timberlands. Forest practice laws and regulations that affect present or future harvest and forest management activities in certain states include:

•limits on the size of clearcuts,

•requirements that some timber be left unharvested to protect water quality and fish and wildlife habitat,

•regulations regarding construction and maintenance of forest roads,

•rules requiring reforestation following timber harvest, and

•various related permit programs.

Each state in which we own timberlands has developed best management practices to reduce the effects of forest practices on water quality and aquatic habitats. Additional and more stringent regulations may be adopted by various state and local governments to achieve water-quality standards under the federal Clean Water Act, protect fish and wildlife habitats, or achieve other public policy objectives.

In Canada, our forest operations are carried out on public timberlands under forest licenses with the provinces. All forest operations are subject to:

•forest practices and environmental regulations,and

•license requirements established by contract between us and the relevant province designed to:

-protect environmental values,and

-encourage other stewardship values.

In Canada, 21 member companies of the Forest Products Association of Canada (FPAC), including Weyerhaeuser’s Canadian subsidiary, announced in May 2010 the signing of a Canadian Boreal Forest Agreement (CBFA) with nine environmental organizations. The CBFA applies to approximately 72 million hectares of public forests licensed to FPAC members and, when fully implemented, is expected to lead to the conservation of significant areas of Canada’s boreal forest and protection of boreal species at risk, in particular woodland caribou. CBFA signatories continue to work on management plans with provincial governments, and seek the participation of aboriginal and local communities in advancing the goals of the CBFA. Progress under the CBFA is measured and reported on by an independent auditor.





ENDANGERED SPECIES PROTECTIONS

In the United States, a number of fish and wildlife species that inhabit geographic areas near or within our timberlands have been listed as threatened or endangered under the federal Endangered Species Act (ESA) or similar state laws, such as:

•the northern spotted owl, the marbled murrelet, a number of salmon species, bull trout and steelhead trout in the Pacific Northwest,

•several freshwater mussel and sturgeon species, and

•the red-cockaded woodpecker, gopher tortoise, gopher frog and American burying beetle in the South or Southeast.

Additional species or populations may be listed as threatened or endangered as a result of pending or future citizen petitions or petitions initiated by federal or state agencies. In addition, significant citizen litigation seeks to compel the federal agencies to designate "critical habitat" for ESA-listed species, and many cases have resulted in settlements under which designations will be implemented over time. Such designations may adversely affect some management activities and options. Restrictions on timber harvests can result from:

•federal and state requirements to protect habitat for threatened and endangered species,

•regulatory actions by federal or state agencies to protect these species and their habitat, and

•citizen suits under the ESA.



Such actions could increase our operating costs and affect timber supply and prices in general. To date, we do not believe that these measures have had, and we do not believe that in2015they will have, a significant effect on our harvesting operations. We anticipate that likely future actions will not disproportionately affect Weyerhaeuser as compared with comparable operations of U.S. competitors.

In Canada:

•The federal Species at Risk Act (SARA) requires protective measures for species identified as being at risk and for critical habitat, pursuant to SARA, Environment Canada continues to identify and assess species deemed to be at risk and their critical habitat,and

•in October 2012, the Canadian Minister of the Environment released a strategy for the recovery of the boreal population of woodland caribou under the SARA. The population and distribution objectives for boreal caribou across Canada are to (1) maintain the current status of existing, self-sustaining local caribou populations and (2) stabilize and achieve self-sustaining status for non-self-sustaining local caribou populations. Critical habitat for boreal caribou is identified for all boreal caribou ranges, except for northern Saskatchewan’s Boreal Shield range (SK1) where additional information is required for that population. Species assessment and recovery plans are developed in consultation with aboriginal communities and stakeholders.



The identification and protection of habitat and the implementation of range plans and land use action plans may, over time, result in additional restrictions on timber harvests and other forest management practices that could increase operating costs for operators of timberlands in Canada. To date, we do not believe that these Canadian measures have had, and we do not believe that in2015they will have, a significant effect on our harvesting operations. We anticipate that likely future measures will not disproportionately affect Weyerhaeuser as compared with similar operations of Canadian competitors.





WEYERHAEUSER COMPANY >2014 ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K17








FOREST CERTIFICATION STANDARDS

We operate in North America under the Sustainable Forestry Initiative(SFI®). This is a certification standard designed to supplement government regulatory programs with voluntary landowner initiatives to further protect certain public resources and values. SFI®is an independent standard, overseen by a governing board consisting of:

•conservation organizations,

•academia,

•the forest industry,and

•large and small forest landowners.

Ongoing compliance with SFI®may result in some increases in our operating costs and curtailment of our timber harvests in some areas. There also is competition from other private certification systems, primarily the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC), coupled with efforts by supporters to further those systems by persuading customers of forest products to require products certified to their preferred system. Certain features of the FSC system could impose additional operating costs on timberland management. Because of the considerable variation in FSC standards, and variability in how those standards are interpreted and applied, if sufficient marketplace demand develops for products made from raw materials sourced from other than SFI-certified forests, we could incur substantial additional costs for operations and be required to reduce harvest levels.





WHAT THESE REGULATIONS AND CERTIFICATION PROGRAMS MEAN TO US

The regulatory and nonregulatory forest management programs described above have:

•increased our operating costs,

•resulted in changes in the value of timber and logs from our timberlands,

•contributed to increases in the prices paid for wood products and wood chips during periods of high demand,

•sometimes made it more difficult for us to respond to rapid changes in markets, extreme weather or other unexpected circumstances, and

•potentially encouraged further reductions in the use of, or substitution of other products for, lumber, oriented strand board, and plywood.

We believe that these kinds of programs have not had, and in2015will not have, a significant effect on the total harvest of timber in the United States or Canada. However, these kinds of programs may have such an effect in the future. We expect we will not be disproportionately affected by these programs as compared with typical owners of comparable timberlands. We also expect that these programs will not significantly disrupt our planned operations over large areas or for extended periods.





CANADIAN ABORIGINAL RIGHTS

Many of the Canadian timberlands are subject to the constitutionally protected treaty or common-law rights of aboriginal peoples of Canada. Most of British Columbia (B.C.) is not covered by treaties, and as a result the claims of B.C.’s aboriginal peoples relating to forest resources have been largely unresolved. On June 26, 2014 the Supreme Court of Canada ruled that the Tsilhqot’in Nation holds aboriginal title to approximately 1,900 square kilometers in B.C. This was the first time that the court has declared title to exist based on historical occupation by aboriginal peoples. Many aboriginal groups continue to be engaged in treaty discussions with the governments of B.C., other provinces and Canada.

Final or interim resolution of claims brought by aboriginal groups can be expected to result in:

•additional restrictions on the sale or harvest of timber,

•potential increase in operating costs, and

•impact to timber supply and prices in Canada.

We believe that such claims will not have a significant effect on our total harvest of timber or production of forest products in2015, although they may have such an effect in the future. In 2008, FPAC, of which we are a member, signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the Assembly of First Nations, under which the parties agree to work together to strengthen Canada’s forest sector through economic-development initiatives and business investments, strong environmental stewardship and the creation of skill-development opportunities particularly targeted to aboriginal youth.





POLLUTION-CONTROL REGULATIONS

Our operations are subject to various laws and regulations, including:

•federal,

•state,

•provincial, and

•local pollution controls.

These laws and regulations, as well as market demands, impose controls with regard to:

•air, water and land,

•solid and hazardous waste management,

•waste disposal,

•remediation of contaminated sites, and

•the chemical content of some of our products.

Compliance with these laws, regulations and demands usually involves capital expenditures as well as additional operating costs. We cannot easily quantify the future amounts of capital expenditures we might have to make to comply with these laws, regulations and demands or the effects on our operating costs because in some instances compliance standards have not been developed or have not become final or definitive. In addition, it is difficult to isolate the environmental component of most manufacturing capital projects.



WEYERHAEUSER COMPANY >2014 ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K18






Our capital projects typically are designed to:

•enhance safety,

•extend the life of a facility,

•increase capacity,

•increase efficiency,

•facilitate raw material changes and handling requirements,

•increase the economic value of assets or products, and

•comply with regulatory standards.

We had no material capital expenditures relating primarily to environmental compliance in2014. Based on our understanding of current regulatory requirements in the U.S. and Canada, we expect approximately $23 million of capital expenditures relating primarily to environmental compliance in2015.





ENVIRONMENTAL CLEANUP

We are involved in the environmental investigation or remediation of numerous sites. Of these sites:

•we may have the sole obligation to remediate,

•we may share that obligation with one or more parties,

•several parties may have joint and several obligations to remediate, or

•we may have been named as a potentially responsible party for sites designated as U.S.Superfund sites.

Our liability with respect to these various sites ranges from insignificant to substantial. The amount of liability depends on:

•the quantity, toxicity and nature of materials at the site, and

•the number and economic viability of the other responsible parties.

We spent approximately$5 millionin2014and expect to spend approximately $7 million in2015on environmental remediation of these sites.

It is our policy to accrue for environmental-remediation costs when we:

•determine it is probable that such an obligation exists, and

•can reasonably estimate the amount of the obligation.

We currently believe it is reasonably possible that our costs to remediate all the identified sites may exceed our current accruals of$29 million. The excess amounts required may be insignificant or could range, in the aggregate, up to $138 million over several years. This estimate of the upper end of the range of reasonably possible additional costs is much less certain than the estimates we currently are using to determine how much to accrue. The estimate of the upper range also uses assumptions less favorable to us among the range of reasonably possible outcomes.





REGULATION OF AIR EMISSIONS IN THE U.S.

The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has promulgated regulations for air emissions from:

•pulp and paper manufacturing facilities,

•wood products facilities, and

•industrial boilers.

These regulations cover:

•hazardous air pollutants that require use of maximum achievable control technology (MACT); and

•controls for pollutants that contribute to smog, haze and more recently, greenhouse gases.

In 2011 and 2013 EPA issued new MACT standards for industrial boilers and process heaters. In 2012 EPA completed a technology and residual risk review for MACT standards applicable to pulping and bleaching operations at pulp and paper manufacturing facilities. In 2014 EPA issued a revised New Source Performance Standard for kraft pulp mills. These latter two rules apply on a project specific basis when certain thresholds are exceeded; as a result, we cannot predict whether or when those rules may have a material impact on future projects. Regarding other recent final actions by the EPA, we expect to spend $23 million in 2015 to comply with MACT standards.

The EPA must still promulgate:

•technology and residual risk review standards for additional operations at pulp and paper manufacturing facilities and

•supplemental MACT standards for plywood, lumber and composite wood products facilities.

We cannot currently quantify the amount of capital we will need in the future to comply with new regulations being developed by the EPA because final rules have not been promulgated.

In 2010 EPA issued a final greenhouse gas rule limiting the growth of emissions from new projects meeting certain thresholds. On June 23, 2014, the US Supreme Court issued a decision that removed potential applicability of the underlying 2010 regulations based solely on greenhouse gas emissions and limited application of the rule’s technology requirements to larger emission sources as a result of new emissions from non-greenhouse gas pollutants. As a result of this Supreme Court ruling, EPA is expected to issue new guidance to set thresholds for when the greenhouse gas technology requirements apply if the non-greenhouse gas emissions trigger the rule in the first instance. The impact of the Supreme Court ruling is to end the potential applicability of the technology requirements for our smaller manufacturing operations and limit the applicability for our other operations.

In June 2014 EPA proposed an extensive regulatory program for existing electric utility generating units to scale back emissions of greenhouse gas carbon dioxide (CO2) arising from fossil fuel use to generate electricity. This regulatory program potentially will have indirect impacts on our operations, such as from rising purchased electricity prices or from secondary regulation of cogeneration units that we operate. We are evaluating the proposal but are not able to predict whether the regulations, when final and implemented, will have a material impact on our operations.

We use significant biomass for energy production at our mills. EPA is currently working on rules regarding regulation of biomass emissions.

The impact of these greenhouse gas and biomass rules, as well as recent court decisions, on our operations remains uncertain.



WEYERHAEUSER COMPANY >2014 ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K19






To address concerns about greenhouse gases as a pollutant, we:

•closely monitor legislative, regulatory and scientific developments pertaining to climate change;

•adopted in 2006, as part of the Company's sustainability program, a goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 40 percent by 2020 compared with our emissions in 2000, assuming a comparable portfolio and regulations;

•determined to achieve this goal by increasing energy efficiency and using more greenhouse gas-neutral, biomass fuels instead of fossil fuels; and

•reduced greenhouse gas emissions by approximately 28 percent considering changes in the asset portfolio according to 2012 data, compared to our 2000 baseline.

Additional factors that could affect greenhouse gas emissions in the future include:

•policy proposals by state governments regarding regulation of greenhouse gas emissions,

•Congressional legislation regulating greenhouse gas emissions within the next several years and

•establishment of a multistate or federal greenhouse gas emissions reduction trading systems with potentially significant implications for all U.S. businesses.

We believe these developments have not had, and in2015will not have, a significant effect on our operations. Although these measures could have a material adverse effect on our operations in the future, we expect that we will not be disproportionately affected by these measures as compared with owners of comparable operations. We maintain an active forestry research program to track and understand any potential effect from actual climate change related parameters that could affect the forests we own and manage and do not anticipate any disruptions to our planned operations.





REGULATION OF AIR EMISSIONS IN CANADA

In addition to existing provincial air quality regulations, the Canadian federal government has proposed an air quality management system (AQMS) as a comprehensive national approach for improving air quality in Canada. The federal proposed AQMS includes:

•ambient air quality standards for outdoor air quality management across the country,

•a framework for air zone air management within provinces and territories that targets specific sources of air emissions,

•regional airsheds that facilitate coordinated action across borders,

•industrial sector based emission requirements that set a national base level of performance for major industries in Canada, and

•improved intergovernmental collaboration to reduce emissions from the transportation sector.

Environment Canada is developing a“Greenhouse Gas Emission Framework”that is expected to be proposed in 2015 with implementation in 2020. The framework will put in place a national, sector-based greenhouse gas reduction program applicable to a number of industries, including pulp and paper manufacturing.

All Canadian provincial governments:

•have greenhouse gas reporting requirements,

•are working on reduction strategies,and

•together with the Canadian federal government, are considering new or revised emission standards.

In addition, British Columbia has adopted a carbon tax and Alberta has a mandatory GHG emission reduction regulation. Our Grande Prairie, Alberta cellulose fiber mill generates and sells carbon credits.

We believe these measures have not had, and in2015will not have, a significant effect on our operations. Although these measures could have a material adverse effect on our operations in the future, we expect that we will not be disproportionately affected by these measures as compared with owners of comparable operations. We also expect that these measures will not significantly disrupt our planned operations.





REGULATION OF AIR EMISSIONS IN POLAND AND URUGUAY

The European Union’s“Clean Air Programme”includes new air quality objectives that Poland and other European Union countries will implement through 2030. Some provinces in Uruguay have established air quality monitoring networks and ambient air objectives have been proposed for the region where our Los Piques mill is located.

We believe these measures have not had, and in2015will not have, a significant effect on our operations. Although these measures could have a material adverse effect on our operations in the future, we expect that we will not be disproportionately affected by these measures as compared with owners of comparable operations. We also expect that these measures will not significantly disrupt our planned operations.





REGULATION OF WATER

In the U.S., as a result of litigation under the federal Clean Water Act,additional federal or state permits are now required in some states for the application of pesticides, including herbicides, on timberlands. Those permits have entailed additional costs. In addition, there is continuing litigation in the federal courts that may result in permit requirements for pollution discharges from forest roads and other drainage features on timberland, which would entail additional costs for forest landowners including Weyerhaeuser. Finally, the federal regulatory agencies are considering expanding the definition of waters subject to federal Clean Water Act jurisdiction, which could increase the scope and number of permits required for forestry-related activities and entail additional costs for Weyerhaeuser and other forest landowners in the U.S.

In August 2014 EPA issued a final regulation on thermal cooling water intakes for the protection of aquatic resources. The final rule is not expected to have a material impact although the technology requirements to protect aquatic resources outlined in the rule may be applied on a case-by-case when water permits are renewed.

In 2015, Washington State Department of Ecology (WA DOE) is expected to propose rules to update the Human Health Water Quality Criteria for the protection of human health. It is unclear what effect, if any, the WA DOE regulations will have on our manufacturing operations in Washington State.



WEYERHAEUSER COMPANY >2014 ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K20






In addition:

•In 2013, amendments to the Canadian Federal Fisheries Act came into force. These amendments change the focus from habitat protection to fisheries protection and increase penalties.

•Uruguay’s national policy for water includes regulation of river basin planning, management and water use permits. Wastewater discharge authorization is required for industry, including our Los Piques mill.

•In response to an European Union Water Framework Directive, in 2015 Polish authorities announced their intention to develop a water management plan to reduce total nitrogen and phosphorous loads in municipal waste water by 75 percent. The plan could impact our Poland facility, although it is unclear what effect, if any, the water management plan may have on our operation in Poland until the plan is complete.

We believe the above developments have not had, and in 2015 will not have, a significant effect on our operations. Although these measures could have a material adverse effect on our operations in the future, we expect that we will not be disproportionately affected by these measures as compared with owners of comparable operations. We also expect that these measures will not significantly disrupt our planned operations.





POTENTIAL CHANGES IN POLLUTION REGULATION

State governments continue to promulgate total maximum daily load (TMDL) requirements for pollutants in water bodies that do not meet state or EPA water quality standards. State TMDL requirements may:

•set limits on pollutants that may be discharged to a body of water; or

•set additional requirements, such as best management practices for nonpoint sources, including timberland operations, to reduce the amounts of pollutants.

It is not possible to estimate the capital expenditures that may be required for us to meet pollution allocations across the various proposed state TMDL programs until a specific TMDL is promulgated.

In Canada, various levels of government have been working to address water issues including use, quality and management. Recent areas of focus include water allocation, regional watershed protection, protection of drinking water, water pricing and a national water quality index.

RISK FACTORS

We are subject to various risks and events that could adversely affect our business, our financial condition, our results of operations and the price of our common stock.

You should consider the following risk factors, in addition to the information presented elsewhere in this report, particularly in “Forward-Looking Statements” and "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" as well as in the filings we make from time to time with the SEC, in evaluating us, our business and an investment in our securities.

The risks discussed below are not the only risks we face. Additional risks not currently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial also may adversely affect our business.





RISKS RELATED TO OUR INDUSTRIES AND BUSINESS





MACROECONOMIC CONDITIONS

The industries in which we operate are sensitive to macroeconomic conditions and consequently are highly cyclical.





COMMODITY PRODUCTS

Many of our products are commodities that are widely available from other producers.

Because commodity products have few distinguishing properties from producer to producer, competition for these products is based primarily on price, which is determined by supply relative to demand and competition from substitute products. In addition, prices for our products are affected by many other factors outside of our control. As a result, we have little influence over the timing and extent of price changes, which often are volatile. Our profitability with respect to these products depends, in part, on managing our costs, particularly raw material and energy costs, which represent significant components of our operating costs and can fluctuate based upon factors beyond our control. Both sales and profitability of our products are subject to volatility due to market forces beyond our control.





INDUSTRY SUPPLY OF LOGS, WOOD PRODUCTS AND PULP

Excess supply of products may adversely affect prices and margins.

Oversupply of products may result from producers introducing new capacity for manufactured products or increasing harvest levels in response to favorable short-term pricing trends. Industry supplies of pulp are also influenced by global production capacity, which has grown in recent years and is expected to continue to grow. Continuation of these factors could adversely affect our sales volumes and margins.





HOMEBUILDING MARKET AND ECONOMIC RISKS

High unemployment, low demand and low levels of consumer confidence can adversely affect our business and results of operations.

Several of our businesses are dependent upon the health of the U.S. housing market. Demand for homes is sensitive to changes in economic conditions such as the level of employment, consumer confidence, consumer income, the availability of financing and interest rate levels. The legacy of the housing bubble, its collapse and ensuing credit crisis has been one of tightened credit requirements and a reduced number of mortgage loans available for financing home purchases. Credit conditions have begun to ease, but remain significantly more restrictive than prior to the housing bubble. Demand for new homes also has been adversely affected by factors such as unemployment and lower job participation, limited wage growth and weak consumer confidence. Additionally, rising student loan debt among younger adults is limiting access to mortgage financing and home ownership. Foreclosure rates and distress sales of houses, while still at elevated levels, have fallen significantly and are less of an impact compared to the years immediately following the housing collapse.

Homebuyers’ ability to qualify for and obtain affordable mortgages could be affected by changes in government sponsored entities and private mortgage insurance companies supporting the mortgage market.

The federal government has historically had a significant role in supporting mortgage lending through its sponsorship of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. As a result of turbulence in credit markets and the mortgage finance industry in the last few years, the effect of the federal government’s conservatorship of these government sponsored entities on the short-term and long-term demand for new housing remains unclear.The liquidity provided to the mortgage industry by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, both of which purchase home mortgages and mortgage-backed securities originated by mortgage lenders, is critical to the housing market. There have been significant concerns about the future purpose of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and a number of proposals to curtail their activities over time are under review. Limitations or restrictions on the availability of financing by these entities could adversely affect interest rates and the availability of mortgage financing, which could reduce demand for housing and adversely affect demand for our products.



WEYERHAEUSER COMPANY >2014 ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K23






Changes in mortgage interest expense and real estate tax regulations could harm our future sales and earnings.

Significant costs of homeownership include mortgage interest expense and real estate taxes, both of which are generally deductible for an individual’s federal and, in some cases, state income taxes. Any changes to income tax laws by the federal government or a state government to eliminate or substantially reduce these income tax deductions, as has been considered from time to time, would increase the after-tax cost of owning a home. Increases in real estate taxes by local governmental authorities would also increase the cost of homeownership. Any such increases to the cost of homeownership could adversely affect the demand for our products.





CAPITAL MARKETS

Deterioration in economic conditions and the credit markets could adversely affect our access to capital.

Upset financial or credit market conditions can impair the company’s ability to borrow money or otherwise access credit markets on terms acceptable to us, which may, among other impacts, reduce our ability to take advantage of growth and expansion opportunities. Similarly, our customers may be unable to borrow money to fund their operations. Similarly, deteriorating or volatile market conditions could have an adverse effect on our customers and suppliers and their ability to purchase our products or sell products to us.





CHANGES IN CREDIT RATINGS

Changes in credit ratings issued by nationally recognized rating organizations could adversely affect our cost of financing and have an adverse effect on the market price of our securities.

Credit rating agencies rate our debt securities on factors that include our operating results, actions that we take, their view of the general outlook for our industry and their view of the general outlook for the economy. Actions taken by the rating agencies can include maintaining, upgrading or downgrading the current rating or placing the company on a watch list for possible future downgrading. Downgrading the credit rating of our debt securities or placing us on a watch list for possible future downgrading could limit our access to the credit markets, increase our cost of financing, and have an adverse effect on the market price of our securities.





SUBSTITUTION

Some of our products are vulnerable to declines in demand due to competing technologies or materials.

Our products may compete with nonfiber-based alternatives or with alternative products in certain market segments. For example, plastic, wood/plastic or composite materials may be used by builders as alternatives to the products produced by our Wood Products businesses such as lumber, veneer, plywood and oriented strand board. Changes in prices for oil, chemicals and wood-based fiber can change the competitive position of our products relative to available alternatives and could increase substitution of those products for our products. If use of these alternative products grows, demand for and pricing of our products could be adversely affected.





CHANGES IN PRODUCT MIX OR PRICING

Our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected by changes in product mix or pricing.

Our results may be adversely affected by a change in our product mix or pricing. If we are not successful in implementing previously announced or future price increases, or in our plans to increase sales of higher-priced, higher-value products, or if there are delays in acceptance of price increases or failure of customers to accept higher-priced products our results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected. Price discounting, if required to maintain our competitive position, could result in lower than anticipated price realizations.





INTENSE COMPETITION

We face intense competition in our markets, and the failure to compete effectively could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

We compete with North American and, for many of our product lines, global producers, some of which may have greater financial resources and lower production costs than we do. The principal basis for competition for many of our products is selling price. Our ability to maintain satisfactory margins depends in large part on our ability to control our costs. Our industries also are particularly sensitive to other factors including innovation, design, quality and service, with varying emphasis on these factors depending on the product line. To the extent that one or more of our competitors become more successful with respect to any key competitive factor, our ability to attract and retain customers could be materially adversely affected. If we are unable to compete effectively, such failure could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Another emerging form of competition is between brands of sustainably produced products; customer demand for certain brands could reduce competition among buyers for our products or cause other adverse effects.

In North America, our forests are third party-certified to the Sustainable Forestry Initiative (SFI®) standard. Some of our customers have expressed a preference in certain of our product lines for products made from raw materials sourced from forests certified to different standards, including standards of the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC). If and to the extent that preference for a standard other than SFI®becomes a customer requirement, there may be reduced demand and lower prices for our products relative to competitors who can supply products sourced from forests certified to competing certification standards. If we seek to comply with such other standards, we could incur materially increased costs for our operations or be required to reduce harvest levels. FSC, in particular, employs standards that are geographically variable and could cause a material reduction in the harvest levels of some of our timberlands, most notably in the Pacific Northwest.





WEYERHAEUSER COMPANY >2014 ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K24








MATERIAL DISRUPTION OF MANUFACTURING

A material disruption at one of our manufacturing facilities could prevent us from meeting customer demand, reduce our sales or negatively affect our results of operation and financial condition.

Any of our manufacturing facilities, or any of our machines within an otherwise operational facility, could cease operations unexpectedly due to a number of events, including:

•unscheduled maintenance outages,

•prolonged power failures,

•equipment failure,

•a chemical spill or release,

•explosion of a boiler,

•fires, floods, windstorms, earthquakes, hurricanes or other severe weather conditions or catastrophes,

•the effect of drought or reduced rainfall on water supply,

•labor difficulties,

•disruptions in transportation infrastructure, including roads, bridges, rail, tunnels, shipping and port facilities,

•terrorism or threats of terrorism,

•governmental regulations, and

•other operational problems.

Any such downtime or facility damage could prevent us from meeting customer demand for our products or require us to make unplanned capital expenditures. If one of our facilities or machines were to incur significant downtime, our ability to meet our production targets and satisfy customer requirements could be impaired, resulting in lower sales and income. Although some risks are not insurable and some coverage is limited, we purchase insurance protecting our manufacturing facilities from fires, floods, windstorms, earthquakes, equipment failures and boiler explosions.





STRATEGIC INITIATIVES

Our business and financial results may be adversely impacted if we are unable to successfully execute on important strategic initiatives.

There can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully implement important strategic initiatives in accordance with our expectations, which may result in an adverse impact on our business and financial results. These strategic initiatives are designed to improve our results of operations and drive long-term shareholder value, and include, among others: maximizing cash flow through operational excellence; reducing costs to achieve industry-leading cost structure; and innovating in higher-margin products.





CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS

Our operations require substantial capital.

Our businesses require substantial capital for expansion and for repair or replacement of existing facilities or equipment. Although we maintain our production equipment with regular scheduled maintenance, key pieces of equipment may need to be repaired or replaced periodically. The costs of repairing or replacing such equipment and the associated downtime of the affected production line could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

While we believe our capital resources will be adequate to meet our current projected operating needs, capital expenditures and other cash requirements, if for any reason we are unable to provide for our operating needs, capital expenditures and other cash requirements on acceptable economic terms, we could experience a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.





ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS

We could incur substantial costs as a result of compliance with, violations of, or liabilities under applicable environmental laws and other laws and regulations.

We are subject to a wide range of general and industry-specific laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment, including those governing:

•air emissions,

•wastewater discharges,

•harvesting and other silvicultural activities,

•forestry operations and endangered species habitat protection,

•surface water management,

•the storage, management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes,

•the cleanup of contaminated sites,

•landfill operation and closure obligations,

•building codes, and

•health and safety matters.

We have incurred, and we expect to continue to incur, significant capital, operating and other expenditures complying with applicable environmental laws and regulations and as a result of remedial obligations. We also could incur substantial costs, such as civil or criminal fines, sanctions and enforcement actions (including orders limiting our operations or requiring corrective measures, installation of pollution control equipment or other remedial actions), cleanup and closure costs, and third-party claims for property damage and personal injury as a result of violations of, or liabilities under, environmental laws and regulations.

As the owner and operator of real estate, we may be liable under environmental laws for cleanup, closure and other damages resulting from the presence and release of hazardous substances on or from our properties or operations. In addition, surface water management regulations may present liabilities and are subject to change. The amount and timing of environmental expenditures is difficult to predict, and in some cases, our liability may exceed forecasted amounts or the value of the property itself. The discovery of additional contamination or the imposition of



WEYERHAEUSER COMPANY >2014 ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K25






additional cleanup obligations at our sites or third-party sites may result in significant additional costs. Any material liability we incur could adversely affect our financial condition or preclude us from making capital expenditures that otherwise would benefit our business.

We also anticipate public policy developments at the state, federal and international level regarding climate change and energy access, security and competitiveness. We expect these developments to address emission of carbon dioxide, renewable energy and fuel standards, and the monetization of carbon. Compliance with regulations that implement new public policy in these areas might require significant expenditures. These developments may also include mandated changes to energy use and building codes which could affect our homebuilding practices. Enactment of new environmental laws or regulations or changes in existing laws or regulations, or the interpretation of these laws or regulations, might require significant expenditures. We also anticipate public policy developments at the state, federal and international level regarding taxes and a number of other areas that could require significant expenditures.

Changes in global or regional climate conditions and governmental response to such changes at the international, U.S. federal and state levels may affect our operations or our planned or future growth activities.

There continue to be numerous international, U.S. federal and state-level initiatives and proposals to address domestic and global climate issues. Within the U.S., some of these proposals would regulate and/or tax the production of carbon dioxide and other “greenhouse gases” to facilitate the reduction of carbon compound emissions into the atmosphere and provide tax and other incentives to produce and use “cleaner” energy. Climate change impacts, if they occur, and governmental initiatives, laws and regulations to address potential climate concerns, could increase our costs and have a long-term adverse impact on our businesses and results of operations. Future legislation or regulatory activity in this area remains uncertain, and its impact on our operations is unclear at this time. However, it is possible that legislation or government mandates, standards or regulations intended to mitigate or reduce carbon compound or greenhouse gas emissions or other climate change impacts could adversely affect our operations. For example, such activities could limit harvest levels or result in significantly higher costs for energy and other raw materials. Because our manufacturing operations depend upon significant amounts of energy and raw materials, these initiatives could have an adverse impact on our results of operations and profitability.





CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES

We will be affected by changes in currency exchange rates.

We have manufacturing operations in Canada, Poland and Uruguay. We are also a large exporter and compete with global producers of products very similar to ours. Therefore, we are affected by changes in the strength of the U.S. dollar, particularly relative to the Canadian dollar, euro and yen, and the strength of the euro relative to the yen. Changes in exchange rates could materially and adversely affect our sales volumes, margins and results of operations.





AVAILABILITY OF RAW MATERIALS AND ENERGY

Our business and operations could be materially adversely affected by changes in the cost or availability of raw materials and energy.

We rely heavily on certain raw materials (principally wood fiber and chemicals) and energy sources (principally natural gas, electricity, coal and fuel oil) in our manufacturing processes. Our ability to increase earnings has been, and will continue to be, affected by changes in the costs and availability of such raw materials and energy sources. We may not be able to fully offset the effects of higher raw material or energy costs through hedging arrangements, price increases, productivity improvements or cost-reduction programs.





PEOPLE

Our business is dependent upon attracting, retaining and developing key personnel.

We believe that our success depends, to a significant extent, upon our ability to attract, retain and develop key senior management and operations management personnel. Our failure to recruit, retain, and develop key personnel could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations.





TRANSPORTATION

We depend on third parties for transportation services and increases in costs and disruptions in the availability of transportation could materially adversely affect our business and operations.

Our business depends on the transportation of a large number of products, both domestically and internationally. We rely primarily on third parties for transportation of the products we manufacture or distribute as well as delivery of our raw materials. A significant portion of the goods we manufacture and raw materials we use are transported by marine, rail and truck, each of which is highly regulated. In addition, each has historically been subject to periodic disruption due to labor issues.

If any of our third-party transportation providers were to fail to deliver the goods we manufacture or distribute in a timely manner, we may be unable to sell those products at full value, or at all. Similarly, if any of these providers were to fail to deliver raw materials to us in a timely manner, we may be unable to manufacture our products in response to customer demand. In addition, if any of these third parties were to cease operations or cease doing business with us, we may be unable to replace them at reasonable cost. Our third-party transportation providers are also subject to events outside of their control, such as disruption of transportation infrastructure due to labor issues or natural disasters.

Any failure of a third-party transportation provider to deliver raw materials or finished products in a timely manner could harm our reputation, negatively affect our customer relationships and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operation.

In addition, an increase in transportation rates or fuel surcharges could materially adversely affect our sales and profitability.





WEYERHAEUSER COMPANY >2014 ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K26








REIT STATUS AND TAX IMPLICATIONS

If we fail to remain qualified as a REIT, our taxable income would be subject to tax at corporate rates and we would not be able to deduct dividends to shareholders.

In any taxable year in which we fail to qualify as a REIT, unless we are entitled to relief under the Internal Revenue Code:

•We would not be allowed to deduct dividends to shareholders in computing our taxable income.

•We would be subject to federal and state income tax on our taxable income at applicable corporate rates.

•We also would be disqualified from treatment as a REIT for the four taxable years following the year during which we lost qualification.

Qualification as a REIT involves the application of highly technical and complex provisions of the Internal Revenue Code to our operations and the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control. There are only limited judicial or administrative interpretations of these provisions. Although we operate in a manner consistent with the REIT qualification rules, we cannot assure you that we are or will remain so qualified.

Certain of our business activities are subject to corporate-level income tax and potentially subject to prohibited transactions tax.

Under the Internal Revenue Code, REITs generally must engage in the ownership and management of income producing real estate. For the Company, this generally includes owning and managing a timberland portfolio for the production and sale of standing timber. Accordingly, the harvesting and sale of logs, the development or sale of certain timberlands and other real estate, the manufacture and sale of wood products and the manufacture and sale of pulp products are conducted through one or more of our wholly-owned taxable REIT subsidiaries (TRSs) because such activities could generate non-qualifying REIT income and could constitute“prohibited transactions.”Prohibited transactions are defined by the Internal Revenue Code generally to be sales or other dispositions of property to customers in the ordinary course of a trade or business. By conducting our business in this manner we believe that we satisfy the REIT requirements of the Internal Revenue Code and are not subject to the 100 percent tax that could be imposed if a REIT were to conduct a prohibited transaction. The net income of our TRSs is subject to corporate-level income tax.

The extent of our use of our TRS may affect the price of our common shares relative to the share price of other REITs.

We conduct a significant portion of our business activities through one or more TRSs. Our use of our TRSs enables us to engage in non-REIT qualifying business activities such as the sale of logs, production and sale of wood products and pulp products, and sale of HBU property. Our TRSs are subject to corporate-level tax. Therefore, we pay income taxes on the income generated by our TRSs. Under the Code, no more than 25 percent of the value of the gross assets of a REIT may be represented by securities of one or more TRS. This limitation may affect our ability to increase the size of our TRSs’operations. Furthermore, our use of TRSs may cause the market to value our common shares differently than the shares of other REITs, which may not use TRSs as extensively as we use them.

We may be limited in our ability to fund distributions using cash generated through our taxable REIT subsidiaries.

The ability of the REIT to receive dividends from our TRS is limited by the rules with which we must comply to maintain our status as a REIT. In particular, at least 75 percent of gross income for each taxable year as a REIT must be derived from passive real estate sources including sales of our standing timber and other types of qualifying real estate income and no more than 25 percent of our gross income may consist of dividends from our TRS and other non-real estate income.

This limitation on our ability to receive dividends from our TRSs may affect our ability to fund cash distributions to our shareholders using cash flows from our TRSs. The net income of our TRSs is not required to be distributed, and income that is not distributed will not be subject to the REIT income distribution requirement.

Our cash dividends are not guaranteed and may fluctuate.

Generally, REITs are required to distribute 90 percent of their ordinary taxable income and 95 percent of their net capital gains income. Capital gains may be retained by the REIT, but would be subject to income taxes. If capital gains are retained rather than distributed, our shareholders would be notified and they would be deemed to have received a taxable distribution, with a refundable credit for any federal income tax paid by the REIT. Accordingly, we believe that we are not required to distribute material amounts of cash since substantially all of our taxable income is treated as capital gains income. Our Board of Directors, in its sole discretion, determines the amount of quarterly dividends to be provided to our shareholders based on consideration of a number of factors. These factors include, but are not limited to, our results of operations, cash flow and capital requirements, economic conditions, tax considerations, borrowing capacity and other factors, including debt covenant restrictions that may impose limitations on cash payments, future acquisitions and divestitures, harvest levels, changes in the price and demand for our products and general market demand for timberlands including those timberland properties that have higher and better uses. Consequently, our dividend levels may fluctuate.

We may not be able to complete desired like-kind exchange transactions for timberlands and real estate we sell.

When we sell timberlands and real estate, we may seek to match these sales with the acquisition of suitable replacement timberlands. This allows us“like-kind exchange”treatment for these transactions under section 1031 and related regulations of the Code. This matching of sales and purchases may provide us with tax benefits, most importantly the deferral of built-in gains tax on the property sold. The inability to obtain like-kind exchange treatment may result in the payment of taxes with respect to the property sold, and a corresponding reduction in earnings and cash available for distribution to shareholders as dividends.

Changes in tax laws or their interpretation could adversely affect our shareholders and our results of operations.

Federal and state tax laws are constantly under review by persons involved in the legislative process, the Internal Revenue Service, the United States Department of the Treasury, and state taxing authorities. Changes to tax laws could adversely affect our shareholders or increase our effective tax rates. We cannot predict with certainty whether, when, in what forms, or with what effective dates, the tax laws applicable to us or our shareholders may be changed.





WEYERHAEUSER COMPANY >2014 ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K27








LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

We are a party to a number of legal proceedings, and adverse judgments in certain legal proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.

The costs and other effects of pending litigation against us and related insurance recoveries cannot be determined with certainty. Although the disclosure inNote 15: Legal Proceedings, Commitments and ContingenciesofNotes to Consolidated Financial Statementscontains management’s current views of the effect such litigation will have on our financial results, there can be no assurance that the outcome of such proceedings will be as expected.

It is possible that there could be adverse judgments against us in some or all major litigation against us and that we could be required to take a charge and make cash payments for all or a portion of any damage award. Any such charge or cash payment could materially and adversely affect our results of operations or cash flows for the quarter or year in which we record or pay it.





IMPORT/EXPORT TAXES AND DUTIES

We may be required to pay significant taxes on our exported products or countervailing and anti-dumping duties on our imported products.

International trade disputes occur frequently and can be taken to an International Trade Court for resolution of unfair trade practices between countries. As an example, there have been many disputes and subsequent trade agreements regarding sales of softwood lumber between Canada and the United States. The current Softwood Lumber Agreement (SLA) between Canada and the U.S., originally signed in October 2006, is scheduled to expire in October 2015. The SLA requires Canadian softwood lumber facilities, including our mills, to pay an export tax when the price of lumber is at or below a threshold price. The export tax could be as high as 22.5 percent if a province exceeds its total allotted export share. It is also possible that additional countervailing antidumping duties could be imposed in the future. We may experience reduced revenues and margins in any business that is subject to such tariffs or to the terms of the settlements of such international disputes. To the extent such tariffs increase prices, they could also reduce the demand for our products. These tariffs or settlement terms could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial results and financial condition, including facility closures or impairments of assets. We cannot predict whether there will be an extension of the SLA or a new agreement or, if an extension or new agreement is completed, its impact on our business.





NATURAL DISASTERS ON TIMBERLANDS ASSETS

Our timberlands assets could be adversely affected by weather, fire, infestation or natural disasters.

Our timberlands assets may be damaged by adverse weather, severe wind and rainstorms, fires, pest infestation or other natural disasters. Because our manufacturing processes primarily use wood fiber, in many cases from our own timberlands, in the event of material damage to our timberlands, our operations could be disrupted or our production costs could be increased. As is typical in the forestry industry, we do not insure against losses of timber, including losses due to these causes.





ACQUISITION OF LONGVIEW TIMBER LLC

We may fail to realize the full benefits anticipated as a result of the acquisition of Longview Timber LLC (Longview Timber).

In 2013 we acquired Longview Timber. There are a number of risks and uncertainties relating to the acquisition and the ultimate success of the acquisition will depend, in part, on our ability to realize the anticipated business opportunities and growth prospects from combining our businesses with those of Longview Timber. We may not fully realize our expected business opportunities and growth prospects. We may need to make unanticipated capital expenditures or investments in order to maintain, improve or sustain the operations or assets of Longview Timber. We may be required to take write-offs or impairment charges or recognize amortization expenses resulting from the acquisition and may be subject to unanticipated or unknown liabilities relating to Longview Timber and its business. If any of these factors occur, we may not fully realize our expected business opportunities and growth prospects.





TAX DISTRIBUTION OF WRECO

We could incur substantial U.S. federal tax liability if the WRECO transaction were found not to qualify as a tax-free “reorganization” or the distribution of WRECO shares to Weyerhaeuser shareholders were found not to qualify as a tax-free distribution.

In 2014 we closed the divestiture of our home building business, Weyerhaeuser Real Estate Company (WRECO), via a "Reverse Morris Trust" transaction pursuant to which a wholly-owned subsidiary of TRI Pointe Homes, Inc. (TRI Pointe) merged with and into WRECO, with WRECO surviving the merger and becoming a wholly-owned subsidiary of TRI Pointe. The Reverse Morris Trust transaction was structured to qualify as a tax-free reorganization and the associated distribution of WRECO shares to Weyerhaeuser shareholders as a tax-free distribution. If the transaction were determined not to qualify as a tax-free reorganization,or if the distribution does not qualify as a tax-free distribution, then Weyerhaeuser or its subsidiaries or Weyerhaeuser shareholders may be required to pay substantial U.S. federal income taxes.

If the transaction were determined not to qualify as a tax-free reorganization or the distribution not to qualify as a tax-free distribution, or if Weyerhaeuser were required to indemnify TRI Pointe and WRECO, such taxes and indemnification obligations could be substantial and could materially and adversely affect the company’s liquidity, financial condition and results of operations.





CYBERSECURITY RISKS

We rely on information technology to support our operations and reporting environments. A security failure of that technology could impact our ability to operate our businesses effectively, adversely affect our reported financial results, impact our reputation and expose us to potential liability or litigation.

We use information systems to carry out our operational activities and maintain our business records. Some systems are internally managed and some are maintained by third-party service providers. We and our service providers employ what we believe are adequate security measures. Our ability to conduct business could be materially and adversely affected if these systems or resources are compromised, damaged or fail. This could be a result of a cyber incident, natural disaster, hardware or software corruption, failure or error, telecommunications system failure, service provider error or failure, intentional or unintentional personnel actions or other disruption.



WEYERHAEUSER COMPANY >2014 ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K28






In the ordinary course of our business, we collect and store sensitive data, including intellectual property, other proprietary information and personally identifiable information. If this data is compromised, destroyed or inappropriately disclosed, it could have a material adverse effect, including damage to our reputation, loss of customers, significant expenses to address and resolve the issues, or litigation or other proceedings by affected individuals, business partners and/or regulators.





RISKS RELATED TO OWNERSHIP OF OUR COMMON STOCK





STOCK-PRICE VOLATILITY

The market price of our common stock may be influenced by many factors, some of which are beyond our control, including those described above under "Risks Related to our Industries and Business" and the following:

•actual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results or our competitors' operating results,

•announcements by us or our competitors of new products, capacity changes, significant contracts, acquisitions or strategic investments,

•our growth rate and our competitors’growth rates,

•general economic conditions,

•conditions in the financial markets,

•changes in stock market analyst recommendations regarding us, our competitors or the forest products industry generally, or lack of analyst coverage of our common stock,

•sales of our common stock by our executive officers, directors and significant stockholders,

•sales or repurchases of substantial amounts of common stock,

•changes in accounting principles, and

•changes in tax laws and regulations.

In addition, there has been significant volatility in the market price and trading volume of securities of companies operating in the forest products industry that often has been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies.

Some companies that have had volatile market prices for their securities have had securities litigation brought against them. If litigation of this type is brought against us, it could result in substantial costs and divert management’s attention and resources.





PREFERENCE SHARES

Our common shares will rank junior to our mandatory convertible preference shares with respect to dividends and amounts payable in the event of our liquidation.

Our common shares will rank junior to our mandatory convertible preference shares with respect to the payment of dividends and amounts payable in the event of our liquidation, dissolution or winding-up. This means that, unless full cumulative dividends have been paid or set aside for payment on all outstanding mandatory convertible preference shares for all past dividend periods and the then current dividend period, no dividends may be declared or paid on our common shares. Likewise, in the event of our voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding-up, no distribution of our assets may be made to holders of our common shares until we have paid to holders of the mandatory convertible preference shares a liquidation preference equal to $50.00 per share plus accrued and unpaid dividends.

Certain provisions in the mandatory convertible preference shares could delay or prevent an otherwise beneficial takeover or takeover attempt of us and, therefore, the ability of holders to exercise their rights associated with a potential fundamental change.

Certain provisions in our mandatory convertible preference shares could make it more difficult or more expensive for a third party to acquire us. For example, if a fundamental change were to occur on or prior to July 1, 2016, holders of the mandatory convertible preference shares may have the right to convert their mandatory convertible preference shares, in whole or in part, at an increased conversion rate and be entitled to receive a fundamental change dividend make-whole amount equal to the present value of all remaining dividend payments on their mandatory convertible preference shares. These features of the mandatory convertible preference shares could increase the cost of acquiring us or otherwise discourage a third party from acquiring us or removing incumbent management.

To implement our decision to be taxed as a REIT, we distributed to our shareholders our accumulated earnings and profits, determined under federal income tax provisions, as a “Special Dividend.” On September 1, 2010, we paid a dividend of $5.6 billion which included the Special Dividend and the regular quarterly dividend of approximately $11 million. At the election of each shareholder, the Special Dividend was paid in cash or Weyerhaeuser common shares. The number of common shares issued was approximately 324 million. The stock portion of the Special Dividend was treated as the issuance of new shares for accounting purposes and affects our earnings per share only for periods after the distribution. Prior periods are not restated. The required treatment results in earnings per share that is less than would have been the case had the common shares not been issued.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (MD&A)





WHAT YOU WILL FIND IN THIS MD&A

Our MD&A includes the following major sections:

•economic and market conditions affecting our operations;

•financial performance summary;

•results of our operations — consolidated and by segment;

•liquidity and capital resources — where we discuss our cash flows;

•off-balance sheet arrangements;

•environmental matters, legal proceedings and other contingencies; and

•accounting matters — where we discuss critical accounting policies and areas requiring judgments and estimates.





ECONOMIC AND MARKET CONDITIONS AFFECTING OUR OPERATIONS

The strength of the U.S. housing market strongly affects our Wood Products and Timberlands segments. As published by the U.S. Census Bureau, total U.S. housing starts for 2014 were slightly above 1,000,000 units, with single-family units accounting for 648,000 of the total. This represents a 5 percent increase in single-family starts from 2013, which was 618,000 units. Multi-family construction also increased in 2014 to 358,000 units compared with 305,000 in 2013. While a significant improvement, current housing demand remains well below 1,000,000 single-family starts, the lowest level during the 15-year period of 1992-2007.

Wood Products primarily sells into the new residential building and repair and remodel markets. Demand for wood products has continued to modestly improve in 2014 resulting in prices similar to those in 2013 for most lumber and plywood products. The significant exception was oriented strand board (OSB) where 2014 prices were 31 percent below 2013 as measured by Random Lengths North Central Price.

Demand for logs from our Timberlands segment is affected by the production of wood-based building products as well as export demand in our Western holdings. In the South, Southern pine log prices were slightly higher in 2014 due to the modest improvement in the housing market while Western log prices, helped by demand from China and Japan, increased more substantially in 2014.

Cellulose Fibers is primarily affected by global supply and demand factors and the relative strength of the U.S. dollar. The severe winter weather in the first half of 2014 caused an inventory decline which took most of the year to correct, consequently prices for cellulose fibers were higher in 2014 than 2013. The U.S. dollar gained strength in 2014 as the euro declined 12 percent relative to the U.S. dollar due to slowing growth in Eurozone economies.

COMPARING2014WITH2013

Net Sales

Net sales increased$149 million— 2 percent — primarily due to:

•Timberlands segment sales increased $154 million, primarily due to higher log prices and increased sales volumes in the West, including our acquired Longview Timber holdings.

•Cellulose Fibers segment sales increased $34 million, primarily due to higher sales realizations for pulp.

These increases were partially offset by a $39 million decrease in our Wood Products segment sales, primarily due to lower sales realizations for OSB. This decrease in sales was partially offset by higher sales realizations and volumes for engineered wood products and lumber and increased sales from complementary building products.

Net Earnings Attributable to Weyerhaeuser Common Shareholders

Our net earnings attributable to Weyerhaeuser common shareholders increased$1,242 millionprimarily due to:

•a $926 million increase in earnings from discontinued operations, primarily due to a $972 million net gain on the Real Estate Divestiture recognized in 2014;

•a $333 million decrease in charges for restructuring, closure and asset impairments primarily related to a noncash impairment charge relating to a large master-planned community in north of Las Vegas, Nevada which was retained by Weyerhaeuser in the divestiture of Weyerhaeuser Real Estate Company (WRECO);

•a $206 million increase in gross margin in our Timberlands and Cellulose Fibers segments, primarily due to higher sales realizations and owning Longview Timber for a full year;

•a $166 million increase in other operating income, primarily due to a $151 million pretax gain recognized in 2014 related to a previously announced postretirement plan amendment; and

•a $79 million decrease in our selling, general and administrative expenses.

These increases were partially offset by:

•a $356 million change in income taxes from a benefit in 2013 to an expense in 2014 primarily related to a previously unrecognized tax benefit recorded in 2013 and higher earnings in our Taxable REIT Subsidiary (TRS) in 2014; and

•a $140 million decrease in gross margin in our Wood Products segment, primarily due to lower sales realizations in OSB.

COMPARING2013WITH2012

Net Sales

Net sales increased$1,265 million— 21 percent — primarily due to:

•Wood Products segment sales increased $951 million, primarily due to higher sales realizations and higher sales volumes across all major product lines.

•Timberlands segment sales increased $266 million, primarily due to higher export and domestic log prices, increased sales volumes and the purchase of Longview Timber.

•Cellulose Fibers segment sales increased $48 million primarily due to increased sales volumes.



WEYERHAEUSER COMPANY >2014 ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K35






Net Earnings Attributable to Weyerhaeuser Common Shareholders

Our net earnings attributable to Weyerhaeuser common shareholders increased$155 million— 40 percent — primarily due to:

•a $509 million increase in gross margin in our Wood Products and Timberlands segments, primarily due to higher sales realizations and sales volumes; and

•a $181 million change in income taxes from an expense in 2012 to a benefit in 2013 primarily related to a previously unrecognized tax benefit recorded in 2013.

These increases were partially offset by:

•a $351 million increase in charges for restructuring, closure and asset impairments primarily related to a noncash impairment charge relating to a large master-planned community in north of Las Vegas, Nevada which was retained by Weyerhaeuser in the divestiture of WRECO;

•a $143 million decrease in other operating income, primarily due to a $103 million pretax gain recognized in 2012 related to a previously announced postretirement plan amendment; and

•a $31 million increase in our selling, general and administrative expenses in 2013.

As a REIT, we generally are not subject to corporate level tax on income of the REIT that is distributed to shareholders. We will, however, be subject to corporate taxes on built-in-gains (the excess of fair market value over tax basis at January 1, 2010) on sales of real property (other than standing timber) held by the REIT during the first 10 years following the REIT conversion. We also will continue to be required to pay federal corporate income taxes on earnings of our TRS, which includes our manufacturing businesses and the portion of our timberlands segment income included in the TRS.

The table below summarizes the historical tax characteristics of distributions to shareholders for the years ended December 31:

AMOUNTS PER SHARE201420132012Preference - capital gain distribution$3.19$1.66$—Common - capital gain distribution$1.02$0.81$0.62





LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

We are committed to maintaining a sound, conservative capital structure that enables us to:

•protect the interests of our shareholders and lenders and

•have access at all times to major financial markets.





CASH FROM OPERATIONS

Cash from operations includes:

•cash received from customers;

•cash paid to employees and suppliers;

•cash paid for interest on our debt; and

•cash paid or received for taxes.

Consolidated net cash provided by our operations was:

•$1,088 millionin2014,

•$1,004 millionin2013and

•$581 millionin2012.

COMPARING2014WITH2013

Net cash provided by operations increased $84 millionin2014as compared with2013, primarily due to:

•Cash received from customers increased $180 million as sales increased in our Timberlands and Cellulose Fibers segments.

•Net cash inflows related to income taxes increased $70 million. We received income tax refunds of $52 million in 2014 and paid $18 million in 2013.

•Cash paid for interest decreased $43 million, primarily due to interest received related to tax refunds in 2014 and refinancing of debt in 2013.

These inflows were partially offset by a $189 million increase in cash paid to employees and suppliers primarily due to increased production and the acquisition of Longview Timber.

COMPARING2013WITH2012

Net cash provided by operations increased $423 million in2013as compared with2012, primarily due to a $1,228 million increase in cash received from customers. This inflow was partially offset by:

•cash paid to employees and suppliers increased $715 million as sales and production increased in our Wood Products and Timberlands segments. Receivables, primarily in our Wood Products segment, increased significantly in 2013 compared to 2012 as sales increased; and

•net cash outflows related to discontinued operations increased $75 million.

Pension Contributions and Benefit Payments Made and Expected

During2014, we:

•contributed$43 millionfor our Canadian registered plan in accordance with minimum funding rules and respective provincial regulations;

•contributed to or made benefit payments for our Canadian nonregistered pension plans of$3 million;

•made benefit payments of$24 millionfor our U.S. nonqualified pension plans; and

•made benefit payments of$31 millionfor our U.S. and Canadian other postretirement plans.

There was no minimum required contribution for our U.S. qualified plan for2014, nor were any contributions made to this plan in2014.

During2015, based on estimated year-end assets and projections of plan liabilities, we expect to:

•be required to contribute approximately$38 millionfor our Canadian registered plan;

•be required to contribute or make benefit payments for our Canadian nonregistered plans of$3 million;

•make benefit payments of$19 millionfor our U.S. nonqualified pension plans; and

•make benefit payments of$26 millionfor our U.S. and Canadian other postretirement plans.

We do not anticipate a contribution being required to our U.S. qualified pension plan for2015.

More information can be found inNote 4: Longview Timber Purchasein theNotes to Consolidated Financial Statementsand the "Cash from financing activities" section below.

REAL ESTATE DIVESTITURE

At the close of the Real Estate Divestiture in July 2014, WRECO used $744 million of the debt proceeds to repay intercompany debt and interest to Weyerhaeuser Company. The newly issued debt, remaining proceeds and other WRECO assets and liabilities, including $5 million cash on hand, were acquired by TRI Pointe Homes, Inc. (TRI Pointe) when WRECO became a wholly-owned subsidiary of TRI Pointe at the closing of the transaction. Additionally, $32 million related to the adjustment amount payable pursuant to the terms of the transaction agreement was paid to TRI Pointe. Our net cash proceeds in connection with the Real Estate Divestiture totaled $707 million.

We anticipate that our net capital expenditures for2015— excluding acquisitions — will be approximately $480 million to $500 million. However, that amount could change due to:

•future economic conditions,

•environmental regulations,

•weather and

•timing of equipment purchases.

ACCOUNTING MATTERS





CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Our critical accounting policies involve a higher degree of judgment and estimates. They also have a high degree of complexity.

In accounting, we base our judgments and estimates on:

•historical experience and

•assumptions we believe are appropriate and reasonable under current circumstances.

Actual results, however, may differ from the estimated amounts we have recorded.

Our most critical accounting policies relate to our:

•pension and postretirement benefit plans;

•potential impairments of long-lived assets; and

•legal, environmental and product liability reserves.

Details about our other significant accounting policies — what we use and how we estimate — are inNote 1: Summary of Significant Accounting Policiesin theNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS

We sponsor several pension and postretirement benefit plans for our employees. Key assumptions we use in accounting for the plans include our:

•expected long-term rate of return on plan assets,

•discount rates,

•anticipated trends in health care costs,

•assumed increases in salaries and

•mortality rates.

At the end of every year, we review our assumptions with external advisers and make adjustments as appropriate. Actual experience that differs from our assumptions or any changes in our assumptions could have a significant effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.

Other factors that affect our accounting for the plans include:

•actual pension fund performance,

•level of lump sum distributions,

•plan changes and amendments,

•changes in plan participation or coverage and

•portfolio changes and restructuring.

This section provides more information about our:

•expected long-term rate of return and

•discount rates.

Expected Long-Term Rate of Return on Plan Assets

Plan assets are assets of the pension plan trusts that fund the benefits provided under the pension plans. The expected long-term rate of return is our estimate of the long-term rate of return that our plan assets will earn. Our expected long-term rate of return is important in determining the net income or expense we recognize for our plans.

Over the 30 years it has been in place, our U.S. pension trust investment strategy has achieved a14.6 percentnet compound annual return rate.

After considering available information at the end of2014, we continue to assume an expected long-term rate of return of 9.0 percent. Factors we considered include:

•the net compounded annual return of 10.6 percent achieved by our U.S. pension trust investment strategy the past 5 years and

•current and expected valuation levels in the global equity and credit markets.

Our expected long-term rate of return is important in determining the net income or expense we recognize for our plans. Every 0.5 percent decrease in our expected long-term rate of return would increase expense or reduce a credit by approximately:

•$23 million for our U.S. qualified pension plans and

•$4 million for our Canadian registered pension plans.

Likewise, every 0.5 percent increase in our expected long-term rate of return would decrease expense or increase a credit by those same amounts.

The actual return on plan assets in any given year may vary from our expected long-term rate of return. Actual returns on plan assets affect the funded status of the plans. Differences between actual returns on plan assets and the expected long-term rate of return are reflected as adjustments to cumulative other comprehensive income (loss), a component of total equity.



WEYERHAEUSER COMPANY >2014 ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K46






Discount Rates

Our discount rates as ofDecember 31, 2014, are:

•4.1 percentfor our U.S. pension plans — compared with4.9 percentatDecember 31, 2013;

•3.6 percentfor our U.S. postretirement plans — compared with4.0 percentatDecember 31, 2013;

•3.9 percentfor our Canadian pension plans — compared with4.7 percentatDecember 31, 2013; and

•3.8 percentfor our Canadian postretirement plans — compared with4.6 percentatDecember 31, 2013.

We review our discount rates annually and revise them as needed. The discount rates are selected at the measurement date by matching current spot rates of high-quality corporate bonds with maturities similar to the timing of expected cash outflows for benefits.

Pension and postretirement benefit expenses for2015will be based on the4.1 percentand3.6 percentassumed discount rates for U.S. plans and3.9 percentand3.8 percentassumed discount rates for the Canadian plans.

Our discount rates are important in determining the cost of our plans. A 0.5 percent decrease in our discount rate would increase expense or reduce a credit by approximately:

•$28 million for our U.S. qualified pension plans and

•$5 million for our Canadian registered pension plans.

Likewise, every 0.5 percent increase in our expected long-term rate of return would decrease expense or increase a credit by those same amounts.

LONG-LIVED ASSETS

We review the carrying value of our long-lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable through future operations. The carrying value is the amount assigned to long-lived assets in our financial statements.

An impairment occurs when the carrying value of long-lived assets will not be recovered from future cash flows and is more than fair market value. Fair market value is the estimated amount we would receive if we were to sell the assets.

In determining fair market value and whether impairment has occurred, we are required to estimate:

•future cash flows,

•residual values and

•fair values of the assets.

Key assumptions we use in developing the estimates include:

•probability of alternative outcomes,

•product pricing,

•raw material costs,

•product sales and

•discount rate.

CONTINGENT LIABILITIES

We are subject to lawsuits, investigations and other claims related to environmental, product and other matters, and are required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters, as well as potential ranges of probable losses.

We record contingent liabilities when:

•it becomes probable that we will have to make payments and

•the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated.

Assessing probability of loss and estimating probable losses requires analysis of multiple factors, including:

•historical experience,

•judgments about the potential actions of third party claimants and courts and

•recommendations of legal counsel.

In addition to contingent liabilities recorded for probable losses, we disclose contingent liabilities when there is a reasonable possibility that an ultimate loss may occur.

While we do our best in developing our projections, recorded contingent liabilities are based on the best information available and actual losses in any future period are inherently uncertain. If estimated probable future losses or actual losses exceed our recorded liability for such claims, we would record additional charges in other (income) expense, net. These exposures and proceedings can be significant and the ultimate negative outcomes could be material to our operating results or cash flow in any given quarter or year. SeeNote 15: Legal Proceedings, Commitments and Contingenciesin theNotes to Consolidated Financial Statementsfor more information.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK





LONG-TERM DEBT OBLIGATIONS

The following summary of our long-term debt obligations includes:

•scheduled principal repayments for the next five years and after,

•weighted average interest rates for debt maturing in each of the next five years and after and

•estimated fair values of outstanding obligations.

We estimate the fair value of long-term debt based on quoted market prices we received for the same types and issues of our debt or on the discounted value of the future cash flows using market yields for the same type and comparable issues of debt. Changes in market rates of interest affect the fair value of our fixed-rate debt.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA





REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Board of Directors and Shareholders

Weyerhaeuser Company:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Weyerhaeuser Company and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2014 and 2013, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, cash flows, and changes in equity for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2014. These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Weyerhaeuser Company and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2014 and 2013, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2014, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), Weyerhaeuser Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2014, based on criteria established inInternal Control — Integrated Framework (1992)issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO), and our report dated February 13, 2015 expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

FOR THE THREE-YEAR PERIOD ENDEDDECEMBER 31, 2014





NOTE 1:SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Our significant accounting policies describe:

•our election to be taxed as a real estate investment trust,

•how we report our results,

•changes in how we report our results and

•how we account for various items.

OUR ELECTION TO BE TAXED AS A REAL ESTATE INVESTMENT TRUST (REIT)

Starting with our 2010 fiscal year, we elected to be taxed as a REIT. We expect to derive most of our REIT income from investments in timberlands, including the sale of standing timber through pay-as-cut sales contracts. REIT income can be distributed to shareholders without first paying corporate level tax, substantially eliminating the double taxation on income. A significant portion of our timberland segment earnings receives this favorable tax treatment. We are, however, subject to corporate taxes on built-in-gains (the excess of fair market value over tax basis at January 1, 2010) on sales of real property (other than standing timber) held by the REIT during the first 10 years following the REIT conversion. We continue to be required to pay federal corporate income taxes on earnings of our Taxable REIT Subsidiary (TRS), which includes our manufacturing businesses and the portion of our Timberlands segment income included in the TRS.

HOW WE REPORT OUR RESULTS

Our report includes:

•consolidated financial statements,

•our business segments,

•foreign currency translation,

•estimates, and

•fair value measurements.

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Our consolidated financial statements provide an overall view of our results and financial condition. They include our accounts and the accounts of entities that we control, including:

•majority-owned domestic and foreign subsidiaries and

•variable interest entities in which we are the primary beneficiary.

They do not include our intercompany transactions and accounts, which are eliminated, and noncontrolling interests are presented as a separate component of equity.

We account for investments in and advances to unconsolidated equity affiliates using the equity method, with taxes provided on undistributed earnings. This means that we record earnings and accrue taxes in the period that the earnings are recorded by our unconsolidated equity affiliates.

Throughout these Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, unless specified otherwise, references to “Weyerhaeuser,” “we” and “our” refer to the consolidated company.

OUR BUSINESS SEGMENTS

We are principally engaged in:

•growing and harvesting timber; and

•manufacturing, distributing and selling products made from trees.

Our business segments are organized based primarily on products and services.

Our Business Segments and Products

SEGMENTPRODUCTS AND SERVICESTimberlandsLogs, timber, minerals, oil and gas and international wood productsWood ProductsSoftwood lumber, engineered wood products, structural panels and building materials distributionCellulose FibersPulp, liquid packaging board and an equity interest in a newsprint joint venture

We also transfer raw materials, semifinished materials and end products among our business segments. Because of this intracompany activity, accounting for our business segments involves:

•pricing products transferred between our business segments at current market values and

•allocating joint conversion and common facility costs according to usage by our business segment product lines.



Gains or charges not related to or allocated to an individual operating segment are held in Unallocated Items. This includes a portion of items such as: share-based compensation; pension and postretirement costs; foreign exchange transaction gains and losses associated with financing; and the elimination of intersegment profit in inventory and the LIFO reserve.



WEYERHAEUSER COMPANY >2014 ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K56






FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION

Local currencies are the functional currencies for most of our operations outside the U.S. We translate foreign currencies into U.S. dollars in two ways:

•assets and liabilities — at the exchange rates in effect as of our balance sheet date; and

•revenues and expenses — at average monthly exchange rates throughout the year.

ESTIMATES

We prepare our financial statements according to U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP). This requires us to make estimates and assumptions during our reporting periods and at the date of our financial statements. The estimates and assumptions affect our:

•reported amounts of assets, liabilities and equity;

•disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities; and

•reported amounts of revenues and expenses.

While we do our best in preparing these estimates, actual results can and do differ from those estimates and assumptions.

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

We use a fair value hierarchy in accounting for certain nonfinancial assets and liabilities including:

•long-lived assets (asset groups) measured at fair value for an impairment assessment,

•reporting units measured at fair value in the first step of a goodwill impairment test,

•nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities measured at fair value in the second step of a goodwill impairment assessment,

•assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business acquisition and

•asset retirement obligations initially measured at fair value.

The fair value hierarchy is based on inputs to valuation techniques that are used to measure fair value that are either observable or unobservable. Observable inputs reflect assumptions market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability based on market data obtained from independent sources while unobservable inputs reflect a reporting entity’s pricing based upon its own market assumptions.

The fair value hierarchy consists of the following three levels:

•Level 1 — Inputs are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.

•Level 2 — Inputs are:

–  quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in an active market;

–  quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active; or

–  inputs other than quoted prices that are observable and market-corroborated inputs, which are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data.

•Level 3 — Inputs are derived from valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs or value drivers are unobservable.

CHANGES IN HOW WE REPORT OUR RESULTS

Changes in how we report our results come from:

•accounting changes made upon our adoption of new accounting guidance and

•our reclassification of certain balances and results from prior years to make them consistent with our current reporting.

RECLASSIFICATIONS

We have reclassified certain balances and results from the prior years to be consistent with our2014reporting. This makes year-to-year comparisons easier. Our reclassifications had no effect on net earnings or Weyerhaeuser shareholders’ interest. Our reclassifications present the results of operations discontinued in 2014 separately on ourConsolidated Statement of Operations,Consolidated Balance Sheetand in the related footnotes.Note 3: Discontinued Operationsprovides more information about our discontinued operations.

NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

In March 2013, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2013-05, which provides guidance on a parent’s accounting for the cumulative translation adjustment upon derecognition of a subsidiary or group of assets within a foreign entity. This new guidance requires that the parent release any related cumulative translation adjustment into net income only if the sale or transfer results in the complete or substantially complete liquidation of the foreign entity in which the subsidiary or group of assets had resided. Our prospective adoption of this guidance in first quarter 2014 did not have a material effect on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows.

In July 2013, FASB issued ASU 2013-11, which provides guidance on the presentation of unrecognized tax benefits, reflecting the manner in which an entity would settle at the reporting date any additional income taxes that would result from the disallowance of a tax position when net operating loss carryforwards, similar tax losses or tax credit carryforwards exist. Our prospective adoption of this guidance in first quarter 2014 did not have a material effect on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows.

In April 2014, FASB issued ASU 2014-08, an amendment to the current model of the classification and presentation of discontinued operations and asset disposals that changes the definition of a discontinued operation to include only disposals of components of an entity that represent a strategic shift that has (or will have) a material effect on an entity's financial results. The new standard is effective for all disposals or classifications as assets held for sale for fiscal periods starting after December 15, 2014 and early adoption is permitted. We expect to adopt ASU 2014-08 on January 1, 2015 and have determined that its adoption will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures at that time.



WEYERHAEUSER COMPANY >2014 ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K57






In May 2014, FASB issued ASU 2014-09, a comprehensive new revenue recognition model that requires an entity to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers at an amount that reflects the consideration it expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. The new standard is effective for us on January 1, 2017 and early adoption is not permitted. We may use either the retrospective or cumulative effect transition method. We are evaluating the impact that ASU 2014-09 will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. We have not yet selected a transition method nor determined the effect of the standard on our ongoing financial reporting.

HOW WE ACCOUNT FOR VARIOUS ITEMS

This section provides information about how we account for certain key items related to:

•capital investments,

•financing our business and

•operations.

ITEMS RELATED TO CAPITAL INVESTMENTS

Key items related to accounting for capital investments pertain to property and equipment, timber and timberlands, impairment of long-lived assets and goodwill.

Property and Equipment

We maintain property accounts on an individual asset basis. Here is how we handle major items:

•Improvements to and replacements of major units of property are capitalized.

•Maintenance, repairs and minor replacements are expensed.

•Depreciation is calculated using a straight-line method at rates based on estimated service lives.

•Logging roads are generally amortized — as timber is harvested — at rates based on the volume of timber estimated to be removed.

•Cost and accumulated depreciation of property sold or retired are removed from the accounts and the gain or loss is included in earnings.

Timber and Timberlands

We carry timber and timberlands at cost less depletion charged to disposals. Depletion refers to the carrying value of timber that is harvested, lost as a result of casualty, or sold.

Key activities affecting how we account for timber and timberlands include:

•reforestation,

•depletion and

•forest management in Canada.

Reforestation.Generally, we capitalize initial site preparation and planting costs as reforestation. We transfer reforestation to a merchantable timber classification when the timber is considered harvestable. That generally occurs after:

•15years in the South and

•30years in the West.

Generally, we expense costs after the first planting as they are incurred or over the period of expected benefit. These costs include:

•fertilization,

•vegetation and insect control,

•pruning and precommercial thinning,

•property taxes and

•interest.

Accounting practices for these costs do not change when timber becomes merchantable and harvesting starts.

Depletion.To determine depletion rates, we divide the net carrying value of timber by the related volume of timber estimated to be available over the growth cycle. To determine the growth cycle volume of timber, we consider:

•regulatory and environmental constraints,

•our management strategies,

•inventory data improvements,

•growth rate revisions and recalibrations and

•known dispositions and inoperable acres.

We include the cost of timber harvested in the carrying values of raw materials and product inventories. As these inventories are sold to third parties, we include them in the cost of products sold.

Forest management in Canada.We managed timberlands under long-term licenses in various Canadian provinces that are:

•granted by the provincial governments;

•granted for initial periods of15to25years; and

•renewable provided we meet reforestation, operating and management guidelines.

Calculation of the fees we pay on the timber we harvest:

•varies from province to province,

•is tied to product market pricing and

•depends upon the allocation of land management responsibilities in the license.



WEYERHAEUSER COMPANY >2014 ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K58






Impairment of Long-Lived Assets

We review long-lived assets — including certain identifiable intangibles — for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. Impaired assets held for use are written down to fair value. Impaired assets held for sale are written down to fair value less cost to sell. We determine fair value based on:

•appraisals,

•market pricing of comparable assets,

•discounted value of estimated cash flows from the asset and

•replacement values of comparable assets.

Goodwill

Goodwill is the purchase price minus the fair value of net assets acquired when we buy another entity. We assess goodwill for impairment:

•using a fair-value-based approach and

•at least annually — at the beginning of the fourth quarter.

In2014the fair value of the reporting unit with goodwill substantially exceeded its carrying value.

ITEMS RELATED TO FINANCING OUR BUSINESS

Key items related to financing our business include financial instruments, cash and cash equivalents, accounts payable and concentration of risk.

Financial Instruments

We estimate the fair value of financial instruments where appropriate. The assumptions we use — including the discount rate and estimates of cash flows — can significantly affect our fair-value amounts. Our fair values are estimates and may not match the amounts we would realize upon sale or settlement of our financial positions.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

Cash equivalents are investments with original maturities of90days or less. We state cash equivalents at cost, which approximates market.

Accounts Payable

Our banking system replenishes our major bank accounts daily as checks we have issued are presented for payment. As a result, we have negative book cash balances due to outstanding checks that have not yet been paid by the bank. These negative balances are included in accounts payable on ourConsolidated Balance Sheet. Changes in these negative cash balances are reported as financing activities in ourConsolidated Statement of Cash Flows. We hadnonegative book cash balances as ofDecember 31, 2014andDecember 31, 2013.

Concentration of Risk

We disclose customers that represent a concentration of credit risk. As ofDecember 31, 2014, one customer accounted for approximately13 percentof our accounts receivable balance.

ITEMS RELATED TO OPERATIONS

Key items related to operations include revenue recognition, inventories, shipping and handling costs, income taxes, share-based compensation, pension and other postretirement plans, and environmental remediation.

Revenue Recognition

Operations generally recognize revenue upon shipment to customers. For certain export sales, revenue is recognized when title transfers at the foreign port.

For timberland sales, we recognize revenue when title and possession have been transferred to the buyer and all other criteria for sale and profit recognition have been satisfied.

Inventories

We state inventories at the lower of cost or market. Cost includes labor, materials and production overhead. LIFO — the last-in, first-out method — applies to major inventory products held at our U.S. domestic locations. We began to use the LIFO method for domestic products in the 1940s as required to conform with the tax method elected. Subsequent acquisitions of entities added new products under the FIFO — the first-in, first-out method — or moving average cost methods that have continued under those methods. The FIFO or moving average cost methods applies to the balance of our domestic raw material and product inventories as well as for all material and supply inventories and all foreign inventories.

Shipping and Handling Costs

We classify shipping and handling costs in the costs of products sold in ourConsolidated Statement of Operations.

Income Taxes

We account for income taxes under the asset and liability method. Unrecognized tax benefits represent potential future funding obligations to taxing authorities if uncertain tax positions the company has taken on previously filed tax returns are not sustained. In accordance with the company’s accounting policy, accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are recognized as a component of income tax expense.



WEYERHAEUSER COMPANY >2014 ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K59






We recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities to reflect:

•future tax consequences due to differences between the carrying amounts for financial purposes and the tax bases of certain items and

•operating loss and tax credit carryforwards.

To measure deferred tax assets and liabilities, we:

•determine when the differences between the carrying amounts and tax bases of affected items are expected to be recovered or resolved and

•use enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in those years.

Share-Based Compensation

We generally measure the fair value of share-based awards on the dates they are granted or modified. These measurements establish the cost of the share-based awards for accounting purposes. We then recognize the cost of share-based awards in ourConsolidated Statement of Operationsover each employee’s required service period.Note 17: Share-Based Compensationprovides more information about our share-based compensation.

Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Plans

We recognize the overfunded or underfunded status of our defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans on ourConsolidated Balance Sheetand recognize changes in the funded status through comprehensive income (loss) in the year in which the changes occur.

Actuarial valuations determine the amount of the pension and other postretirement benefit obligations and the net periodic benefit cost we recognize. The net periodic benefit cost includes:

•cost of benefits provided in exchange for employees’ services rendered during the year;

•interest cost of the obligations;

•expected long-term return on fund assets;

•gains or losses on plan settlements and curtailments;

•amortization of prior service costs and plan amendments over the average remaining service period of the active employee group covered by the plans or the average remaining life expectancy in situations where the plan participants affected by the plan amendment are inactive; and

•amortization of cumulative unrecognized net actuarial gains and losses — generally in excess of 10 percent of the greater of the benefit obligation or market-related value of plan assets at the beginning of the year — over the average remaining service period of the active employee group covered by the plans or the average remaining life expectancy in situations where the plan participants are inactive.

Pension plans.We have pension plans covering most of our employees. Determination of benefits differs for salaried, hourly and union employees:

•Salaried employee benefits are based on each employee’s highest monthly earnings for five consecutive years during the final 10 years before retirement.

•Hourly and union employee benefits generally are stated amounts for each year of service.

•Union employee benefits are set through collective-bargaining agreements.

We contribute to our U.S. and Canadian pension plans according to established funding standards. The funding standards for the plans are:

•U.S. pension plans — according to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974; and

•Canadian pension plans — according to the applicable provincial pension act and the Income Tax Act.

Postretirement benefits other than pensions.We provide certain postretirement health care and life insurance benefits for some retired employees. In some cases, we pay a portion of the cost of the benefit.Note 9: Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Plansprovides additional information about changes made in our postretirement benefit plans during2014and2013.

Environmental Remediation

We accrue losses associated with environmental remediation obligations when such losses are probable and reasonably estimable. Future expenditures for environmental remediation obligations are not discounted to their present value. Recoveries of environmental remediation costs from other parties are recorded as assets when the recovery is deemed probable and does not exceed the amount of losses previously recorded.

NOTE 3:DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS

We have made certain reclassifications in our consolidated financial statements to reflect discontinued operations related to WRECO which was previously reported under the Real Estate segment and Unallocated Items.

OPERATIONS INCLUDED IN DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS

Divestiture of WRECO

OnJuly 7, 2014, we completed the following set of transactions resulting in our homebuilding and real estate development business becoming wholly-owned by TRI Pointe Homes, Inc. (TRI Pointe):

•the distribution of shares of WRECO to our shareholders in exchange for59 millionshares of our common stock; and

•the merger of WRECO into a special purpose subsidiary of TRI Pointe, with WRECO surviving the merger and becoming a wholly-owned subsidiary of TRI Pointe.

Collectively, these transactions are referred to as the “Real Estate Divestiture”.

During June 2014, our wholly-owned subsidiary, WRECO, issued$900 millionof unsecured and unsubordinated senior debt obligations. The net proceeds after deducting the discount, underwriting fees and issuance costs were$870 million. At the close of the Real Estate Divestiture in July 2014, WRECO used$744 millionof the debt proceeds to repay intercompany debt and interest to Weyerhaeuser Company. The newly issued debt, remaining proceeds and other WRECO assets and liabilities, including$5 millioncash on hand, were acquired by TRI Pointe when WRECO became a wholly-owned subsidiary of TRI Pointe at the closing of the transaction. Additionally,$32 millionrelated to the adjustment amount payable pursuant to the terms of the transaction agreement was paid to TRI Pointe. Our net cash proceeds in connection with the Real Estate Divestiture totaled$707 million.

For issuances of shares, excess of par value is recorded in "Other capital" in ourConsolidated Balance Sheet.

Proceeds were used to finance the acquisition and pay related fees and expenses. We paid$11 millionin fees related to a bridge loan in 2013. As of the close of the Longview Timber purchase, we did not draw from the loan and these fees were expensed in 2013, which is recorded in "Interest expense" in ourConsolidated Statement of Operations.

We obtained additional debt financing in 2013 which was used to repay all of the assumed debt in 2013. SeeNote 13: Long-term Debt.





NOTE 5:NET EARNINGS PER SHARE

Our basic earnings per share attributable to Weyerhaeuser common shareholders for the last three years were:

•$3.20in2014,

•$0.95in2013and

•$0.71in2012.

Our diluted earnings per share attributable to Weyerhaeuser common shareholders for the last three years were:

•$3.18in2014,

•$0.95in2013and

•$0.71in2012.

This note discloses:

•how we calculate basic and diluted net earnings per share and

•shares excluded from dilutive effect.

HOW WE CALCULATE BASIC AND DILUTED NET EARNINGS PER SHARE

"Basic earnings" per share is net earnings available to common shareholders divided by the weighted average number of our outstanding common shares, including stock equivalent units where there is no circumstance under which those shares would not be issued.

"Diluted earnings" per share is net earnings available to common shareholders divided by the sum of the:

•weighted average number of our outstanding common shares and

•the effect of our outstanding dilutive potential common shares.

Dilutive potential common shares may include:

•outstanding stock options,

•restricted stock units,

•performance share units and

•preference shares.

We use the treasury stock method to calculate the effect of our outstanding stock options, restricted stock units and performance share units. Share-based payment awards that are contingently issuable upon the achievement of specified performance or market conditions are included in our diluted earnings per share calculation in the period in which the conditions are satisfied.



WEYERHAEUSER COMPANY >2014 ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K65






We use the if-converted method to calculate the effect of our outstanding preference shares. In applying the if-converted method, conversion is not assumed for purposes of computing diluted earnings per share if the effect would be antidilutive. Preference shares are antidilutive whenever the amount of the dividend declared in or accumulated for the current period per common share obtainable on conversion exceeds diluted earnings per share exclusive of the preference shares.

Preference shares are evaluated for participation on a quarterly basis to determine whether two-class presentation is required. Preference shares are considered to be participating as of the financial reporting period end to the extent they would participate in dividends paid to common shareholders. Preference shares are not considered participating for the years endedDecember 31, 2014and2013. Under the provisions of the two-class method, basic and diluted earnings per share would be presented for both preference and common shareholders.

SHARES EXCLUDED FROM DILUTIVE EFFECT

The following shares were not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share because they were either antidilutive or the required performance or market conditions were not met. Some or all of these shares may be dilutive potential common shares in future periods.

We issued13.8 million6.375 percent Mandatory Convertible Preference Shares, Series A onJune 24, 2013. We do not include these shares in our calculation of diluted earnings per share because they are antidilutive. SeeNote 4: Longview Timber Purchase.

NOTE 9:PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS

We sponsor several retirement programs for our employees.

This note provides details about:

•types of plans we sponsor,

•significant transactions and events affecting plans we sponsor,

•funded status of plans we sponsor,

•pension assets,

•activity of plans we sponsor and

•actuarial assumptions.

TYPES OF PLANS WE SPONSOR

The plans we sponsor in the U.S. and Canada differ according to each country’s requirements.

In the U.S., our pension plans are:

•qualified — plans that qualify under the Internal Revenue Code; and

•nonqualified — plans for select employees that provide additional benefits not qualified under the Internal Revenue Code.

In Canada, our pension plans are:

•registered — plans that are registered under the Income Tax Act and applicable provincial pension acts; and

•nonregistered — plans for select employees that provide additional benefits that may not be registered under the Income Tax Act or provincial pension acts.

We also offer retiree medical and life insurance plans in the U.S. and Canada. These plans are referred to as other postretirement benefit plans in the following disclosures.

Employee Eligibility and Accounting

The Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Plans section ofNote 1: Summary of Significant Accounting Policiesprovides information about employee eligibility for pension plans and postretirement health care and life insurance benefits, as well as how we account for the plans and benefits. See "Effects of Significant Transactions and Events" below for changes to eligibility in the pension and other postretirement benefit plans.

Measurement Date

We measure the fair value of pension plan assets and pension and other postretirement benefit obligations as of the end of our fiscal year. The fair value of pension plan assets are estimated at the end of the year and are revised in the first half of the following year when the information needed to finalize fair values is received. Additionally, we receive updated census data that is used to estimate our projected benefit obligation. As a result of the Real Estate Divestiture as well as our selling, general and administrative cost reduction initiative, we remeasured our U.S. qualified pension plan during third quarter 2014. There were no significant events that triggered remeasurement in 2013.

EFFECTS OF SIGNIFICANT TRANSACTIONS AND EVENTS

The information that is provided in this note is affected by the following transactions and events.

Amendments of Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Plans for Salaried Employees

Pension Benefit Plan Amendments

During fourth quarter 2013, we ratified an amendment to the Weyerhaeuser Pension Plan that closes the plan to newly hired and rehired salaried or non union employees effective January 1, 2014.  Certain union employee groups adopted similar amendments effective at other dates. Beginning at the effective date, new hires and rehires into groups affected by these amendments will receive a company contribution for retirement in their 401(k) plan. The change was announced in December 2013.

During fourth quarter 2013, we ratified amendments to the Weyerhaeuser Company Limited Retirement Plan for Non-Union Employees and the Retirement Plan for Non-Union Employees of Weyerhaeuser Company Limited at Grand Prairie, Alberta and Grande Cache, Alberta that (1) closes these plans to new hires and rehires effective January 1, 2014 and (2) changes the early retirement reduction for current employees enrolled in these plans, effective for future years of service beginning January 1, 2016. These changes were announced to participants in December 2013.



WEYERHAEUSER COMPANY >2014 ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K68






Postretirement Medical and Life Insurance Benefit Plan Amendments

During fourth quarter 2014, the decision was ratified to reinstate or modify available options for U.S. and Canadian postretirement benefits for certain retirees. As a result, our postretirement obligation increased by$45 million.

During fourth quarter 2013, the decision was ratified to eliminate Company funding of the Post-Medicare Health Reimbursement Account (HRA) for certain salaried retirees after 2014. This change was communicated to affected retirees during January 2014. As a result, we recognized a pretax gain of$151 millionin 2014 from this plan amendment.

Midyear Remeasurement of Assets and Liabilities

Our pension plans are typically remeasured as of fiscal year-end unless a significant event occurs that requires remeasurement. As a result of the Real Estate Divestiture as well as our selling, general and administrative cost reduction initiative, we remeasured our U.S. qualified pension plan during third quarter 2014.

The net effect of the remeasurement was as follows:

•We recognized a$9 millioncharge in third quarter 2014 for curtailments and special termination benefits. Of this amount,$6 millionis included in the net gain on the Real Estate Divestiture and is presented in "Earnings from discontinued operations, net of income taxes" in ourConsolidated Statement of Operations. The remaining$3 millionis included in "Charges for restructuring, closures and impairments" in ourConsolidated Statement of Operations.

•The funded status of our U.S. qualified pension plan was reduced by$291 millionprimarily as a result of a decline in the discount rate used to calculate the projected benefit obligation and also due to asset performance and curtailment and special terminations. The discount rate used to remeasure the pension plans’ liabilities was changed from a rate of4.9 percentat December 31, 2013 to rates reflective of current bond rates on the remeasurement date. A discount rate of4.4 percentwas used as of July 7, 2014. There was no change to the expected rate of return assumption.

•Deferred tax liabilities decreased$108 million.

•Total equity decreased$183 millionfor changes in "Cumulative other comprehensive loss", reflecting the net effect of the items discussed above. Amounts deferred in cumulative other comprehensive loss will be amortized into net periodic pension cost (credits) in future periods.

FUNDED STATUS OF PLANS WE SPONSOR

The funded status of the plans we sponsor is determined by comparing the projected benefit obligation with the fair value of plan assets at the end of the year.

Changes in actuarial assumptions had a negative effect on the funded status of the pension and postretirement plans as of the end of2014. The primary actuarial assumption changes were driven by a change in the discount rates as well as adoption of the updated mortality tables for the U.S. pension and postretirement plans. The Company elected to implement the mortality assumption published by the Society of Actuaries in October 2014, effective December 31, 2014. The updated mortality tables accounted for$387 millionof the increase to the pension liabilities as well as$11 millionof the increase to the postretirement liabilities as of December 31, 2014. The discount rates decreased from4.90 percentat the end of2013to4.10 percentat the end of2014for the U.S. pension plans, and decreased from4.0 percentat the end of 2013 to3.60 percentat the end of 2014 for U.S. postretirement. The discount rates decreased from4.70 percentat the end of2013to3.90 percentat the end of2014for the Canadian pension plans, and decreased from4.60 percentat the end of 2013 to3.80 percentat the end of 2014 for Canadian postretirement.

Our qualified and registered pension plans and a portion of our nonregistered pension plans are funded. We contribute to these plans according to established funding standards. The nonqualified pension plan, a portion of the nonregistered pension plans, and the other postretirement benefit plans are unfunded. For the unfunded plans, we pay benefits to retirees from our general assets as they come due.

The values reported for our pension plan assets at the end of2014and2013were estimated. Additional information regarding the year-end values generally becomes available to us during the first half of the following year. We increased the fair value of plan assets by$53 millionto reflect final valuations as ofDecember 31, 2013.

During2014, we contributed$43 millionfor our Canadian registered plans, we made contributions and benefit payments of$3 millionfor our Canadian nonregistered pension plans and made benefit payments of$24 millionfor our nonqualified pension plans.

The asset or liability on ourConsolidated Balance Sheetrepresenting the funded status of the plans is different from the cumulative income or expense that we have recorded related to these plans. These differences are actuarial gains and losses and prior service costs and credits that are deferred and will be amortized into our periodic benefit costs in future periods. These unamortized amounts are recorded in "Cumulative Other Comprehensive Loss", which is a component of total equity on ourConsolidated Balance Sheet. The Cumulative Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) section ofNote 16: Shareholder's Interestdetails changes in the amounts included in cumulative other comprehensive income (loss) by component.

Accumulated Benefit Obligations Greater Than Plan Assets

As ofDecember 31, 2014, pension plans with accumulated benefit obligations greater than plan assets had:

•$6.6 billionin projected benefit obligations,

•$6.5 billionin accumulated benefit obligations and

•assets with a fair value of$5.6 billion.

As ofDecember 31, 2013, pension plans with accumulated benefit obligations greater than plan assets had:

•$971 millionin projected benefit obligations,

•$948 millionin accumulated benefit obligations and

•assets with a fair value of$726 million.

•$5.7 billionatDecember 31, 2013.

PENSION ASSETS

Our Investment Policies and Strategies

Our investment policies and strategies guide and direct how we manage funds for the benefit plans we sponsor. These funds include our:

•U.S. Pension Trust — funds our U.S. qualified pension plans;

•Canadian Pension Trust — funds our Canadian registered pension plans; and

•Retirement Compensation Arrangements — fund a portion of our Canadian nonregistered pension plans.

U.S. and Canadian Pension Trusts

Our U.S. pension trust holds the funds for our U.S. qualified pension plans, while our Canadian pension trust holds the funds for our Canadian registered pension plans.

Our strategy within the trusts is to invest:

•directly in a diversified mix of nontraditional investments; and

•indirectly through derivatives to promote effective use of capital, increase returns and manage associated risk.

Consistent with past practice and in accordance with investment guidelines established by the company’s investment committee, the investment managers of the company’s pension plan asset portfolios utilize a diversified set of investment strategies.

Our direct investments include:

•cash and short-term investments,

•hedge funds,

•private equity,

•real estate fund investments and

•common and preferred stocks.

Our indirect investments include:

•equity index derivatives,

•fixed income derivatives and

•swaps and other derivative instruments.

The overall return for our pension trusts includes:

•returns earned on our direct investments and

•returns earned on the derivatives we use.

Cash and short-term investments generally consist of highly liquid money market and government securities and are primarily held to fund benefit payments, capital calls and margin requirements.

Hedge fund investments generally consist of privately-offered managed pools primarily structured as limited liability entities, with the general members or partners of such limited liability entities serving as portfolio manager and thus being responsible for the fund’s underlying investment decisions. Generally, these funds have varying degrees of liquidity and redemption provisions. Underlying investments within these funds may include long and short public and private equities, corporate, mortgage and sovereign debt, options, swaps, forwards and other derivative positions. These funds may also use varying degrees of leverage.

Private equity investments consist of investments in private equity, mezzanine, distressed, co-investments and other structures. Private equity funds generally participate in buyouts and venture capital of limited liability entitiesthrough unlisted equity and debt instruments. These funds may also employ borrowing at the underlying entity level. Mezzanine and distressed funds generally follow strategies of investing in the debt of public or private companies with additional participation through warrants or other equity type options.

Real estate fund investments in real property may be initiated through private transactions between principals or public market vehicles such as real estate investment trusts and are generally held in limited liability entities.

Common and preferred stocks are equity instruments that generally have resulted from transactions related to private equity investment holdings.

Swaps and other derivative instruments generally are comprised of swaps, futures, forwards or options. In accordance with our investment risk and return objectives, some of these instruments are utilized to achieve target equity and bond asset exposure or to reduce exposure to certain market risks or to help manage the liquidity of our investments. The resulting asset mix achieved is intended to allow the assets to perform comparably with established benchmarks. Others, mainly total return swaps with limited exchange of principal, are designed to gain exposure to the return characteristics of specific financial strategies.

All swap, forward and option contracts are executed in a diversified manner through a number of financial institutions and in accordance with our investment guidelines.

Retirement Compensation Arrangements

Retirement Compensation Arrangements fund a portion of our Canadian nonregistered pension plans.

Under Retirement Compensation Arrangements, our contributions are split:

•50 percent to our investments in a portfolio of equities; and

•50 percent to a noninterest-bearing refundable tax account held by the Canada Revenue Agency — as required by Canadian tax rules.



WEYERHAEUSER COMPANY >2014 ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K71






The Canadian tax rules requirement means that — on average, over time — approximately 50 percent of our Canadian nonregistered pension plans’ assets do not earn returns.

Managing Risk

Investments and contracts, in general, are subject to risk, including market price, liquidity, currency, interest rate and credit risks. We have established governance practices to manage certain risks. The following provides an overview of these risks and describes actions we take to mitigate the potential adverse effects of these risks on the performance of our pension plan assets. Generally, we manage these risks through:

•selection and diversification of managers and strategies,

•use of limited-liability vehicles,

•diversification and

•constraining risk profiles to predefined limits on the percentage of pension trust assets that can be invested in certain categories.

Market price riskis the risk that the future value of a financial instrument will fluctuate as a result of changes in its market price, whether caused by factors specific to the individual investment, its issuer, or any other market factor that may affect its price. We attempt to mitigate market price risk on the company’s pension plan asset portfolios by investing in a diversified set of assets whose returns exhibit low correlation to those of traditional asset classes and each other. In addition, we and our investment advisers monitor the investments on a regular basis to ensure the decision to invest in particular assets continues to be suitable, including performing ongoing qualitative and quantitative assessments and comprehensive investment and operational due diligence. Special attention is paid to organizational changes made by the underlying fund managers and to changes in policy relative to their investment objectives, valuation, hedging strategy, degree of diversification, leverage, alignment of fund principles and investors, risk governance and costs.

Liquidity riskis the risk that the pension trusts will encounter difficulty in meeting obligations associated with their financial liabilities. Our financial obligations as they relate to the pension plans may consist of distributions and redemptions payable to pension plan participants, payments to counterparties and fees to service providers. As established, pension plan assets primarily consist of investments in limited liability pools for which there is no active secondary market. As a result, the investments may be illiquid. Further, hedge funds are subject to potential restrictions that may affect the timing of the realization of pending redemptions. Private equity funds are subject to distribution and funding schedules that are set by the private equity funds’ respective managers and market activity. To mitigate liquidity risk on the company’s pension plan asset portfolios, the hedge fund portfolios have been diversified across manager’s strategies and funds that possess varying liquidity provisions and the private equity portfolios have been diversified across different vintage years and strategies. In addition, the investment committee regularly reviews cash flows of the pension trusts and sets appropriate guidelines to address liquidity needs.

Currency riskarises from holding pension plan assets denominated in a currency other than the currency in which its liabilities are settled. Such risk is managed generally through notional contracts designed to hedge the net exposure to non-functional currencies.

Interest rate riskis the risk that a change in interest rates will adversely affect the fair value of fixed income securities. The pension trust’s primary exposure to interest rate risk is indirect and through their investments in limited liability pools. Such indirect exposure is managed by the respective fund managers in conjunction with their investment level decisions and predefined investment mandates.

Credit riskrelates to the extent to which failures by counterparties to discharge their obligations could reduce the amount of future cash flows on hand at the balance sheet date. The pension trusts’ exposure to counterparty credit risk is reflected in settlement receivables from derivative contracts within the pension plan assets. In evaluating credit risk, we will often be dependent upon information provided by the counterparty or a rating agency, which may be inaccurate. We decrease exposure to credit risk by only dealing with highly-rated financial counterparties, and as of year-end, our counterparties each had a credit rating of at least A from Standard and Poor’s.

We further manage this risk through:

•diversification of counterparties,

•predefined settlement and margining provisions and

•documented agreements.

We expect that none of our counterparties will fail to meet its obligations. Also, no principal is at risk as a result of these types of investments. Only the amount of unsettled net receivables is at risk.

We are also exposed to credit risk indirectly through counterparty relationships struck by the underlying managers of investments in limited liability pools. This indirect exposure is mitigated through a due diligence process, which focuses on monitoring each investment fund to ensure the decision to invest in or maintain exposure to a fund continues to be suitable for the pension plans’ asset portfolios.

While we do not target specific direct investment or derivative allocations, we have established guidelines on the percentage of pension trust assets that can be invested in certain categories to provide diversification by investment type fund and investment managers, as well as tomanage overall liquidity.

Valuation of Our Plan Assets

The pension assets are stated at fair value based upon the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the reporting date. We do not value pension investments based upon a forced or distressed sale scenario. Instead, we consider both observable and unobservable inputs that reflect assumptions applied by market participants when setting the exit price of an assetor liability in an orderly transaction within the principal market of that asset or liability.

We value the pension plan assets based upon the observability of exit pricing inputs and classify pension plan assets based upon the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement of the pension plan assets in their entirety.  The fair value hierarchy we follow is outlined below;

Level 1: Inputs are unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets and liabilities traded in an active market.

Level 2: Inputs are quoted prices in non-active markets for which pricing inputs are observable either directly or indirectly at the reporting date.

Level 3: Inputs are derived from valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs or value drivers are unobservable.

The pension assets are comprised of cash and short-term investments, derivative contracts, common and preferred stock and fund units. The fund units are typically limited liability interests in hedge funds, private equity funds, real estate funds and cash funds. Each of these assets participates in its own unique principal market.

Cash and short-term investments, when held directly, are valued at cost.

Common and preferred stocks are valued at exit prices quoted in the public markets.

Derivative contracts held by our pension trusts are not publicly traded and each derivative contract is specifically negotiated with a unique financial counterparty and references either illiquid fund units or a unique number of synthetic units of a publicly reported market index. The derivative contracts are valued based upon valuation statements received from the financial counterparties.

Fund units are valued based upon the net asset values of the funds which we believe represent the per-unit prices at which new investors are permitted to invest and the prices at which existing investors are permitted to exit. To the degree net asset values as of the end of the year have not been received, we use the most recently reported net asset values and adjust for market events and cash flows that have occurred between the interim date and the end of the year to estimate the fair values as of the end of the year.

Assets that do not have readily available quoted prices in an active market require a higher degree of judgment to value and have a higher degree of risk that the value that could have been realized upon sale as of the valuation date could be different from the reported value than assets with observable pricing inputs. It is possible that the full extent of market price, liquidity, currency, interest rate, or credit risks may not be fully factored into the fair values of our pension plan assets that use significant unobservable inputs. Approximately$4.8 billion, or85.8 percent, ofour pension plan assets were classified as Level 3 assets as ofDecember 31, 2014.

We estimate the fair value of pension plan assets based upon the information available during the year-end reporting process. In some cases, primarily private equity funds, the information available consists of net asset values as of an interim date, cash flows between the interim date and the end of the year, and market events. When the difference is significant, we revise the year-end estimated fair value of pension plan assets to incorporate year-end net asset values received after we have filed our annual report on Form 10-K. We increased the fair value ofpension assets in the second quarter of2014by$53 million, or1.0 percent.

The net pension plan assets, when categorized in accordance with this fair value hierarchy, are as follows:

•be required to contribute approximately$38 millionfor our Canadian registered plan;

•be required to contribute or make benefit payments for our Canadian nonregistered plans of$3 million; and

•make benefit payments of approximately$19 millionfor our U.S. nonqualified pension plans.

Expected Return on Plan Assets

We estimate the expected long-term return on assets for our:

•qualified and registered pension plans and

•nonregistered plans.

Qualified and Registered Pension Plans.Our expected long-term rate of return for plan assets as ofDecember 31, 2014, is comprised of:

•a7.3 percentassumed return from direct investments and

•a1.7 percentassumed return from derivatives.

Determining our expected return:

•requires a high degree of judgment,

•uses our historical fund returns as a base and

•places added weight on more recent pension plan asset performance.

Over the 30 years it has been in place, our U.S. pension trust investment strategy has achieved a14.6 percentnet compound annual return rate. The past 5 years, our net compounded annual return was10.6 percent.

Nonregistered plans.Canadian tax rules require that 50 percent of the assets for nonregistered plans go to a noninterest-bearing refundable tax account. As a result, the return we earn investing the other 50 percent is spread over 100 percent of the assets.

Our expected long-term annual rate of return on the equity portion of this portfolio — the portion we are allowed to invest and manage — is7 percent. We base that expected rate of return on:

•historical experience and

•future return expectations.

Our expected overall annual return on assets that fund our nonregistered plans is3.5 percent.

Rising costs of health care affect the costs of our other postretirement plans.

Health Care Cost Trend Rates

We use assumptions about health care cost trend rates to estimate the cost of benefits we provide. In2014, the assumed weighted health care cost trend rate was:

•6.4 percentin the U.S. and

•5.7 percentin Canada.

This table shows the assumptions we use in estimating the annual cost increase for health care benefits we provide.

The assumed health care cost trend rate can significantly influence projected postretirement benefit plan payments. Some of the benefits are defined dollar amounts and are unaffected by changes in health care costs. To determine the health care cost trend rate, we look at historical market experience, current environment and future expectations. The following table demonstrates the effect a 1 percent change in assumed health care cost trend rates would have with all other assumptions remaining constant.

UNION-ADMINISTERED MULTIEMPLOYER BENEFIT PLANS

We contribute to multiemployer defined benefit plans under the terms of collective-bargaining agreements that cover some of our union-represented employees.

The U.S. plans are established to provide retirement income for eligible employees who meet certain age and service requirements at retirement. The benefits are generally based on:

•a percentage of the employer contributions paid into the plan on the eligible employee's behalf or

•a formula considering an eligible employee's service, the total contributions paid on their behalf plus a benefit based on the value of an eligible employee's account.

The Canadian plan is a negotiated cost defined benefit plan. The plan is established to provide retirement income for members based on their number of years of service in the industry, and the benefit rate that applied to that service.



The risks of participating in these multiemployer plans are different from single-employer plans in the following aspects:

•Assets contributed to the multiemployer plan by one employer may be used to provide benefits to employees of other participating employers.

•If a participating employer stops contributing to the plan, the unfunded obligations of the plan may be borne by the remaining participating employers.

•If we choose to stop participating in some of the multiemployer plans, we may be required to pay those plans an amount based on the underfunded status of the plan, referred to as a withdrawal liability.



WEYERHAEUSER COMPANY >2014 ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K78






As ofDecember 31, 2014, these plans covered approximately1,200of our employees.

Our contributions were:

•$4 millionin2014,

•$4 millionin2013and

•$4 millionin2012.

There have been no significant changes that affect the comparability of the2014,2013and2012contributions. None of our contributions exceeded more than 5 percent of any plan's total contributions during2014,2013or2012.

DEFINED CONTRIBUTION PLANS

We sponsor various defined contribution plans for our U.S. and Canadian salaried and hourly employees. Our contributions to these plans were:

•$20 millionin2014,

•$20 millionin2013and

•$19 millionin2012.





NOTE 10:VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES

This note provides details about special-purpose entities (SPEs).

SPECIAL-PURPOSE ENTITIES

From 2002 through 2004, we sold certain nonstrategic timberlands in five separate transactions. We are the primary beneficiary and consolidate the assets and liabilities of certain monetization and buyer-sponsored SPEs involved in these transactions. We have an equity interest in the monetization SPEs, but no ownership interest in the buyer-sponsored SPEs. The following disclosures refer to assets of buyer-sponsored SPEs and liabilities of monetization SPEs. However, because these SPEs are distinct legal entities:

•Assets of the SPEs are not available to satisfy our liabilities or obligations.

•Liabilities of the SPEs are not our liabilities or obligations.

In 2013, we repaid a$162 millionnote and received$184 millionrelated to one of our timber monetization SPEs undertaken in 2003. Net proceeds were$22 million. In 2012, we repaid a$97 millionnote and received$110 millionrelated to one of our timber monetization SPEs undertaken in 2002. Net proceeds were$13 million.

OurConsolidated Statement of Operationsincludes:

•Interest expense on SPE notes of:

–$29 millionin2014,

–$29 millionin2013and

–$32 millionin2012.

•Interest income on SPE investments of:

–$34 millionin2014,

–$34 millionin2013and

–$34 millionin2012.

Sales proceeds paid to buyer-sponsored SPEs were invested in restricted financial investments with a balance of$615 millionas of bothDecember 31, 2014, andDecember 31, 2013. The weighted average interest rate was5.5 percentduring2014and5.1 percentduring2013. Maturities of the financial investments at the end of2014were:

•$253 millionin2019and

•$362 millionin2020.

The long-term notes of our monetization SPEs were$511 millionas of bothDecember 31, 2014, andDecember 31, 2013. The weighted average interest rate was5.6 percentduring2014and5.3 percentin2013. Maturities of the notes at the end of2014were:

•$209 millionin2019and

•$302 millionin2020.

Financial investments consist of bank guarantees backed by bank notes for three of the SPE transactions. Interest earned from each financial investment is used to pay interest accrued on the corresponding SPE’s note. Any shortfall between interest earned and interest accrued reduces our equity in the monetization SPEs.

Upon dissolution of the SPEs and payment of all obligations of the entities, we would receive any net equity remaining in the monetization SPEs and would be required to report deferred tax gains on our income tax return. In the event that proceeds from the financial investments are insufficient to settle all of the liabilities of the SPEs, we are not obligated to contribute any funds to any of the SPEs. As ofDecember 31, 2014, our net equity in thethreeSPEs was approximately$105 millionand the deferred tax liability was estimated to be approximately$180 million.

In order to repay the debt that we assumed in the acquisition of Longview Timber, in 2013 we issued$500 millionof 4.625 percent notes due September 15, 2023. The net proceeds after deducting the discount, underwriting fees and issuance costs were$495 million. We also entered into a$550 million7-year senior unsecured term loan credit facility maturing in September 2020 and borrowed$550 million. Borrowings are at LIBOR plus a spread or at other interest rates mutually agreed upon between the borrower and the lending banks.

On October 15, 2013, we repaid the$1,118 millioncarrying value of the debt that we assumed in the acquisition of Longview Timber and related fees, expenses and premiums using the proceeds from the notes issued and the borrowings from our term loan credit facility borrowed in 2013. A pretax charge of$25 millionwas included in our net interest expense in 2013, for early retirement premiums, unamortized debt issuance costs and other miscellaneous charges in connection with the early extinguishment of debt. SeeNote 4: Longview Timber Purchasefor more information.

In addition to the Longview Timber debt and repaying debt that was scheduled to mature, we repaid approximately$40 millionof long-term debt in 2013.

NOTE 14:FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

This note provides information about the fair value of our:

•debt and

•other financial instruments.

FAIR VALUE OF DEBT

The estimated fair values and carrying values of our long-term debt consisted of the following:

DOLLAR AMOUNTS IN MILLIONSDECEMBER 31, 2014DECEMBER 31, 2013CARRYINGVALUEFAIR VALUE(LEVEL 2)CARRYINGVALUEFAIR VALUE(LEVEL 2)Long-term debt (including current maturities)$4,891$5,922$4,891$5,683

To estimate the fair value of long-term debt, we used the following valuation approaches:

•market approach — based on quoted market prices we received for the same types and issues of our debt; or

•income approach — based on the discounted value of the future cash flows using market yields for the same type and comparable issues of debt.

The inputs to these valuations are based on market data obtained from independent sources or information derived principally from observable market data.

The difference between the fair value and the carrying value represents the theoretical net premium or discount we would pay or receive to retire all debt at the measurement date.

FAIR VALUE OF OTHER FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

We believe that our other financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, receivables, and payables, have net carrying values that approximate their fair values with only insignificant differences. This is primarily due to:

•the short-term nature of these instruments,

•carrying short-term investments at expected net realizable value and

•the allowance for doubtful accounts.





NOTE 15:LEGAL PROCEEDINGS, COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

This note provides details about our:

•legal proceedings,

•environmental matters and

•commitments and other contingencies.

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

We are party to various legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business. We are not currently a party to any legal proceeding that management believes could have a material adverse effect on our long-term consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS

Our environmental matters include:

•site remediation and

•asset retirement obligations.

Site Remediation

Under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act — commonly known as the Superfund — and similar state laws, we:

•are a party to various proceedings related to the cleanup of hazardous waste sites and

•have been notified that we may be a potentially responsible party related to the cleanup of other hazardous waste sites for which proceedings have not yet been initiated.

Our established reserves.We have established reserves for estimated remediation costs on the active Superfund sites and other sites for which we are responsible. These reserves are recorded in "Accrued liabilities" and "Other liabilities" in ourConsolidated Balance Sheet.

Changes in the Reserve for Environmental Remediation

WEYERHAEUSER COMPANY >2014 ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K82






We change our accrual to reflect:

•new information on any site concerning implementation of remediation alternatives,

•updates on prior cost estimates and new sites and

•costs incurred to remediate sites.

Estimates.We believe it is reasonably possible, based on currently available information and analysis, that remediation costs for all identified sites may exceed our existing reserves by up to$108 million.

This estimate, in which those additional costs may be incurred over several years, is the upper end of the range of reasonably possible additional costs. The estimate:

•is much less certain than the estimates on which our accruals currently are based, and

•uses assumptions that are less favorable to us among the range of reasonably possible outcomes.

In estimating our current accruals and the possible range of additional future costs, we:

•assumed we will not bear the entire cost of remediation of every site,

•took into account the ability of other potentially responsible parties to participate, and

•considered each party’s financial condition and probable contribution on a per-site basis.

We have not recorded any amounts for potential recoveries from insurance carriers.

Asset Retirement Obligations

We have obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets consisting primarily of reforestation obligations related to forest management licenses in Canada and obligations to close and cap landfills. Some of our sites have asbestos containing materials. We have met our current legal obligation to identify and manage these materials. In situations where we cannot reasonably determine when asbestos containing materials might be removed from the sites, we have not recorded an accrual because the fair value of the obligation cannot be reasonably estimated. These obligations are recorded in "Accrued liabilities" and "Other liabilities" in ourConsolidated Balance Sheet.

•common shares,

•share-repurchase programs and

•cumulative other comprehensive income (loss).

PREFERRED AND PREFERENCE SHARES

We hadnopreferred shares outstanding at the end of2014or2013. However, we have authorization to issue7 millionpreferred shares with a par value of$1per share.

As part of our purchase of Longview Timber, we issued13.8 millionof our 6.375 percent Mandatory Convertible Preference Shares, Series A, par value$1.00and liquidation preference of$50.00per share onJune 24, 2013, for net proceeds of$669 million, which remained outstanding at year-end2014. Dividends will be payable on a cumulative basis when, as and if declared by our Board of Directors, at an annual rate of6.375 percenton the liquidation preference. We may pay declared dividends in cash or, subject to certain limitations, in common shares or by delivery of any combination of cash and common shares on January 1, April 1, July 1 and October 1 of each year, commencing on October 1, 2013, through, and including, July 1, 2016. These shares will automatically convert on July 1, 2016 into between1.5090and1.8107of our common shares, subject to anti-dilution adjustments. At any time prior to that date, holders may elect to convert each share into common shares at the minimum conversion rate of1.5090common shares, subject to anti-dilution adjustments. SeeNote 4: Longview Timber Purchasefor more information.

We may issue preferred or preference shares at one time or through a series of offerings. The shares may have varying rights and preferences that can include:

•dividend rates,

•redemption rights,

•conversion terms,

•sinking-fund provisions,

•values in liquidation and

•voting rights.

When issued, outstanding preferred and preference shares rank senior to outstanding common shares. That means preferred and preference shares would receive dividends and assets available on liquidation before any payments are made to common shares.

NOTE 17:SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION

Share-based compensation expense was:

•$40 millionin2014,

•$42 millionin2013and

•$37 millionin2012.

The amounts above contain awards to employees that were part of the Real Estate Divestiture and are included in our results of discontinued operations. These amounts are:

•$3 millionin2014,

•$5 millionin2013and

•$4 millionin2012.

This note provides details about:

•our Long-Term Incentive Compensation Plan (2013 Plan),

•how we account for share-based awards,

•tax benefits of share-based awards,

•types of share-based compensation and

•unrecognized share-based compensation.

OUR LONG-TERM INCENTIVE COMPENSATION PLAN

Our long-term incentive plans provide for share-based awards that include:

•stock options,

•stock appreciation rights,

•restricted stock,



WEYERHAEUSER COMPANY >2014 ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K86






•restricted stock units,

•performance shares and

•performance share units.

We may issue future grants of up to19,466,670shares under the 2013 Plan. We also have the right to reissue forfeited and expired grants.

For stock options and stock appreciation rights:

•An individual participant may receive a grant of up to2 millionshares in any one calendar year.

•The exercise price is required to be the market price on the date of the grant.

For restricted stock, restricted stock units, performance shares, performance share units or other equity grants:

•An individual participant may receive a grant of up to1 millionshares annually.

•No participant may be granted awards that exceed$10 millionearned in a 12 month period.

The Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors (the Committee) annually establishes an overall pool of stock awards available for grants based on performance.

For stock-settled awards, we:

•issue new stock into the marketplace and

•generally do not repurchase shares in connection with issuing new awards.

Our common shares would increase by approximately34 millionshares if all share-based awards were exercised or vested. These include:

•all options, restricted stock units, and performance share units outstanding atDecember 31, 2014under the 2013 Plan and 2004 Plan; and

•all remaining options, restricted stock units, and performance share units that could be granted under the 2013 Plan.

HOW WE ACCOUNT FOR SHARE-BASED AWARDS

We:

•use a fair-value-based measurement for share-based awards, and

•recognize the cost of share-based awards in our consolidated financial statements.

We recognize the cost of share-based awards in ourConsolidated Statement of Operationsover the required service period — generally the period from the date of the grant to the date when it is vested. Special situations include:

•Awards that vest upon retirement — the required service period ends on the date an employee is eligible for retirement, including early retirement.

•Awards that continue to vest following job elimination or the sale of a business — the required service period ends on the date the employment from the company is terminated.

In these special situations, compensation expense from share-based awards is recognized over a period that is shorter than the stated vesting period.

TAX BENEFITS OF SHARE-BASED AWARDS

Our total income tax benefit from share-based awards — as recognized in ourConsolidated Statement of Operations— for the last three years was:

•$11 millionin2014,

•$10 millionin2013, and

•$9 millionin2012.

The amounts above contain income tax benefit from share-based awards to employees that were part of the Real Estate Divestiture and are included in our results of discontinued operations. These amounts are:

•$1 millionin2014,

•$2 millionin2013and

•$1 millionin2012.

Tax benefits for share-based awards are accrued as stock compensation expense is recognized in theConsolidated Statement of Operations. Tax benefits on share-based awards are realized when:

•restricted shares and restricted share units vest,

•performance shares and performance share units vest,

•stock options are exercised and

•stock appreciation rights are exercised.

When actual tax benefits realized exceed the tax benefits accrued for share-based awards, we realize an excess tax benefit. We report the excess tax benefit as financing cash inflows rather than operating cash inflows. We had excess tax benefits of:

•$10 millionin2014,

•$13 millionin2013and

•$5 millionin2012.

The amounts above contain excess tax benefits from share-based awards to employees that were part of the Real Estate Divestiture and are included in our results of discontinued operations. These amounts are:

•$2 millionin2014,

•$2 millionin2013and

•$1 millionin2012.



WEYERHAEUSER COMPANY >2014 ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K87






TYPES OF SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION

Our share-based compensation is in the form of:

•stock options,

•restricted stock units,

•performance share units,

•stock appreciation rights and

•deferred compensation stock equivalent units.

STOCK OPTIONS

Stock options entitle award recipients to purchase shares of our common stock at a fixed exercise price. We grant stock options with an exercise price equal to the market price of our stock on the date of the grant.

The Details

Our stock options generally:

•vest over four years of continuous service and

•must be exercised within 10 years of the grant-date.

The vesting and post-termination vesting terms for stock options granted in2014,2013and2012were as follows:

•vest ratably over four years;

•vest or continue to vest in the event of death while employed, disability or retirement at an age of at least 62;

•continue to vest upon retirement at an age of at least 62, but a portion of the grant is forfeited if retirement occurs before the one year anniversary of the grant;

•continue to vest for one year in the event of involuntary termination when the retirement criteria has not been met; and

•stop vesting for all other situations including early retirement prior to age 62.

Our Accounting

We use a Black-Scholes option valuation model to estimate the fair value of every stock option award on its grant-date.

In our estimates, we use:

•historical data — for option exercise time and employee terminations;

•a Monte-Carlo simulation — for how long we expect granted options to be outstanding; and

•the U.S. Treasury yield curve — for the risk-free rate. We use a yield curve over a period matching the expected term of the grant.

The expected volatility in our valuation model is based on:

•implied volatilities from traded options on our stock,

•historical volatility of our stock and

•other factors.

Share-based compensation expense for stock options is generally recognized over the vesting period. There are exceptions for stock options awarded to employees who:

•are eligible for retirement;

•will become eligible for retirement during the vesting period; or

•whose employment is terminated during the vesting period due to job elimination or the sale of a business.



In these cases, we record the share-based compensation expense over a required service period that is less than the stated vesting period.

RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS

Through the Plan, we award restricted stock units — grants that entitle the holder to shares of our stock as the award vests.

The Details

Our restricted stock units granted in2014,2013and2012generally:

•vest ratably over four years;

•immediately vest in the event of death while employed or disability;

•continue to vest upon retirement at an age of at least 62, but a portion of the grant is forfeited if retirement occurs before the one year anniversary of the grant;

•continue vesting for one year in the event of involuntary termination when the retirement has not been met; and

•will be forfeited upon termination of employment in all other situations including early retirement prior to age 62.

Our Accounting

The fair value of our restricted stock units is the market price of our stock on the grant-date of the awards.

We generally record share-based compensation expense for restricted stock units over the four-year vesting period. Generally for restricted stock units that continue to vest following the termination of employment, we record the share-based compensation expense over a required service period that is less than the stated vesting period.

Activity

The following table shows our restricted stock unit activity for2014.

The total grant-date fair value of restricted stock units vested was:

•$16 millionin2014,

•$14 millionin2013and

•$19 millionin2012.

Nonvested restricted stock units accrue dividends that are paid out when restricted stock units vest. Any restricted stock units forfeited will not receive dividends.

As restricted stock units vest, a portion of the shares awarded is withheld to cover employee taxes. As a result, the number of stock units vested and the number of common shares issued will differ.

PERFORMANCE SHARE UNITS

As part of a new long-term incentive compensation strategy intended to tie executive compensation more closely to company performance, we granted a target number of performance share units to executives in2014,2013,2012and2011. Performance share units will be paid in the form of shares of Weyerhaeuser stock – to the extent earned through company performance against financial goals – over a four-year vesting period.

The Details

The final number of shares awarded will range from0 percentto150 percentof each grant’s target, depending upon actual company performance.

The ultimate number of performance share units earned is based on two measures:

•Weyerhaeuser’s cash flow during the first year determined the initial number of units earned and

•Weyerhaeuser’s relative total shareholder return (TSR) ranking in the S&P 500 during the first two years is used to adjust the initial number of units earned up or down by20 percent.

At the end of the two-year performance period and over a further two-year vesting period, performance share units would be paid in shares of our stock. Performance share units granted and that are earned vest as follows:

•vest 50 percent, 25 percent and 25 percent on the second, third and fourth anniversaries of the grant-date, respectively, as long as the individual remains employed by the company;

•fully vest in the event the participant dies or becomes disabled while employed;

•continue to vest upon retirement at an age of at least 62, but a portion of the grant is forfeited if retirement occurs before the one year anniversary of the grant;

•continue vesting for one year in the event of involuntary termination when the retirement has not been met; and

•will be forfeited upon termination of employment in all other situations including early retirement prior to age 62.

Our Accounting

Since the award contains a market condition, the effect of the market condition is reflected in the grant-date fair value which is estimated using a Monte Carlo simulation model. This model estimates the TSR ranking of the company among the S&P 500 index over the two-year performance period. Compensation expense is based on the estimated probable number of earned awards and recognized over the four-year vesting period on an accelerated basis. Generally, compensation expense would be reversed if the performance condition is not met unless the requisite service period has been achieved.

The total grant-date fair value of performance share units vested was:

•$7 millionin2014and

•$5 millionin2013.

There werenoperformance share units vesting in2012.

For 2014 grants, the company exceeded the cash flow target, resulting in an initial number of shares earned equal to114 percentof target.

For 2013 grants, the company exceeded the cash flow target, resulting in an initial number of shares earned equal to150 percentof target. Because the company's two-year TSR ranking was between the 25thand 50thpercentile, the initial number of performance shares granted decreased15 percent.

For 2012 grants, the company exceeded the cash flow target, resulting in an initial number of shares earned equal to122 percentof target. Because the company's two-year TSR ranking was between the 50thand 75thpercentile, the initial number of performance shares granted increased17 percent.

As performance share units vest, a portion of the shares awarded is withheld to cover participant taxes. As a result, the number of stock units vested and the number of common shares issued will differ.

STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHTS

Through the Plan, we grant cash-settled stock appreciation rights as part of certain compensation awards.

The Details

Stock appreciation rights are similar to stock options. Employees benefit when the market price of our stock is higher on the exercise date than it was on the date the stock appreciation rights were granted. The differences are that the employee:

•receives the benefit as a cash award and

•does not purchase the underlying stock.

The vesting conditions and exceptions are the same as for 10-year stock options. Details are in the Stock Options section earlier in this note.

Stock appreciation rights are generally issued to employees outside of the U.S.

Our Accounting

We use a Black-Scholes option-valuation model to estimate the fair value of a stock appreciation right on its grant-date and every subsequent reporting date that the right is outstanding. Stock appreciation rights are liability-classified awards and the fair value is remeasured at every reporting date.

The process used to develop our valuation assumptions is the same as for the 10-year stock options we grant. Details are in the Stock Options section earlier in this note.

UNRECOGNIZED SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION

As ofDecember 31, 2014, our unrecognized share-based compensation cost for all types of share-based awards included:

•$39 millionrelated to non-vested equity-classified share-based compensation arrangements — expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately2.3 years; and

•$1 millionrelated to non-vested liability-classified stock appreciation rights — expected to vest over a weighted average period of approximately2.3 years.

DEFERRED COMPENSATION STOCK EQUIVALENT UNITS

Certain employees and our board of directors may defer compensation into stock-equivalent units.

The Details

The plan works differently for employees and directors.

Eligible employees:

•may choose to defer all or part of their bonus into stock-equivalent units;

•may choose to defer part of their salary, except for executive officers; and

•receive a 15 percent premium if the deferral is for at least five years.

Our directors:

•receive a portion of their annual retainer fee in the form of restricted stock units, which vest over one year and may be deferred into stock-equivalent units;

•may choose to defer some or all of the remainder of their annual retainer fee into stock-equivalent units; and

•do not receive a premium for their deferrals.

Employees and directors also choose when the deferrals will be paid out although no deferrals may be paid until after the separation from service of the employee or director.

Our Accounting

We settle all deferred compensation accounts in cash for our employees. Our directors receive shares of common stock as payment for stock-equivalent units. In addition, we credit all stock-equivalent accounts with dividend equivalents.

During 2012, the directors' deferred compensation plan was amended to allow the directors to elect to receive payments of amounts deferred into stock-equivalent units in cash or stock for elections made prior to December 31, 2011. Deferrals made beginning January 1, 2012, into stock-equivalent units will be paid in common shares. Elections to receive these deferred amounts in stock resulted in the issuance of71,056in 2014,52,720in 2013 and40,899shares in 2012. The number of common shares to be issued in the future to directors who elected common share payments is605,987.

Stock-equivalent units are:

•liability-classified awards and

•re-measured to fair value at every reporting date.

The fair value of a stock-equivalent unit is equal to the market price of our stock.

Activity

The number of stock-equivalent units outstanding in our deferred compensation accounts was:

•944,966as ofDecember 31, 2014;

•915,160as ofDecember 31, 2013; and

•971,650as ofDecember 31, 2012.

RESTRUCTURING AND CLOSURES

During 2014, our restructuring and closure charges were primarily related to our selling, general and administrative cost reduction initiative to support achieving our competitive performance goals. We do not expect additional material charges related to this initiative in 2015. During 2013 and 2012, our restructuring and closure charges were primarily related to various Wood Products operations we closed or curtailed and restructuring our corporate staff functions to support achieving our competitive performance goals.

Other restructuring and closure costs include lease termination charges, dismantling and demolition of plant and equipment, gain or loss on disposition of assets, environmental cleanup costs and incremental costs to wind down operating facilities.

ASSET IMPAIRMENTS

The Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and Goodwill sections ofNote 1: Summary of Significant Accounting Policiesprovide details about how we account for these impairments. Additional information can also be found in ourCritical Accounting Policies.

Long-Lived Assets

Our long-lived asset impairments were primarily related to the following:

•2013 — charges include:

–

$356 million

impairment of the Coyote Springs Property. Under the terms of the TRI Pointe transaction, certain assets and liabilities of WRECO and its subsidiaries were excluded from the transaction and retained by Weyerhaeuser, including assets and liabilities relating to the Coyote Springs Property. During fourth quarter 2013, following the announcement of the TRI Pointe transaction, WRECO and Weyerhaeuser began exploring strategic alternatives for the Coyote Springs Property and determined that Weyerhaeuser’s strategy for development of the Coyote Springs Property will likely differ from WRECO’s current development plan. WRECO’s development plan was long-term in nature with development and net cash flows covering at least 15-20 years. The undiscounted cash flows for the Coyote Springs Property under the WRECO development plan remained above the carrying value of the property. Weyerhaeuser Company’s strategy is to cease holding the Coyote Springs Property for development and to initiate activities in the near-term to market the assets to potential third-party buyers. The undiscounted cash flows under the Weyerhaeuser Company asset sale strategy were below the carrying value of the property. Consequently, we recorded a noncash charge of

$356 million

in fourth quarter 2013 for the impairment of the Coyote Springs Property in Unallocated Items. The fair value of the property was primarily based on an independent appraisal that was determined using both other observable inputs (Level 2) related to other market transactions and significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) such as the timing and amounts of future cash flows related to the development of the property, timing and amounts of proceeds from acreage sales, access to water for use on the property and discount rates applicable to the future cash flows. The property is recorded in "Property and equipment, net" and "Other assets" in our

Consolidated Balance Sheet

.

–$9 millionrelated to the decision to permanently close our Colbert, Georgia engineered wood products facility in our Wood Products segment that was previously indefinitely closed. The fair value of the facility was determined using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) based on liquidation values.

•2012 — charges are primarily related to unutilized assets held in Unallocated Items that were sold or are currently held for sale. The fair values of the assets were determined using significant other observable inputs (Level 2) based on market quotes and significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) based on discounted cash flow models.

OTHER INFORMATION ABOUT OUR DEFERRED INCOME TAX ASSETS (LIABILITIES)

Other information about our deferred income tax assets (liabilities) include:

•net operating loss and credit carryforwards,

•valuation allowances and

•reinvestment of undistributed earnings.

Net Operating Loss and Credit Carryforwards

Our state and foreign net operating loss carryforwards as of the end of2014are as follows:

•$586 million, which expire from2015through2034; and

•$1 million, which do not expire.

Our federal, state and foreign credit carryforwards as of the end of2014are as follows:

•$148 million, which expire from2015through2034; and

•$31 million, which do not expire.

Valuation Allowances

With the exception of the valuation allowance discussed below, we believe it is more likely than not that we will have sufficient future taxable income to realize our deferred tax assets.

Our valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets was$72 millionas of the end of2014. This primarily related to foreign and state net operating losses and state and provincial credits.

The total changes in our valuation allowance over the last year was a net decrease of$17 million. This net decrease resulted primarily from the disposition of foreign entities with net operating losses and the expiration of foreign and state net operating losses and credits.

Reinvestment of Undistributed Earnings

The balance of our foreign undistributed earnings was approximately$27 millionat the end of2014and is permanently reinvested; therefore, it is not subject to U.S. income tax. Generally, such earnings become subject to U.S. tax upon the remittance of dividends and under certain other circumstances. It is not practicable to estimate the amount of deferred tax liability related to investments in our foreign subsidiaries.

HOW WE ACCOUNT FOR INCOME TAXES

The Income Taxes section ofNote 1: Summary of Significant Accounting Policiesprovides details about how we account for our income taxes.

UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS

Unrecognized tax benefits represent potential future obligations to taxing authorities if uncertain tax positions we have taken on previously filed tax returns are not sustained. The total amount of unrecognized tax benefits as ofDecember 31, 2014and2013, are$11 millionand$26 million, respectively, which does not include related interest of$3 millionand$4 million, respectively. These amounts represent the gross amount of exposure in individual jurisdictions and do not reflect any additional benefits expected to be realized if such positions were not sustained, such as the federal deduction that could be realized if an unrecognized state deduction was not sustained.

The net liability recorded in ourConsolidated Balance Sheetrelated to unrecognized tax benefits was$4 millionas ofDecember 31, 2014, which includes interest of$3 millionand is net of$6 millionin payments made in advance of settlements and$4 millionin credits and loss carryovers available to offset the liability. The net liability as ofDecember 31, 2013, was$24 million, which includes interest of$4 millionand is net of$6 millionin payments made in advance of settlements.

The net liability recorded for tax positions across all jurisdictions that, if sustained, would affect our effective tax rate was$12 millionas ofDecember 31, 2014, and$16 millionas ofDecember 31, 2013, which includes interest of$3 millionand$4 million, respectively.

During fourth quarter 2013, we received a final examination report from the IRS regarding our years under exam. As a result, we recognized a benefit for the reduction of our unrecognized tax benefits primarily relating to alternative fuel mixture credits. In addition, we recognized a benefit for a reduction of interest accrued primarily related to the U.S./Canada Competent Authority settlement.

In accordance with our accounting policy, we accrue interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense.

As ofDecember 31, 2014, no U.S. federal income tax returns are under examination, with years 2011 forward subject to examination. No state jurisdictions are under examination, with years 2009 forward subject to examination. We are undergoing and are subject to examinations in various foreign jurisdictions for tax years 2005 forward.We expect that the outcome of any examination will not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements; however, audit outcomes and the timing of audit settlements are subject to significant uncertainty.

In the next 12 months, we estimate a decrease of up to$6 millionin unrecognized tax benefits due to resolution of examinations.

WEYERHAEUSER COMPANY >2014 ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K99








REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Board of Directors and Shareholders

Weyerhaeuser Company:

We have audited Weyerhaeuser Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2014, based on criteria established inInternal Control — Integrated Framework(1992)issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Weyerhaeuser Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, Weyerhaeuser Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2014, based on criteria established inInternal Control — Integrated Framework(1992)issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of Weyerhaeuser Company and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2014 and 2013, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, cash flows, and changes in equity for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2014, and our report dated February 13, 2015 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements.
