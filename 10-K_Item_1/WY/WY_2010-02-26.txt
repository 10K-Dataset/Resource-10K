CURRENT MARKET CONDITIONS

For the last few years we
experienced the most severe recession since the 1930’s. The U.S. housing market experienced a significant downturn in this recession. The health of the U.S. housing market strongly affects our Real Estate, Wood Products and Timberlands
segments. Real estate focuses on building single family homes. Wood Products primarily sells into the new residential building and repair and remodel markets, and demand for domestic logs is strongly correlated with the production of wood-based
building products. Cellulose Fibers is primarily affected by global demand for absorbent pulp products and the value of the U.S. dollar.

COMPETITION IN OUR MARKETS

We operate in highly competitive domestic and foreign
markets, with numerous companies selling similar products. Many of our products also face competition from substitutes for wood and



WEYERHAEUSER COMPANY>2009 ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K1






wood-fiber products. In real estate development, our competitors include numerous regional and national firms. We compete in our markets primarily through price, product quality and service
levels.

Our business segments’ competitive strategies are as follows:



•Timberlands — Extract maximum value for each acre we own or manage.

•Wood Products — Deliver high-quality lumber, engineered wood products and integrated solutions to the residential construction and
industrial markets.

•Cellulose Fibers — Concentrate on value-added pulp products.

•Real Estate — Deliver unique value propositions in target markets.

WHAT WE DO



This section provides information about how we:



•grow and harvest trees;

•manufacture and sell products made from them;

•build and sell homes; and

•develop land.

For each of our business segments, we provide details about what we do, where we do it, how much we sell and where we are headed.

TIMBERLANDS

Our Timberlands business segment manages 6.6 million acres of private
commercial forestland worldwide. We own 5.8 million of those acres and lease the other 760,000 acres. In addition, we have renewable, long-term licenses on 15.2 million acres of forestland located in four Canadian provinces. The tables
presented in this section include data from this segment’s business units as of the end of 2009.









WHAT WE DO

Forestry Management

Our Timberlands business segment:



•grows and harvests trees for use as lumber, other wood and building products and pulp and paper;

•exports logs to other countries where they are made into products;

•plants seedlings — and in parts of Canada we use natural regeneration — to reforest the harvested areas using the most effective
regeneration method for the site and species;

•monitors and cares for the new trees as they grow to maturity; and

•seeks to sustain and maximize the timber supply from our forestlands while keeping the health of our environment a key priority.

Our goal is to maximize returns by selling logs and stumpage to internal and external customers. We focus on solid
wood and use intensive silviculture to improve forest productivity and returns while managing our forests on a sustainable basis to meet customer and public expectations.

International operations in this segment consist principally of forest plantations, forest licenses and converting assets in South America. We serve as managing partner in these operations which are
either wholly-owned subsidiaries or joint ventures. In China, we are the managing partner in a joint venture established in 2007. We own 51 percent of this joint venture and Fujian Yong’An Forestry Company owns the remaining 49 percent. As of
December 31, 2009, the joint venture managed 45,000 acres of timberlands with 486,000 seedlings planted in 2009.

Sustainable
Forestry Practices

We are committed to responsible environmental stewardship wherever we operate, managing
forests to produce financially mature timber while protecting the ecosystem services they provide. Our working forests include places with unique environmental, cultural, historical or recreational value. To protect their unique qualities, we follow
regulatory requirements, voluntary standards and implement the Sustainable Forestry Initiative®(SFI) standard. Independent auditing of all of the forests we own or
manage in the United States certifies that we meet the SFI standard. In Canada, we certify our forests to the Canadian Standards Association (CSA) standard. Our forestlands in Uruguay are the model for the developing Uruguayan national forest
certification standard, and we have designed them to meet the Program for the Endorsement of Forest Certification (PEFC).



Canadian Forestry Operations

In
Canada, we have licenses to operate forestlands that provide the volume for our manufacturing units in various provinces. When we harvest trees, we pay the provinces at stumpage rates set by the government and generally based on prevailing market
prices. We do not generate any profit in the Timberlands segment from the harvest of timber from the licensed acres in Canada.

Other
Values From Our Timberlands

In the United States, we actively manage mineral, oil and gas leases on our land and use geologic
databases to identify and market opportunities for commercial mineral and geothermal development. We recognize leasing revenue over the terms of agreements with customers. Revenue primarily comes from:



•royalty payments on oil and gas production;

•upfront bonus payments from oil and gas leasing and exploration activity;

•royalty payments on hard minerals (rock, sand and gravel);

•geothermal lease and option revenues; and

•the sale of mineral assets.

In managing mineral resources, we generate revenue related to our ownership of the minerals and, separately, related to our ownership of the surface. The ownership of mineral rights and surface acres may be held by two separate
parties. Materials that can be mined from the surface, and whose value comes from factors other than their chemical composition, typically belong to the surface owner. Examples of surface materials include rock, sand, gravel, dirt and topsoil. The
mineral owner holds the title to commodities that derive value from their unique chemical composition. Examples of mineral rights include oil, gas, coal (even if mined at the surface) and precious metals. If the two types of rights conflict, then
mineral rights are generally superior to surface rights. A third type of land right is geothermal, which can belong to either the surface or mineral owner. We routinely reserve mineral and geothermal rights when selling surface timberlands acreage.

WEYERHAEUSER COMPANY>2009 ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K3






HOW WE MEASURE OUR
PRODUCT

We report Timberlands data in cubic meters. Cubic meters measure the total volume of wood fiber in a tree or log that we can
sell. Cubic meter volume is determined from the large- and small-end diameters and length and provides a more consistent and comparative measure of timber and log volume among operating regions, species, size and seasons of the year than other units
of measure.

We also use two other units of measure when transacting business including:



•thousand board feet (MBF) — used in the West to measure the expected lumber recovery from a tree or log, but it does not include taper or
recovery of nonlumber residual products;

•green tons — used in the South to measure weight, but factors used for conversion to product volume can vary by species, size, location and
season.

Both measures are accurate in the regions they are used, but they do not provide a meaningful basis for
comparisons between the regions.

The conversion rate for MBF to cubic meters varies based on several factors including diameter, length
and taper of the timber. The average conversion rate for MBF to cubic meters is approximately 6.7 cubic meters per MBF.

The conversion
rate from green tons to cubic meters also varies based on the season harvested and the specific gravity of the wood for the region where the timber is grown. An average conversion rate for green tons to cubic meters is approximately 0.825 cubic
meters per green ton.

WHERE WE DO IT

Our timberlands assets are located primarily in North America. In the U.S. we own and manage sustainable forests in nine states for use in wood products and pulp and paper manufacturing. We own or lease:



•4.1 million acres in the southern U.S. (Alabama, Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, Oklahoma and Texas); and

•2.1 million acres in the Pacific Northwest (Oregon and Washington).

Our international operations are located primarily in Uruguay and China where, as of December 31, 2009, we own a total of 315,000 acres and
have long-term leases on another 71,000 acres.

In addition, we have renewable, long-term licenses on 15.2 million acres of
forestland owned by the provincial government of four Canadian provinces.



Our total timber inventory — including timber on owned and leased land in our U.S. and international operations — is approximately 306 million cubic meters. The timber inventory on licensed lands in Canada is
approximately 383 million cubic meters. The amount of timber inventory does not translate into an amount of lumber or panel products because the quantity of end products:



•varies according to the species, size and quality of the timber; and

•will change through time as the mix of these variables adjust.

The species, size and grade of the trees affects the relative value of our timberlands.

Western United States

Our
Western acres are well situated to serve the wood product markets in Oregon and Washington. Their location near Weyerhaeuser mills and many third-party facilities, allows for multiple sales opportunities. In addition, our location on the West Coast
provides access to higher-value export markets for Douglas fir and hemlock logs in Japan, Korea and China. The size and quality of our Western timberlands, coupled with their proximity to several deep-water port facilities, positions us to meet the
needs of Pacific Rim log markets.

Our lands are composed primarily of Douglas fir, a species highly valued for its structural strength.
Our coastal lands also contain western hemlock but to a lesser degree than our fir stands. Our management systems, which provide us a competitive operating advantage, range from research and forestry, to technical planning models, mechanized
harvesting, and marketing and logistics.

The average age of timber harvested in 2009 was 50 years. Most of our U.S. timberland is
intensively managed for timber production, but some areas are conserved for environmental, historical, recreational or cultural reasons. Some of our older









trees are protected in acreage set aside for conservation, and some are not yet logged due to harvest rate regulations. While over the long term our average harvest age will decrease in
accordance with our sustainable forestry practices we will only harvest approximately 1.5 percent of our Western acreage each year.

Southern United States

Our Southern acres predominantly contain southern yellow pine and encompass timberlands in
seven states. This area provides a constant year round flow of logs to a variety of internal and third-party customers. We sell grade logs to mills that manufacture a diverse range of products including lumber, plywood and veneer. We also sell chips
and fiber logs to oriented strand board, pulp and paper mills. Our timberlands are well located to take advantage of road, logging and transportation systems for efficient delivery of logs to these customers.

We intensively manage our timber plantations using forestry research and planning systems to optimize grade log production. We also actively manage our
land to capture revenues from our oil, gas and hard minerals resources. We do this while providing quality habitat for a range of animals and birds, which is in high demand for recreational purposes. We lease more than 95 percent of our acres to the
public and state wildlife agencies for recreational purposes.

The average age of timber harvested in 2009 was 31 years for southern
yellow pine. In accordance with our sustainable forestry practices, we harvest approximately 3.0 percent to 3.5 percent of our acreage each year in the South.

Our forestlands in Uruguay are approximately 50 percent
loblolly pine and 50 percent eucalyptus. On average, the timber in Uruguay is in the first third of its rotation age. It is entering into that part of the growth rotation when we will see increased volume accretion. About 80 percent of the area to
be planted has been afforested to date. The afforestation program is planned to be completed within the next four years.



In Uruguay, the target rotation ages are 21 to 22 years for pine, and 14 to 17 years for eucalyptus. We manage both species to a grade (appearance)
regime.

We also operate a plywood mill in Uruguay with a production capacity of 140,000 cubic meters and a production volume of 80,000
cubic meters reached in 2009. Construction to more than double this capacity is under way and is expected to be completed in 2010.

In Brazil, Weyerhaeuser is a managing partner in a joint venture. We own 67 percent and Fibria Cellulose SA owns 33 percent. A hardwood sawmill with 72,000 cubic meters of capacity produces high-value eucalyptus (Lyptus®) lumber and related appearance wood products. The mill’s production in 2009 was 60,000 cubic meters.

Our investment in China is a joint venture with a public company that is controlled by the state and local governments. Weyerhaeuser is the managing partner in a joint venture started in 2007.
Ownership is 51 percent Weyerhaeuser and 49 percent Fujian Yong’An Forestry Company. The joint venture currently manages 45,000 acres of timberlands with 486,000 seedlings planted in 2009.

In China, the target rotation age is seven years, since we are managing the forests of loblolly pine and eucalyptus for fiber.

We lease and license forestland in Canada from the provincial government to secure the volume for our manufacturing units in the various provinces.
When the volume is harvested, we pay the province at stumpage rates set by the government and generally based on prevailing market prices. The harvested logs are transferred to our manufacturing facilities at cost (stumpage plus harvest, haul and
overhead costs less any margin on selling logs to third parties). Any conversion profit is recognized at the respective mill in either the Cellulose Fibers or Wood Products segment.

Five-Year Trend for Total Net Sales in Timberlands











Percentage of 2009
Sales to Unaffiliated Customers



Log Sales Volumes

Logs sold to unaffiliated customers in 2009 decreased approximately 1.4 million cubic meters — 14 percent — from 2008.



•Sales volumes in the West decreased 2.5 million cubic meters — 36 percent due to weaker domestic and export markets. Our Western sales
to unaffiliated customers are generally higher-grade logs sold into the export market and domestic-grade logs sold to West Coast sawmills.

•Sales to unaffiliated customers in the South increased 1.2 million cubic meters — 51 percent — primarily due to sales of fiber
logs to International Paper for use at locations that previously were owned by Weyerhaeuser and higher grade log sales to domestic customers. Our southern sales volumes to unaffiliated customers are generally lower-grade fiber logs sold to pulp or
containerboard mills. We use most of our high-grade logs in our own conversion facilities.

•Sales volumes from Canada decreased 120,000 cubic meters — 23 percent — in 2009. This reduction in volume was primarily due to having
fewer manufacturing operations and production curtailments.

•Sales volumes from our international operations decreased 24,000 cubic meters — 7 percent — in 2009. This reduction in volume was due
to weaker global markets.

We sell three grades of logs — domestic grade, domestic fiber and export. Factors that
may affect log sales in each of these categories include:



•domestic grade log sales — lumber usage, primarily for housing starts and repair and remodel activity, the needs of our own mills and the
availability of logs from both outside markets and our own timberlands;

•domestic fiber log sales — demand for chips by pulp and containerboard mills; and

•export log sales — level of housing starts in Japan, where most of our North American export logs are sold.



All our domestic and export logs are sold to unaffiliated customers or
transferred at market prices to our internal mills by the sales and marketing staff within our Timberlands business units.

Log Prices

The majority of our
log sales to unaffiliated customers involves sales to the export market and to other domestic sawmills in the Pacific Northwest. Following is a five-year summary of selected export log prices.

Five-Year Summary of Selected Export Log Prices

(#2 Sawlog Bark On — $/MBF)



Our log prices are affected by the supply of and demand for grade and fiber logs and are influenced by the same
factors that affect log sales. Export log prices are particularly affected by the Japanese housing market.

Average 2009 log realizations
in the West and South decreased from 2008 — primarily due to lower domestic log prices caused by the steep decline in lumber prices during the year. Western



WEYERHAEUSER COMPANY>2009 ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K7






export prices also declined due to the weak Japanese economy. Export prices were also influenced by the lower domestic prices.

Minerals and Energy Products

Mineral revenue increased in 2009. Decreased
royalties from oil and gas and mining was offset by increases in oil and gas leasing revenues and revenues from the sale of selected oil and gas producing properties. Royalty revenue decreased as a result of weaker energy prices and reduced demand
for construction aggregates. New drilling activity in the Haynesville Shale area in North Louisiana increased dramatically in late 2009, but due to the timing of initial production the effect on revenue was small. The company continued to explore
geothermal opportunities in Washington and Oregon and entered into a lease for wind power development in Washington.

Catchlight
Energy

Catchlight Energy is Weyerhaeuser’s joint venture with Chevron, which is focused on the commercialization of liquid
transportation fuels produced from conversion of forest-based material. During 2009, Catchlight was engaged in research and development work in the areas of sustainability, feedstock sourcing and scalability, and conversion technologies. Catchlight
Energy also spent time developing relationships with selected technology partners. Results of Catchlight Energy are reported in the Corporate and Other segment.



WHERE WE’RE HEADED

Our
competitive strategies include:



•managing forests on a sustainable basis to meet customer and public expectations;

•reducing the time it takes to realize returns by practicing intensive forest management and focusing on the most advantageous markets;

•efficiently delivering raw materials to internal supply chains;

•building long-term relationships with external customers who rely on a consistent supply of high-quality raw material;

•continuously reviewing our portfolio of land holdings to create the greatest value for the company;

•investing in technology and advances in silviculture to improve yields and timber quality;

•positioning ourselves as one of the largest, lowest-cost growers of global softwood and hardwood timber;

•leveraging our mineral ownership position; and

•positioning ourselves to take advantage of new market opportunities that may be created by energy and climate change legislation and regulation.

In addition, we believe we will generate additional revenues from new products and services, such as wetland
mitigation banking and conservation easements, and from participating in emerging carbon and energy markets.

Wood Products Volume

The volume of wood products sold in 2009 decreased from 2008 primarily due to a significant decline in market demand, resulting from the downturn of the homebuilding and repair and remodel markets. In response to these
market conditions in 2008 and 2009, we sold or closed a number of facilities and curtailed production at several other mills. The sales and closures include:



•Sales:

–2009 — TJ®Commercial business, Albany Trucking and one
veneer mill; and

–2008 — seven U.S. distribution centers.

•Permanent closures:

–2009 — four lumber mills, two engineered lumber mills and six distribution centers; and

–2008 — three lumber mills, four U.S. distribution centers and two Canadian OSB mills that were indefinitely curtailed in 2007.

•Indefinite closures:

–2009 — one lumber mill, three engineered lumber mills and two veneer mills; and

–2008 — one Canadian OSB mill and one engineered lumber mill.

Wood Products Prices

Prices for wood products in 2009 declined from 2008.

In general, the following factors influence prices for wood products:



•Demand for structural wood products used in new residential construction and the repair and remodel of existing homes affects prices. Residential
construction is affected by the rate of household formation and other demographic factors, mortgage interest rates, the need for replacement of existing housing stock and the demand for secondary or vacation homes. Repair and remodel activity is
affected by the size and age of existing housing inventory and access to home equity financing and other credit.

•The availability of supply of commodity building products such as lumber and plywood affects prices. A number of factors can affect supply,
including new capacity, weather, raw material quality and availability and rail and truck transportation availability.

Demand for home construction fell dramatically from 2006 through 2009, with a corresponding drop in demand for the products that we produce and sell. This has put significant and prolonged downward pressure on prices and is evident
in the following graphs.

WHAT WE DO

The Real Estate
segment focuses on:

•constructing single-family housing and

•developing residential lots for our use and for sale.

Real Estate Products and Activities



PRODUCTSHOW THEY’RE USEDSingle-family housingResidential livingLandResidential lots and land for construction and sale,
master-planned communities with mixed-use property

WHERE WE DO IT

Our operations are concentrated in metropolitan areas in Arizona, California, Maryland, Nevada, Texas, Virginia and Washington.

HOW MUCH WE SELL

We are one of
the top 20 homebuilding companies in the United States as measured by annual single-family home closings.

Our revenues decreased to $904
million in 2009 — 36 percent — compared with $1.4 billion in 2008, primarily due to a 32 percent decline in single-family closings and lower average sales prices. The decline in home closings was affected by weak consumer
confidence, high unemployment and increasing foreclosures. Increased inventory of homes available for sale due to foreclosures also continued to put downward pressure on pricing.

The following factors affect revenues in our Real Estate business segment:



•Variances in market prices of the homes that we build.

•The product and geographic mix of sales, which may vary based on the following:

–The markets where we build vary by geography.

–The types of homes we build which range in price points to meet our target customers’ needs from entry-level products in Washington state to
move-up, custom homes in Southern California and the Washington, D.C., metro area.

–The mix of price points since we build traditional, single-family, detached homes and attached products such as townhomes and condominiums.









•Land and lot sales are a component of our activities. These sales do not occur evenly from year to year and may range from approximately
5 percent to 15 percent of total Real Estate revenues annually.

•From time to time, we sell apartment buildings we have built and commercial properties in which we have an ownership interest.

WHAT WE DO

Our Corporate and Other segment includes:



•governance-related corporate support activities and company-wide initiatives such as major system and infrastructure deployments;

•transportation operations — including Westwood Shipping Lines and five short-line railroads — which provide services to our
manufacturing operations and to third parties; and

•results of activities related to discontinued operations.

We also record certain gains or charges in the Corporate and Other segment related to dispositions or events that generally are not related to an individual operating segment.

WHERE WE DO IT

Our
transportation operations include our marine operations, which provide shipping between North America and Asia, and our railroad operations, which are located in the western and southern United States.

As part of our strategic restructuring of our international holdings, we:



•sold our French composite panels operation — December 2005;

•sold our Irish composite panels operation — November 2006;

•restructured our investment in our Uruguay joint ventures in preparation for a partitioning of the assets with the joint venture owners —
June 2007;

•sold our investment in our Australian operations — July 2008.

SeeNote 7: Equity Affiliatesin theNotes to Consolidated Financial Statementsfor more information related to our joint ventures.



HOW MUCH WE SELL

Sales and revenues for our Corporate and Other segment are primarily related to our marine transportation and discontinued international operations. In
2009, our net sales were $165 million compared with $392 million in 2008. The decline in revenues is primarily due to the sale of our Australian operations in July 2008 and decreased revenue in our transportation business during 2009.

Factors that affect revenues in our transportation operations include:



•international trade levels between North America and its trading partners in Asia,

•the profile of our competition within our shipping lanes and

•overall demand for forest products.

NATURAL RESOURCE AND ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS



Many social values are expressed in the laws
and regulations that pertain to growing and harvesting timber. We participate in voluntary certification of our timberlands to assure that we sustain their values including the protection of wildlife and water quality. We are also subject to laws
regulating forestry practices. Changes in law and regulation can significantly affect local or regional timber harvest levels and market values of timber-based raw materials.

ENDANGERED SPECIES PROTECTIONS

In the United States,
a number of fish and wildlife species that inhabit geographic areas near or within our timberlands have been listed as threatened or endangered under the federal Endangered Species Act (ESA) or similar state laws. Some of these listed species
include the northern spotted owl, the marbled murrelet, a number of salmon species, bull trout and steelhead trout in the Pacific Northwest and the red-cockaded woodpecker, gopher tortoise and American burying beetle in the Southeast. Additional
species or populations may be listed as threatened or endangered as a result of pending or future citizen petitions or petitions initiated by federal or state agencies.

Federal and state requirements to protect habitat for threatened and endangered species have resulted in restrictions on timber harvest on some timberlands, including some of our timberlands.
Additional listings of fish and wildlife species as endangered, threatened or sensitive under the ESA or similar state laws as well as regulatory actions taken by federal or state agencies to protect habitat for these species may, in the future,
result in additional restrictions on our timber harvests and other forest management practices. They also could increase our operating costs and affect timber supply and prices in general.

In Canada, the federal Species at Risk Act (SARA) requires protective measures for species identified as being at risk and for critical
habitat. Environment Canada announced a series of western science studies in 2010 that, with other landscape information, are designed to identify critical habitat. The identification and protection of habitat may, over time, result in
additional restrictions on timber harvests and other forest management practices that could increase operating costs for operators of forestlands in Canada. To date these Canadian measures have not had, and in 2010 will not have, a significant
effect on our harvesting operations. We anticipate that future measures will not disproportionally affect Weyerhaeuser as compared with comparable operations.



REGULATIONS AFFECTING FORESTRY PRACTICES

In the United States, regulations established by federal, state and local governments or agencies to protect water quality and wetlands could affect future harvests and forest management practices
on some of our timberlands. Forest practice acts in some states in the United States increasingly affect present or future harvest and forest management activities. For example, in some states, these acts limit the size of clearcuts, require some
timber to be left unharvested to protect water quality and fish and wildlife habitat, regulate construction and maintenance of forest roads, require reforestation following timber harvest and contain procedures for state agencies to review and
approve proposed forest practice activities. Some states and local governments regulate certain forest practices through various permit programs. Each state in which we own timberlands has developed best management practices to reduce the effects of
forest practices on water quality and aquatic habitats. Additional and more stringent regulations may be adopted by various state and local governments to achieve water-quality standards under the federal Clean Water Act, protect fish and wildlife
habitats, or achieve other public policy objectives.

Our forest operations in Canada are carried out on public forestlands under forest
licenses. All forest operations are subject to forest practices and environmental regulations, and operations under licenses also are subject to contractual requirements between us and the relevant province designed to protect environmental and
other social values.

FOREST CERTIFICATION STANDARDS

We operate in the United States under the Sustainable Forestry Initiative®. This is a certification standard designed to supplement government regulatory programs with voluntary landowner initiatives to further protect certain public resources and
values. The Sustainable Forestry Initiative®is an independent standard, overseen by a governing board consisting of conservation organizations, academia, the forest
industry and large and small forest landowners. Compliance with the Sustainable Forestry Initiative®may result in some increases in our operating costs and curtailment
of our timber harvests in some areas. In Canada, we participate in the Sustainable Forestry Initiative®and the Canadian Standards Association Sustainable Forest
Management System standard, a voluntary certification system that further protects certain public resources and values. Compliance with these standards will result in some increases in our operating costs and curtailment of our timber harvests in
some areas in Canada.

WHAT THESE REGULATIONS AND CERTIFICATION PROGRAMS MEAN TO US

The regulatory and nonregulatory forest management programs described above have increased our operating costs, resulted



WEYERHAEUSER COMPANY>2009 ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K17






in changes in the value of timber and logs from our timberlands, and contributed to increases in the prices paid for wood products and wood chips during periods of high demand. These kinds of
programs also can make it more difficult for us to respond to rapid changes in markets, extreme weather or other unexpected circumstances. One additional effect may be further reductions in the usage of, or substitution of other products for, lumber
and plywood. We believe that these kinds of programs have not had, and in 2010 will not have, a significant effect on the total harvest of timber in the United States or Canada. However, these kinds of programs may have such an effect in the future.
We expect we will not be disproportionately affected by these programs as compared with typical owners of comparable timberlands. We also expect that these programs will not significantly disrupt our planned operations over large areas or for
extended periods.

CANADIAN ABORIGINAL RIGHTS

Many of the Canadian forestlands are subject to the constitutionally protected treaty or common-law rights of aboriginal peoples of Canada. Most of
British Columbia (B.C.) is not covered by treaties, and as a result the claims of B.C.’s aboriginal peoples relating to forest resources are largely unresolved, although many aboriginal groups are engaged in treaty discussions with the
governments of B.C. and Canada. Final or interim resolution of claims brought by aboriginal groups is expected to result in additional restrictions on the sale or harvest of timber and may increase operating costs and affect timber supply and prices
in Canada. We believe that such claims will not have a significant effect on our total harvest of timber or production of forest products in 2010, although they may have such an effect in the future. In 2008, the Forest Products Association of
Canada (FPAC), of which we are a member, signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the Assembly of First Nations, under which the parties agree to work together to strengthen Canada’s forest sector through economic-development initiatives and
business investments, strong environmental stewardship and the creation of skill-development opportunities particularly targeted to aboriginal youth.

POLLUTION-CONTROL REGULATIONS

ENVIRONMENTAL CLEANUP

We are involved in the environmental investigation or remediation
of numerous sites. Of these sites, we may have the sole obligation to remediate or may share that obligation with one or more parties. In some instances, several parties have joint and several obligations to remediate. Some sites are Superfund sites
where we have been named as a potentially responsible party. Our liability with respect to these various sites ranges from insignificant to substantial. The amount of liability depends on the quantity, toxicity and nature of materials at the site
and depends on the number and economic viability of the other responsible parties.

We spent approximately $5 million in 2009 and expect
to spend approximately $8 million in 2010 on environmental remediation of these sites. It is our policy to accrue for environmental-remediation costs when we determine it is probable that such an obligation exists and can reasonably estimate the
amount of the obligation. We currently believe it is reasonably possible that our costs to remediate all the identified sites may exceed our current accruals of $31 million. The excess amounts required may be insignificant or could range, in the
aggregate, up to approximately $30 million over several years. This estimate of the upper end of the range of reasonably possible additional costs is much less certain than the estimates we currently are using to determine how much to accrue. The
estimate of the upper range also uses assumptions less favorable to us among the range of reasonably possible outcomes.

REGULATION
OF AIREMISSIONS IN THE U.S.

The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has promulgated
regulations for air emissions from pulp and paper manufacturing facilities, wood products facilities and industrial









boilers. These regulations cover hazardous air pollutants that require use of maximum achievable control technology (MACT) and controls for pollutants that contribute to smog and haze. The U.S.
Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit issued decisions in 2007 vacating the MACT standards for air emissions from industrial boilers and process heaters and remanding the standards for plywood and composite wood products to the EPA. The EPA must
promulgate supplemental MACT standards for plywood and composite products and new MACT standards for boilers. Pending final action by the EPA, some states may implement MACT requirements for boilers on a case-by-case basis. We anticipate that we
might spend as much as $30 million to $100 million over the next few years to comply with the MACT standards after they have been determined by the EPA and the states. We cannot currently quantify the amount of capital we will need in the future to
comply with new regulations being developed by the EPA or Canadian environmental agencies because final rules have not been promulgated.

We closely monitor legislative, regulatory and scientific developments pertaining to climate change. In 2006, as part of the Company’s sustainability program, we adopted a goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 40
percent by 2020 compared with our emissions in 2000, assuming a comparable portfolio and regulations. We intend to achieve this goal by increasing energy efficiency and using more greenhouse gas-neutral, biomass fuels instead of fossil
fuels. 2008 data indicates that we have reduced greenhouse gas emissions by approximately 10 percent considering changes in the asset portfolio.

In 2007, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that greenhouse gases are pollutants that can be subject to regulation under the Clean Air Act. In 2009, the EPA proposed regulations for reporting and controlling greenhouse gas emissions that
are applicable to our manufacturing operations. Some state governments also have released policy proposals that indicate they may regulate greenhouse gas emissions in the future. In addition, Congress is considering and may adopt legislation
regulating greenhouse gas emissions within the next few years. It is not yet known when and to what extent these federal and state policy activities may come into force or how any future federal and state greenhouse gas regulatory programs may
relate to each other. A multistate and federal greenhouse gas emissions reduction trading system may be put in place in the future with potentially significant implications for all U.S. businesses. We believe these measures have not had, and in 2010
will not have, a significant effect on our operations, although they may have such an effect in the future. We expect we will not be disproportionately affected by these measures as compared with typical owners of comparable operations. We maintain
an active forestry research program to track and understand any potential effect from actual climate change related parameters that could affect the forests we own and manage and do not anticipate any disruptions to our planned operations.

REGULATION OF AIR EMISSIONS IN CANADA

We participate in negotiations between the FPAC and Natural Resources Canada to define industry obligations for complying with Canada’s national plan for reducing greenhouse gas emissions over
the next several years. FPAC continues to work with international, national and regional policy makers in their efforts to develop technically sound and economically viable policies, practices and procedures for measuring, reporting and managing
greenhouse gas emissions.

In 2007, the Canadian federal government proposed a regulatory framework for air emissions that adopted some
aspects of the Kyoto Protocol. The federal framework called for mandatory reductions in greenhouse gas emissions for heavy industrial emissions producers, among other measures, to be put in place by 2010. The proposed Canadian framework is
currently being redesigned to conform to anticipated international cap and trade programs. In addition, Environment Canada has reduced the greenhouse gas emission reporting threshold for carbon dioxide equivalents.

Canadian provincial governments also are working on emissions-reduction strategies. Several provinces have adopted rules requiring reporting of
greenhouse gas emissions by large emitters and some provinces require reductions by large emitters. New provincial requirements for reductions in emissions are anticipated in 2010. The Canadian federal government and most provinces also are
considering implementing new or revised emission standards for particulate matter, volatile organic compounds, nitrogen oxides and sulfur oxides.

We believe these measures have not had, and in 2010 will not have, a significant effect on our operations, although they may have such an effect in the future. We expect we will not be disproportionately affected by these measures as
compared with typical owners of comparable operations. We also expect that these measures will not significantly disrupt our planned operations.

POTENTIAL CHANGES IN POLLUTION REGULATION

State governments continue to promulgate
total maximum daily load (TMDL) requirements for pollutants in water bodies that do not meet state or EPA water quality standards. State TMDL requirements may set limits on pollutants that may be discharged to a body of water or set additional
requirements, such as best management practices for nonpoint sources, including timberland operations, to reduce the amounts of pollutants. It is not possible to estimate the capital expenditures that may be required for us to meet pollution
allocations across the various proposed state TMDL programs until a specific TMDL is promulgated.



WEYERHAEUSER COMPANY>2009 ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K19






Various levels of
government in Canada have started work to address water usage and quality issues. Regional watershed protection is increasing and appears to be a part of future water strategies across Canada. As part of our membership in the U.S. Business
Roundtable S.E.E. Change (society, environment and economy) initiative, we established a goal in May 2008 to reduce water use at our cellulose fibers mills 20 percent by 2012, using a 2007 baseline. We achieved a 10 percent water use reduction in
2008 compared to our 2007 baseline.

RISK FACTORS

We are subject to certain risks and events that, if one or more of them
occur, could adversely affect our business, our financial condition, our results of operations and the trading price of our common stock.

You should consider the following risk factors, in addition to the other information presented in this report and the matters described in “Forward-Looking Statements,” as well as the other reports and registration
statements we file from time to time with the SEC, in evaluating us, our business and an investment in our securities.

The risks below
are not the only risks we face. Additional risks not currently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial also may adversely affect our business.





RISKS RELATED TO OUR INDUSTRIES AND BUSINESS



MACROECONOMIC CONDITIONS

The industries in which we operate are sensitive to macroeconomic conditions and consequently highly cyclical.

The overall levels of demand for the products we manufacture and distribute and consequently our sales and profitability reflect fluctuations in levels
of end-user demand, which depend in part on general macroeconomic conditions in North America and worldwide as well as on local economic conditions. Current economic conditions in the United States and the global economic downturn, combined with the
decreased availability of credit and high foreclosure rates, has resulted in a continued weakness in the homebuilding industry (including the company’s Real Estate business), increased inventories of available new homes, significant declines in
home prices, loss of home-equity values and loss of consumer confidence and demand. Our Wood Products segment is highly dependent on the strength of the homebuilding industry and the weakness in that industry has resulted in depressed prices of and
demand for wood products and building materials. This has been further reflected in declining prices and demand for logs and reduced harvests in our Timberland segment. The length and magnitude of industry cycles have varied over time and by
product, but generally reflect changes in macroeconomic conditions. Consumer demand could continue to decline as a result of the current economic conditions, further adversely affecting our businesses.



COMMODITY PRODUCTS

Many of our products are commodities that are widely available from other producers.

Because commodity products have few distinguishing properties from producer to producer, competition for these products is based primarily on price,
which is determined by supply relative to demand and competition from substitute products. Prices for our products are affected by many factors outside of our control, and we have no influence over the timing and extent of price changes, which often
are volatile. Our profitability with respect to these products depends, in part, on managing our costs, particularly raw material and energy costs, which represent significant components of our operating costs and can fluctuate based upon factors
beyond our control. Prices of and demand for many of our products have declined significantly in recent quarters, while many of our raw material or energy costs have increased. This has adversely affected both our sales and profitability.

INDUSTRY SUPPLY OF LOGS, WOOD PRODUCTS AND PULP

Excess supply of products may adversely affect prices and margins.

Industry supply of logs, wood products and pulp is subject to changing macroeconomic and industry conditions that may cause producers to idle or permanently close individual machines or entire mills
or to decrease harvest levels. To avoid substantial cash costs in connection with idling or closing a mill, some producers choose to continue to operate at a loss, which could prolong weak prices due to oversupply. Oversupply of products also may
result from producers introducing new capacity or increasing harvest levels in response to favorable short-term pricing trends. Industry supplies of pulp also are influenced by overseas production capacity, which has grown in recent years and is
expected to continue to grow. While the weakness of the U.S. dollar in recent years has improved the company’s competitive position and mitigated the levels of imports, the recent strengthening of the U.S. dollar and decreases in demand for
consumer products in emerging markets may result in increased imports of pulp from overseas, resulting in lower prices. Continuation of these factors could materially and adversely affect sales volumes and margins of our operations.



WEYERHAEUSER COMPANY>2009 ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K21






HOMEBUILDING MARKET AND ECONOMIC RISKS

Continuing high foreclosure rates, low demand
and low levels of consumer confidence could continue to adversely affect our sales volume, pricing and margins and result in further impairments.

Demand for homes is sensitive to changes in economic conditions such as the level of employment, consumer confidence, consumer income, the availability of financing and interest rate levels. During the period of 2007 through 2009,
the mortgage industry experienced significant instability and increasing default rates, particularly with regard to subprime and other nonconforming loans. This caused many lenders to tighten credit requirements and reduce the number of mortgage
loans available for financing home purchases. Demand for new homes also has been adversely affected by factors such as continued high unemployment, accelerating foreclosure rates and distress sales of houses, significant declines in home values and
a collapse of consumer confidence. Our cancellation rates have fallen, but homebuyers sometimes find it more advantageous to forfeit a deposit than to complete the purchase of the home because of the fear of further price declines. These factors
have resulted in reduced margins and prices and a higher level of sales incentives in many of our markets.

The company has traditionally
carried a larger supply of land for development than many of our competitors. Some of the land was purchased during the last few years. Land prices have fallen in these markets and may continue to fall. As new housing demand in our markets has
fallen significantly, we have elected to sell some of our land and lots at a loss or declined to exercise options, even though that required us to forfeit deposits and write off preacquisition costs. We also have changed our competitive strategies
in some markets and elected to discontinue or postpone development in other markets in response to the downturn. As a result, we have been required to take substantial write-downs of the carrying value of our land inventory.

CAPITAL MARKETS

Recent deterioration in economic conditions and the credit markets could adversely affect our access to capital.

Financial and credit markets have been experiencing a period of turmoil that has included the failure or sale of various financial institutions and an unprecedented level of intervention from the United States government. While it is
difficult to predict the ultimate results of these events, they may impair the company’s ability to borrow money. Similarly, our customers may be unable to borrow money to fund their operations.

Continued deteriorating or volatile market conditions could:



•adversely affect our ability to access credit markets on terms acceptable to us,

•limit our capital expenditures for repair or replacement of existing facilities or equipment,

•adversely affect our compliance with covenants under existing credit agreements,

•result in adverse changes in the credit ratings of our debt securities,

•have an adverse effect on our customers and suppliers and their ability to purchase our products,

•adversely affect the banks providing financial security for the transaction structures used to defer taxes related to several major sales of
timber,

•adversely affect the performance of our pension plans requiring additional company contributions and

•reduce our ability to take advantage of growth and expansion opportunities.

CHANGES IN CREDIT RATINGS

Changes in credit ratings issued by nationally recognized statistical rating organizations could adversely affect our cost of financing and have an adverse effect on the market price of our securities.

Credit rating agencies rate our debt securities on factors that include our operating results, actions that we take, their view of the general outlook
for our industry and their view of the general outlook for the economy. Actions taken by the rating agencies can include maintaining, upgrading or downgrading the current rating or placing the company on a watch list for possible future downgrading.
Downgrading the credit rating of our debt securities or placing us on a watch list for possible future downgrading could limit our access to the credit markets, increase our cost of financing, and have an adverse effect on the market price of our
securities.

SUBSTITUTION

Some of our products are vulnerable to declines in demand due to competing technologies or materials.

Our products may compete with nonfiber-based alternatives or with alternative products in certain market segments. For example, plastic, wood/plastic or composite materials may be used by builders as alternatives to the
products produced by our Wood Products businesses such as lumber, veneer, plywood and oriented strand board. Changes in prices for oil, chemicals and wood-based fiber can change the competitive position of our products relative to available
alternatives and could increase substitution of those products for our products. As the use of these alternatives grows, demand for our products may further decline.









CHANGES IN PRODUCT MIX OR PRICING

Our results of operations and financial condition
could be materially adversely affected by changes in product mix or pricing.

Our results may be affected by a change in our sales
mix. Our outlook assumes a certain volume and product mix of sales. If actual results vary from this projected volume and product mix of sales, our operations and our results could be negatively affected. Our outlook also assumes we will be
successful in implementing previously announced price increases as well as future price increases. Delays in acceptance of price increases could negatively affect our results. Moreover, price discounting, if required to maintain our competitive
position, could result in lower than anticipated price realizations.

INTENSE COMPETITION

We face intense competition in our markets, and the failure to compete effectively could have a material adverse effect on our business,
financial condition and results of operations.

We compete with North American and, for many of our product lines, global producers,
some of which may have greater financial resources and lower production costs than we do. The principal basis for competition is selling price. Our ability to maintain satisfactory margins depends in large part on our ability to control our costs.
Our industries are also particularly sensitive to other factors including innovation, design, quality and service, with varying emphasis on these factors depending on the product line. To the extent that one or more of our competitors become more
successful with respect to any key competitive factor, our ability to attract and retain customers could be materially adversely affected. If we are unable to compete effectively, such failure could have a material adverse effect on our business,
financial condition and results of operations.

MATERIAL DISRUPTION OF MANUFACTURING

A material disruption at one of our manufacturing facilities could prevent us from meeting customer demand, reduce our sales or negatively affect
our results of operation and financial condition.

Any of our manufacturing facilities, or any of our machines within an otherwise
operational facility, could cease operations unexpectedly due to a number of events, including:



•unscheduled maintenance outages;

•prolonged power failures;

•an equipment failure;

•a chemical spill or release;

•explosion of a boiler;

•the effect of a drought or reduced rainfall on its water supply;

•labor difficulties;

•disruptions in the transportation infrastructure, including roads, bridges, railroad tracks and tunnels;

•fires, floods, windstorms, earthquakes, hurricanes or other catastrophes;

•terrorism or threats of terrorism;

•governmental regulations; and

•other operational problems.

Any such downtime or facility damage could prevent us from meeting customer demand for our products and/or require us to make unplanned capital expenditures. If one of these machines or facilities were to incur significant downtime,
our ability to meet our production targets and satisfy customer requirements could be impaired, resulting in lower sales and income.

CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS

Our operations require substantial capital.

The company has substantial capital requirements for expansion and repair or replacement of existing facilities or equipment. Although we maintain our
production equipment with regular scheduled maintenance, key pieces of equipment may need to be repaired or replaced periodically. The costs of repairing or replacing such equipment and the associated downtime of the affected production line could
have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

We believe our capital resources will
be adequate to meet our current projected operating needs, capital expenditures and other cash requirements. If for any reason we are unable to provide for our operating needs, capital expenditures and other cash requirements on economic terms, we
could experience a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

LAWS AND REGULATIONS

We could incur substantial costs as a result of compliance with, violations of or liabilities under
applicable environmental laws and other laws and regulations.

We are subject to a wide range of general and industry-specific laws
and regulations relating to the protection of the environment, including those governing:



•air emissions;

•wastewater discharges;

•harvesting;

•silvicultural activities;

•the storage, management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes;

•the cleanup of contaminated sites;

•landfill operation and closure obligations;



WEYERHAEUSER COMPANY>2009 ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K23






•forestry operations and endangered species habitat; and

•health and safety matters.

In particular, the pulp and paper industry in the United States is subject to Cluster Rules and Boiler Maximum Achievable Control Technology Rules that further regulate effluent and air emissions. These laws and regulations will
require us to obtain authorizations from and comply with the authorization requirements of the appropriate governmental authorities, which have considerable discretion over the terms and timing of permits.

We have incurred, and we expect to continue to incur, significant capital, operating and other expenditures complying with applicable environmental
laws and regulations and as a result of remedial obligations. We also could incur substantial costs, such as civil or criminal fines, sanctions and enforcement actions (including orders limiting our operations or requiring corrective measures,
installation of pollution control equipment or other remedial actions), cleanup and closure costs, and third-party claims for property damage and personal injury as a result of violations of, or liabilities under, environmental laws and regulations.

As the owner and operator of real estate, including in our homebuilding business, we may be liable under environmental laws for cleanup,
closure and other damages resulting from the presence and release of hazardous substances on or from our properties or operations. The amount and timing of environmental expenditures is difficult to predict, and in some cases, our liability may
exceed forecasted amounts or the value of the property itself. The discovery of additional contamination or the imposition of additional cleanup obligations at our sites or third-party sites may result in significant additional costs. Any material
liability we incur could adversely affect our financial condition or preclude us from making capital expenditures that otherwise would benefit our business.

We also anticipate public policy developments at the state, federal and international level regarding climate change and energy access, security and competitiveness. We expect these developments to address emission of carbon
dioxide, renewable energy and fuel standards, and the monetization of carbon. Compliance with regulations that implement new public policy in these areas might require significant expenditures. Enactment of new environmental laws or regulations or
changes in existing laws or regulations, or the interpretation of these laws or regulations, might require significant expenditures. We also anticipate public policy developments at the state, federal and international level regarding taxes, health
care and a number of other areas that could require significant expenditures.



CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES

We will be affected by changes in currency exchange
rates.

We have manufacturing operations in Canada, Uruguay and Brazil. We are also a large exporter and compete with producers of
products very similar to ours. Therefore, we are affected by changes in the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to the Canadian dollar, Euro and Yen.

AVAILABILITY OF RAW MATERIALS AND ENERGY

Our business and operations could
be materially adversely affected by changes in the cost or availability of raw materials and energy.

We rely heavily on certain raw
materials (principally wood fiber and chemicals) and energy sources (principally natural gas, electricity, coal and fuel oil) in our manufacturing processes. Our ability to increase earnings has been, and will continue to be, affected by changes in
the costs and availability of such raw materials and energy sources. We may not be able to fully offset the effects of higher raw material or energy costs through hedging arrangements, price increases, productivity improvements or cost-reduction
programs.

TRANSPORTATION

We depend on third parties for transportation services and increases in costs and the availability of transportation could materially adversely affect our business and operations.

Our business depends on the transportation of a large number of products, both domestically and internationally. We rely primarily on third parties
for transportation of the products we manufacture and/or distribute as well as delivery of our raw materials. In particular, a significant portion of the goods we manufacture and raw materials we use are transported by railroad or trucks, which are
highly regulated.

If any of our third-party transportation providers were to fail to deliver the goods we manufacture or distribute in a
timely manner, we may be unable to sell those products at full value — or at all. Similarly, if any of these providers were to fail to deliver raw materials to us in a timely manner, we may be unable to manufacture our products in response
to customer demand. In addition, if any of these third parties were to cease operations or cease doing business with us, we may be unable to replace them at reasonable cost.

Any failure of a third-party transportation provider to deliver raw materials or finished products in a timely manner could harm our reputation, negatively affect our customer relationships and have
a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operation.

In addition, an increase in transportation rates or fuel
surcharges could materially adversely affect our sales and profitability.









LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

We are a party to a number of legal proceedings, and adverse judgments in certain legal proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.

The costs and other effects of pending litigation against us and related insurance recoveries cannot be determined with certainty. Although the
disclosure inNote 15: Legal Proceedings, Commitments and ContingenciesofNotes to Consolidated Financial Statementscontains management’s current views of the effect such litigation will have on our financial results, there can
be no assurance that the outcome of such proceedings will be as expected.

For example, there have been several lawsuits filed against us
alleging that we violated U.S. antitrust laws. Those included lawsuits alleging antitrust violations against us and other manufacturers of oriented strand board and lawsuits alleging antitrust violations with respect to alder logs and
lumber. All of these matters have been settled.

It is possible that there could be adverse judgments against us in some or all
major litigation against us and that we could be required to take a charge for all or a portion of any damage award. Any such charge could materially and adversely affect our results of operations for the quarter or year in which we record it.

EXPORT TAXES

We may be required to pay significant export taxes or countervailing and anti-dumping duties for exported products.

ELECTION OF REIT STATUS

If we elect to be treated as a REIT, it will have tax and liquidity implications.

As previously announced, our Board of Directors has determined that an election to be treated as a real estate investment trust (REIT) for tax purposes
would best support our strategic direction, although the timing of the conversion to a REIT is uncertain.

As a REIT, we generally would
not be subject to federal or state corporate income taxes on that portion of our capital gain or ordinary income from our REIT operations that is distributed to our shareholders. Our manufacturing operations, including our wood products, cellulose
fibers and real estate businesses, would continue to be subject to federal and state corporate income taxes.

Election of REIT status
would require that we make a one-time distribution to our shareholders of our accumulated earnings and profits (as calculated for U.S. federal income tax purposes) in the form of a special, taxable dividend, either in cash or a combination of cash
and shares of our capital stock or other property. We estimate that the aggregate value of the special dividend, if declared in 2010, would be approximately $6 billion. We would expect to limit the total amount of cash payable in the special
dividend to a maximum of 10 percent to 20 percent of the total value of the special dividend, or approximately $600 million to $1.2 billion. The balance of the special dividend, or approximately $4.8 to $5.4 billion, would be paid in the form of
shares of our capital stock. This would require us to issue a significant number of additional shares which will require shareholder approval. The actual amount of the special dividend is dependent, in part, on the results of the Company’s
operations, and may be adjusted by any amount that the Board of Directors may determine is appropriate to protect the Company’s ability to remain qualified as a REIT.

NATURAL DISASTERS

Our business and operations
could be adversely affected by weather, fire, infestation or natural disasters.

Our timberlands assets may be damaged by adverse
weather, severe wind and rainstorms, fires, pest infestation or other natural disasters. Because our manufacturing processes primarily use wood fiber, in many cases from our own



WEYERHAEUSER COMPANY>2009 ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K25






timberlands, in the event of material damage to our timberlands, our operations could be disrupted or our production costs could be increased.





RISKS RELATED TO OWNERSHIP OF OUR COMMON STOCK



STOCK-PRICE VOLATILITY

The price of our common stock may be volatile.

The market price of our common stock may be influenced by
many factors, some of which are beyond our control, including those described above under “Risks Related to our Industries and Business” and the following:



•actual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results or our competitors’ operating results;

•announcements by us or our competitors of new products, capacity changes, significant contracts, acquisitions or strategic investments;

•our growth rate and our competitors’ growth rates;

•the financial market and general economic conditions;

•changes in stock market analyst recommendations regarding us, our competitors or the forest products industry generally, or lack of analyst
coverage of our common stock;

•sales of our common stock by our executive officers, directors and significant stockholders or sales of substantial amounts of common stock; and

•changes in accounting principles.

In addition, there has been significant volatility in the market price and trading volume of securities of companies operating in the forest products industry that often has been unrelated to the operating performance of
particular companies.

Some companies that have had volatile market prices for their securities have had securities litigation brought
against them. If litigation of this type is brought against us, it could result in substantial costs and would divert management’s attention and resources.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (MD&A) OF FINANCIAL
CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS





WHAT YOU WILL FIND IN THIS MD&A



Our MD&A includes the following major
sections:



•economic and market conditions affecting our operations;

•financial performance summary;

•results of our operations — consolidated and by segment;

•liquidity and capital resources — where we discuss our cash flows;

•off-balance sheet arrangements;

•environmental matters, legal proceedings and other contingencies; and

•accounting matters — where we discuss critical accounting policies and areas requiring judgments and estimates.





ECONOMIC AND MARKET CONDITIONS AFFECTING OUR OPERATIONS



For the last two years we have experienced the
effects of the most severe recession since the 1930’s. The U.S. housing market experienced a significant downturn in this recession and remains very weak. The health of the U.S. housing market strongly affects our Real Estate, Wood Products and
Timberlands segments. Real Estate focuses on building single family homes. Wood Products primarily sells into the new residential building and repair and remodel markets. Demand for logs from our Timberlands segment is driven by the production of
wood-based building products. Cellulose Fibers is primarily affected by global demand and the value of the U.S. dollar.

We track certain indicators such as housing starts, home sales, employment, consumer confidence, foreclosures, home prices,
mortgage interest rates and access to mortgages, and the number of homes for sale to assess housing market conditions.

Nationally,
employment declined in every month of 2009. In December 2009, the unemployment rate rose to 10 percent from 7.4 percent in December 2008. Unemployment in two states where our Real Estate segment has operations was higher than the December 2009
national average. The December unemployment rate in Nevada was 13 percent and in California was 12.4 percent according to Bureau of Labor reports.



The sustained drop in employment contributed to the consumer confidence index plunging to a record low in the spring of 2009. The consumer
confidence index was initiated in 1967.

Foreclosure filings during 2009 increased 21 percent compared to 2008. Specific markets in which
our home builders operate had higher than average foreclosure rates — Nevada, Arizona and California had three of the top four foreclosure rates in the country at 10 percent, 6 percent and 4.75 percent, respectively. California’s
foreclosure activity in total was the highest of the fifty states in 2009 and increased 21 percent from 2008. The national homeowner vacancy rate edged lower to 2.6 percent, yet remained well above the historical average of 1.6 percent.

New home sales in the U.S. totaled 374,000 units in 2009. This was a record low and down 71 percent from the record high of 2005.

U.S. single-family housing starts bottomed at an annual rate of 360,000 units in first quarter 2009. During the second half, the rate of housing starts
was 485,000 units annually. For the year, single-family starts totaled 443,000 units. This resulted in an inventory of new homes for sale at the lowest level since 1971.

The housing market conditions described above contributed to a 32 percent decrease in the number of single-family homes closed and a 6 percent drop in the average price for homes closed in our Real
Estate operations during 2009.

The depressed level of new home construction and an estimated 15 to 20 percent decrease in repair and
remodeling spending resulted in decreased demand for wood products by 40 to 50 percent from the peak of 2006. Industry operating rates for lumber and oriented strand board (OSB) averaged between 50 and 60 percent of capacity. As a result, lumber and
OSB prices were at or below estimated cash costs during 2009. The price of Douglas fir green 2x4s, the preferred building product in southern California, dropped to 1980-85 levels in nominal dollar terms. Demand decreased for both domestic Douglas
fir logs grown in our western timberlands and lumber produced in our western system.

The price of logs supplied for lumber production
fell throughout the first three quarters of 2009 due to lower demand.

U.S. DOLLAR/GLOBAL DEMAND

Following the onset of the financial crisis in September 2008, the U.S. dollar strengthened by 15 to 20 percent relative to the Canadian dollar and
Euro. The U.S. dollar stayed at these levels through first quarter 2009. Since then, the dollar has weakened to trading levels that existed prior to the beginning of the financial crisis — 0.94US$/C$ and 1.47US$/Euro.









The Cellulose Fibers
business benefitted from the decline in the value of the U.S. dollar as our pulp mills became more competitive compared to European and Canadian producers. Demand for bleached market pulp is estimated to have fallen 0.9 percent in 2009. While demand
decreased in the developed countries, demand in China increased 33 percent.

The combination of the weaker dollar, steady global demand
and decreased capacity resulted in a 35 percent increase in the key indicator pulp price in 2009. This followed a 35 percent drop in the price of market pulp from second quarter 2008 to first quarter 2009.

The weaker dollar against the Yen contributed to more stable export log prices despite the sharp decline in wooden housing starts in Japan in 2009. The
export log market was also helped by higher demand from China in fourth quarter 2009.



WHERE WE ARE HEADED

The U.S. economy has improved during first quarter 2010,
but this improvement appears unlikely to generate meaningful job growth in the quarter. Existing home sales could decline as there appears to be lower demand for the extended first-time buyer tax credit. The tax credit for current owners is
expected to generate few additional home sales as many owners do not have the equity to buy larger homes. Single-family starts are expected to be higher in the quarter given the record low inventory of new homes for sale. Wood products demand is
projected to increase slightly, partially as a result of the rebuilding of inventories by dealers and wholesalers. The weakness of the U.S. dollar is expected to be favorable for U.S. market pulp producers, which is expected to lead to higher pulp
prices in U.S. dollar terms.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS



In December 2008, the board of directors
approved an amendment to our bylaws to adopt a December 31 fiscal year-end, effective for fiscal year-end 2008. Prior to 2008, our fiscal year ended on the last Sunday of the calendar year. As a result, the number of days in our fiscal year
varied. For the last three years:



•Fiscal year 2009 had 365 days.

•Fiscal year 2008 had 367 days.

•Fiscal year 2007 had 364 days.

In reviewing our results of operations, it is important to understand these terms:



•Price realizations refer to net selling prices — this includes selling price plus freight minus normal sales deductions.

•Net contribution to earnings can be positive or negative and refers to earnings (loss) attributable to Weyerhaeuser’s shareholders before
interest expense not capitalized and income taxes.

CONSOLIDATED RESULTS

Net sales and revenue and operating income numbers reported in our consolidated results do not include the activity of our discontinued operations:



•Containerboard, Packaging and Recycling operations (sold in August 2008);

•Australian operations (sold in July 2008); and

•Fine Paper operations (divested in March 2007).

We report these activities and results as discontinued operations in our Consolidated Statement of Earnings. However, we include the results of these operations in the segment discussions that
follow. SeeNote 3: Discontinued Operationsin theNotes to Consolidated Financial Statementsfor more information about our discontinued operations.

COMPARING 2009 WITH 2008

In
2009:



•Net sales and revenues decreased $2.6 billion — 32 percent.

•Net loss attributable to Weyerhaeuser common shareholders decreased $631 million — 54 percent.

Net Sales and Revenues

Net
sales and revenues decreased primarily due to the continued market challenges for the U.S. homebuilding industry and weak pulp markets, reflected in the following:

•significantly lower demand and prices for residential building products along with the closure and curtailment of a number of facilities —
refer to the Wood Products segment discussion;

•declines in the number of single-family homes closed and average selling prices — refer to the Real Estate segment discussion;

•lower pulp sales realizations — refer to the Cellulose Fibers segment discussion; and

•decreased western log sales due to weaker export and domestic markets — refer to the Timberlands segment discussion.









Net Earnings (Loss)
Attributable to Weyerhaeuser Common Shareholders

Net loss attributable to Weyerhaeuser common shareholders decreased $631 million
primarily due to the factors listed below.

Reductions to pretax net loss included:



•$1.7 billion decrease in asset impairment charges primarily related to our Real Estate, Wood Products, Cellulose Fibers and Corporate and Other
segments;

•$344 million recognition of alternative fuel mixture credits in 2009 in our Cellulose Fibers segment;

•$296 million decrease in selling and general and administrative costs as a result of the implementation of company cost-saving initiatives, a
reduction in the number of employees and lower sales volumes across all of our segments;

•$163 million pretax gain on third quarter 2009 sale of 140,000 acres of non-strategic timberland in northwestern Oregon;

•$137 million decrease in raw materials costs in our Wood Products segment;

•$95 million decrease in manufacturing, warehousing and delivery costs and other cost of sales in our Wood Products segment;

•$89 million increase in earnings from foreign exchange gains, primarily resulting from changes in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and the
Canadian dollar; and

•$80 million decrease in freight, fiber and energy costs primarily in our Cellulose Fibers segment.

These reductions to net loss during 2009 were partially offset by the following:



•$1.6 billion of pretax gains recognized on dispositions and investment restructuring during 2008 that did not recur in 2009. This included:

–$1.2 billion from the sale of our Containerboard, Packaging and Recycling business;

–$218 million from the sale of our Australian operations; and

–$250 million gain from the restructuring of our joint venture in Uruguay;



•$259 million due to reduced harvest volumes and lower domestic and export prices in our Timberlands segment;

•$206 million due to lower sales price realizations in our Wood Products segment;

•$204 million loss of earnings due to the sale of our Containerboard, Packaging and Recycling business;

•$203 million due to lower pulp prices and lower pulp sales volumes in our Cellulose Fibers segment;

•$110 million increase in restructuring and closure charges primarily related to our Corporate and Other and Wood Products segments;

•$55 million decrease in pretax earnings from Westwood Shipping operations as well as loss of pretax earnings from international operations that
were disposed of in 2008; and

•$52 million pretax gain recognized in 2008 that did not recur in 2009 from changes in our U.S. postretirement plans for salaried employees in the
U.S.

In addition, income tax expense decreased $424 million primarily due to taxes related to the gains from our
discontinued operation transactions in 2008 that did not recur in 2009.

COMPARING 2008 WITH 2007

In 2008:



•Asset impairments and related charges increased $1.8 billion.

•Net sales and revenues decreased $2.8 billion — 26 percent.

•Net earnings (loss) attributable to Weyerhaeuser common shareholders decreased $2 billion.

Asset Impairments and Related Charges

We continually monitor our assets for potential impairment, particularly in light of market conditions. The upheaval in financial markets during fourth quarter 2008 was accompanied by accelerated deterioration of housing markets and
a continued decline in demand and pricing for most of our wood products. In addition, declining demand in emerging Asian markets, primarily China, adversely affected our Cellulose Fibers operations. We recognized significant asset impairments
in our Real Estate segment during the first three quarters of 2008 and the accelerated deterioration of market conditions triggered additional impairments in fourth quarter. The continued deterioration of market conditions also led to a fair-value
analysis that indicated the carrying value of the goodwill in our Wood Products and Cellulose Fibers segments was impaired in fourth quarter 2008.

Our asset impairments and related charges attributable to Weyerhaeuser shareholders increased $1.8 billion — from approximately $330 million in 2007 to approximately $2.1 billion in 2008. The increase included:



•$808 million in impairments of goodwill in our Wood Products and Cellulose Fibers segments and

•$984 million in asset impairment and related charges in our Real Estate and Corporate and Other segments.

Partially offsetting these increased charges is a $24 million decrease in impairments recorded in connection with closures, curtailments or sales of
operations.

Net Sales and Revenues

Net sales and revenues decreased significantly, primarily due to continued deterioration of the U.S. housing market. Declines in residential homebuilding throughout the nation have resulted in lower demand for residential
building products such as



WEYERHAEUSER COMPANY>2009 ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K33






softwood lumber, oriented strand board (OSB) and engineered lumber. Sales of products within our Wood Products segment, excluding those of discontinued operations, were $1.9 billion — 34
percent — lower than 2007. These difficult market conditions also affected our Real Estate segment, where net sales and revenues decreased $951 million — 40 percent — from 2007.

Net Earnings (Loss) Attributable to Weyerhaeuser Common Shareholders

Net earnings (loss) attributable to Weyerhaeuser common shareholders decreased $2 billion primarily due to the factors listed below.

Reductions to pretax net earnings included:



•$1.8 billion increase in pretax asset impairments and related charges discussed above;

•$93 million increase in foreign exchange losses primarily due to an 18 percent decline in the U.S. dollar to Canadian dollar average exchange
rate in 2008;

•$270 million decrease in pretax earnings due to lower price realizations for softwood lumber, engineered products and hardwood lumber in our Wood
Products segment;

•$334 million increase in losses on land sales;

•$253 million decrease in pretax earnings resulting from lower sales prices and higher land, construction and development costs of single-family
homes in our Real Estate segment; and

•$118 million decrease in pretax earnings from lower price realizations and a change in mix of log sales in our Timberlands segment.

Partially offsetting these reductions to pretax net earnings were:



•$953 million increase in pretax gains on dispositions and investment restructuring.

–Pretax gains of $1.6 billion recognized during 2008 included:



•$1.2 billion from the sale of our Containerboard, Packaging and Recycling business;

•$218 million from the sale of our Australian operations; and

•$250 million gain from the restructuring of our joint venture in Uruguay.



–Pretax gains of $690 million recognized in 2007 included:



•$606 million from the Domtar Transaction and

•$84 million from the disposition of property operating facilities and our New Zealand investments.



•$173 million increase in sales realizations in our Cellulose Fibers segment.

•$52 million gain from changes in our postretirement plans for current salaried employees in the U.S. in 2008.



In addition, income tax expense increased $211 million. Taxes related
to gains from discontinued operation transactions increased approximately $1 billion primarily related to the sale of our Containerboard, Packaging and Recycling business in 2008. This change was largely offset by tax benefits related to our
increased loss from continuing operations as compared with 2007 and a $57 million benefit we recognized related to timber provisions in the Food, Conservation and Energy Act (Tree Act) of 2008.

TIMBERLANDS

HOW WE DID IN 2009

We report sales volume and annual production data for our Timberlands business segment inOur Business/What We Do/Timberlands.

COMPARING 2009 WITH

In 2009:



•Net log sales and revenues to unaffiliated customers decreased $178 million — 27 percent.

•Sales of other products to unaffiliated customers decreased $7 million — 3 percent.

•Intersegment sales decreased $497 million — 48 percent.

•Net contribution to earnings decreased $46 million — 12 percent.

Net Sales and Revenues — Unaffiliated Customers

The $185 million decrease in net sales and revenues to unaffiliated customers resulted from:



•$218 million decrease — 40 percent — in log sales in the West as sales volumes decreased 36 percent and price realizations decreased 6
percent due to weaker domestic and export markets;

•$7 million decrease — 35 percent — in log sales in Canada as sales volume in Canada decreased 23 percent and price realizations
decreased 15 percent primarily due to weaker demand; and

•$7 million decrease — 3 percent — in other sales and revenues from unaffiliated customers primarily due to lower timberlands exchange
revenues.

These decreases were partially offset by $47 million — 48 percent — increase in log sales in
the South as sales volumes increased 51 percent, primarily due to sales of fiber logs to International Paper for use at locations that previously were owned by Weyerhaeuser and higher grade log sales to domestic customers.

Intersegment Sales

The $497
million decrease in intersegment sales primarily resulted from:



•fewer Weyerhaeuser mills in operation as a result of closures and curtailments of Wood Products operations in the United States; and

•sales to Containerboard, Packaging and Recycling operations became third-party sales after we sold the business to International Paper in August
2008.

Net contribution to earnings

The $46 million decrease in net contribution to earnings primarily resulted from:



•$146 million due to a 40 percent reduction in harvest in the West and 27 percent reduction in harvest in the South;

•$113 million due to lower domestic and export prices in the West and South; and

•$15 million due to asset impairments attributable to Weyerhaeuser shareholders.



These decreases were partially offset by the following:



•$163 million pretax gain on a sale of 140,000 acres of non-strategic timberland in northwestern Oregon in third quarter 2009;

•$44 million reduction of operating costs, including lower salvage logging costs, lower fuel costs and reduced spending on silviculture; and

•$23 million reduction in selling, general and administrative costs as a result of cost cutting measures.

COMPARING 2008 WITH 2007

In
2008:



•Net log sales and revenues to unaffiliated customers increased $5 million — 1 percent.

•Other sales and revenues to unaffiliated customers decreased $28 million — 11 percent.

•Intersegment sales decreased $312 million — 23 percent.

•Net contribution to earnings declined $243 million — 39 percent.

Net Sales and Revenues — Unaffiliated Customers

The $23 million decrease in net sales and revenues to unaffiliated customers resulted from:



•$18 million decrease — 3 percent — in log sales in the West primarily due to:

–Average price realizations dropped 14 percent with the slowing domestic market and the declining U.S. housing market.

–Partially offset by increased sales volume, both export and domestic, of 12 percent due to more available whitewood volume created by the
December 2007 storm salvage logging.



•$18 million decrease — 47 percent — in log sales in Canada primarily due to:

–Sales volume in Canada dropped 43 percent as a result of having fewer operations in Canada.

–Average price realizations decreased 9 percent.



•$49 million decrease — 22 percent — in other sales and revenues from unaffiliated customers primarily due to lower timberlands exchange
revenues.

These decreases were partially offset by:



•$41 million increase — 73 percent — in log sales in the South as a result of increases in both volume and price.

–We sold our containerboard mills to International Paper in August 2008. Log sales to those mills were previously reported as intersegment sales.
Sales to the mills are now reported as sales to unaffiliated customers.



WEYERHAEUSER COMPANY>2009 ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K35






–Fiber prices in the South increased due to lower available residual chip volumes as sawmills took market downtime.



•$21 million increase — 53 percent — in minerals, oil and gas revenue.

Intersegment Sales

The $312
million decrease in intersegment sales primarily resulted from:



•$125 million decrease due to a 35 percent decrease in the volume of logs sold to our Canadian mills as a result of fewer facilities and increased
market downtime;

•$58 million decrease due to a 7 percent decline in the volume of logs sold to our U.S. mills as a result of the slower housing market;

•$58 million decrease due to a 20 percent decline in average log price realizations in the West; and

•$57 million decrease as sales to Containerboard, Packaging and Recycling operations became third-party sales after we sold our Containerboard,
Packaging and Recycling business to International Paper in August 2008.

Net contribution to earnings

The $243 million decrease in net contribution to earnings primarily resulted from:



•$118 million decrease due to lower price realizations and a change in the mix of log sales to more whitewood and less Douglas fir;

•$68 million decrease from fewer sales or exchanges of nonstrategic timberlands;

•$67 million decrease due to higher operating costs driven by higher diesel prices for logging, trucking, handling and silviculture activities and
by salvage logging costs resulting from the December 2007 West Coast windstorm; and

•$27 million decrease as 2007 included a pretax gain on the sale of a Western export facility that did not recur in 2008.

These decreases were partially offset by the following:



•$30 million increase in oil, gas and land management lease revenues; and

•$10 million increase, as 2007 included a casualty loss from the December 2007 West Coast windstorm that did not recur in 2008.

OUR OUTLOOK

Excluding the effect of sales of non-strategic land, we expect first quarter operating earnings from the segment to be comparable to fourth quarter, primarily due to improved log sales realizations, offset by higher costs.

COMPARING 2009 WITH 2008

In
2009:



•Net sales and revenues decreased $1.5 billion — 41 percent.

•Net contribution to earnings increased $814 million.

Net Sales and Revenues

Net sales and revenues decreased $1.5 billion — 41
percent — primarily due to the following:



•Softwood lumber average price realizations decreased $42 per thousand board feet (MBF) — 14 percent.









•Engineered solid section average price realizations decreased $56 per hundred cubic feet — 3 percent.

•Engineered I-joists average price realizations decreased $89 per thousand lineal feet — 7 percent.

•Oriented strand board (OSB) average price realizations decreased $7 per thousand square feet 3/8" — 4 percent.

•Plywood average price realizations decreased $50 per thousand square feet 3/8" — 14 percent.

•Hardwood lumber average price realizations decreased $83 per MBF — 9 percent.

•Sales of other products purchased for resale decreased 45 percent as a result of the sale of Canadian and selected U.S. distribution centers
and overall decline in demand for building products.

•Shipment volumes decreased across all product lines as follows:

–Softwood lumber decreased 1.4 billion board feet — 29 percent.

–Engineered solid section decreased 10 million cubic feet — 41 percent.

–Engineered I-joists decreased 88 million lineal feet — 39 percent.

–OSB decreased 1 billion square feet 3/8" — 41 percent.

–Pywood decreased 267 million square feet 3/8" — 47 percent.

–Hardwood lumber decreased 72 million board feet — 22 percent.

Net Contribution to Earnings

Net contribution to earnings improved $814 million primarily due to the following:



•$730 million decrease in impairments of goodwill and other assets;

•$137 million decrease in raw materials, mainly due to decreased log costs;

•$110 million decrease in selling and administrative charges resulting from staff reductions and continued focus on reducing costs;

•$57 million decrease in manufacturing and other cost of sales due to mill optimizations and production efficiencies; and

•$38 million decrease in warehousing and delivery costs as a result of lower shipment volumes and closures of distribution center facilities.

These improvements were partially offset by the following:



•$206 million decrease due to lower sales price realizations and

•$25 million decrease in contributions from other products purchased for resale as a result of reduced market demand and closed distribution
facilities.



COMPARING 2008 WITH 2007

In 2008:



•Impairments of long-lived assets increased $691 million.

•Net sales and revenues decreased $1.9 billion—34 percent.

•Net contribution to earnings decreased $813 million.

Asset Impairments

The accelerated deterioration of market conditions in fourth
quarter 2008 adversely affected the results of our Wood Products operations and led to a fair-value analysis that indicated the carrying value of the goodwill in our iLevel reporting unit was impaired.

The fair-value analysis took into account:



•the industry’s reduced market multiples,

•recent and expected operating performance and

•an expectation that weak macroeconomic trends would likely continue.

Based on the results of the fair-value analysis, we recognized a goodwill impairment of $733 million in the Wood Products segment in the fourth quarter
of 2008. Total goodwill impairments in 2008 for the segment were $744 million.

During 2008, we also recognized $98 million of other
asset-impairment charges in the Wood Products segment in connection with the expected closure, curtailment or sale of operations. This compares with total Wood Products asset-impairment charges of $119 million in 2007.

Net Sales and Revenues

Net
sales and revenues decreased $1.9 billion — 34 percent — primarily due to the following:



•Softwood lumber average price realizations decreased $37 per thousand board feet (MBF) — 11 percent — following the market trend.

•Engineered I-joists average price realizations decreased $134 per thousand lineal feet — 10 percent — and engineered solid section
decreased $169 per hundred cubic feet — 8 percent — in response to competitive market conditions.

•Hardwood lumber average price realizations decreased $78 per MBF — 8 percent.

•Sales of other products purchased for resale decreased 42 percent as a result of the sale of Canadian and selected U.S. distribution
centers, a reduction in the product lines purchased for resale and overall decline in demand for building products.



WEYERHAEUSER COMPANY>2009 ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K37






•Shipment volumes decreased across all product lines as follows:



–Lumber decreased 1.8 billion board feet — 28 percent.

–OSB decreased 1 billion square feet 3/8" — 30 percent.

–Shipment volumes of engineered I-joists decreased 111 million lineal feet — 33 percent.

–Engineered solid section decreased 8 million cubic feet — 26 percent.

Net Contribution to Earnings

Net contribution to earnings decreased $813 million primarily due to the following:



•$744 million of charges in 2008 for the impairment of goodwill — compared with $30 million in 2007; and

•$270 million decrease resulting from lower price realizations for softwood lumber, engineered products and hardwood lumber.

These decreases were partially offset by the following:



•$78 million reduction in selling and administrative expense;

•$171 million in charges for facility closures, other asset impairments, restructuring costs and litigation compared to $212 million in 2007; and

•$13 million benefit recognized in connection with a reduction in the reserve for hardboard siding claims.

In addition, net contribution to earnings increased due to reductions in raw material, warehousing and delivery costs. However, these reductions were
offset by increased manufacturing costs resulting from reduced operating postures and ongoing costs at curtailed facilities.

OUR
OUTLOOK

We expect a lower operating loss in first quarter due to improved operating rates and anticipated sales realization
improvements for lumber and OSB.

effects of the global economic recession — weaker pulp demand and a stronger U.S. dollar — resulted in decreased sales realizations from fourth quarter 2008 through first half 2009. Pulp prices improved in the second half as the U.S.
dollar weakened and demand strengthened. The $254 million decrease in net sales and revenues for the full year 2009 compared with 2008 was primarily due to the following:



•Pulp price realizations decreased $120 per ton — 15 percent;

•Sales volume of pulp decreased approximately 7,000 tons;

•Sales volume of liquid packaging board decreased approximately 14,000 tons — 5 percent; and

•Sales price of liquid packaging increased $46 per ton — 5 percent.









Net Contribution to
Earnings

Net contribution to earnings increased $297 million primarily due to the following:



•$344 million increase due to alternative fuel mixture credits, see “Liquidity and Capital Resources” for more information related to
alternative fuel mixture credits;

•$94 million goodwill impairment charge in fourth quarter 2008, which did not recur in 2009;

•$80 million decrease in fiber, freight and energy costs, primarily related to lower prices for chips and fuel;

•$46 million decrease in other operating and maintenance costs, primarily as a result of cost reduction initiatives and the effect of the
strengthening of the U.S. exchange rate on Canadian operating costs year over year;

•$13 million increase in liquid packaging board price realizations; and

•$12 million decrease in administrative costs as a result of cost reduction activities.

These increases were partially offset by the following decreases:



•$203 million due to lower pulp prices and lower pulp sales volumes, as global market demand decreased from the prior year;

•$40 million as a result of lower production, primarily due to maintenance downtime and market downtime in the first half of the year;

•$26 million due to lower other product realizations; and

•$23 million in other non operating income and earnings from our interest in our newsprint joint venture due to lower newsprint market prices.

COMPARING 2008 WITH 2007

In 2008:



•Asset impairments increased $92 million.

•Net sales and revenues decreased $67 million — 4 percent.

•Net contribution to earnings decreased $82 million — 36 percent.

Asset Impairments

The
accelerated deterioration of market conditions in fourth quarter 2008 was accompanied by a sudden and dramatic decline in demand for pulp from developing Asian markets and a severe downturn in the global pulp market, which resulted in a significant
decline in pulp prices. These developments led to a fair-value analysis that indicated the carrying value of the goodwill in our Cellulose Fibers reporting unit was impaired.

The fair-value analysis takes into account:



•the industry’s reduced market multiples,

•recent and expected operating performance and

•an expectation that weak macroeconomic trends will likely continue.



Based on the results of the fair-value analysis, we recognized a goodwill
impairment of $94 million in the Cellulose Fibers segment in fourth quarter 2008.

Net Sales and Revenues

Net sales and revenues decreased 4 percent for the year primarily due to a decrease in pulp sales volume, which was partially offset by an increase in
average price realizations for pulp and liquid packaging board.

For the full year 2008 compared with 2007:



•Average price realizations for pulp and liquid packaging improved primarily due to a weaker U.S. dollar and strong demand.

–Pulp price realizations improved $82 per ton — 11 percent.

–Liquid packaging board price realizations improved $94 per ton — 11 percent.



•Sales volume of pulp declined approximately 366,000 tons — 18 percent. The volume decrease was primarily due to the divestiture of the
Kamloops, British Columbia, pulp mill and other white paper mills in the Domtar Transaction in first quarter 2007.

•Sales volume of liquid packaging increased approximately 16,000 tons — 6 percent.

Net Contribution to Earnings

Net contribution to earnings decreased $82 million primarily due to the following:



•$94 million goodwill impairment charge in fourth quarter as discussed above;

•$50 million reduction in earnings from lower pulp sales volumes;

•$41 million increase in chemical costs primarily due to higher prices;

•$38 million increase in freight costs primarily related to higher fuel prices and ocean freight;

•$37 million increase in operating costs, including maintenance, depreciation and the effect of the strengthening of the Canadian exchange rate on
Canadian operating costs; and

•$33 million increase in fiber and energy costs primarily related to higher prices paid for chips and fuel.

These decreases were partially offset by the following:



•$173 million from increased price realizations as a result of improved market conditions — $140 million from pulp and $33 million from
liquid packaging board;

•$20 million increase in earnings from our interest in our newsprint joint venture primarily due to higher newsprint market prices; and



WEYERHAEUSER COMPANY>2009 ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K39






•$18 million in reduced expenses primarily from productivity improvements, cost reductions and increased cost recovery from slush pulp sales.

OUR OUTLOOK

Excluding the effect of alternative fuel mixture credits, which ended in 2009, we expect earnings from operations for first quarter to be comparable to fourth quarter. Annual maintenance and fiber costs are expected to increase.
These costs are expected to offset improved pulp price realizations.







REAL ESTATE

HOW WE DID IN 2009

We report single-family unit statistics for our Real Estate business segment inOur Business/What We Do/Real Estate.

Here is a comparison of net sales and revenues and net contribution to earnings for the last three years:

Net Sales and Revenues and Net contribution to earnings for Real Estate

COMPARING 2009 WITH 2008

In
2009:



•Net sales and revenues decreased $504 million — 36 percent.

•Net contribution to earnings increased $1.1 billion — 78 percent.

Net Sales and Revenues

The
$504 million decrease in net sales and revenues resulted from:



•Single-family revenues decreased $462 million — 36 percent. This included:

–$410 million due to a 32 percent decrease in single-family home closings and

–$52 million due to a 6 percent decrease in the average sales price of homes closed.

•Land and lot sales decreased $31 million — 31 percent.

•Other revenue decreased $11 million.

Net Contribution to Earnings

The $1.1 billion increase in net contribution to earnings resulted from:



•$815 million decrease in impairments and write-offs of preacquisition and abandoned community costs attributable to Weyerhaeuser shareholders;

•$233 million increase in contribution from land and lot sales;









•$82 million benefit from lower selling, general and administrative costs, primarily due to lower sales volumes, a reduction in the number of open
communities, and general cost cutting measures, including a reduction in headcount.

Offsetting the increase was:



•$56 million decrease in single-family gross margin, primarily the result of fewer closings at lower prices; and

•$17 million increase in restructuring charges, primarily related to vacated office space and headcount reductions.

COMPARING 2008 WITH 2007

In
2008:



•Impairments and other related charges attributable to Weyerhaeuser shareholders increased $906 million.

•Net sales and revenues decreased $951 million — 40 percent.

•Net contribution to earnings decreased $1.56 billion.

Impairments and Other Related Charges Attributable to Weyerhaeuser Shareholders

We continually monitor our assets for potential impairment, particularly in light of the current market conditions. Additionally, we control some land through deposits with land sellers that defer the payment of the full acquisition
price until certain entitlements are obtained. We also control some land through structured options offered by land sellers.

In 2008, we
recorded $874 million in impairments and other related charges attributable to Weyerhaeuser shareholders for real estate projects, joint ventures and intangible assets. This compares with $128 million in impairments and other related charges for
real estate projects recorded in 2007. There was a significant increase in impairments from the previous year due to the eroding market conditions for selling new homes and the inability for many home buyers to secure financing due to the changing
mortgage market and tighter credit standards. In addition, during the fourth quarter of 2008, the already-depressed housing market was further affected by increased financial turmoil. Job losses, both actual and announced, and a loss of consumer
confidence reduced the number of potential home buyers. Increasing foreclosures added inventory to the marketplace causing lower appraisal values and home sale prices.

In light of these deteriorating market conditions and increased uncertainty regarding the timing of recovery, the company reviewed its homebuilding projects and land portfolio to determine whether
the assets would continue to be held for development or sold. During fourth quarter 2008, management decided to sell some of its land portfolio, which required the company to write the land assets down to current fair value, resulting in
impairments. Impairments also were recorded on projects and land held for development.



In addition, we recorded $128 million in investment impairments and other related charges attributable to Weyerhaeuser shareholders for our real estate investments in 2008 compared with $36 million
in 2007.

In 2008, we also wrote off $74 million in costs associated with option deposits and other preacquisition costs related to land
parcels that we decided not to acquire. In 2007, we wrote off $6 million of option deposits and preacquisition costs.

Net Sales and
Revenues

The $951 million decrease in net sales and revenues resulted from:



•Single-family revenues decreased $785 million — 38 percent. This included:

–$581 million due to a 28 percent decrease in single-family home closings and

–$204 million due to a 14 percent decrease in the average sales price of homes closed.

•Land and lot sales decreased $114 million — 54 percent.

•Other revenue decreased $52 million as 2007 included revenue of $49 million from an apartment building sale with no comparable sale in 2008.

Net Contribution to Earnings

The $1.56 billion decrease in net contribution to earnings resulted from:

•Impairments and preacquisition cost write-offs attributable to Weyerhaeuser shareholders caused a decrease of $906 million.

•Single-family activities caused a decrease of $253 million — 55 percent — due to lower sales prices and higher land, construction and
development costs. Single-family activity includes net sales less cost of goods sold.

•Land sales resulted in a decrease of $334 million. In 2008 we recorded losses of $219 million in land sales compared with earnings of $115
million in 2007.

•$42 million decrease resulted from earnings of $42 million for an apartment building sale in 2007 with no comparable sale in 2008.

Offsetting the decrease was:



•$33 million benefit from lower selling, general and administrative costs primarily due to lower sales commissions, marketing costs and incentive
compensation.

OUR OUTLOOK

Excluding asset impairments, restructuring and related charges, we expect the segment to be profitable in first quarter. A loss is expected from single-family homebuilding operations due to
seasonally lower closings; however, two commercial partnership interests were sold in January 2010 and will contribute $33 million in earnings.

CORPORATE AND OTHER

We report what our Corporate and Other segment includes inOur

Here is a comparison of net sales and revenues and net contribution to earnings for the
last three years:

HOW WE DID IN 2009



•We restructured our corporate support functions. This included reductions in staff and consolidation of office space.

•We announced changes to our employee and postretirement benefits plans for 2010. These include:

–modifications to the U.S. pension plan for active employees;

–reduction of certain company-sponsored retiree life insurance benefits for qualifying U.S. employees;

–changes in available medical plans for U.S. employees and retirees not eligible for Medicare; and

–freeze on contributions towards the cost of Canadian non-union retiree benefits.

The segment’s results are affected by changes in foreign exchange rates primarily related to our Canadian operations, changes in our stock price,
pension and postretirement credits (costs), and strategic initiatives outside the operating segments. Results for the Corporate and Other segment also include the net gain on divestitures that affect multiple

business segments and the disposition of entire business segments.

COMPARING 2009 WITH 2008

In 2009:



•Net sales and revenues decreased $227 million — 58 percent.

•Net contribution to earnings decreased $1.7 billion.

Net Sales and Revenues

Net sales and revenues decreased, primarily due to the
sale of our Australian operations in July 2008 and decreased revenue in our transportation business during 2009.



Net Contribution to Earnings

The $1.7 billion decrease in net contribution to earnings resulted from:



•$1.2 billion pretax gain recognized in 2008 from the sale of our Containerboard, Packaging and Recycling business;

•$250 million pretax non-cash gain recognized in 2008 from restructuring our joint ventures in Uruguay in 2008;

•$218 million pretax gain recognized in 2008 from the sale of our Australian operations;

•$64 million reduction in net pension and postretirement credits primarily related to the remeasurement of plan assets and liabilities partially
offset by changes in plan participation;

•$58 million increase in charges for asset impairments and restructuring activities, primarily related to 2009 pension settlements and
curtailments;

•$55 million decrease in earnings from Westwood Shipping operations, as well as international operations that were disposed of in 2008; and

•$52 million pretax gain recognized in 2008 from changes in our U.S. postretirement plans for salaried employees in the U.S.

These decreases were partially offset by the following:



•$82 million change in net foreign exchange gains and losses — $39 million gain in 2009 compared to $43 million loss in 2008 — primarily
resulting from changes in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and the Canadian dollar;

•$59 million decrease in general and administrative costs as a result of implementing company cost saving initiatives; and

•$51 million decrease in Weyerhaeuser’s expense related to previously capitalized interest on excess qualifying assets of Weyerhaeuser Real
Estate Company, primarily due to lower home and land sales in 2009.

COMPARING 2008 WITH 2007

In 2008:



•Net sales and revenues decreased $40 million — 9 percent.

•Net contribution to earnings increased $1.1 billion.

Net Sales and Revenues

Net sales and revenues decreased primarily due to the
sale of our Australian operations in July 2008, partially offset by increased revenue earned in our transportation business

during 2008.









Net Contribution to
Earnings

The $1.1 billion increase in net contribution to earnings resulted from:



•$777 million increase in pretax gains on dispositions — $1.4 billion in 2008 compared with $616 million in 2007. The gains include:

–$1.2 billion in 2008 from the sale of our Containerboard, Packaging and Recycling business;

–$218 million in 2008 from the sale of our Australian operations;

–$606 million in 2007 from the Domtar Transaction; and

–$10 million in 2007 from the sale of our New Zealand investment.

•$250 million non-cash gain for the restructuring of our joint ventures in Uruguay in 2008;

•$197 million increase in net pension and postretirement income resulted from the effect of the change to retain most recurring pension and
postretirement credits (costs) in Corporate and Other; and

•$52 million pretax gain in 2008 from changes in our postretirement plans for current salaried employees in the U.S.

These increases were partially offset by the following:



•$92 million change in net foreign exchange gains and losses — $43 million loss in 2008 compared with $49 million gain in 2007
— primarily a result of changes in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and the Canadian dollar;

•$69 million increase in charges related to the write-off of capitalized interest on impaired Real Estate homebuilding assets during 2008;

•$55 million increased charges for corporate restructuring activities; and

•$43 million pretax gain from a legal settlement in 2007 with no comparable gain in 2008.



FINE PAPER

On March 7, 2007, our Fine Paper operations and related assets were divested in the Domtar Transaction. As a result, the year ended
December 30, 2007, includes nine weeks of Fine Paper operations. Subsequent to first quarter 2007, we no longer have results of operations for the Fine Paper segment.

Here are net sales and revenues and net contribution to earnings for 2007:

INTEREST EXPENSE

Including Real Estate and interest expense reported in discontinued operations, our interest expense incurred for the last three years was:



•$466 million in 2009,

•$550 million in 2008 and

•$604 million in 2007.



WEYERHAEUSER COMPANY>2009 ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K43






The decrease in our
interest expense incurred is primarily due to reductions in our amount of outstanding debt of approximately:



•$327 million in 2009,

•$1.4 billion in 2008 and

•$846 million in 2007.

In connection with the repayments, we recognized the following pretax (gains) losses on early extinguishment of debt:



•$28 million in 2009,

•$(32) million in 2008 and

•$45 million in 2007.

INCOME TAXES

Our benefit for income taxes for our continuing operations over the last
three years were:



•$274 million in 2009,

•$900 million in 2008 and

•$179 million in 2007.

During 2009, we did not record any one-time tax benefits or charges:

During 2008, we recorded the following tax benefit:



•Timber provisions in the Food, Conservation and Energy Act (TREE Act) of 2008 enacted May 22, 2008, resulted in a tax benefit of $57
million. The provision was effective for one year and reduced the capital gains tax rate on qualified timber sales from 35 percent to 15 percent.

During 2007, we recorded these one-time tax benefits and charges:



•$22 million deferred tax benefit related to a reduction in the Canadian federal income tax rate and

•$9 million charge to deferred taxes related to the Flat Rate Business Tax Reform in Mexico.

In addition, income tax expense (benefit) recorded in connection with divestitures are included in discontinued operations and include the following:



•tax expense on dispositions of $887 million related to the gain on sale of our Containerboard, Packaging and Recycling business and $58 million
related to the gain on sale of our Australian operations in 2008; and

•a tax benefit of $89 million from the sale of our Fine Paper business and related assets resulting from a rollout of temporary differences on the
assets sold in Canada in 2007.





LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES



We are committed to maintaining a sound,
conservative capital structure that enables us to:



•protect the interests of our shareholders and lenders and

•have access at all times to major financial markets.

Our policy governing capital has two important elements:



•viewing the capital structure of Forest Products separately from that of Real Estate because of the very different nature of their assets and
business activity and

•minimizing liquidity risk by managing a combination of maturing short-term and long-term debt.

The amount of debt and equity for Forest Products and Real Estate will reflect the following:



•basic earnings capacity and

•liquidity characteristics of their respective assets.

CASH FROM OPERATIONS

Cash from operations includes:



•cash received from customers;

•cash paid to employees, suppliers and others;

•cash paid for interest on our debt; and

•cash paid or received for taxes.

Consolidated net cash (used in) provided by our operations was:



•$(162) million in 2009,

•$(1.3) billion in 2008 and

•$635 million in 2007.

COMPARING 2009 WITH 2008

Net cash used in operations decreased $1.1 billion in 2009 as compared with 2008 due to
the following:



•Consolidated cash paid for income taxes decreased by $1.1 billion primarily due to taxes paid on the sale of our Containerboard, Packaging
and Recycling business in 2008.

•Cash we received from customers in our Forest Products operations excluding Real Estate increased $560 million net of cash paid to employees,
suppliers and others. This increase was primarily due to:

–Cash from operations declined as a result of significantly lower demand for building materials due to the continued deterioration of the U.S.
housing market.

–2008 cash from operations includes 31 weeks of Containerboard, Packaging and Recycling and approximately 30 weeks of Australian operations prior
to their sales.









•Cash we received from customers in our Real Estate segment, net of cash paid to employees, suppliers and others decreased $1 million primarily
due to fewer closings of single-family home sales and the continued deterioration of the U.S. housing market.

•We received $213 million from alternative fuel mixture credits in 2009.

Alternative Fuel Mixture Credits

The U.S. Internal Revenue Code allowed a $0.50 per gallon tax credit for the alternative fuel component of alternative fuel mixtures produced and used as a fuel in a taxpayer’s trade or business in 2009. Our application for
registration as a blender based on our use of black liquor as an alternative fuel was approved in May 2009. We began blending black liquor (a by-product of our wood pulping process) and diesel fuel during the first week of April 2009 and have
blended and used 688 million gallons of the alternative fuel mixture through December 31, 2009. The alternative fuel mixture credit expired on December 31, 2009. We recognized credits of $344 million in 2009 — of which we have
received $213 million of cash and have recorded a receivable of $131 million — for black liquor blended through December 31, 2009.

COMPARING 2008 WITH 2007

Net cash from operations decreased $1.9 billion in 2008 as compared with 2007 due to the
following:



•Consolidated cash paid for income taxes increased by

$981 million primarily due to taxes paid on the sale of our Containerboard, Packaging and Recycling business in
2008.

•Cash we received from customers in our forest products operations decreased $987 million, which excludes Real Estate, net of cash paid to
employees, suppliers and others. This decrease was primarily due to:

–Cash from operations declined as a result of significantly lower demand for building materials due to the continued deterioration of the U.S.
housing market.

–2007 cash from operations includes nine weeks of activity related to the operations that were divested in the Domtar Transaction. There were no
cash flows from these operations in 2008.

–2008 cash from operations includes 31 weeks of Containerboard, Packaging and Recycling and approximately 30 weeks of Australian operations prior
to their sales. 2007 includes 52 weeks of cash flows from these operations.

•Cash we received from customers in our Real Estate segment, net of cash paid to employees, suppliers and others decreased $119 million primarily
due to fewer closings of single-family home sales and the continued deterioration of the U.S. housing market.



INVESTING IN OUR BUSINESS

Cash from investing activities includes:



•acquisitions of property, equipment, timberlands and reforestation;

•investments in or distribution from equity affiliates;

•proceeds from sale of assets and operations; and

•purchases and redemptions of short-term investments.

REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITIES

As of December 31, 2009, Weyerhaeuser Company has two multi-year revolving
credit facility agreements:



•$400 million revolving credit facility that expires in March 2010 (2010 Facility) and

•$1 billion five-year revolving credit facility that expires in December 2011 (2011 Facility).

Weyerhaeuser Real Estate Company (WRECO) is permitted to borrow under only the 2011 Facility.

On September 14, 2009, Weyerhaeuser Company amended its 2011 Facility by entering into a First Amendment to the $1,000,000,000 Competitive Advance
and Revolving Credit Facility Agreement dated as of December 19, 2006. The amendment decreased the amount of minimum defined net worth that Weyerhaeuser Company is required to maintain under the facility from $3.75 billion to $3.0
billion. In addition, the amendment reduced the amount that WRECO is permitted to borrow under the facility to $200 million from $400 million and modified the fees and interest rates payable under the facility. No other changes in the
facility were made and

$1.0 billion remains available under the facility until December 2011.

Also on September 14, 2009, Weyerhaeuser Company amended its 2010 Facility by entering into a First Amendment to the $1,200,000,000 Competitive
Advance and Revolving Credit Facility Agreement dated as of December 19, 2006. The amendment decreased the amount of minimum defined net worth that Weyerhaeuser Company is required to maintain under the facility from $3.75 billion to $3.0
billion. In addition, the amendment reduced the size of the facility to $400 million from $1.2 billion, removed WRECO as a borrower under the facility and modified the fees and interest rates payable under the facility. No other changes in
the facility were made and $400 million remains available under the facility until March 2010.

Neither Weyerhaeuser Company nor WRECO is
a guarantor of the borrowing of the other under either of the credit facilities.

As of December 31, 2009, Weyerhaeuser Company and
WRECO:



•had no borrowings outstanding under our credit facilities,

CREDIT RATINGS

On June 22, 2009, Dominion Bond Rating Service (DBRS) changed the trend on the ratings for our debt to Negative from Stable, including our Issuer
Rating of BBB (high).

On September 3, 2009, Fitch Ratings downgraded ratings for our debt to “BB+” from “BBB-.”

Following the December 15, 2009 announcement of the Company’s intention to elect REIT status, Moody’s Investor Services
affirmed the rating of the company’s long term debt at Ba1 but changed the outlook from Stable to Developing.

On December 16,
2009, Standard and Poor’s affirmed the rating at BBB- but changed their outlook to Negative.

STOCK OPTION EXERCISES

Our cash proceeds from the exercise of stock options were:



•$0 million in 2009,

•$4 million in 2008 and

•$321 million in 2007.

We did not recognize any excess tax benefits from the exercise of stock options during 2009 or 2008. We recognized $51 million in 2007 due to the high volume of stock options exercised when the price of our common stock reached
record highs during the first quarter of that year.

PAYING DIVIDENDS AND REPURCHASING STOCK

We paid dividends of:



•$127 million in 2009,

•$507 million in 2008 and

•$531 million in 2007.

Changes in the amount of dividends we paid were primarily due to the decrease in our quarterly dividend from 60 cents to 25 cents in December 2008 and to 5 cents in July 2009.

In December of 2008, the board of directors authorized the additional repurchase of up to $250 million of the company’s outstanding shares. During
2009, we repurchased 66,691 shares of common stock at a cost of $2 million under the stock-repurchase program.

During 2007, we completed
the stock-repurchase program that was announced in October 2005, which authorized the repurchase of up to 18 million shares of our common stock. Of the 18 million shares repurchased, 7 million shares were repurchased in 2007 at a
net cost of $473 million.

During 2007, we also redeemed 25 million shares in connection with the Domtar Transaction.

In 2009 and 2008, we paid a dividend, but we had negative cash from operations. This resulted in a negative dividend-payout ratio. The dividend payout
ratio for 2007 was 84 percent.

ACCOUNTING MATTERS



CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Our critical accounting
policies involve a higher degree of judgment and estimates. They also have a high degree of complexity.

In accounting, we base our
judgments and estimates on:



•historical experience and

•assumptions we believe are appropriate and reasonable under current circumstances.

Actual results, however, may differ from the estimated amounts we have recorded.

Our most critical accounting policies relate to our:



•pension and postretirement benefit plans;

•potential impairments of long-lived assets;

•legal, environmental and product liability reserves; and

•depletion accounting.

Details about our other significant accounting policies — what we use and how we estimate — are inNote 1: Summary of Significant Accounting Policiesin theNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements.









PENSION AND
POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS

We sponsor several pension and postretirement benefit plans for our employees. Key assumptions we use
in accounting for the plans include our:



•discount rate,

•expected long-term rate of return,

•anticipated trends in health care costs,

•assumed increases in salaries and

•mortality rates.

At the end of every year, we review our assumptions with external advisers and make adjustments as appropriate. Actual experience that differs from our assumptions or any changes in our assumptions could have a significant effect on
our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.

Other factors that affect our accounting for the plans include:



•actual pension fund performance,

•level of lump sum distributions,

•plan changes,

•changes in plan participation or coverage and

•portfolio changes and restructuring.

This section provides more information about our:



•expected long-term rate of return,

•discount rate and

•cash contributions.

Expected Long-Term Rate of Returns

Plan assets are assets of the pension plan trusts that fund the benefits
provided under the pension plans. The expected long-term rate of return is our estimate of the long-term rate of return that our plan assets will earn. After considering all available information at the end of 2009, we continue to assume an expected
long-term rate of return of 9.5 percent. Factors we considered include:



•the 15.3 percent net compounded annual return achieved by our U.S. pension trust investment strategy over the past 25 years and

•current and expected valuation levels in the global equity and credit markets.

Our expected long-term rate of return is important in determining the net income or expense we recognize for our plans. Every 0.5 percent decrease in
our expected long-term rate of return would increase expense or reduce a credit by approximately:



•$20 million for our U.S. qualified pension plans and

•$3 million for our Canadian registered pension plans.

Likewise, every 0.5 percent increase in our expected long-term rate of return would decrease expense or increase a credit by those same amounts.



The actual return on plan assets in any given year may vary from our
expected long-term rate of return. Actual returns on plan assets affect the funded status of the plans. Differences between actual returns on plan assets and the expected long- term rate of return are reflected as adjustments to cumulative other
comprehensive income (loss), a component of total equity.

Discount Rate

Our discount rate as of December 31, 2009, is:



•5.9 percent for our U.S. pensions plans — compared with 6.3 percent at December 31, 2008;

•5.2 percent for our U.S. postretirement plans — compared with 6.3 percent at December 31, 2008;

•6.1 percent for our Canadian pension plans — compared with 7.3 percent at December 31, 2008; and

•6.0 percent for our Canadian postretirement plans — compared with 7.3 percent at December 31, 2008.

We review our discount rates annually and revise them as needed. The discount rates are selected at the measurement date by matching current spot rates
of high-quality corporate bonds with maturities similar to the timing of expected cash outflows for benefits.

Pension and postretirement
benefit expenses for 2010 will be based on the 5.9 and 5.2 percent assumed discount rates for U.S. plans and the 6.1 percent and 6.0 percent assumed discount rates for the Canadian plans.

Our discount rate is important in determining the cost of our plans. A 0.5 percent decrease in our discount rate would increase expense or reduce a
credit by approximately:



•$15 million for our U.S. qualified pension plans and

•$3 million for our Canadian registered pension plans.

Contributions Made and Benefits Paid

During 2009:



•We were not required to and did not make any contributions to our U.S. qualified pension plans.

•We contributed approximately $27 million to our U.S. nonqualified pension plans.

•We contributed approximately $7 million to our Canadian registered and nonregistered pension plans in accordance with minimum funding rules in
accordance with the respective provincial regulations. We also chose to make voluntary contributions of approximately $27 million to our largest registered plan during 2009.

•We made benefit payments of approximately $52 million to our U.S. and Canadian other postretirement plans.



WEYERHAEUSER COMPANY>2009 ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K49






During 2010:

We intend to make a voluntary contribution of approximately $100 million to the U.S. qualified pension plans for the 2009 plan year. The
contribution will be made prior to September 15, 2010. The contribution will decrease 2009 taxable income, thereby increasing the amount of the 2009 net operating loss refund. It would also decrease the earnings and profits required for a real
estate investment trust conversion. This contribution is expected to eliminate the estimated $30 million minimum funding requirements for this plan for 2010 which would have been due by September 15, 2011.

In addition:



•We expect to be required to contribute $10 million to our Canadian registered and nonregistered pension plans. We voluntarily contributed $15
million subsequent to December 31, 2009 and may elect to make additional contributions to our largest registered plan in Canada.

•We expect to contribute $20 million to our U.S. nonqualified pension plans.

•We expect to make benefit payments of $60 million to our U.S. and Canadian other postretirement plans.

Receivable From Pension Trust

During 2009 and 2008, there was a high volume of lump-sum distributions from our U.S. qualified pension plans. Retirement-eligible employees whose employment with the company terminated in connection with the sale of our
Containerboard, Packaging and Recycling business or corporate restructuring activities could elect to receive their pension benefit as a lump-sum distribution if permitted in accordance with the plans’ provisions. In addition, market events
during the same period, adversely affected liquidity. For instance, many of the funds in which plan assets are invested changed their redemption terms which delayed some of the pension trusts’ cash receipts. To avoid liquidating assets at
depressed prices and, as permitted by law, we elected to provide $285 million of short-term liquidity to the U.S. pension trust through short-term loans. These short-term loans were made in fourth quarter 2008 and first quarter 2009. Markets
and liquidity improved in 2009 and the pension trust repaid $139 million in fourth quarter 2009. Full repayment of the remaining balance is anticipated in 2010.

LONG-LIVED ASSETS

We review the carrying value of our long-lived assets
whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable through future operations. The carrying value is the amount assigned to long-lived assets in our books.



An impairment occurs when the carrying value of long-lived assets will not
be recovered from future cash flows and is less than fair market value. Fair market value is the estimated amount we would get if we were to sell the assets.

In determining fair market value and whether impairment has occurred, we are required to estimate:



•future cash flows,

•residual values and

•fair values of the assets.

Key assumptions we use in developing the estimates include:



•probability of alternative outcomes,

•product pricing,

•raw material costs,

•product sales and

•discount rate.

IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS: REAL ESTATE

Ordinarily, we review homebuilding long-lived assets for impairment
whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. We recorded long-lived homebuilding asset impairments and related charges attributable to Weyerhaeuser shareholders of $261 million
in 2009, $1.1 billion in 2008 and $170 million in 2007.

Real Estate Held for Development

Real estate held for development includes subdivisions and master planned communities (MPCs). MPCs typically include several product segments such as
residential, active adult, retail and commercial. We evaluate impairment at the subdivision or MPC product segment level. Factors that are considered when evaluating a subdivision or MPC product segment for impairment include:



•gross margins and selling costs on homes closed in recent months;

•projected gross margins and selling costs based on our operating budgets;

•competitor pricing and incentives in the same or nearby communities; and

•trends in average selling prices, discounts, incentives, sales velocity and cancellations.

We update the undiscounted cash flow forecast for each subdivision and MPC product segment that may be impaired. The undiscounted cash flow forecasts
are affected by community-specific factors that include:



•estimates and timing of future revenues;

•estimates and timing of future land development, materials, labor and contractor costs;









•community location and desirability, including availability of schools, retail, mass transit and other services;

•local economic and demographic trends regarding employment, new jobs and taxes;

•competitor presence, product types, future competition, pricing, incentives and discounts; and

•land availability, number of lots we own or control, entitlement restrictions and alternative uses.

The carrying amount of each subdivision and MPC product segment is written down to fair value when the forecasted cash flows are less than the carrying
amount of a subdivision or MPC product segment. An impairment charge for a subdivision or MPC product segment is allocated to each lot in the community in the same manner as land and development costs are allocated to each lot.

Real Estate Held for Sale

Real
estate held for sale includes homes that have been completed and land that we intend to sell. We regularly sell land or lots that do not fit our value proposition or development plans.

The carrying amount of real estate held for sale is reduced to fair value less estimated costs to sell if the forecasted net proceeds are less than the carrying amount. The fair value analysis is
affected by local market economic conditions, demographic factors and competitor actions, and is inherently uncertain. Actual net proceeds can differ from the estimates. The carrying amount of real estate held for sale is evaluated quarterly.

Market Approach

We use the market approach to determine fair value of real estate held for development and held for sale when information for comparable assets is available. This approach is commonly used for our active projects where we are selling
product. We typically use:



•sales prices for comparable assets,

•market studies,

•appraisals or

•legitimate offers.

Income Approach

We generally use the income approach to determine fair value of real estate for our inactive
projects. The income approach uses valuation techniques to convert future amounts (for example, cash flows or earnings) to a single present amount (discounted). The fair value measurement is based on the value indicated by current market
expectations regarding those future estimated cash inflows and outflows. We use present value techniques based on discounting the estimated cash flows at a rate commensurate with the inherent risks associated with the assets and related estimated
cash flow streams. Discount rates applied to the estimated future cash flows of our homebuilding assets in year-to-date 2009 ranged from 12 percent to 25 percent. The income approach relies on management judgment regarding the various inputs to
the undiscounted cash flow forecasts.

LEGAL, ENVIRONMENTAL AND PRODUCT LIABILITY RESERVES

We record contingent liabilities when:



•it becomes probable that we will have to make financial payments and

•the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated.

Legal Matters

Determining our liabilities for legal matters requires
projections about the outcome of litigation and the amount of our financial responsibility. We base our projections on:



•historical experience and

•recommendations of legal counsel.

While we do our best in developing our projections, litigation is still inherently unpredictable. Details about our legal exposures and proceedings are discussed inNote 15: Legal Proceedings, Commitments and
Contingenciesin theNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements. These exposures and proceedings are significant. Ultimate negative outcomes could be material to our operating results or cash flow in any given quarter or year.

Environmental Matters

Determining our liabilities for environmental matters requires estimates of future remediation alternatives and costs. We base our estimates on:



•detailed evaluations of relevant environmental regulations;

•physical and risk assessments of our affected sites;

•assumptions of probable financial participation by other known potentially responsible parties; and

•amounts that we will receive from insurance carriers — though the amounts are not recorded until we have a binding agreement.

Product Liability Matters

We record reserves for contingent product-liability matters when it becomes probable we will make financial payment. Determining the amount of reserves we record requires projections of future claim
rates and amounts.



WEYERHAEUSER COMPANY>2009 ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K51






DEPLETION

We record depletion — the costs attributed to timber harvested — as trees are harvested.

To calculate our depletion rate, which is updated annually, we:



•take the total cost of the timber, minus previously recorded depletion; and

•divide by the total timber volume estimated to be harvested during the harvest cycle.

Estimating the volume of timber available for harvest over the harvest cycle requires the consideration of the following factors:



•changes in weather patterns,

•effect of fertilizer and pesticide applications,

•changes in environmental regulations and restrictions,

•limits on harvesting certain timberlands,

•changes in harvest plans,

•scientific advancement in seedling and growing technology and

•changes in harvest cycles.



In addition, the length of the harvest cycle varies by geographic region and species of timber.

Depletion-rate calculations do not include estimates for:



•future silviculture — or sustainable forest management — costs associated with existing stands;

•future reforestation costs associated with a stand’s final harvest; and

•future volume in connection with the replanting of a stand subsequent to its final harvest.

LONG-TERM DEBT
OBLIGATIONS



The following
summary of our long-term debt obligations includes:



•scheduled principal repayments for the next five years and after,

•weighted average interest rates for debt maturing in each of the next five years and after and

•estimated fair values of outstanding obligations.

We estimate the fair value of long-term debt based on quoted market prices we received for the same types and issues of our debt or on the discounted value of the future cash flows using market
yields for the same type and comparable issues of debt. Changes in market rates of interest affect the fair value of our fixed-rate debt.

OUR USE OF DERIVATIVES



We occasionally use derivatives to:



•achieve the mix of variable-rate debt and fixed-rate debt that we want in our capital structure,

•hedge commitments in commodities that we produce or buy and

•manage our exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations.

The fair value of our derivatives may vary due to the volatility of the underlying forward prices or index rates associated with them.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS



FOR THE THREE-YEAR PERIOD ENDED DECEMBER
31, 2009

NOTE 1: SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Our significant accounting policies describe:



•how we report our results,

•changes in how we report our results and

•how we account for various items.

HOW WE REPORT OUR RESULTS

We report our results using:



•consolidated financial statements;

•our business segments;

•foreign currency translation;

•estimates; and

•a fiscal year that ended December 31, 2009.

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Our consolidated financial statements
provide an overall view of our results and financial condition. They include our accounts and the accounts of entities that we control, including:



•majority-owned domestic and foreign subsidiaries and

•variable interest entities in which we are the primary beneficiary.

They do not include our intercompany transactions and accounts, which are eliminated.

We account for investments in and advances to unconsolidated equity affiliates using the equity method, with taxes provided on undistributed earnings. This means that we record earnings and accrue
taxes in the period that the earnings are recorded by our unconsolidated equity affiliates.

We report our financial results and
condition in two groups:



•Forest Products — our forest products-based operations, principally the growing and harvesting of timber, the manufacture,
distribution and sale of forest products and corporate governance activities; and

•Real Estate — our real estate development and construction operations.

Throughout these Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, unless specified otherwise, references to “Weyerhaeuser,” “we” and
“our” and refer to the consolidated company, including both Forest Products and Real Estate.



OUR BUSINESS SEGMENTS

We are principally engaged in:



•growing and harvesting timber;

•manufacturing, distributing and selling forest products; and

•developing real estate and constructing homes.

Our business segments are organized based primarily on products and services.

Our
Business Segments and Products



SEGMENTPRODUCTS AND SERVICESTimberlandsLogs, timber, minerals, oil and gas and international wood
productsWood ProductsSoftwood lumber, engineered lumber, structural panels, hardwood
lumber and building materials distributionCellulose FibersPulp and liquid packaging boardReal EstateReal estate development, construction and salesCorporate and OtherGovernance, corporate support activities and
transportationFine Paper (divested in 2007)Business, printing, publishing and converting paper
productsContainerboard, Packaging and Recycling (sold in 2008)Containerboard, packaging and recycling

We also transfer raw materials, semifinished materials and end products among our business segments. Because of this intracompany activity,
accounting for our business segments involves:



•allocating joint conversion and common facility costs according to usage by our business segment product lines and

•pricing products transferred between our business segments at current market values.

FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION

Local currencies are the functional currencies for certain of our operations outside the U.S. We translate foreign currencies into U.S. dollars in two ways:



•assets and liabilities — at the exchange rates in effect as of our balance sheet date; and

•revenues and expenses — at average monthly exchange rates throughout the year.



WEYERHAEUSER COMPANY>2009 ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K61






ESTIMATES

We prepare our financial statements according to U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP). This requires us to make
estimates and assumptions during our reporting periods and at the date of our financial statements. The estimates and assumptions affect our:



•reported amounts of assets, liabilities and equity;

•disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities; and

•reported amounts of revenues and expenses.

While we do our best in preparing these estimates, actual results can and do differ from those estimates and assumptions.

OUR FISCAL YEAR

In December 2008, our board of directors amended our bylaws to
adopt a December 31 fiscal year-end. Before 2008, our fiscal year ended on the last Sunday of the calendar year. As a result, the number of days in our fiscal year varied. For the last three years:



•Fiscal year 2009 had 365 days.

•Fiscal year 2008 had 367 days.

•Fiscal year 2007 had 364 days.

CHANGES IN HOW WE REPORT OUR RESULTS

Changes in how we report our results come from:



•accounting changes made upon our adoption of new accounting guidance and

•our reclassification of certain balances and results from prior years to make them consistent with our current reporting.

ACCOUNTING CHANGES WE IMPLEMENTED IN 2009

TheFASB Accounting Standards CodificationTM(the Codification)

On July 1, 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued the Codification to establish a single level of authoritative nongovernmental U.S. GAAP and eliminate the previous U.S.
GAAP hierarchy. All other literature outside of the Codification is non-authoritative with the exception of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) rules and interpretive releases, which are also authoritative U.S. GAAP for SEC registrants.

Our adoption of the Codification did not change our application of U.S. GAAP nor did it have any effect on our results of operations,
financial position or cash flows.



Fair Value
Measurements for Nonfinancial Assets and Nonfinancial Liabilities

We adopted FASB guidance for fair value measurements and
disclosures of financial assets and financial liabilities in first quarter 2008. The FASB deferred the effective date of this guidance for one year as it applies to nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities that are not recognized or
disclosed at fair value on a recurring basis. We adopted the deferred guidance in first quarter 2009. This guidance:



•provides a common definition of fair value,

•establishes a framework for measuring fair value and

•expands disclosures about fair value instruments.

It applies when other accounting topics require or permit fair value measurements. However, it does not require any new fair value measurements.

Nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities affected by this guidance include:



•long-lived assets (asset groups) measured at fair value for an impairment assessment,

•reporting units measured at fair value in the first step of a goodwill impairment test,

•nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities measured at fair value in the second step of a goodwill impairment assessment and

•asset retirement obligations initially measured at fair value.

This guidance includes a fair value hierarchy that is intended to increase consistency and comparability in fair value measurements and related disclosures. The fair value hierarchy is based on
inputs to valuation techniques that are used to measure fair value that are either observable or unobservable. Observable inputs reflect assumptions market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability based on market data obtained from
independent sources while unobservable inputs reflect a reporting entity’s pricing based upon their own market assumptions.

The
fair value hierarchy consists of the following three levels:



•Level 1 — Inputs are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.

•Level 2 — Inputs are:

–quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in an active market,

–quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active or

–inputs other than quoted prices that are observable and market-corroborated inputs which are derived principally from or corroborated by
observable market data.

•Level 3 — Inputs are derived from valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs or value drivers are unobservable.









Our adoption of this
guidance resulted in additional disclosure. It did not have a material impact on our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.

Noncontrolling Interests

In December 2007, the FASB issued guidance that affects the presentation of
noncontrolling interests which:



•changes the accounting for noncontrolling (minority) interests in consolidated financial statements,

•requires noncontrolling interests to be presented as a separate component of equity,

•changes the income statement presentation of income or losses attributable to noncontrolling interests and

•revises the accounting for both increases and decreases in a parent’s controlling ownership interest.

Our adoption of this guidance in first quarter 2009 did not have a material affect on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows. We
did change the presentation of noncontrolling interests on ourConsolidated Statement of Operations,Consolidated Balance SheetandConsolidated Statement of Changes in Equity and Comprehensive Income.

Disclosures about Postretirement Benefit Plan Assets

In December 2008, the FASB issued guidance that amends postretirement disclosure requirements to include:



•qualitative disclosures about how pension investment allocation decisions are made;

•disclosures about the major categories of plan assets and concentrations of risk; and

•disclosures about fair value measurements, including the methods and inputs used to measure the fair value of plan assets.

The adoption of this guidance resulted in additional disclosures inNote 8: Pension and Other Postretirement
Benefit Plans. It did not have any impact on our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.

ACCOUNTING CHANGES
THAT TAKE EFFECT IN 2010

Variable Interest Entities (VIE)

In June 2009, the FASB issued guidance which amends existing consolidation guidance for VIEs by:



•changing the required approach for identifying the primary beneficiary of a VIE by replacing the quantitative-based risks and rewards calculation
with a qualitative approach that focuses on identifying who has the power to direct activities that significantly impact an entity’s economic performance,

•requiring additional reconsideration events when determining whether an entity is a VIE to include loss of power from voting or similar rights to
direct the activities that significantly impact the entity’s economic performance,

•requiring ongoing assessment of whether an enterprise is the primary beneficiary of a VIE and

•requiring additional disclosures over involvement with a VIE.

This guidance is effective in first quarter 2010. We expect our adoption of this guidance to result in consolidation of additional entities and are currently evaluating the impact on our financial
position, results of operations and cash flows.

RECLASSIFICATIONS

We have reclassified certain balances and results from prior years to be consistent with our 2009 reporting. This makes year-to-year comparisons easier. Our reclassifications had no effect on net
earnings (loss) or Weyerhaeuser shareholders’ interest. Noncontrolling interest presentation changes are discussed separately in this footnote.

HOW WE ACCOUNT FOR VARIOUS ITEMS

This section provides information about how we account for certain key items
related to:



•capital investments,

•financing our business and

•operations.

ITEMS RELATED TO CAPITAL INVESTMENTS

Key items related to accounting for capital investments pertain to
property and equipment, timber and timberlands, impairment of long-lived assets and goodwill.

Property and Equipment

We maintain property accounts on an individual asset basis. Here’s how we handle major items:



•Improvements to and replacements of major units of property are capitalized.

•Maintenance, repairs and minor replacements are expensed.

•Depreciation is calculated using a straight-line method at rates based on estimated service lives.

•Logging railroads and truck roads are generally amortized — as timber is harvested — at rates based on the volume
of timber estimated to be removed.

•Cost and accumulated depreciation of property sold or retired are removed from the accounts and the gain or loss is included in earnings.



WEYERHAEUSER COMPANY>2009 ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K63






Timber and Timberlands

We carry timber and timberlands at cost less depletion charged to disposals. Depletion refers to the carrying value of timber that
is harvested, lost as a result of casualty, or sold.

Key activities affecting how we account for timber and timberlands include:



•reforestation,

•depletion and

•forest management in Canada.

Reforestation.Generally, we capitalize all initial site preparation and planting costs as reforestation. We transfer reforestation to a merchantable timber classification when the timber is considered harvestable. That
generally occurs after:



•15 years in the South and

•30 years in the West.

Generally, we expense costs after the first planting as they are incurred or over the period of expected benefit. These costs are considered to be maintenance of the forest and include:



•fertilization,

•vegetation and insect control,

•pruning and precommercial trimming,

•property taxes and

•interest.

Accounting practices for these costs do not change when timber becomes merchantable and harvesting starts.

Depletion.To determine depletion rates, we divide the net carrying value of timber by the related volume of timber estimated to be available over the growth cycle. To determine the growth cycle volume of timber, we consider:



•regulatory and environmental constraints,

•our management strategies,

•inventory data improvements,

•growth rate revisions and recalibrations and

•known dispositions and inoperable acres.

We include the cost of timber harvested in the carrying values of raw materials and product inventories. As these inventories are sold to third parties, we include them in the cost of products sold.

Forest management in Canada.We hold forest management licenses in various Canadian provinces that are:



•granted by the provincial governments;

•granted for initial periods of 15 to 25 years; and

•renewable every five years provided we meet reforestation, operating and management guidelines.



Calculation of the fees we pay on the timber we harvest:



•varies from province to province,

•is tied to product market pricing and

•depends upon the allocation of land management responsibilities in the license.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets

We review long-lived assets — including certain identifiable intangibles — for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. Impaired assets
held for use are written down to fair value. Impaired assets held for sale are written down to fair value less cost to sell. We determine fair value based on:



•appraisals,

•market pricing of comparable assets,

•discounted value of estimated cash flows from the asset and

•replacement values of comparable assets.

Goodwill

Goodwill is the purchase price minus the fair value of net assets
acquired when we buy another entity. We assess goodwill for impairment:



•using a fair-value-based approach and

•at least annually — at the beginning of the fourth quarter.

ITEMS RELATED TO FINANCING OUR BUSINESS

Key items related to financing our
business include financial instruments, derivatives, cash and cash equivalents and accounts payable.

Financial Instruments

We estimate the fair value of financial instruments where appropriate. The assumptions we use — including the discount rate and
estimates of cash flows — can significantly affect our fair-value amounts. Our fair values are estimates and may not match the amounts we would realize upon sale or settlement of our financial positions.

Derivatives

We occasionally
use well-defined financial contracts to help manage risks associated with:



•foreign exchange rates,

•interest rates and

•commodity prices.









We measure derivatives at
fair value and present them as assets and liabilities on ourConsolidated Balance Sheet. We had no derivative instruments designated as hedges as of December 31, 2009.

Certain of our purchase and sale contracts have elements that meet the accounting definition of derivatives. We do not account for these contracts as derivatives because we expect the purchases and
sales to occur, qualifying them for the “normal purchases or normal sales” exception.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

Cash equivalents are investments with original maturities of 90 days or less. We state cash equivalents at cost, which approximates
market.

Short-Term Investments

Our short-term investments consist of investments where redemptions have been delayed. These investments are carried at the expected realizable value of the investment, which approximates fair value.

Accounts Payable

Our banking
system replenishes our major bank accounts daily as checks we have issued are presented for payment. As a result, we have negative book cash balances due to outstanding checks that have not yet been paid by the bank. These negative balances are
included in accounts payable on ourConsolidated Balance Sheet. Changes in these negative cash balances are reported as financing activities in ourConsolidated Statement of Cash Flows. Negative book cash balances were:



•$55 million at December 31, 2009; and

•$85 million at December 31, 2008.

ITEMS RELATED TO OPERATIONS

Key items related to operations include revenue recognition, inventories,
shipping and handling costs, income taxes, share-based compensation, pension and other postretirement plans, and environmental remediation.

Revenue Recognition

Forest Products operations recognize revenue differently from Real Estate operations. Forest
Products operations generally recognize revenue upon shipment to customers. For certain export sales, revenue is recognized when title transfers at the foreign port.



Real Estate operations recognize revenue when:



•closings have occurred,

•required down payments have been received,

•title and possession have been transferred to the buyer and

•all other criteria for sale and profit recognition have been satisfied.

Inventories

We state
inventories at the lower of cost or market. Cost includes labor, materials and production overhead. We use LIFO — the last-in, first-out method — for certain of our domestic raw material, in-process and finished goods inventories. Our LIFO
inventories for continuing operations were:



•$118 million at December 31, 2009; and

•$231 million at December 31, 2008.

We use FIFO — the first-in, first-out method — or moving average cost methods for the balance of our domestic raw materials and product inventories as well as for all material and supply inventories and all foreign
inventories. If we used FIFO for all inventories for continuing operations, our stated product inventories would have been higher by:



•$127 million at December 31, 2009; and

•$162 million at December 31, 2008.

Shipping and Handling Costs

We classify shipping and handling costs in the
costs of products sold in ourConsolidated Statement of Operations.

Income Taxes

We account for income taxes under the asset and liability method. Unrecognized tax benefits represent potential future funding obligations to taxing
authorities if uncertain tax positions the company has taken on previously filed tax returns are not sustained. In accordance with the company’s accounting policy, accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are
recognized as a component of income tax expense and current taxes payable.

We recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities to reflect:



•future tax consequences due to differences between the carrying amounts for financial purposes and the tax bases of certain items and

•operating loss and tax credit carryforwards.

To measure deferred tax assets and liabilities, we:



•determine when the differences between the carrying amounts and tax bases of affected items are expected to be recovered or resolved and

•use enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in those years.

Alternative Fuel
Mixture Credits

The U.S. Internal Revenue Code allowed a $0.50 per gallon tax credit for the alternative fuel component of
alternative fuel mixtures produced and used as a fuel in a taxpayer’s trade or business in 2009. Our application for registration as a blender based on our use of black liquor as an alternative fuel was approved in May 2009. We began blending
black liquor (a by-product of our wood pulping process) and diesel fuel during the first week of April 2009 and have blended and used 688 million gallons of the alternative fuel mixture through December 31, 2009. The alternative fuel
mixture credit expired on December 31, 2009. We recognized credits of $344 million in 2009 — of which we have received $213 million of cash and have recorded a receivable of $131 million — for black liquor blended through
December 31, 2009.

Share-Based Compensation

We measure the fair value of share-based awards on the dates they are granted or modified. These measurements establish the cost of the share-based awards for accounting purposes. We then recognize
the cost of share-based awards in ourConsolidated Statement of Operationsover each employee’s required service period.Note 17: Share-Based Compensationprovides more information about our share-based compensation.

Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Plans

We recognize the overfunded or underfunded status of our defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans on our balance sheet and recognize changes in the funded status through comprehensive income (loss) in the year
in which the changes occur.

Actuarial valuations determine the amount of the pension and other postretirement benefit obligations and
the net periodic benefit cost we recognize. The net periodic benefit cost includes:



•cost of benefits provided in exchange for employees’ services rendered during the year;

•interest cost of the obligations;

•expected long-term return on fund assets;

•gains or losses on plan settlements and curtailments;

•amortization of prior service costs and plan amendments over the average remaining service period of the active employee group covered by the
plans; and

•amortization of cumulative unrecognized net actuarial gains and losses — generally in excess of 10 percent of the greater of the accrued
benefit obligation or market-related value of plan assets at the beginning of the year — over the average remaining service period of the active employee group covered by the plans.

Pension plans.We have pension plans covering most of our employees. Determination of benefits differs for salaried, hourly and union employees:



•Salaried employee benefits are based on each employee’s highest monthly earnings for five consecutive years during the final 10 years before
retirement.

•Hourly and union employee benefits generally are stated amounts for each year of service.

•Union employee benefits are set through collective-bargaining agreements.

We contribute to our U.S. and Canadian pension plans according to established funding standards. The funding standards for the plans are:



•U.S. pension plans — according to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974; and

•Canadian pension plans — according to the applicable Provincial Pension Benefits Act and the Income Tax Act.

Postretirement benefits other than pensions.We provide certain postretirement health care and life insurance benefits for some retired
employees. In some cases, we pay a portion of the cost of the benefit.Note 8: Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Plansprovides additional information about changes made in our postretirement benefit plans during 2009.

Environmental Remediation

We
accrue losses associated with environmental remediation obligations when such losses are probable and reasonably estimable. Future expenditures for environmental remediation obligations are not discounted to their present value. Recoveries of
environmental remediation costs from other parties are recorded as assets when the recovery is deemed probable and does not exceed the amount of losses previously recorded.









NOTE 2: BUSINESS SEGMENTS

Our business segments and how we account for those segments are
discussed inNote 1: Summary of Significant Accounting Policies. This note provides key financial data by business segment.

DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS

We have disposed of various businesses and operations that are included in the segment
results below. SeeNote 3: Discontinued Operationsfor detailed information regarding our discontinued operations and the segments affected.

KEY FINANCIAL DATA BY BUSINESS SEGMENT

Management evaluates segment performance based on the contributions to
earnings of the respective segments.

The following changes were made during 2008 and 2007:

During 2008:



•We reclassified Weyerhaeuser’s international operations outside of North America from the Corporate and Other segment to the Timberlands
segment.

•We changed our process of allocating pension and postretirement costs (credits) to the operating segments.

During 2007, we completed the Domtar Transaction, which affected several of the company’s segments. SeeNote 3: Discontinued Operationsfor
more information.

There were no changes made in 2009 that affect the comparability of the segment results.

International Operations

Effective July 2008, there were changes in senior management responsibility for Weyerhaeuser’s international operations outside of North America, which consist primarily of timberlands and related converting operations in South
America. As a result, these operations, which previously were reported as part of the Corporate and Other segment, are now reported as part of the Timberlands segment. Results of international operations that have been disposed of and results of the
company’s investment in Uruguay prior to its restructuring in second quarter 2008 continue to be reported in the Corporate and Other segment including the 2008 gain on restructuring. Segment results for prior periods have been recast to present
information consistent with the current presentation.



Allocation of Pension and Postretirement Credits (Costs)

Effective with third quarter 2008, certain
postretirement credits (costs) are no longer allocated to the Forest Products segments. These credits (costs) are reported in the Corporate and Other segment with the exception of our Real Estate segment and certain union-negotiated postretirement
benefits that are reflected in the Cellulose Fibers segment. Postretirement credits (costs) due to curtailments, settlements or special termination benefits continue to be reported in the appropriate business segment. SeeNote 8: Pension and
Other Postretirement Benefit Plansfor more detailed information.

Domtar Transaction

In first quarter 2007, we divested our Fine Paper business and related assets through completion of the Domtar Transaction. The majority of the
operations that were divested as a result of the Domtar Transaction are included in the Fine Paper segment. The additional related assets are included in the following segments:



•Cellulose Fibers — which includes the Kamloops, British Columbia, cellulose fiber operations and also includes sales of cellulose fiber
produced in four mills with integrated paper and cellulose fiber operations;

•Wood Products — which includes the Ear Falls, Ontario, sawmill and activities associated with the Big River and Wapawekka, Saskatchewan,
sawmills that were closed in third quarter 2006; and

•Timberlands — which includes forest licenses on 12.2 million acres associated with the Dryden, Ontario and Prince Albert, Saskatchewan
facilities.

The pretax gain on the Domtar Transaction is included in the Corporate and Other segment.

We have made certain reclassifications in our
consolidated financial statements to reflect discontinued operations.

DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS DIVESTED

Containerboard, Packaging and Recycling Business

On August 4, 2008, we
sold our Containerboard, Packaging and Recycling business to International Paper Company. Operating assets included in the transaction were:



•nine containerboard mills with total capacity of 6.3 million tons,

•72 packaging locations with total capacity of 99.4 billion square feet,

•10 specialty packaging plants,

•four kraft bag and sack locations with a total capacity of 199,000 tons and

•19 recycling facilities.

The Containerboard, Packaging and Recycling assets were classified as assets held for sale, and depreciation of the assets was suspended as of March 15, 2008, the date the purchase and sale agreement was signed.

We received $6.1 billion in proceeds from the sale and we used $2.1 billion of these proceeds to pay down outstanding debt during the second half of
2008. We recorded a $1.2 billion pretax gain in our Corporate and Other segment and recorded tax expense of $887 million, resulting in a net gain of $288 million. The effective tax rate on the transaction is higher than our overall effective tax
rate primarily due to the write-off of approximately $1.25 billion of goodwill in connection with the sale. Goodwill is not deductible for income tax purposes, and no tax benefit has been recorded on the write-off of goodwill.



Australian Operations

In July 2008, we sold the manufacturing operations and the distribution business of our Weyerhaeuser Australia Group and our 50 percent interest in the
Green Triangle Forest Products timberlands business in two separate transactions. The assets we sold were:



•Pine Solutions Australia — sales and distribution operations;

•Weyerhaeuser Australia — two sawmills and associated operations; and

•Green Triangle Forest Products — two sawmills, a pine molding operation, an export chip business and timberlands operations including
approximately 20,000 hectares (approximately 50,000 acres) of plantation pine forest.

The Australian assets were
classified as assets held for sale and depreciation of the assets was suspended as of June 19, 2008, the date the transactions were approved by our board of directors.

We classified the $342 million aggregate cash proceeds from these transactions in the accompanyingConsolidated Statement of Cash Flowsas:



•$306 million in proceeds from sale of business and operating facilities and

•$36 million in distributions from equity affiliates.

We recorded a $218 million pretax gain in the Corporate and Other segment and recorded tax expense of $58 million, resulting in a net gain of $160 million during 2008.

Fine Paper Business and Related Assets — Domtar Transaction

On March 7, 2007, we completed:



•a series of transfers and other transactions resulting in our Fine Paper business and related assets becoming wholly owned by Domtar Corporation;

•the distribution of shares of Domtar Corporation to our shareholders in exchange for 25 million shares of our common stock; and

•the acquisition of Domtar Inc., an unaffiliated Canadian corporation, by Domtar Corporation.

Collectively, these transactions are referred to as the “Domtar Transaction.”

We received $1.35 billion in cash in connection with the Domtar Transaction, of which we used a substantial portion to pay down debt during 2007.

An estimate of the interest expense related to the debt that was paid with the proceeds from the Domtar Transaction is included in discontinued
operations.









Before distributing
Domtar Corporation shares to our shareholders, Domtar Corporation was a wholly owned subsidiary of our company. Concurrent with the distribution to shareholders, Domtar Corporation ceased being our subsidiary.

The operating assets divested as part of the Domtar Transaction are referred to as “Fine Paper and related assets” or “Fine Paper
business and related assets.” They included:



•Fine Paper — the Fine Paper business including seven paper mills and one coated groundwood mill with a combined capacity of 2.9 million
tons and 16 paper converting facilities with a total capacity of 2 million tons;

•Cellulose Fibers — five cellulose fiber manufacturing facilities with total capacity of 0.8 million tons;

•Wood Products — one sawmill with a capacity of 160 million board feet; and

•Timberlands — forest licenses on 12.2 million acres associated with the Dryden, Ontario, and Prince Albert, Saskatchewan, facilities.

Other assets divested were:



•the Prince Albert, Saskatchewan, pulp and paper facility that we closed in the first quarter of 2006; and

•sawmills in Big River and Wapawekka, Saskatchewan, that were closed in the second quarter of 2006.

We recorded a $606 million pretax gain in the Corporate and Other segment and recorded $89 million in tax benefits during 2007. The U.S. portion of the
transaction resulted in a gain that was not taxable. The Canadian portion of the transaction resulted in a net loss for which we recorded a tax benefit.

NET EARNINGS FROM DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS

Our net earnings from discontinued operations were:



•$667 million in 2008 and

•$1,038 million in 2007.

Results of discontinued operations:



•exclude certain general corporate overhead costs that have been allocated to and are included in contribution to earnings for the operating
segments,

•include an allocation of net pension income and

•include interest expense only if the interest is directly attributable to the discontinued operations or is interest on debt that is required to
be repaid as a result of a disposal transaction.

Discontinued operations related to our Containerboard, Packaging and
Recycling business do not include any allocation of interest expense.

Discontinued operations related to our Australian operations and
the Fine Paper business and related assets include interest expense.

Net earnings from operations includes pretax gains of
$29 million for the sale of a previously closed box plant site and $43 million on a legal settlement related to the Dryden, Ontario, facility — both in 2007. SeeNote 19: Other Operating Costs (Income), Netfor more information.

SALE OF BUILDING PRODUCTS DISTRIBUTION CENTERS

In the second quarter of 2007, we sold our Canadian building products distribution facilities. In connection with this sale, we recorded pretax charges of $38 million — including
$22 million for the impairment of goodwill.

During 2008, we sold six U.S. distribution facilities. We recorded net losses of
$6 million — including $5 million for the impairment of goodwill.

The sale of these distribution centers provided us with
net cash proceeds of:



•$62 million in 2008 and

•$100 million in 2007



WEYERHAEUSER COMPANY>2009 ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K71






We continue to sell wood
products through many of these distribution centers. As a result, the operations of these facilities are not included in discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.

NOTE 4: NET EARNINGS (LOSS) PER SHARE

Our basic and diluted earnings (loss) per share attributable to Weyerhaeuser shareholders for the last three years were:



•$(2.58) in 2009,

•$(5.57) in 2008 and

•$3.60 in 2007.

This note provides details about:



•how we calculate basic and diluted net earnings per share and

•our shares with an anti-dilutive effect.

HOW WE CALCULATE BASIC AND DILUTED NET EARNINGS PER SHARE

“Basic
earnings” per share is net earnings divided by the weighted average number of our outstanding common and exchangeable shares. As of year-end 2008, we no longer have exchangeable shares outstanding. More information about this can be found inNote 16: Shareholders’ Interest.

“Diluted earnings” per share is net earnings divided by the sum of the:



•weighted average number of our outstanding common and exchangeable shares and

•effect of our outstanding dilutive potential common shares.

Dilutive potential common shares may include:



•outstanding stock options,

•restricted stock units or

•performance share units.

We use the treasury stock method to calculate the effect of our outstanding dilutive potential common shares.



SHARES EXCLUDED FROM DILUTIVE EFFECT

No dilutive potential shares were included in the computation of diluted earnings (loss) per share for 2009, 2008 and 2007 due to the net loss from continuing operations. However, some or all of these shares may be included in future
periods.

SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM

In
December 2008, we announced a stock repurchase program under which we are authorized to repurchase up to $250 million of outstanding common shares. Through December 31, 2009, we had repurchased a total of 66,691 shares of common stock for
approximately $2 million under the program. These repurchases took place during first quarter 2009 and all common stock purchases under the program were made in open-market transactions.

SERVICE LIVES AND DEPRECIATION

Specific notes about estimated service lives for Forest Products property and equipment:



•Buildings and improvements have estimated lives that are generally at either the high end or low end of the range from 10 years to 40 years,
depending on the type and performance of construction.

•Assets we purchase in business combinations have estimated lives that are the remaining useful lives of the assets as of the date we acquired
them, which is typically shorter than assets we construct or buy new.

The maximum service lives for Forest Products
machinery and equipment varies among our operations:



•Timberlands — 15 years;

•Wood products manufacturing facilities — 20 years; and

•Primary pulp mills — 25 years.

Forest Products depreciation expense, including discontinued operations, was:



•$425 million in 2009,

•$541 million in 2008 and

•$859 million in 2007.



NOTE 7: EQUITY AFFILIATES

Uruguay

In April 2008, we
completed the process of restructuring our ownership interests in Uruguay and partitioned the timberland and other assets formerly owned through a joint venture. As part of the partitioning, we contributed $23 million, net of cash acquired, to
obtain full ownership of a plywood mill formerly owned through the joint venture. These assets and the results of their operations were consolidated in the accompanying financial statements as of April 2008. An estimated noncash restructuring gain
of $101 million was recorded in our Corporate and Other segment during second quarter 2008. An additional $149 million gain was recorded in fourth quarter 2008 when the valuation of the partitioned assets was finalized. There was no tax provision on
the gain primarily due to a forestry exemption from income taxes in Uruguay, and the fact that the assets are considered indefinitely invested.

Australia

In July 2008, the manufacturing operations held within our RII Weyerhaeuser World Timberfund L.P. joint
venture were sold. We received a cash distribution of $36 million and recorded a



WEYERHAEUSER COMPANY>2009 ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K73






pretax gain of $6 million on this sale. Also in July, we sold our interest in the joint venture. We received net cash proceeds of $77 million and recorded a pretax gain on the sale of $78
million. These results are included in discontinued operations in theConsolidated Statement of Operations.

New Zealand

In October 2007, we sold our interest in Nelson Forests Joint Venture (Nelson Forests JV) and the related management company which was
our wholly-owned subsidiary. We received net cash proceeds of approximately $161 million. We recorded a pretax gain on the sale of Nelson Forests JV and its management company of approximately $10 million in fourth quarter 2007, which is included in
other operating costs, net, in theConsolidated Statement of Operations.

In addition, we manage cash for NORPAC under a services agreement. Weyerhaeuser holds the cash and records a payable balance to NORPAC, which is included in accounts payable in the accompanyingConsolidated Balance Sheet. We
had the following payable balances to NORPAC:



•$61 million at December 31, 2009; and

•$43 million at December 31, 2008.

REAL ESTATE UNCONSOLIDATED ENTITIES

Our Real Estate segment holds equity investments in 10 real estate
partnerships and limited liability companies. Our participation in these entities may be as a developer, a builder, or an investment partner. Our ownership percentage varies from 5 percent to 60 percent depending on the investment. Aggregated
assets, liabilities and operating results of the entities that we account for as equity affiliates are provided below.

NOTE 8: PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS

We sponsor several retirement programs for our employees.

This note provides details about:



•types of plans we sponsor,

•significant transactions and events affecting plans we sponsor,

•funded status of plans we sponsor,

•pension assets,

•activity of plans we sponsor and

•actuarial assumptions.

TYPES OF PLANS WE SPONSOR

The plans we sponsor in the U.S. and Canada differ according to each country’s
requirements.

In the U.S., our pension plans are:



•qualified — plans that qualify under the Internal Revenue Code; and

•nonqualified — plans for select employees that provide additional benefits not qualified under the Internal Revenue Code.

In Canada, our pension plans are:



•registered — plans that are registered under the Income Tax Act and applicable provincial pension acts; and

•nonregistered — plans for select employees that provide additional benefits that may not be registered under the Income Tax Act or
provincial pension acts.

We also offer retiree medical and life insurance plans in the U.S. and Canada. These plans
are referred to as other postretirement benefit plans in the following disclosures.

Our qualified and registered pension plans and a
portion of our nonregistered pension plans are funded. We contribute to these plans according to established funding standards. The nonqualified pension plan, a portion of the nonregistered pension plans, and the other postretirement benefit plans
are unfunded. For the unfunded plans, we pay benefits to retirees from our general assets as they come due.

Employee Eligibility and
Accounting

The Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Plans section ofNote 1: Summary of Significant Accounting Policiesprovides information about employee eligibility for pension plans and postretirement health care and life insurance benefits, as well as how we account for the plans and benefits. In 2009, we made changes to: (1) certain postretirement benefit
plans in Canada, (2) postretirement life insurance benefits for certain U.S. retirees and (3) the U.S. pension plan for salaried employees. See Effects of Significant Transactions and Events below for changes to eligibility in the other
postretirement benefit plans.

Measurement Date

We measure the fair value of pension plan assets and pension and other postretirement benefit obligations as of the end of our fiscal year. The fair value of pension plan assets are estimated at the
end of the year and are revised in the first half of the following year when the information needed to finalize fair values is received.

EFFECTS OF SIGNIFICANT TRANSACTIONS AND EVENTS

The information that is provided in this footnote is affected by
the following transactions and events that occurred in 2009 and 2008.

Amendments of Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Plans
for Salaried Employees

During third quarter 2009, amendments were approved for our postretirement medical and life insurance
benefits for certain retirees and employees covered by plans in Canada. The changes to the Canadian plans included a decrease in the amounts we will pay for postretirement medical and life insurance for certain retirees and employees. As a result of
the plan changes, the plans’ liabilities were remeasured at August 31, 2009. The remeasurement and the annual remeasurement at January 1, 2009 reduced the unrecognized gain by $19 million. The plan changes also generated an
unrecognized prior service credit of $97 million which will be amortized into net periodic benefit credits (costs) over the remaining future service years of plan members.

During fourth quarter 2009, an amendment was approved for our postretirement life insurance benefit for certain U.S. salaried retirees. The change eliminated the life insurance benefit for certain
salaried retirees effective January 1, 2010. The plan’s liabilities were remeasured at November 30, 2009. This remeasurement and the annual remeasurement at January 1, 2009 increased the unrecognized loss by $6 million. This
change resulted in a $16 million prior service credit which was fully recognized in 2009.

During third quarter 2009, we announced
changes to the Weyerhaeuser Company Retirement Plan for Salaried Employees (the qualified pension plan for U.S. employees receiving salaried benefits) for service earned on and after January 1, 2010. The changes include a reduced pension
benefit, changes in how benefits payable before age 65 are determined and a change from a single lump sum optional form of payment to an option for seven equal annual installments. There are no



WEYERHAEUSER COMPANY>2009 ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K75






changes in the plan’s projected benefit obligation (PBO) for the 2009 plan year as a result of these changes. However, there was a change to the plan’s minimum benefit, which increased
for all years of service including those earned prior to January 1, 2010. This change does not have a significant impact on the plan’s PBO, but the effect of this change is reflected in the PBO at December 31, 2009 and prior service
cost was established as of December 31, 2009. All of the changes will impact net periodic pension benefit credits (costs) and required funding, if any, beginning in 2010.

During second quarter 2008, we announced amendments to our postretirement medical and life insurance benefit plans for U.S. salaried employees that reduced or eliminated certain medical and life
insurance benefits that were available to both past and present employees. These changes resulted in a $52 million curtailment gain recognized in second quarter 2008 for full recognition of the pre-existing prior service credit for affected
employees.

Restructuring Activities

The information that is provided in this footnote is affected by restructuring activities that occurred in 2009 and 2008.

2009 Restructuring. The cumulative lump sum distributions for the year triggered two settlements in the U.S. Settlement charges of $60 million and $16 million were recognized in third and fourth quarter 2009, respectively.

The 2009 curtailments and special termination benefits are related to involuntary terminations due to company-wide restructuring
activities and the closure of Wood Products facilities. The total curtailment charge for the U.S. and Canadian pension plans was $22 million. The net curtailment credit to the Canadian postretirement benefit plans was less than $1 million. There
were no curtailment charges or credits to the U.S. postretirement plans.

Special termination benefits were available under both the
pension and postretirement benefit plans in the U.S. and Canada, for those terminated employees who were not yet eligible to retire but whose age plus service was at least 65 and had at least ten years of service (Rule of 65). Special termination
charges were $14 million and $9 million for the pension and postretirement benefit plans, respectively.

2008 Restructuring.
During third quarter 2008, we recognized a $59 million charge for settlement of the qualified pension plan that was transferred to International Paper and other plan curtailments and special termination benefits related to the sale of our
Containerboard, Packaging and Recycling business. This charge was included in the net gain on the sale of the Containerboard, Packaging and Recycling business and is presented in discontinued operations in the accompanying Consolidated Statement of
Operations.

Midyear Remeasurement of Assets and Liabilities

Our pension and other postretirement benefit plans are only remeasured at fiscal year-end unless a significant event occurs that requires remeasurement of the assets or liabilities at an interim
date. During 2009 and 2008, the following events required interim remeasurements:



•The amendment to the other postretirement benefit plans for certain retirees in the U.S. required remeasurement of the plan’s liabilities as
of November 30, 2009.

•The amendment to the other postretirement benefit plans for certain retirees and employees in Canada required remeasurement of the plan’s
liabilities as of August 31, 2009.

•The volume of lump sum distributions from our U.S. qualified pension plan for salaried employees required remeasurement of the plan’s assets
and liabilities as of August 31, 2009, the date the settlement was triggered.

•The amendment to the other postretirement benefit plan for salaried employees in the U.S. triggered remeasurement of the plan’s liabilities
as of June 29, 2008.

•The sale of our Containerboard, Packaging and Recycling business triggered remeasurement of the assets and liabilities of the U.S. pension plans
as of July 31, 2008.

•The combined effect of the sale of the Containerboard, Packaging and Recycling business and corporate restructuring activities triggered
remeasurement of the assets and liabilities for the U.S. qualified pension plan for salaried employees and liabilities of the U.S. postretirement medical and life benefit plans for salaried employees as of October 31, 2008. The remeasurement
was for the purpose of calculating an adjustment for pension settlement associated with the sale and restructuring; and curtailment and special termination benefits associated with restructuring activities.

The discount rate used to remeasure the plans’ liabilities is reflective of current bond rates on the remeasurement date. As a result of the
midyear remeasurements, multiple discount rates were used in estimating our net periodic benefit cost (credit) for 2009 and 2008. These rates are discussed further in the Actuarial Assumptions portion of this footnote. There was no change to the
expected rate of return assumption during 2009 and 2008.







`



Receivable From Pension Trust

During 2009 and 2008, there was a high volume of lump sum distributions from our U.S. qualified pension plans. Retirement- eligible employees whose employment with the company terminated in connection with the sale of our
Containerboard, Packaging and Recycling business or corporate restructuring activities could elect to receive their pension benefit as a lump sum distribution if permitted in accordance with the plans’ provisions. In addition, market events in
late 2008 and early 2009 adversely affected liquidity. For instance, many of the funds in which plan assets are invested changed their redemption terms which delayed some of the pension trusts’ cash receipts. To avoid liquidating assets at
depressed prices and, as permitted by law, we elected to provide $285 million of short-term liquidity to the U.S. pension trust through short-term loans. These short-term loans were made in the fourth quarter 2008 and first quarter 2009. Markets and
liquidity improved in 2009 and the pension trust repaid $139 million in fourth quarter 2009. Full repayment of the remaining balance is anticipated in 2010.

FUNDED STATUS OF PLANS WE SPONSOR

The funded status of the plans we sponsor is determined by comparing
the benefit obligation with the fair value of plan assets at the end of the year.

The values reported for our pension plan assets at the end of 2009 and 2008 were estimated. Additional information regarding the year-end values
generally becomes available to us during the first half of the following year.

Use of the final valuations as of December 31, 2008,
would have decreased the fair value of plan assets by $287 million and increased the underfunded status of our pension plans from $294 million to $581 million. Changes to our balance sheet as of December 31, 2008, would have been as follows:



•$137 million decrease in deferred pension and other assets;

•$150 million increase in deferred pension, other postretirement benefits and other liabilities;

•$104 million decrease in the deferred income tax liability; and

•$183 million net increase in cumulative other comprehensive loss, which would have resulted in a reduction in total Weyerhaeuser
shareholders’ interest.

Accumulated Benefit Obligations Greater Than Plan Assets

As of December 31, 2009, pension plans with accumulated benefit obligations greater than plan assets had:



•$2.9 billion in projected benefit obligations,

•$2.8 billion in accumulated benefit obligations and

•assets with a fair value of $2 billion.

As of December 31, 2008, pension plans with accumulated benefit obligations greater than plan assets had:



•$2.6 billion in projected benefit obligations,

•$2.5 billion in accumulated benefit obligations and

•assets with a fair value of $2 billion.



The accumulated benefit obligation for all of our defined benefit pension plans was:



•$4.6 billion at December 31, 2009; and

•$4.2 billion at December 31, 2008.

PENSION ASSETS

Our Investment Policies and Strategies

Our investment policies and strategies guide and direct how we manage funds for the benefit plans we sponsor. These funds include our:



•U.S. pension trust — funds our U.S. qualified pension plans;

•Canadian pension trust — funds our Canadian registered pension plans; and

•Retirement Compensation Arrangements — fund a portion of our Canadian nonregistered pension plans.

U.S. and Canadian Pension Trusts

Our U.S. pension trust holds the funds for our U.S. qualified pension plans, while our Canadian pension trust holds the funds for our Canadian registered pension plans.

Our strategy within the trusts is to invest:



•directly in a diversified mix of nontraditional investments; and

•indirectly through derivatives to promote effective use of capital, increase returns and manage associated risk.

Consistent with past practice and in accordance with investment guidelines established by the company’s investment committee, the investment
managers of the company’s pension plan asset portfolios utilize a diversified set of investment strategies.

Our direct investments
include:



•cash and short-term investments,

•hedge funds,

•private equity,

•real estate fund investments and

•common and preferred stocks.

Our indirect investments include:



•equity index derivatives,

•fixed income derivatives and

•swaps and other derivative instruments.

The overall return for our pension trusts includes:



•returns earned on our direct investments and

•returns earned on the derivatives we use.

Cash and short-term investments generally consist of highly liquid money market and government securities and are primarily held to fund benefit payments, capital calls and margin requirements.









Hedge fund investments
generally consist of privately-offered managed pools primarily structured as limited liability entities, with the general members or partners of such limited liability entities serving as portfolio manager and thus being responsible for the
fund’s underlying investment decisions. Generally, these funds have varying degrees of liquidity and redemption provisions. Underlying investments within these funds may include long and short public and private equities, corporate, mortgage
and sovereign debt, options, swaps, forwards and other derivative positions. These funds may also use varying degrees of leverage.

Private equity investments consist of investments in private equity, mezzanine, distressed, co-investments and other structures. Private equity funds generally participate in buyouts and venture capital of limited liability entities
through unlisted equity and debt instruments. These funds may also employ borrowing at the underlying entity level. Mezzanine and distressed funds generally follow strategies of investing in the debt of public or private companies with additional
participation through warrants or other equity type options.

Real estate fund investments in real property may be initiated through
private transactions between principals or public market vehicles such as real estate investment trusts and are generally held in limited liability entities.

Common and preferred stocks are equity instruments that generally have resulted from transactions related to private equity investment holdings.

Swaps and other derivative instruments generally are comprised of swaps, futures, forwards or options. In accordance with our investment risk and return objectives, some of these instruments are
utilized to achieve target equity and bond asset exposure or to reduce exposure to certain market risks. Others, mainly total return swaps with limited exchange of principal, are designed to gain exposure to the return characteristics of specific
financial strategies.

Retirement Compensation Arrangements

Retirement Compensation Arrangements fund a portion of our Canadian nonregistered pension plans.

Under Retirement Compensation Arrangements, our contributions are split:



•50 percent to our investments in a portfolio of equities; and

•50 percent to a noninterest-bearing refundable tax account held by Canada Revenue Agency — as required by Canadian tax rules.



The Canadian tax rules requirement means that — on average, over time
— approximately 50 percent of our Canadian nonregistered pension plans’ assets do not earn returns.

Managing Risk

All investments are subject to risk, including market price, liquidity, currency, interest rate and credit risks. We have
established governance practices to manage these risks. The following provides an overview of these risks and describes actions we take to mitigate the potential adverse effects of these risks on the performance of our pension plan assets.
Generally, we manage these risks through:



•selection and diversification of managers and strategies,

•use of limited-liability vehicles,

•diversification and

•constraining risk profiles to predefined limits on the percentage of pension trust assets that can be invested in certain categories.

Market price riskis the risk that the future value of a financial instrument will fluctuate as a result of
changes in its market price, whether caused by factors specific to the individual investment, its issuer, or any other market factor that may affect its price. We attempt to mitigate market price risk by investing in a diversified set of assets
whose returns exhibit low correlation to those of traditional asset classes and each other. In addition, we and our investment advisors monitor the investments on a regular basis to ensure the decision to invest in particular assets continues to be
suitable, including performing ongoing qualitative and quantitative assessments and comprehensive investment and operational due diligence. Special attention is paid to organizational changes made by the underlying fund managers and to changes in
policy relative to their investment objectives, valuation, hedging strategy, degree of diversification, leverage, alignment of fund principles and investors, risk governance and costs.

Liquidity riskis the risk that the pension trusts will encounter difficulty in meeting their obligations associated with their financial liabilities. Our financial obligations as they
relate to the pension plans may consist of distributions and redemptions payable to pension plan participants, payments to counterparties and fees to service providers. As established, pension plan assets primarily consist of investments in limited
liability pools for which there is no active secondary market. As a result, the investments may be illiquid. Further, hedge funds are subject to potential restrictions that may affect the timing of the realization of pending redemptions.
Private equity funds are subject to distribution and funding schedules that are set by the private equity funds’ respective managers and market activity. To mitigate liquidity risk, the hedge fund portfolio has



WEYERHAEUSER COMPANY>2009 ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K79






been diversified across manager’s strategies and funds that posses varying liquidity provisions and the private equity portfolio has been diversified across different vintage years and
strategies. In addition, the investment committee regularly reviews cash flows of the trust and sets appropriate guidelines to address liquidity needs.

Currency riskarises from holding pension plan assets denominated in a currency other than the currency in which its liabilities are settled. Such risk is managed generally through notional contracts designed to hedge the net
exposure to non-functional currencies.

Interest rate riskis the risk that a change in interest rates will adversely affect the
fair value of fixed income securities. We have no direct exposure to fixed-income securities within the pension plan assets at December 31, 2009 or 2008. Therefore, the pension trust’s primary exposure to interest rate risk is indirect and
through its investment in limited liability pools. Such indirect exposure is managed by the respective fund managers in conjunction with their investment level decisions and predefined investment mandates.

Credit riskrelates to the extent to which failures by counterparties to discharge their obligations could reduce the amount of future cash
flows on hand at the balance sheet date. The pension trust exposure to counterparty credit risk is reflected as a settlement receivable from derivative contracts within the pension plan assets. In evaluating credit risk, we will often be dependent
upon information provided by the counterparty or a rating agency, which may be inaccurate. We decrease exposure to credit risk by only dealing with highly-rated financial counterparties, and as of year end, our counterparties each had a credit
rating of at least A from Standard and Poor’s.

We expect that none of our counterparties will fail to meet its obligations. Also,
no principal is at risk as a result of these types of investments. Only the amount of unsettled net receivables is at risk.

We manage
this risk through:



•selection of counterparties with a defined minimum credit quality,

•diversification,

•predefined settlement provisions and

•documented agreements.

We are also exposed to credit risk indirectly through counterparty relationships struck by the underlying managers of investments in limited liability pools. This indirect exposure is mitigated through a due diligence process, which
focuses on monitoring each investment fund to ensure the decision to invest in or maintain exposure to a fund continues to be suitable for the pension plans’ asset portfolios.



While we do not target specific direct investment or derivative allocations, we have established guidelines on the
percentage of pension trust assets that can be invested in certain categories to provide diversification by investment type fund and investment managers, as well as to manage overall liquidity.

Assets within our qualified and registered pension plans in our U.S. and Canadian pension trusts were invested as follows:

For our nonregistered plans, we invest 50 percent of the funds we contribute to our nonregistered pension plans. Under Canadian tax rules for
Retirement Compensation Arrangements, the other 50 percent is allocated to a noninterest-bearing refundable tax account held by the Canada Revenue Agency. We have invested the assets that we are allowed to manage as follows:

Valuation of Our Plan Assets

We estimate the fair value of pension plan assets based upon the information available at year end. The pension assets are stated at fair value based upon the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a
liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the reporting date. We do not value pension investments based upon a forced or distressed sale scenario. Instead, we consider both observable and unobservable inputs that reflect
assumptions applied by market participants when setting the exit price of an asset or liability in an orderly transaction within the principal market of that asset or liability.

The pension assets are comprised of cash, derivative contracts, common and preferred stock and fund units. The fund units are typically limited liability interests in hedge funds, private equity
funds, real estate funds and cash funds. Each of these assets participates in its own unique principal market. As such, cash, when held directly, is valued at cost; common and preferred stocks are valued at exit prices quoted in the public markets;
derivative contracts are valued at exit prices









determined after consideration of inputs from executed contracts, broker dealers and counterparty quoted prices; and fund units are valued based upon the net asset value of the fund. If
restrictions were imposed upon any of the limited liability pools in which the pension plan assets were invested at a time when our interest in the fund units were being sold, it is possible that the value to be realized in such a transaction could
be different from the reported value.

We value the pension plan assets based upon the observability of exit pricing inputs and classify
pension plan assets based upon the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement of the pension plan asset in their entirety. The fair value hierarchy we follow is outlined below:

Level 1: Inputs are unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets and liabilities traded in an active market.

Level 2: Inputs are quoted prices in non-active markets for which pricing inputs are observable either
directly or indirectly at the reporting date.

Level 3: Inputs are derived from valuation techniques in
which one or more significant inputs or value drivers are unobservable.

Assets with readily available quoted prices in an active market
or those for which fair value can be measured from actively quoted prices will have a higher degree of market price observability and thus, a lesser degree of judgment applied when measuring fair value than those with unobservable
pricing inputs.

The pension trusts’ net investments exclusive of receivables and accruals, when categorized in accordance with
this fair value hierarchy, are as follows:

Expected Pension Funding

Established funding standards govern the funding requirements for our qualified and registered pension plans. We fund the benefit payments of our
nonqualified and nonregistered plans as benefit payments come due.

We intend to make a voluntary contribution of approximately $100
million to the U.S. qualified pension plans for the 2009 plan year. The contribution will be made prior to September 15, 2010. The contribution will decrease 2009 taxable income, thereby increasing the amount of the 2009 net operating loss
refund. It would also decrease the earnings and profits required for a real estate investment trust conversion. This contribution is expected to eliminate the estimated $30 million minimum funding requirements for this plan for 2010, which would
have been due by September 15, 2011.

In addition, we expect to contribute the following to pension plans during 2010:



•$20 million to our U.S. nonqualified pension plans and

•$10 million for required contributions to our Canadian registered and nonregistered pension plans. We voluntarily contributed $15 million
subsequent to December 31, 2009 and may elect to make additional contributions to the largest registered plan in Canada.

Expected Postretirement Benefit Funding

Our retiree medical and life insurance plans are unfunded. Benefits for
these plans are paid from our general assets as they come due. Except for benefits provided to certain unionized employees, we retain the right to terminate other postretirement benefits. We expect to contribute approximately $60 million to our U.S.
and Canadian other postretirement benefit plans in 2010, including approximately $17 million expected to be required to cover benefit payments under collectively bargained contractual obligations.

Discount Rate

Midyear changes in the assumed discount rate during 2009 were
for the following:



•The liabilities for salaried life insurance benefits were remeasured as of November 30, 2009, as a result of the elimination of the benefit
for certain salaried retirees.

•The assets and liabilities for the U.S. qualified salaried pension plan were remeasured at August 31, 2009. The remeasurement was for the
purpose of calculating a charge for the pension settlement which was triggered August 31, 2009 due to large volume of lump sum distributions from that plan.

•The liabilities of the postretirement medical and life plans in Canada were remeasured at August 31, 2009 due to the changes in certain of
those plans.

Expected Return on Plan Assets

We estimate the expected long-term return on assets for our:



•qualified and registered pension plans and

•nonregistered plans.

Qualified and Registered Pension Plans.Our expected long-term rate of return assumption for plan assets as of December 31, 2009, is comprised of:



•an 8 percent assumed return from direct investments and

•a 1.5 percent assumed return from derivatives.









Determining our expected
return:



•requires a high degree of judgment,

•uses our historical fund returns as a base and

•places added weight on more recent pension plan asset performance.

Over the 25 years it has been in place, our U.S. pension trust investment strategy has achieved a 15.3 percent net compound annual return rate.

Based on valuations received as of year end, our total actual return on assets held by our pension trusts for the registered and
qualified plans was a gain of approximately $691 million in 2009. The actual return on the nonregistered plan assets (RCA trust) was a loss of $1 million.

These trusts fund our qualified and registered pension plans.

Actual Returns (Losses) on Assets Held by Our
Pension Trusts



DOLLAR AMOUNTS IN MILLIONS200920082007Direct investments$525$(1,578)$745Derivatives166(394)32Total$691$(1,972)$777

Nonregistered plans.Our expected overall annual return on assets that fund our nonregistered plans is 4.75 percent.

Our expected long-term annual rate of return on the equity portion of this portfolio — the portion we are allowed to invest and manage — is
9.5 percent. We base that expected rate of return on:



•historical experience and

•future return expectations.

Historically, the 4.75 percent expected overall annual return is calculated by dividing 9.5 percent by two. That is because Canadian tax rules require that 50 percent of the assets for nonregistered plans go to a noninterest-bearing
refundable tax account. As a result, the return we earn investing the other 50 percent is spread over 100 percent of the assets.

HEALTH CARE COSTS

Rising costs of health care significantly affect the costs of our health care plans.



Health Care Cost Trend Rates

We use assumptions about health care cost trend rates to estimate the cost of benefits we provide. In 2009, the assumed weighted health care cost trend
rate for the next year was:



•8 percent in the U.S. and

•5.7 percent in Canada.

This table shows the assumptions we use in estimating the annual cost increase for health care benefits we provide.

OTHER PLANS

In addition to the
pension and postretirement benefit plans we provide, we also:



•make contributions to union-administered multiemployer pension plans and

•sponsor other postretirement and defined contribution plans.

Union-Administered Multiemployer Pension Plans

We make negotiated
contributions to union-administered multiemployer pension plans. Our contributions were approximately:



•$3 million in 2009,

•$5 million in 2008 and

•$6 million in 2007.

Our contribution generally is based on fixed amounts per hour per employee. As of December 31, 2009, these plans covered approximately 1,200 of our employees.



WEYERHAEUSER COMPANY>2009 ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K85






Other Postretirement
Benefit Plans

We sponsor other postretirement benefit plans for our U.S. and Canadian employees. These plans are not included above
since the full cost of the plans is paid by retirees.

Defined Contribution Plans

We sponsor various defined contribution plans for our U.S. and Canadian salaried and hourly employees. Our contributions to these plans were:



•$15 million in 2009,

•$47 million in 2008 and

•$53 million in 2007.

Effective May 1, 2009, the company match for the salaried defined contribution plan was temporarily suspended. The suspension is scheduled to be lifted in July 2010.

NOTE 9: CONSOLIDATION OF VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES

This note provides details about:



•Forest Products special-purpose entities (SPEs) and

•Real Estate variable interests.

FOREST PRODUCTS SPECIAL-PURPOSE ENTITIES

From 2002 through 2004, Forest Products sold certain
nonstrategic timberlands in five separate transactions. We are the primary beneficiary and consolidate the assets and liabilities of certain monetization and buyer-sponsored SPEs involved in these transactions. We have an equity interest in the
monetization SPEs, but no ownership interest in the buyer-sponsored SPEs. The following disclosures refer to assets of buyer-sponsored SPEs and liabilities of monetization SPEs. However, because these SPEs are distinct legal entities:



•Assets of the SPEs are not available to satisfy our liabilities or obligations.

•Liabilities of the SPEs are not our liabilities or obligations.

OurConsolidated Statement of Operationsincludes:



•Interest expense on SPE debt of:



–$33 million in 2009,

–$39 million in 2008 and

–$44 million in 2007.



•Interest income on SPE investments of:



–$36 million in 2009,

–$48 million in 2008 and

–$55 million in 2007.



Sales proceeds paid to buyer-sponsored SPEs were invested in restricted bank financial instruments with a balance of $909 million as of
December 31, 2009. The weighted average interest rate was 3.78 percent during 2009 and 4.38 percent during 2008. Maturities of the bank financial instruments at the end of 2009 were:



•$110 million in 2012,

•$184 million in 2013,

•$253 million in 2019 and

•$362 million in 2020.

The long-term debt of our monetization SPEs was $761 million as of December 31, 2009, and $758 million as of December 31, 2008. The weighted average interest rate was 4.11 percent during 2009 and 4.73 percent during 2008.
Maturities of the debt at the end of 2009 were:



•$94 million in 2012,

•$156 million in 2013,

•$209 million in 2019 and

•$302 million in 2020.

Bank financial instruments consist of bank guarantees backed by bank notes for three of the SPE transactions and letters of credit backed by cash deposits for two of the SPE transactions. Interest earned from each bank financial
instrument is used to pay interest accrued on the corresponding SPE’s debt. Any shortfall between interest earned and interest accrued reduces our equity in the monetization SPEs.

Upon dissolution of the SPEs and payment of all obligations of the entities, we would receive any net equity remaining in the monetization SPEs and would be required to report deferred tax gains on
our income tax return. In the event that proceeds from the bank financial instruments are insufficient to settle all of the liabilities of the SPEs, we are not obligated to contribute any funds to any of the SPEs. As of December 31, 2009, our
net equity in the five SPEs was approximately $148 million and the deferred tax liability was estimated to be approximately $284 million.

REAL ESTATE VARIABLE-INTEREST ENTITIES

Our Real Estate segment includes subsidiaries with two types of variable
interests:



•Fixed-price purchase options — real estate development subsidiaries enter into options to acquire lots at fixed prices, primarily for
building single-family homes.

•Subordinated financing — a subsidiary provides subordinated financing to third-party developers and homebuilders.

VARIABLE-INTEREST ENTITIES NOT CONSOLIDATED

We do not consolidate some variable-interest entities. These are related to lot option purchase agreements we entered into:



•prior to December 31, 2003; and

•after December 30, 2003.

Prior to December 31, 2003

After exhaustive efforts, we have not been able to obtain the information needed
to determine whether we are required to consolidate certain entities related to purchase options that we entered into prior to December 31, 2003. These represent:



•three lot option purchase agreements,

•$19 million in deposits at risk and

•$20 million to be paid if the options are fully exercised.

After December 30, 2003

We are not required to consolidate certain
entities related to purchase options that we entered into after December 31, 2003, because we are not the primary beneficiary. These represent:



•three lot option purchase agreements,

•$2 million in deposits at risk and

•$29 million to be paid if the options are fully exercised.

SUBORDINATED FINANCING ACTIVITY

As of December 31, 2009, our real estate
subsidiary that provides subordinated financing has approximately $3 million in subordinated loans at risk in 36 variable-interest entities.

NOTE 14: FAIR VALUE
OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

This note provides details about our:



•debt and

•other financial instruments.



FAIR VALUE OF DEBT

The fair
value of our long-term debt was $5.7 billion as of December 31, 2009. The estimated fair values and carrying values consisted of the following:

Fair Value and Carrying Value of Our Long-Term Debt



DOLLAR AMOUNTS IN MILLIONSDECEMBER 31, 2009DECEMBER 31, 2008CARRYINGVALUEFAIRVALUECARRYINGVALUEFAIRVALUEFinancial liabilities:Long-term debt (including current
maturities)Forest Products$5,284$5,256$5,560$4,605Real Estate$402$398$456$381

To estimate the fair value of long-term debt, we used the following valuation approaches:



•market approach — based on quoted market prices we received for the same types and issues of our debt; or

•income approach — based on the discounted value of the future cash flows using market yields for the same type and comparable issues of
debt.

The inputs to these valuations are based on market data obtained from independent sources or information derived
principally from observable market data.

The difference between the fair value and the carrying value represents the theoretical net
premium or discount we would pay or receive to retire all debt at the measurement date.

FAIR VALUE OF OTHER FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

We believe that our other financial instruments, including cash, short-term investments, receivables, and payables, have net
carrying values that approximate their fair values with only insignificant differences. This is primarily due to:



•the short-term nature of these instruments,

•carrying short-term investments at expected net realizable value and

•the allowance for doubtful accounts.

We also have long-term investments that are classified as available-for-sale securities. These securities’ carrying values approximate their fair values.

NOTE 15: LEGAL PROCEEDINGS, COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

This note provides details about our:



•legal proceedings,

•environmental matters and

•commitments and other contingencies.



WEYERHAEUSER COMPANY>2009 ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K89






LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

We are party to legal matters generally incidental to our

business. The ultimate outcome of any legal proceeding:



•is subject to a great many variables and

•cannot be predicted with any degree of certainty.

However, whenever probable losses from litigation could reasonably be determined — we believe that we have established adequate reserves. In addition, we believe the ultimate

outcome of the legal proceedings:



•could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows or financial position in any given quarter or year; but

•will not have a material adverse effect on our long-term results of operations, cash flows or financial position.

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS

The
issues we have concerning environmental matters are:



•site remediation and

•asbestos removal.

Site Remediation

Under the Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act — commonly
known as the Superfund—and similar state laws, we:



•are a party to various proceedings related to the cleanup of hazardous waste sites and

•have been notified that we may be a potentially responsible party related to the cleanup of other hazardous waste sites for which proceedings
have not yet been initiated.

Our established reserves.We have established reserves for estimated remediation
costs on the active Superfund sites and other sites for which we are responsible.

Changes in the Reserve for Environmental
Remediation



DOLLAR AMOUNTS IN MILLIONSReserve balance as of December 31, 2008$37Reserve charges and adjustments, net(1)Payments(5)Reserve balance as of December 31, 2009$31Total active sites as of December 31, 200955

The changes in our reserves for remediation costs reflect:



•new information on all sites concerning remediation alternatives,

•updates on prior cost estimates and new sites and

•costs incurred to remediate sites.



Estimates.We believe it is reasonably possible — based on currently available information and analysis — that remediation
costs for all identified sites may exceed our reserves by up to $30 million.

That estimate — in which those additional costs may be
incurred over several years — is the upper end of the range of reasonably possible additional costs. The estimate:



•is much less certain than the estimates on which our accruals are currently based and

•uses assumptions that are less favorable to us among the range of reasonably possible outcomes.

In estimating our current accruals and the possible range of additional future costs, we:



•assumed we will not bear the entire cost of remediation of every site,

•took into account the ability of other potentially responsible parties to participate and

•considered each party’s financial condition and probable contribution on a per-site basis.

We have not recorded any amounts for potential recoveries from insurance carriers.

Asbestos Management

Some of our sites have asbestos containing materials
(ACM). We have met our current legal obligation to identify and manage these materials. In situations where we cannot reasonably determine when asbestos containing materials might be removed from the sites, we have not recognized a liability because
its fair value cannot be reasonably estimated.

COMMITMENTS AND OTHER CONTINGENCIES

Our commitments and contingencies include:



•guarantees of debt and performance,

•warrantees on homes,

•purchase obligations for goods and services and

•operating leases.

Guarantees

We have guaranteed the performance of the buyer/lessee of a timberlands lease we sold in 2005. Future
payments on the lease — which expires in 2023 — are $21 million. We recorded $3 million for this guarantee.

Our Real Estate
segment has guaranteed buyer/lessee performance on ground leases that we sold. Future payments on the leases — which expire in 2041 — are $26 million.









Warranties

Our warranty liability was:



•$28 million at December 31, 2009, and

•$28 million at December 31, 2008.

These warranties — provided by our WRECO subsidiary — are on homes that we have built. The terms of the warranties vary according to:



•competitive industry practice and

•state and local laws.

Purchase Obligations

Our purchase obligations as of December 31, 2009 were:



•$56 million in 2010,

•$33 million in 2011,

•$16 million in 2012,

NOTE 16: SHAREHOLDERS’ INTEREST

This note provides details about:



•preferred and preference shares,

•common shares,

•share-repurchase programs,

•exchangeable shares and

•cumulative other comprehensive loss.

PREFERRED AND PREFERENCE SHARES

We had no preferred or preference shares outstanding at year-end 2009
and 2008.

However, we have authorization to issue:



•7 million preferred shares with a par value of $1 per share and

•40 million preference shares with a par value of $1 per share.

We may issue preferred or preference shares at one time or through a series of offerings. The shares may have varying rights and preferences that can
include:



•dividend rates,

•redemption rights,

•conversion terms,

•sinking-fund provisions,

•values in liquidation and

•voting rights.

When issued, outstanding preferred and preference shares rank senior to outstanding common shares. That means preferred and preference shares would receive dividends and assets available on liquidation before any payments are made to
common shares.

OUR SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM

In December 2008, we announced a stock-repurchase program under which we are authorized to repurchase up to $250 million of outstanding shares. As of December 31, 2009, we had repurchased a total of 66,691 shares of common stock
for approximately $2 million under the program. These repurchases took place during first quarter 2009 and all common stock purchases under the program were made in open-market transactions. There were no common share repurchases during 2008.

During 2007, we completed a stock-repurchase program authorized by the board of directors in 2005. Under this program, in open-market
transactions, we repurchased approximately 7 million shares of our common stock for $473 million in 2007.



EXCHANGEABLE SHARES

There were no outstanding exchangeable shares as of
year-end 2009 and 2008. During 2008, 1.6 million exchangeable shares were redeemed or cancelled.

Our Weyerhaeuser Company Limited
subsidiary issued 13.6 million exchangeable shares to common shareholders of MacMillan Bloedel in 1999 as part of the consideration paid to acquire MacMillan Bloedel. No additional shares were issued. These exchangeable shares were, as nearly

NOTE 17: SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION

Share-based compensation expense was:



•$26 million in 2009,

•$47 million in 2008 and

•$41 million in 2007.

Share-based compensation for each of these years includes expense related to the following awards:



•2009 — equity-classified awards granted in 2006, 2007, 2008 and 2009 and all outstanding liability-classified awards;

•2008 — equity-classified awards granted in 2006, 2007 and 2008 and all outstanding liability-classified awards; and

•2007 — equity-classified awards granted in 2006 and 2007 and all outstanding liability-classified awards.

This note provides details about:



•our Long-Term Incentive Compensation Plan,

•how we account for share-based awards,

•tax benefits of share-based awards,

•types of share-based compensation and

•unrecognized share-based compensation.

OUR LONG-TERM INCENTIVE COMPENSATION PLAN

Our Long-Term Incentive Compensation Plan (the Plan) provides
for share-based awards that include:



•stock options,

•stock appreciation rights,

•restricted stock,

•restricted stock units,

•performance shares and

•performance share units.

We may issue grants of up to 17 million shares under the Plan. That is in addition to 1.9 million shares subject to outstanding awards under prior plans.

For stock options and stock appreciation rights:



•An individual participant may receive a grant of up to 500,000 shares in any one calendar year.

•The exercise price is required to be the market price on the date of the grant.

For restricted stock, restricted stock units, performance shares, performance share units or other equity grants:



•An individual participant may receive a grant of up to 200,000 shares annually.

•The maximum aggregate number of shares that may be issued as grants is 3.4 million shares.



The compensation committee of our board of directors (the Committee)
annually establishes an overall pool of stock awards available for grants based on performance.

For stock-settled awards, we:



•issue new stock into the marketplace and

•generally do not repurchase shares in connection with issuing new awards.

Our common shares would increase by approximately 19 million shares if all share-based awards were exercised or vested. These include:



•all options, restricted stock units, and performance share units outstanding at December 31, 2009 under the Plan;

•all options outstanding at December 31, 2009 under earlier plans; and

•all remaining options, restricted stock units, and performance share units that could be granted under the Plan.

HOW WE ACCOUNT FOR SHARE-BASED AWARDS

We:



•use a fair-value-based measurement for share-based awards, and

•recognize the cost of share-based awards in our consolidated financial statements.

We recognize the cost of share-based awards in ourConsolidated Statement of Operationsover the required service period — generally the
period from the date of the grant to the date when it is vested. Special situations include:



•Awards that vest upon retirement — the required service period ends on the date an employee is eligible for retirement, including early
retirement.

•Awards that continue to vest following job elimination or the sale of a business — the required service period ends on the date the
employment from the company is terminated.

In these special situations, compensation expense from share-based awards
is recognized over a period that is shorter than the stated vesting period.

TAX BENEFITS OF SHARE-BASED AWARDS

Our total income tax benefit from share-based awards — as recognized in ourConsolidated Statement of Operations— for the last three
years was:



•$9 million in 2009,

•$19 million in 2008 and

•$12 million in 2007.



WEYERHAEUSER COMPANY>2009 ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K93






Tax benefits for
share-based awards are accrued as stock compensation expense is recognized in theConsolidated Statement of Operations. Tax benefits on share-based awards are realized when:



•restricted shares and restricted share units vest,

•performance shares and performance share units vest,

•stock options are exercised and

•stock appreciation rights are exercised.

When actual tax benefits realized exceed the tax benefits that were accrued for share-based awards, we realize an excess tax benefit. We report the excess tax benefit as financing cash inflows
rather than operating cash inflows. Our excess tax benefits were:



•$0 in 2009,

•$0 in 2008 and

•$51 million in 2007.

These items are shown as other financing activities on ourConsolidated Statement of Cash Flows.

TYPES OF
SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION

Our share-based compensation is in the form of:



•stock options,

•restricted stock units,

•performance share units,

•stock appreciation rights and

•deferred compensation stock equivalent units.

STOCK OPTIONS

We award stock options through the Plan. Stock options entitle
award recipients to purchase shares of our common stock at a fixed exercise price. We grant stock options with an exercise price equal to the market price of our stock on the date of the grant.

The Details

Our stock options
generally:



•vest over four years of continuous service and

•must be exercised within 10 years of the grant date.

Exceptions are that the stock options generally:



•vest upon retirement for employees aged 65 or older, or employees aged 62 – 64 with at least 10 years of service;

•continue to vest following retirement for employees ages 55 – 61 with at least 10 years of service; and

•continue to vest following involuntary termination due to job elimination or the sale of a business.



During first quarter 2009, we awarded selected executives with special
stock options that:



•vest at the end of four years of continuous service and

•must be exercised within ten years of the grant date.

During second quarter 2006, we awarded selected executives and other key employees with special stock options that:



•vested at the end of two years of continuous service and

•must be exercised within five years of the grant date.

Our Accounting

We use a Black-Scholes option-valuation model to estimate the
fair value of every stock option award on its grant date.

In our estimates, we use:



•historical data — for option exercise time and employee terminations;

•a Monte-Carlo simulation — for how long we expect granted options to be outstanding; and

•the U.S. Treasury yield curve — for the risk-free rate. We use a yield curve over a period matching the expected term of the grant.

The expected volatility in our valuation model is based on:



•implied volatilities from traded options on our stock,

•historical volatility of our stock and

•other factors.

Share-based compensation expense for stock options is generally recognized over the vesting period. There are exceptions for stock options awarded to
employees who:



•are eligible for retirement,

•will become eligible for retirement during the vesting period or

•whose employment is terminated during the vesting period due to job elimination or the sale of a business.









In these cases, we record
the share-based compensation expense over a required service period that is less than the stated vesting period.

Activity

In 2009, we granted 1,504,850 stock options at a weighted average exercise price of $25.29.

•$600,000 in 2008, related to the exercise of 68,000 options; and

•$131 million in 2007, related to the exercise of 5.6 million options.

RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS

Through
the Plan, we award restricted stock units — grants that entitle the holder to shares of our stock as the award vests.

The
Details

Our restricted stock units granted in 2007 and 2009 generally:



•vest over four years of continuous service; and

•are forfeited upon termination of employment for any reason, including retirement.

Our restricted stock units granted in 2008 generally:



•vest over four years of continuous service; and

•continue to vest in the event of retirement, including early retirement, or upon termination of employment due to job elimination or the sale of
a business.



Our Accounting

The fair value of our restricted stock units is the market price of our stock on the grant date of the awards.

We generally record share-based compensation expense for restricted stock units over the four-year vesting period. For restricted stock units granted
in 2008 that continue to vest following the termination of employment, we record the share- based compensation expense over a required service period that is less than the stated vesting period. For all other grant years, following termination of
employment, we reverse the expense related to the unvested portion of the award.

Activity

We awarded 238,344 restricted stock units at a weighted average fair value of $25.41 in 2009.

The following table shows our restricted stock unit activity for 2009.

Summary of Nonvested Restricted Stock Units for 2009

As restricted stock units vest, a portion of the shares awarded is withheld to cover employee taxes. As a result, the number of stock units vested and
the number of common shares issued will differ.

PERFORMANCE SHARE UNITS

Through the Plan, we awarded performance share units to selected executives and other key employees. These are grants that entitled the holder to
shares of our stock if required performance targets were met over a three-year period.

The Details

Every grant of performance share units had a target number of shares — with the final number of shares to be awarded ranging from 0 percent to
200 percent of the target, depending upon performance.

Performance targets were based on our financial performance ranking among a
selected peer group. The financial performance rankings considered were:



•return on net assets and

•cost of capital.



WEYERHAEUSER COMPANY>2009 ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K95






At the end of the
performance period, performance share unit payouts would be in shares of our stock, subject to the terms applicable to the awards.

Our Accounting

Certain conditions must be met to establish a grant date for accounting purposes. Our
performance-based awards did not meet all of these conditions due to discretion the Committee had over certain items that are included in the final determination of awards that were granted. As a result, we:



•remeasured the fair value of the performance share units at every reporting date,

•adjusted the number of shares expected to be awarded based on the probability of achieving the performance target and

•recognized compensation cost for performance share units over their three-year performance period.

Activity

No performance share
units were awarded in 2008 or 2009.

The performance period for the unvested Performance Share Units ended December 31, 2009. The minimum performance threshold was not met, and all
previously recognized compensation costs were reversed. Subsequent to year end, all unvested performance share unit awards were cancelled.

STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHTS

Through the Plan, we grant cash-settled stock appreciation rights as part of certain
compensation awards.

The Details

Stock appreciation rights are similar to stock options. Employees benefit when the market price of our stock is higher on the exercise date than it was on the date the stock appreciation rights were granted. The differences
are that the employee:



•receives the benefit as a cash award and

•does not purchase the underlying stock.



The vesting conditions and exceptions are the same as for 10-year stock options. Details are in the Stock Options section
earlier in this note.

Stock appreciation rights are generally issued to employees outside of the U.S.

Our Accounting

We use a
Black-Scholes option-valuation model to estimate the fair value of a stock appreciation right on its grant date and every subsequent reporting date that the right is outstanding. Stock appreciation rights are liability-classified awards and the fair
value is remeasured at every reporting date.

The process used to develop our valuation assumptions is the same as for the 10-year stock
options we grant. Details are in the Stock Options section earlier in this note.

•$0.1 million in 2008 and

•$9 million in 2007.

UNRECOGNIZED SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION

As of December 31, 2009, our unrecognized share-based compensation
cost for all types of share-based awards included:



•$25 million related to nonvested equity-classified share-based compensation arrangements — expected to be recognized over a weighted-average
period of approximately 1.77 years; and

•$1 million related to nonvested liability-classified stock appreciation rights — expected to vest over a weighted-average period of
approximately 1.3 years.

DEFERRED COMPENSATION STOCK EQUIVALENT UNITS

Certain employees and our board of directors can defer compensation into stock-equivalent units.

The Details

The plan works
differently for employees and directors.

Eligible employees:



•may choose to defer all or part of their bonus into stock-equivalent units and

•receive a 15 percent premium if the deferral is for at least five years.

Our directors:



•have a portion of their annual retainer fee automatically deferred into stock-equivalent units,

•may choose to defer some or all of the remainder of their annual retainer fee into stock-equivalent units and

•do not receive a premium for their deferrals.

Employees and directors also choose when the deferrals will be paid out although no deferrals may be paid until after the separation from service of the employee or director.



Our Accounting

We settle all deferred compensation accounts in cash. In addition, we credit all stock-equivalent accounts with dividend equivalents.

Stock-equivalent units are:



•liability-classified awards and

•remeasured to fair value at every reporting date.

The fair value of a stock-equivalent unit is equal to the market price of our stock.

Activity

The number of stock-equivalent units outstanding in our deferred compensation accounts was:



•430,789 as of December 31, 2009;

•427,233 as of December 31, 2008; and

•419,217 as of December 30, 2007.

WEYERHAEUSER COMPANY>2009 ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K97






RESTRUCTURING AND
CLOSURES

Our restructuring and closure charges were primarily related to the following:



•2009 — we closed or curtailed various Wood Products operations and restructured corporate staff functions to support achieving our
competitive performance goals.



•2008 — we reduced the number of employees after the sale of our Containerboard, Packaging and Recycling business and to support achieving
our competitive performance goals. In addition, we closed or curtailed various Wood Products operations.



•2007 — we restructured the administration facility in Kamloops, British Columbia, covering various business functions and restructured the
Wood Products segment.

Assessing Facilities for Closure, Curtailment or Sale

We evaluate operating facilities for closure or sale when they are not a long-term strategic fit for us or cannot achieve top-quartile performance
without significant capital investments.

We also continually assess our customers’ needs and change our operating posture to
efficiently and effectively meet those needs. In doing so, we consider changing market conditions or adjusting production levels at many of our operating facilities.



Actions related to the following operations, coupled with corporate restructuring, resulted in the majority of closure
and restructuring charges in 2009, 2008 and 2007:

Pension and
postretirement charges include a $76 million noncash pension charge during 2009 triggered by the amount of lump-sum distributions paid in 2009 to former employees — seeNote 8: Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Plansfor more
information.

Other restructuring and closure costs include lease termination charges, dismantling and demolition of plant and equipment,
gain or loss on disposition of assets, environmental cleanup costs and incremental costs to wind down operating facilities.

ACCRUED
TERMINATION BENEFITS

As of December 31, 2009, Weyerhaeuser’s accrued liabilities include approximately $20 million of
severance accruals related to restructuring and closure charges recognized during 2009.

ASSET IMPAIRMENTS

The
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and Goodwill sections ofNote 1: Summary of Significant Accounting Policiesprovide details about how we account for these impairments.

Long-Lived Assets

Our long-lived asset impairments were primarily related to
the following:



•2009 — charges for Wood Products facilities included $74 million related to engineered wood products facilities in Hazard, Kentucky and
Valdosta, Georgia. In addition, charges included $30 million related to corporate-region buildings and $11 million related to a lumber mill in Brazil. The fair values of the assets were determined using significant other observable inputs (Level 2)
based on market quotes and significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) based on discounted cash flow models.



•2008 — includes capitalized interest on Real Estate projects that were impaired for a charge of $69 million. In addition, charges for Wood
Products facilities included a $27 million charge related to the assets of the Trust Joist®Commercial division and $37 million related to oriented strand board
facilities in Drayton Valley, Alberta and Miramichi, New Brunswick.



•2007 — charges for Wood Products facilities included $47 million related to oriented strand board facilities in Miramichi, New
Brunswick, and Wawa, Ontario, a $17 million charge related to an engineered wood products facility in Colbert, Georgia, and a $10 million charge related to the Canadian distribution facilities.

Goodwill

Our impairments of
goodwill were primarily related to the following:



•2009 — the goodwill associated with the hardwoods and industrial wood products reporting unit.



•2008 — as a result of the collapse of financial markets in fourth quarter 2008, accompanied by accelerated deterioration of housing markets
and declining demand for pulp products in emerging Asian markets, the estimated fair value of certain of our reporting units fell below the carrying value of those units. This triggered the goodwill impairments in our Wood Products segment of $744
million and $94 million in our Cellulose Fibers segment during the fourth quarter.



•2007 — Canadian and certain U.S. building materials distribution centers resulting in a charge of $30 million.

NOTE 19: OTHER OPERATING COSTS (INCOME), NET

These costs (income):



•exclude our Real Estate operations,

•include both recurring and occasional income and expense items and

The $163 million pretax gain on sale of non-strategic timberlands resulted from the sale of 140,000 acres in northwestern Oregon in third quarter 2009.

The total pretax gain on the 2008 sale of our Australian operations was $218 million; $212 million was recorded in other operating
income, net and $6 million was recorded in equity in income of affiliates. The full $218 million is presented on theConsolidated Statement of Operationsas earnings from discontinued operations, net of taxes.

Foreign exchange (gains) losses result primarily from changes in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and the Canadian dollar.

Land management income includes income from recreational activities, land permits, grazing rights, firewood sales and other miscellaneous income
related to land management activities.

circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. These assets are stated at cost unless events or circumstances trigger an impairment review. If a triggering event occurs and the asset’s carrying amount is
not recoverable, we record an impairment loss, which is the difference between the asset’s book value and fair value. The determination of fair value is based on appraisals and market pricing of comparable assets when that information is
available, or the discounted value of estimated future net cash flows from these assets.

During 2008 and 2009, unfavorable market
conditions caused us to re-evaluate our strategy to develop certain projects, reduce sales prices, and increase customer incentives. The recoverability of our investments was reassessed, which triggered impairment charges. Asset impairments are
recorded as adjustments to the cost basis of inventory and investments. The Impairment of Long-Lived Assets section ofNote 1: Summary of Significant Accounting Policiesprovides details about how we account for impairments related to our
real estate in process of development and for sale.

The write-off of pre-acquisition and abandoned community costs includes forfeited deposits on options to purchase land and capitalized engineering and
related costs associated with the options. The charge for 2009 includes the write-off of 9 projects that were planned for development of approximately 5,000 residential lots. As of December 31, 2009, we have option agreements on approximately
63,000 residential lots.

In addition, abandoned community costs include the write-off of unamortized costs related to projects that have
been closed prior to full build-out or related to model complex costs written off due to decisions to sell active communities in their current condition or to change home styles offered within a community.

Impairments of investments and other related charges relate to loans and investments in unconsolidated entities.









In addition to the Real
Estate charges included above, Forest Products has recorded charges for the impairment of interest that previously was capitalized on Real Estate assets of $3 million, $69 million, and $0 in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. These charges are
classified as Forest Products charges for asset impairments in the accompanying Consolidated Statement of Operations

The number of real
estate projects owned or operated by us ranged from approximately 100 to 125 during 2009. This includes communities where we were actively building homes or developing land and land positions held for future development. The table below provides,
for each period indicated:



•the number of projects that were tested for recoverability as a result of triggering events that occurred during the period,

•the number of projects for which impairment charges were recognized in the period,

•the amount of real estate impairment charges attributable to Weyerhaeuser shareholders that were recognized in the period, and

•additional information about the fair value of assets impaired in the period.

Within a community that is held for development, there may be individual homes or parcels of land that are currently held for sale. Impairment charges
recognized as a result of adjusting individual held-for-sale assets within a community to estimated fair value less cost to sell are also included in the total impairment charges below. An individual project or held-for-sale asset may have been
tested for recoverability and impairment charges may have been recognized in more than one quarter during the year.

The significant unobservable inputs reported above are discounted future cash flows of the projects. We use present value techniques based on discounting the estimated cash flows using a rate commensurate with the inherent risk
associated with the assets and related estimated cash flow streams. Discount rates applied to the estimated future cash flows of our homebuilding assets for 2009 ranges from 12 percent to 25 percent. See “Management’s Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Critical Accounting Policies” for additional information regarding our evaluation of real estate impairments.

In 2008, we restructured our ownership interests in Uruguay as discussed inNote 7: Equity Affiliates. The restructuring resulted in the
recognition of a $250 million noncash gain for financial accounting purposes related to the partitioning of assets of a joint venture among joint venture partners. There is no tax provision on the gain, primarily due to a forestry exemption from
income taxes in Uruguay, and the assets are considered indefinitely invested.

In 2008, the company recognized goodwill-impairment
charges as discussed inNote 18: Charges for Forest Products Restructuring, Closures and Asset Impairmentsdue to the estimated fair value of certain reporting units falling below the carrying value of those units. These charges are not
deductible for income tax purposes and represent a permanent book-tax difference. As a result, no tax benefit has been recognized for these charges.

In addition, timber provisions in the Food, Conservation and Energy Act of 2008 enacted May 22, 2008, resulted in a tax benefit of $57 million. The provision is effective for one year and reduces the capital gains tax rate on
qualified timber sales from 35 percent to 15 percent.

One-Time Deferred Tax Benefits/Charges

There were no one-time deferred tax benefits or charges during 2008 or 2009.

During 2007, we recorded a:



•$22 million benefit related to a reduction in the Canadian federal income tax rate and

•$9 million charge related to the Flat Rate Business Tax Reform in Mexico.

DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES

Deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect temporary differences between pretax book income and taxable income. Deferred tax assets represent tax benefits that have already been recorded for book purposes but will be recorded for
tax purposes in the future. Deferred tax liabilities represent income that has been recorded for book purposes but will be reported as taxable income in the future.

Our net deferred tax liabilities were approximately $1.1 billion at the end of 2009.

OTHER INFORMATION ABOUT OUR DEFERRED INCOME TAX ASSETS (LIABILITIES)

Other information about our deferred income tax assets (liabilities) include:



•net operating loss carryforwards,

•changes in tax rates and tax laws,

•valuation allowances and

•reinvestment of undistributed earnings.

Net Operating Loss Carryforwards

Our state and foreign net operating loss
carryforwards as of the end of 2009 are as follows:



•$1.4 billion, which expire from 2010 through 2029; and

•$115 million, which do not expire.

Changes in Tax Rates and Tax Laws

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are based on tax rates that are
expected to be in effect in future periods when deferred items reverse. Changes in tax rates or tax laws affect the expected future tax benefit or expense. The effect of such changes that occurred during each of the last three fiscal years is
included in “Tax Law Changes” disclosed under “Effective Income Tax Rate” above.



Valuation Allowances

With the exception of the valuation allowance discussed
below, we believe it is more likely than not that we will have sufficient future taxable income to realize our deferred tax assets.

Our
valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets was $103 million as of the end of 2009.

Total changes in our valuation allowance
over the last year were:



•$15 million net increase in 2009. This net increase resulted primarily from:

–$9 million increase due to foreign exchange;

–$4 million increase due to the change in expectations of future use of state credits and net operating loss carryforwards; and

–$2 million increase due to additional foreign losses.

Reinvestment of Undistributed Earnings

We have approximately $39 million in
undistributed earnings from our foreign subsidiaries as of the end of 2009. We have reinvested our foreign undistributed earnings; therefore they are not subject to U.S. income taxes. It is not practical to determine the income tax liability that
would result from repatriation, however due to the available foreign tax credits, repatriation is not expected to result in a material U.S. tax liability.

HOW WE ACCOUNT FOR INCOME TAXES

The Income Taxes section ofNote 1: Summary of Significant Accounting
Policiesprovides details about how we account for our income taxes.

UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS

Unrecognized tax benefits represent potential future funding obligations to taxing authorities if uncertain tax positions we have taken on previously
filed tax returns are not sustained. The total amount of unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31, 2009, and December 31, 2008, are $170 million and $114 million, respectively, which does not include related interest of $23 million
and $22 million, respectively. These amounts represent the gross amount of exposure in individual jurisdictions and do not reflect any additional benefits expected to be realized if such positions were not sustained, such as the federal deduction
that could be realized if an unrecognized state deduction was not sustained.

The net liability recorded in ourConsolidated Balance Sheetrelated to unrecognized tax benefits was $132 million as of December 31, 2009,
and $65 million as of December 31, 2008, which includes interest of $22 million and $21 million respectively.

The net
liability recorded for tax positions across all jurisdictions that, if sustained, would affect our effective tax rate was $96 million as of December 31, 2009, and $33 million as of December 31, 2008, which includes interest of $22 million
and $21 million, respectively.

In accordance with our accounting policy, we accrue interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax
benefits as a component of income tax expense and current taxes payable.

As of December 31, 2009, our 2007 federal income tax audit
is complete and is scheduled to go to appeals in 2010. We are also undergoing examination in various state and foreign jurisdictions for the 2005–2008 tax years. We expect that the outcome of any examination will not have a material effect on
our consolidated financial statements; however, audit outcomes and the timing of audit settlements are subject to significant uncertainty.

During 2008, we settled audits for the tax years 2005 and 2006. These settlements resulted in a $21 million reduction in our net liability.

In the next 12 months, we estimate a decrease of up to $6 million in unrecognized tax benefits on several individually insignificant tax positions due to the lapse of applicable statutes of limitation in multiple
jurisdictions.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM



The Board of Directors and Shareholders

Weyerhaeuser Company:

We have audited Weyerhaeuser Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2009, based on criteria established inInternal Control — Integrated Frameworkissued by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Weyerhaeuser Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control
over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our
audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal
control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other
procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A
company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect
the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may
become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In
our opinion, Weyerhaeuser Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2009, based on criteria established inInternal Control — Integrated Frameworkissued by
the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of Weyerhaeuser Company and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2009 and 2008, and the related consolidated statements of operations, cash flows, and changes
in equity and comprehensive income for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2009, and our report dated February 25, 2010 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements.
