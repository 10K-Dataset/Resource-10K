Item 1 — Business

General

NRG Energy, Inc., or NRG or the Company, is a leading integrated power company built on the strength of a diverse competitive electric generation portfolio and leading retail electricity platform.  NRG aims to create a sustainable energy future by producing, selling and delivering electricity and related products and services in major competitive power markets in the U.S. in a manner that delivers value to all of NRG's stakeholders. The Company owns and operates approximately30,000MW of generation; engages in the trading of wholesale energy, capacity and related products; transacts in and trades fuel and transportation services; and directly sells energy, services, and innovative, sustainable products and services to retail customers under the names “NRG”, "Reliant" and other retail brand names owned by NRG. NRG was incorporated as a Delaware corporation on May 29, 1992.

Strategy

NRG's strategy is to maximize stockholder value through the safe production and sale of reliable power to its customers in the markets served by the Company, while positioning the Company to provide fully integrated solutions to the end-use energy consumer. This strategy is intended to enable the Company to create and maintain growth at reasonable margins while de-risking the Company in terms of reduced and mitigated exposure to cyclical commodity price risk. At the same time, the Company's relentless commitment to safety for its employees, customers and partners continues unabated.

To effectuate the Company’s strategy, NRG is focused on: (i) excellence in operating performance of its existing assets including repowering its power generation assets at premium sites and optimal hedging of generation assets and retail load operations; (ii) serving the energy needs of end-use residential, commercial and industrial customers in competitive markets through multiple brands and channels with a variety of retail energy products and services differentiated by innovative features, premium service, sustainability, and loyalty/affinity programs; (iii) deploying innovative and renewable energy solutions for consumers within its retail businesses; and (iv) engaging in a proactive capital allocation plan focused on achieving the regular return of and on stockholder capital within the dictates of prudent balance sheet management, including reducing consolidated debt and pursuing selective acquisitions, joint ventures, divestitures and investments.










Transformation Plan

NRG is in the process of executing its Transformation Plan, which is designed to significantly strengthen earnings and cost competitiveness, lower risk and volatility, and create significant shareholder value. The Company expects to fully implement the Transformation Plan by the end of 2020 with significant completion by the end of 2018. The three-part, three-year plan is comprised of the following targets and the Company's progress toward achieving such targets are as follows:





Operations and cost excellence

Cost savings and margin enhancement of $1,065 million recurring, which consists of $590 million of annual cost savings, a $215 million net margin enhancement program, $50 million annual reduction in maintenance capital expenditures, and $210 million in permanent selling, general and administrative expense reduction associated with asset sales.

• During the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company realized annual cost savings of $150 million.

Portfolio optimization

Targeting up to $3.2 billion of asset sale cash proceeds, including divestitures of 6 GWs of conventional generation and businesses (excluding GenOn) and the expected monetization of 100% of its interest in NRG Yield, Inc. and its renewables platform.

• On February 6, 2018, NRG announced agreements to sell (i) NRG's full ownership interest in NRG Yield, Inc. and NRG's renewables platform, a 3,440 MW portfolio, for cash of $1.375 billion, subject to certain adjustments; and (ii) NRG's South Central business, a 3,555 MW portfolio of generation assets, for cash of $1.0 billion, subject to certain adjustments. The transactions are subject to customary closing conditions and are expected to close in the second half of 2018.• Also on February 6, 2018, NRG entered into agreements with NRG Yield, Inc. to sell Carlsbad Energy Center, a 527 MW natural gas fired project, for cash of $365 million, subject to certain adjustments, and Buckthorn Solar, a 154 MW solar facility, for cash of $42 million, subject to certain adjustments.• On February 23, 2018, NRG entered into an agreement to sell BETM for $70 million. The transaction is subject to customary closing conditions and is expected to close in the second half of 2018.• In 2017, NRG executed asset sales of 322 MW for aggregate cash of $150 million, which includes sales to NRG Yield, Inc. and sale of Minnesota wind projects to third parties.

Capital structure and allocation enhancement

A prioritized capital allocation strategy that targets a reduction in consolidated debt from approximately $19.5 billion ($18 billion net debt) to approximately $6.5 billion ($6 billion net debt). Following the completion of the contemplated asset sales, the Company expects approximately $5.3 billion in excess cash to be available for allocation through 2020, after achieving its targeted 3.0x net debt / Adjusted EBITDA corporate credit ratio.

• During 2017, NRG reduced its net corporate debt by $604 million.• Expected reduction in non-recourse debt related to the sale of NRG's ownership in NRG Yield, Inc. and the NRG renewables platform and the sales of Carlsbad Energy Center and Buckthorn Solar, which represented $7.1 billion as of December 31, 2017.

Working Capital and Costs to Achieve

The Company expects to realize (i) $370 million of non-recurring working capital improvements through 2020, and (ii) approximately $290 million one-time costs to achieve.

• During 2017, NRG realized $221 million of working capital improvements and $44 million of one-time costs to achieve.










Business Overview

As of December 31, 2017, the Company’s core businesses include (i) wholesale conventional generation, (ii) retail electricity for residential and commercial, including personal power solutions and Business Solutions, which includes C&I customers and other distributed and reliability products (included in the Retail segment, effective in January 2017), (iii) contracted generation owned by NRG Yield, Inc. (included in the NRG Yield segment) and (iv) renewable utility scale and distributed generation assets that are constructed or in development and that are not otherwise owned by NRG Yield, Inc. (included in the Renewables segment). On June 14, 2017, NRG deconsolidated GenOn for financial reporting purposes as a result of the GenOn bankruptcy filings.

Generation

The Company’s wholesale power generation business includes plant operations, commercial operations, EPC, energy services and other critical related functions. In addition to the traditional functions, the wholesale power generation business also includes NRG’s conventional distributed generation business, consisting of reliability, combined heat and power and large-scale distributed generation.

The wholesale generation business is capital-intensive and commodity-driven with numerous industry participants that compete on the basis of the location of their plants, fuel mix, plant efficiency and the reliability of the services offered. The Company has a diversified power generation portfolio, with approximately28,000MW of fossil fuel and nuclear generation capacity at51plants as ofDecember 31, 2017.  The Company's power generation assets are diversified by fuel-type, dispatch level and region, which helps mitigate the risks associated with fuel price volatility and market demand cycles.  NRG's U.S. baseload and intermediate facilities provide the Company with a significant source of cash flow, while its peaking facilities provide NRG with opportunities to capture significant upside potential that can arise during periods of high demand, which typically drive higher energy prices. As ofDecember 31, 2017, less than 25% of the Company's consolidated operating revenues were derived from coal-fired operating assets. As noted above, the Company expects to sell its 3,555 MW South Central business in the second half of 2018.

Wholesale power generation is a regional business that is currently highly fragmented and diverse in terms of industry structure. As such, there is a wide variation in terms of the capabilities, resources, nature and identities of the companies the Company competes with depending on the market. Competitors include regulated utilities, municipalities, cooperatives, other independent power producers, and power marketers or trading companies, including those owned by financial institutions.  Many of the Company's generation assets, however, are located within densely populated areas that tend to have higher wholesale pricing as a result of relatively favorable local supply-demand balance.  The Company has generation assets located in or near major metropolitan areas. The Company believes that its extensive generation portfolio provides asset optimization opportunities. The Company currently has over500MW targeted for repowering initiatives, all of which are under development or construction. In addition, the Company evaluates opportunities for new generation, on both a merchant and contracted basis.

Retail

Retail provides energy and related services to residential, industrial and commercial consumers through various brands and sales channels across the U.S. In2017, Retail delivered approximately63TWhs and served approximately2.9 millioncustomers. Retail's results make it one of the largest competitive energy retailers in the U.S. The majority of Retail's sales come in the competitive retail energy markets of Texas, Pennsylvania, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York and Ohio, as well as the District of Columbia. Retail's brands collectively are the largest providers of electricity in Texas.

Residential and small commercial (Mass Market) consumers make purchase decisions based on a variety of factors, including price, customer service, brand, product choices and value-added features.  These consumers purchase products through a variety of sales channels, including direct sales, call centers, websites, brokers and brick-and-mortar stores.  Through its broad range of service offerings and value propositions, Retail is able to attract, retain, and increase the value of its customer relationships. Retail's brands are recognized for exemplary customer service, innovative smart energy and technology product offerings and environmentally friendly solutions.










Included in Retail is the Company's Business Solutions group, which includes demand response, commodity sales, energy efficiency and energy management solutions. An integrated provider of supply and distributed energy resources, Business Solutions focuses on distributed products and services as businesses seek greater reliability, cleaner power or other benefits that they cannot obtain from the grid.  These solutions include system power, distributed generation, solar and wind products, carbon management and specialty services, backup generation, storage and distributed solar, demand response and energy efficiency and advisory services. In providing on-site energy solutions, the Company often benefits from its ability to supply energy products from its wholesale generation portfolio to commercial and industrial retail customers. In 2017, Business Solutions delivered approximately 21 TWhs of electricity and managed approximately 1,500 MWs of demand response positions across its portfolio.

Renewables and NRG Yield

As described above, NRG expects to sell its Renewables operating and development platform and its full ownership interest in NRG Yield, Inc. in the second half of 2018. The following description reflects the historical view of these businesses as a part of NRG’s business strategy through its announcement of the Transformation Plan in 2017.

Renewables

The Company’s renewables business focuses on the acquisition, development and operation and maintenance of utility scale wind and solar, community solar and distributed solar generation assets as well as the management and operations of the renewable generation assets owned by NRG Yield, Inc. In2017, the Company acquired 209 MW of utility scale solar and wind projects and 82 MW of distributed generation and community solar projects that are currently under development or in operation across three states.  The renewables business has in-house expertise that covers the full spectrum of development capabilities to execute on utility, distributed generation, and community solar projects. The asset management and operations and maintenance groups within the renewables business manage a portfolio of wind and solar assets across 27 states, serving as the primary commercial asset manager on the vast majority of assets owned by NRG and NRG Yield, Inc. In addition, the operations and maintenance group self-performs plant operations on 2,689 MW of the consolidated fleet of assets owned by NRG and NRG Yield, Inc. and 224 MW of assets owned by third parties.

The utility wind and solar generation business targets strategic partnerships with utilities, municipalities and large national corporations for offsite wind and solar solutions. The distributed solar business targets partnerships with companies, municipalities, schools and communities to provide on-site and virtual net metering off-site renewable generation.  The community solar business targets relationships with companies and municipalities as well as residential homeowners to provide off-site solar generation under community solar regulations and tariffs. In addition to assets in operation, as ofDecember 31, 2017, the Company held a backlog of in-construction, contracted and awarded projects of 1,500 MW, and a pipeline of 5,742 MW across the utility, community solar and distributed solar renewables markets.

The renewables business also competes for new generation opportunities through both RFPs and bilateral solicitations. The renewables business selects markets and projects based on resource relative to the value of the power, while seeking to make use of NRG capabilities in a competitive landscape. The number and type of competitors vary based on location, generation type, project size and counterparty.  The renewables business competes with traditional utilities as well as companies that provide products and services in the downstream solar and wind energy value chains.

NRG Yield

NRG Yield, Inc. is a publicly-traded, dividend growth-oriented company that has historically served as the primary vehicle through which NRG owns, operates and acquires diversified contracted renewable and conventional generation and thermal infrastructure assets.  As ofDecember 31, 2017, NRG owns a55.1%voting interest in the outstanding common stock of NRG Yield, Inc. and receives distributions from NRG Yield LLC through its 46.3% ownership of Class B and Class D units. NRG Yield, Inc.’s contracted generation portfolio collectively represents5,118net MW as ofDecember 31, 2017. Each of the assets sells most of its output pursuant to long-term, fixed-price offtake agreements with creditworthy counterparties. NRG Yield, Inc. also owns thermal infrastructure assets with an aggregate steam and chilled water capacity of1,319net MWt and electric generation capacity of123net MW. These thermal infrastructure assets provide steam, hot water and/or chilled water, and in some instances electricity, to commercial businesses, universities, hospitals and governmental units in multiple locations, principally through long-term contracts or pursuant to rates regulated by state utility commissions.










GenOn Chapter 11 Cases

As disclosed in Item 15 -Note 1,Nature of Business, to the Consolidated Financial Statements, on June 14, 2017, or the Petition Date, GenOn, along with GenOn Americas Generation and certain of their directly and indirectly-owned subsidiaries, or collectively the GenOn Entities, filed voluntary petitions for relief under Chapter 11, or the Chapter 11 Cases, of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, or the Bankruptcy Code, in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Texas, Houston Division, or the Bankruptcy Court. GenOn Mid-Atlantic, as well as its consolidated subsidiaries, REMA and certain other subsidiaries, did not file for relief under Chapter 11.

As a result of the bankruptcy filings and beginning on June 14, 2017, GenOn and its subsidiaries were deconsolidated from NRG’s consolidated financial statements. NRG recorded its investment in GenOn under the cost method with an estimated fair value ofzero. NRG determined that this disposal of GenOn and its subsidiaries is a discontinued operation; and, accordingly, the financial information for all historical periods has been recast to reflect GenOn as a discontinued operation.  In connection with the disposal, NRG recorded a loss on deconsolidation of$208 millionduring the quarter ended June 30, 2017, which is included within the total loss from discontinued operations of$789 millionfor the year endedDecember 31, 2017. SeeNote 3,Discontinued Operations, Acquisitions and Dispositions, for more information. In addition, upon GenOn's emergence from bankruptcy, the Company will recognize an estimated $9.5 billion worthless stock deduction for tax purposes.



On June 29, 2017, the GenOn Entities filed the initial plan of reorganization and the disclosure statement with the Bankruptcy Court consistent with the Restructuring Support Agreement. On September 18, 2017 and October 2, 2017, the GenOn Entities filed amendments to the plan of reorganization and the disclosure statement which primarily provided the GenOn Entities with the flexibility to complete sales of certain assets pursuant to the amended plan of reorganization and removed the GenOn Entities' requirement to conduct a rights offering in connection with the GenOn Entities' exit financing.

On October 31, 2017, the GenOn Entities announced that they entered into a Consent Agreement with certain holders of GenOn’s Senior Notes and GenOn Americas Generation's Senior Notes, collectively, the Consenting Holders, whereby the GenOn Entities and the Consenting Holders agreed to extend the milestones in the Restructuring Support Agreement, by which the plan of reorganization must become effective, or the Effective Date.  Specifically, the Consent Agreement extended the Effective Date milestone to June 30, 2018 or September 30, 2018, if regulatory approvals are still pending, or the Extended Effective Dates.

On December 12, 2017, the Bankruptcy Court entered an order confirming the plan of reorganization, and effective December 12, 2017, GenOn and NRG entered into agreements concerning (i) timeline and transition, (ii) cooperation and co-development matters, (iii) post-employment and retiree health and welfare benefits and pension benefits, (iv) tax matters, and (v) intercompany balances, consistent with the Restructuring Support Agreement, which among other things, provide for the transition of GenOn to a standalone enterprise, resolution of substantial intercompany claims between GenOn and NRG, and the allocation of certain costs and liabilities between GenOn and NRG. The principal terms of these agreements are described further inNote 3,Discontinued Operations, Acquisitions and Dispositions.On December 12, 2017, the Bankruptcy Court also entered an order giving effect to the Consent Agreement.

(k)  On February 6, 2018, NRG announced the sale of its full ownership in NRG Yield, Inc. and its Renewables operating and development platform, which represents 3,440 MW.

NRG's portfolio diversification and commercial operations hedging strategy provides the Company with reliable future cash flows.NRG has hedged a portion of its coal and nuclear capacity with decreasing hedge levels through2021.  In addition, NRG's capacity revenues not only enhance the reliability of future cash flows but are not correlated to natural gas prices. As ofDecember 31, 2017, the Company had purchased fuel forward under fixed price contracts, with contractually-specified price escalators, for approximately41%of its expected coal requirement from2018to2021.  The Company enters into additional hedges when it believes market conditions are favorable.

The Company also has the advantage of being able to supply its retail businesses with its own generation, which can reduce the need to sell and buy power from other institutions and intermediaries, resulting in lower transaction costs and credit exposures.  This combination of generation and retail allows for a reduction in actual and contingent collateral, through offsetting transactions and by reducing the need to hedge the retail power supply through third parties.

The generation and retail combination also provides stability in cash flows, as changes in commodity prices generally have offsetting impacts between the two businesses.  The offsetting nature of generation and retail, in relation to changes in market prices, is an integral part of NRG's goal of providing a reliable source of future cash flow for the Company.

When developing new renewable and conventional power generation facilities, NRG typically secures long-term PPAs, which insulate the Company from commodity market volatility and provide future cash flow stability.  These PPAs are typically contracted with high credit quality local utilities and typically have durations from10 yearsto as much as25 years.










Commercial Operations Overview

NRG seeks to maximize profitability and manage cash flow volatility through the marketing, trading and sale of energy, capacity and ancillary services into spot, intermediate and long-term markets and through the active management and trading of emissions allowances, fuel supplies and transportation-related services.  The Company's principal objectives are the realization of the full market value of its asset base, including the capture of its extrinsic value, the management and mitigation of commodity market risk and the reduction of cash flow volatility over time.

NRG enters into power sales and hedging arrangements via a wide range of products and contracts, including PPAs, fuel supply contracts, capacity auctions, natural gas derivative instruments and other financial instruments. In addition, because changes in power prices in the markets where NRG operates are generally correlated to changes in natural gas prices, NRG uses hedging strategies that may include power and natural gas forward sales contracts to manage the commodity price risk primarily associated with the Company's coal and nuclear generation assets. The objective of these hedging strategies is to stabilize the cash flow generated by NRG's portfolio of assets.

In addition to power sales and hedging arrangements, NRG trades electric power, natural gas and related commodity and financial products, including forwards, futures, options and swaps. The Company seeks to generate profits from volatility in the price of electricity, capacity, fuels and transmission congestion by buying and selling contracts in wholesale markets under guidelines approved by the Company's risk management committee.

Capacity and Other Contracted Revenue Sources

NRG's revenues and cash flows benefit from capacity/demand payments and other contracted revenue sources, originating from market clearing capacity prices, Resource Adequacy contracts, tolling arrangements, PPAs and other long-term contractual arrangements:

•Capacity auctions— The Company's largest sources of capacity revenues are capacity auctions in PJM, ISO-NE, and NYISO.  Both ISO-NE and PJM operate a pay-for-performance model where capacity payments are modified based on real-time performance, where NRG's actual revenues will be the combination of revenues based on the cleared auction MWs plus the net of any over- and under-performance of NRG's fleet. In addition, MISO has an annual auction, known as the Planning Resource Auction, or PRA. The Gulf Coast assets situated in the MISO market may participate in this auction.

•Resource adequacy and bilateral contracts— In California, there is a resource adequacy requirement that is primarily satisfied through bilateral contracts. Such bilateral contracts are typically short-term resource adequacy contracts. When bilateral contracting does not satisfy the resource adequacy need, such shortfalls can be addressed through procurement tools administered by the CAISO, including the capacity procurement mechanism or reliability must-run contracts. In addition, NRG earns demand payments from its long-term full-requirements load contracts with nine Louisiana distribution cooperatives, which expire in 2025. Demand payments from the current long-term contracts are tied to summer peak demand and provide a mechanism for recovering a portion of the costs associated with new or changed environmental laws or regulations. In Texas, capacity and contracted revenues are through bilateral contracts with load serving entities.

•Long-term PPAs— Output from the majority of renewable energy assets and certain conventional energy plants is sold through long-term PPAs and tolling agreements to a single counterparty, which is often a utility or commercial customer.












Fuel Supply and Transportation

NRG's fuel requirements consist of various forms of fossil fuel (including coal, natural gas and oil) and nuclear fuel. The prices of fossil fuels are highly volatile. The Company obtains its fossil fuels from multiple suppliers and through multiple transporters. Although availability is generally not an issue, localized shortages, transportation availability, delays arising from extreme weather conditions and supplier financial stability issues can and do occur.  The preceding factors related to the sources and availability of raw materials are fairly uniform across the Company's businesses and fuel products used.

Coal— The Company believes it is adequately hedged, using forward coal supply agreements, for its domestic coal consumption for2018.  NRG actively manages its coal requirements based on forecasted generation, market volatility and its inventory on site.  As ofDecember 31, 2017, NRG had purchased forward contracts to provide fuel for approximately41%of the Company's expected requirements from2018through2021, including expected coal inventory draw down.  NRG purchased approximately21 milliontons of coal in2017, almost all of which was Powder River Basin coal. For fuel transport, NRG has entered into various rail and barge transportation and rail car lease agreements with varying tenures that provide for most of the Company's transportation requirements of Powder River Basin coal for the next4 years.

The following table shows the percentage of the Company's coal requirements from2018through2021that have been purchased forward as ofDecember 31, 2017:

Natural Gas— NRG operates a fleet of mid-merit and peaking natural gas plants across all its U.S. wholesale regions.  Fuel needs are managed on a spot basis, especially for peaking assets, as the Company does not believe it is prudent to forward purchase natural gas for these types of units, the dispatch of which is highly unpredictable. The Company contracts for natural gas storage services as well as natural gas transportation services to deliver natural gas when needed.

Nuclear Fuel— STP's owners satisfy their fuel supply requirements by: (i) acquiring uranium concentrates and contracting for conversion of the uranium concentrates into uranium hexafluoride; (ii) contracting for enrichment of uranium hexafluoride; and (iii) contracting for fabrication of nuclear fuel assemblies. Through its proportionate participation in STPNOC, which is the NRC-licensed operator of STP and responsible for all aspects of fuel procurement, NRG is party to a number of long-term forward purchase contracts with many of the world's largest suppliers covering STP's requirements for uranium concentrates with only approximately 25% of STP's requirements outstanding for the duration of the original operating license.  Similarly, NRG is party to long-term contracts to procure STP's requirements for conversion and enrichment services and fuel fabrication for the life of the operating license. Since the operating license was renewed for another 20 years in September 2017, STPNOC has begun to review a second phase of fuel purchasing.

Retail Operations

In2017, NRG's retail businesses sold electricity to residential, commercial and industrial consumers at either fixed, indexed or variable prices.  Residential and smaller commercial consumers typically contract for terms ranging from one month to five years while industrial contracts are often between one year and five years in length.  In2017, NRG's retail businesses sold approximately63TWhs of electricity. In any given year, the quantity of TWhs sold can be affected by weather, economic conditions and competition.  The wholesale supply is typically purchased as the load is contracted from a combination of NRG's wholesale portfolio and other third parties.  The ability to choose supply from the market or the Company's portfolio allows for an optimal combination to support and stabilize retail margins.










Operational Statistics

The following are industry statistics for the Company's fossil and nuclear plants, as defined by the NERC, and are more fully described below:

Annual Equivalent Availability Factor, or EAF— Measures the percentage of maximum generation available over time as the fraction of net maximum generation that could be provided over a defined period of time after all types of outages and deratings, including seasonal deratings, are taken into account.

Net Heat Rate— The net heat rate represents the total amount of fuel in BTU required to generate one net kWh provided.

Net Capacity Factor— The net amount of electricity that a generating unit produces over a period of time divided by the net amount of electricity it could have produced if it had run at full power over that time period. The net amount of electricity produced is the total amount of electricity generated minus the amount of electricity used during generation.

The tables below present these performance metrics for the Company's global power generation portfolio, including leased facilities and those accounted for through equity method investments, for the years endedDecember 31, 2017and2016:

Segment Review

The Company's segment structure reflects how management currently makes financial decisions and allocates resources. Effective January 2017, the Company's businesses are segregated as follows: Generation , which includes generation, international and BETM; Retail which includes Mass customers and Business Solutions, which includes C&I customers and other distributed and reliability products; Renewables, which includes solar and wind assets, excluding those in NRG Yield; NRG Yield; and corporate activities. Intersegment sales are accounted for at market. The Company has recast data from prior periods to reflect changes in reportable segments to conform to the current year presentation.

During 2017, NRG Yield acquired several projects totaling 555 MW for cash consideration of approximately $245 million from NRG. These acquisitions were accounted for as transfers of entities under common control and accordingly, all historical periods have been recast to reflect this change.

On June 14, 2017, NRG deconsolidated GenOn for financial reporting purposes. The financial information for all historical periods have been recast to present GenOn as discontinued operations within the corporate segment.

Seasonality and Price Volatility

Annual and quarterly operating results of the Company's wholesale power generation segments can be significantly affected by weather, including wind resource availability, and energy commodity price volatility.  Significant other events, such as the demand for natural gas, interruptions in fuel supply infrastructure and relative levels of hydroelectric capacity can increase seasonal fuel and power price volatility.  The preceding factors related to seasonality and price volatility are fairly uniform across the Company's wholesale generation business segments.

The sale of electric power to retail customers is also a seasonal business with the demand for power generally peaking during the summer months.  As a result, net working capital requirements for the Company's retail operations generally increase during summer months along with the higher revenues, and then decline during off-peak months.  Weather may impact operating results and extreme weather conditions could materially affect results of operations.  The rates charged to retail customers may be impacted by fluctuations in total power prices and market dynamics like the price of natural gas, transmission constraints, competitor actions, and changes in market heat rates.

Market Framework

Organized Energy Markets in CAISO, ERCOT, ISO-NE, MISO, NYISO and PJM

The majority of NRG's fleet operates in one of the organized energy markets, known as RTOs or ISOs. Each organized market administers day-ahead and real-time centralized bid-based energy and ancillary services markets pursuant to tariffs approved by FERC, or in the case of ERCOT, market rules approved by the PUCT.  These tariffs and rules dictate how the energy markets operate, how market participants make bilateral sales with one another, and how entities with market-based rates are compensated.  Established prices reflect the value of energy at the specific location and time it is delivered, which is known as the Locational Marginal Price, or LMP.  Each market is subject to market mitigation measures designed to limit the exercise of locational market power.  These market structures facilitate NRG's sale of power and capacity products at market-based rates.

Other than ERCOT, each of the ISO regions also operates a capacity or resource adequacy market that provides an opportunity for generating and demand response resources to earn revenues to offset their fixed costs that are not recovered in the energy and ancillary services markets.  The ISOs are also responsible for transmission planning and operations.

Gulf Coast

NRG's Gulf Coast wholesale power generation business is located in the ERCOT and MISO markets.  The ERCOT market is one of the nation's largest and historically fastest growing power markets.  ERCOT is an energy only market, and has implemented market rule changes to provide pricing more reflective of higher energy value when operating reserves are scarce or constrained.  NRG also operates generation assets that are located within MISO, participating in the MISO day-ahead and real-time energy and ancillary services markets. Additionally, MISO employs a one-year forward resource adequacy construct, in which capacity resources can compete for fixed cost recovery in the capacity auction.  NRG continues to provide full requirements service to LSEs, including cooperatives and municipalities in the MISO region.












East/West

NRG's generation and demand response assets located in the East region of the U.S. are within the control areas of ISO-NE, NYISO and PJM.  Each of the market regions in the East region provides for robust competition in the day-ahead and real-time energy and ancillary services markets.  Additionally, the East region receives a significant portion of its revenues from capacity markets in ISO-NE, NYISO and PJM.  PJM and ISO-NE use a three-year forward capacity auction, while NYISO uses a month-ahead capacity auction.  Capacity market prices are sensitive to design parameters, as well as additions of new capacity.  Both ISO-NE and PJM operate a pay-for-performance model where capacity payments are modified based on real-time generator performance.  In such markets, NRG’s actual revenues will be the combination of cleared auction prices times the quantity of MWs cleared, plus the net of any over-performance “bonus payments” and any under-performance charges. In both markets, bidding rules allow for the incorporation of a risk premium into generator bids.

In the West region, NRG operates a fleet of natural gas fired facilities located entirely within the CAISO footprint.  The CAISO operates day-ahead and real-time locational markets for energy and ancillary services, while managing congestion primarily through nodal prices.  The CAISO system facilitates NRG's sale of power, ancillary services and capacity products at market-based rates, either within the CAISO's centralized energy and ancillary service markets or bilaterally pursuant to tolling arrangements or other capacity sales with California's LSEs.  The CPUC also determines capacity requirements for LSEs and for specified local areas utilizing inputs from the CAISO.  Both the CAISO and CPUC rules require LSEs to contract with sufficient generation resources in order to maintain minimum levels of generation within defined local areas.  Additionally, the CAISO has independent authority to contract with needed resources under certain circumstances, typically either when LSEs have failed to procure sufficient resources, or system conditions change unexpectedly.

Renewables

NRG operates a fleet of utility scale and distributed renewable generating assets across the U.S.  Many states have implemented their own renewable portfolio standards requiring LSEs to provide a given percentage of their energy sales from renewable resources.  As a result, a number of LSEs have entered into long-term PPAs with NRG's utility scale renewable generating facilities.  There are examples of states increasing their RPS from initially stated levels, such as California’s50%RPS by 2030 and Hawaii’s goal of achieving100%renewables by 2045. In addition, given the cost competitiveness of renewables, LSEs are procuring renewables in excess of their RPS obligations. In December 2015, the U.S. Congress extended the30%solar ITC so that projects which begin construction in 2016 through 2019 will continue to qualify for the30%ITC.  Projects beginning construction in 2020 and 2021 will be eligible for the ITC at the rates of26%and22%, respectively.  The same legislation also extended the10-yearwind PTC for wind projects which begin construction in years 2016 through 2019.  Wind projects which begin construction in the years 2017, 2018 and 2019 are eligible for PTC at80%,60%and40%of the statutory rate per kWh, respectively.

Retail










Regulatory Matters

As owners of power plants and participants in wholesale and retail energy markets, certain NRG entities are subject to regulation by various federal and state government agencies.  These include the CFTC, FERC, NRC and the PUCT, as well as other public utility commissions in certain states where NRG's generating, thermal, or distributed generation assets are located.  In addition, NRG is subject to the market rules, procedures and protocols of the various ISO and RTO markets in which it participates.  Likewise, certain NRG entities participating in the retail markets are subject to rules and regulations established by the states in which NRG entities are licensed to sell at retail.  NRG must also comply with the mandatory reliability requirements imposed by NERC and the regional reliability entities in the regions where NRG operates.

NRG's operations within the ERCOT footprint are not subject to rate regulation by FERC, as they are deemed to operate solely within the ERCOT market and not in interstate commerce.  These operations are subject to regulation by the PUCT, as well as to regulation by the NRC with respect to NRG's ownership interest in STP.

Federal Energy Regulation

FERC

FERC regulates the transmission and the wholesale sale by public utilities of electricity in interstate commerce under the authority of the FPA.  Under existing regulations, FERC determines whether an entity owning a generation facility is an EWG as defined in the PUHCA. FERC also determines whether a generation facility meets the ownership and technical criteria of a QF under PURPA.  The transmission of electric energy occurring wholly within ERCOT is not subject to FERC's rate jurisdiction under Sections 203 or 205 of the FPA.  Each of NRG's non-ERCOT U.S. generating facilities either qualifies as a QF, or the subsidiary owning the facility qualifies as an EWG.

Public utilities are required to obtain FERC's acceptance, pursuant to Section 205 of the FPA, of their rate schedules for the wholesale sale of electricity.  Generally all of NRG's non-QF generating and power marketing entities located outside of ERCOT make sales of electricity pursuant to market-based rates, as opposed to traditional cost-of-service regulated rates.

Derivatives Regulatory Reforms



In the U.S., the CFTC regulates the trading of swaps, futures and many commodities under the Commodity Exchange Act, or CEA. In recent years, there have been a number of reforms to the regulation of the derivatives markets, both in the U.S. and internationally.  These regulations, and any further changes thereto, or adoption of additional regulations, including any regulations relating to position limits on futures and other derivatives or margin for derivatives, could negatively impact NRG’s ability to hedge its portfolio in an efficient, cost-effective manner by, among other things, potentially decreasing liquidity in the forward commodity and derivatives markets or limiting NRG’s ability to utilize non-cash collateral for derivatives transactions.



Department of Energy's Proposed Grid Resiliency Pricing Rule— On September 29, 2017, the Department of Energy issued a proposed rulemaking titled the "Grid Resiliency Pricing Rule." The rulemaking proposed that FERC take action to reform the ISO/RTO markets to value certain reliability and resiliency attributes of electric generation resources. On October 23, 2017, NRG filed comments encouraging FERC to act expeditiously to modernize energy and capacity markets in a manner compatible with robust competitive markets. On January 8, 2018, FERC terminated the proposed rulemaking and opened a new rulemaking asking each ISO/RTO to address specific questions focused on grid resilience.

State Energy Regulation

In Texas, NRG's operations within the ERCOT footprint are not subject to rate regulation by FERC, because they operate solely within the ERCOT market.  These operations are subject to regulation by the PUCT, as well as to regulation by the NRC with respect to NRG's ownership interest in STP.

In New York, NRG's generation subsidiaries are electric corporations subject to "lightened" regulation by the NYSPSC.  As such, the NYSPSC exercises its jurisdictional authority over certain non-rate aspects of the facilities, including safety, retirements, and the issuance of debt secured by recourse to NRG's generation assets located in New York.

In California, NRG's generation subsidiaries are subject to regulation by the CPUC with regard to certain non-rate aspects of the facilities, including health and safety, outage reporting and other aspects of the facilities' operations.  Additionally, the competitiveness of many of NRG's businesses depends on state competition and other policies.










State Out-Of-Market Subsidy Proposals— Certain states in the areas of the country in which NRG operates, including New Jersey, Ohio and Pennsylvania have considered but have not enacted proposals to provide out-of-market subsidy payments to potentially uneconomic nuclear and fossil generating units.  NRG has opposed efforts to provide out-of-market subsidies, and intends to continue opposing them in the future.

Nuclear Operations

NRG South Texas LP owns 44% of a joint undivided interest in STP. The other owners of STP are the City of Austin, Texas (16%) and the City Public Service Board of San Antonio (40%).  STP Nuclear Operating Company, or STPNOC, was founded by the then-owners in 1997 to operate the plant and it is the operator, licensee and holder of the Facility Operating Licenses NPF-76 and NPF-80. STPNOC is a nonstock, nonprofit, nonmember corporation. Each owner of STP appoints a board member (and the three directors then choose a fourth director who also serves as the chief executive officer of STPNOC). A participation agreement establishes an owners' committee with voting interests consistent with ownership interests.

As a holder of an ownership interest in STP, NRG South Texas LP is an NRC licensee and is subject to NRC regulation.  The NRC license gives the Company the right only to possess an interest in STP but not to operate it.  As a possession-only licensee,i.e., non-operating co-owner, the NRC's regulation of NRG South Texas LP is primarily focused on the Company's ability to meet its financial and decommissioning funding assurance obligations.  In connection with the NRC license, the Company and its subsidiaries have a support agreement to provide up to$120 millionto support operations at STP.

Decommissioning Trusts— Upon expiration of the operating licenses for the two generating units at STP, recently extended until 2047 and 2048, respectively, the co-owners of STP are required under federal law to decontaminate and decommission the STP facility. Under NRC regulations, a power reactor licensee generally must pre-fund the full amount of its estimated NRC decommissioning obligations unless it is a rate-regulated utility, or a state or municipal entity that sets its own rates, or has the benefit of a state-mandated non-bypassable charge available to periodically fund the decommissioning trust such that the trust, plus allowable earnings, will equal the estimated decommissioning obligations by the time the decommissioning is expected to begin.

NRG South Texas LP, through its 44% ownership interest, is the beneficiary of decommissioning trusts that have been established to provide funding for decontamination and decommissioning of STP. CenterPoint and AEP collect, through rates or other authorized charges to their electric utility customers, amounts designated for funding NRG South Texas LP's portion of the decommissioning of the facility. See also Item 15 —Note 6,Nuclear Decommissioning Trust Fund,to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion.

If the funds from the trusts are ultimately determined to be inadequate to decommission the STP facilities, the original owners of the Company's STP interests, CenterPoint and AEP, each will be required to collect, through their PUCT-authorized non-bypassable rates or other charges to customers, additional amounts required to fund NRG South Texas LP's obligations relating to the decommissioning of the facility.  Following the completion of the decommissioning, if surplus funds remain in the decommissioning trusts, those excesses will be refunded to the respective rate payers of CenterPoint or AEP, or their successors.

Regional Regulatory Developments

NRG is affected by rule/tariff changes that occur in the ISO regions.  For further discussion on regulatory developments see Item 15 —Note 23,Regulatory Matters,to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Gulf Coast

MISO

Revisions to MISO Capacity Construct— On February 28, 2018, FERC issued two orders on MISO’s capacity market design, which together, re-affirm MISO’s existing capacity market structure.  FERC also held that, even though there was a period of time between where MISO’s capacity market structure may not have just and reasonable, that FERC exercised its remedial authority not to rerun past auctions.  The Company has 30 days to seek an administrative rehearing with FERC.  The eventual outcome of this proceeding will affect capacity prices in MISO and the incentive for generators in MISO to sell capacity into neighboring markets.










East/West

FERC’s Fast-Start Pricing Dockets—On December 28, 2017, notices were published regarding FERC’s initiation of FPA section 206 proceedings for the NYISO, PJM, and SPP to investigate these ISO pricing practices for fast-start generating resources.  FERC found that the practices of each ISO regarding the pricing of fast-start resources may be unjust and unreasonable because the practices do not allow prices to reflect the marginal cost of serving load. FERC also terminated its generic rulemaking into these issues. The proceeding is ongoing. The outcome of this proceeding could affect price formation in the respective energy markets.

PJM

Minimum Offer Price Rule Exemption Appeal—On July 7, 2017, the D.C. Circuit vacated a FERC order from 2013 related to an exemption to the Minimum Offer Price Rule, or MOPR, and remanded the issue back to FERC.  On October 23, 2017, PJM re-filed its initial 2012 MOPR. On December 8, 2017, FERC rejected PJM's filing and directed PJM to submit a compliance filing reinstating the MOPR in effect prior to PJM's December 2012 filing. PJM submitted a compliance filing modifying certain PJM tariff sections, retaining the unit-specific exception, which FERC has accepted.

Generators’ Complaint on Existing Generation MOPR—On January 9, 2017, NRG, its trade association and other generators filed a joint amendment to the pending complaint seeking to apply the MOPR in the capacity market to existing resources that receive out-of-market subsidies.  This filing amends the March 21, 2016 complaint filed by NRG and other companies related to ratepayer-funded subsidies approved by the PUCO.  The national trade association sought expedited treatment to implement countermeasures to protect consumers and wholesale power markets from the negative effects of out-of-market subsidies, like the Zero Emission Credit.  The complaint is pending at FERC.

2020/2021 PJM Auction Results— On May 23, 2017, PJM announced the results of its 2020/2021 Base Residual Auction.  NRG cleared approximately3,992MW of Capacity Performance product. NRG’s expected capacity revenues from the Base Residual Auction for the 2020/2021 delivery year are approximately$268 million.

The table below provides a detailed description of NRG’s 2020/2021 base residual auction results from May 23, 2017:

PJM Seasonal Capacity Proceeding— On November 17, 2016, PJM proposed to allow winter- and summer-peaking capacity resources to “aggregate” their seasonal capacity into an annual capacity product eligible to participate as Capacity Performance resources. NRG filed comments specifically supporting PJM’s proposal to modify the aggregation rules to allow seasonal capacity resources to aggregate across LDAs and to allow aggregations through RPM auctions. On January 23, 2017, PJM amended its proposal to address questions from FERC. On March 21, 2017, FERC issued a decision accepting PJM's seasonal capacity aggregation filing pursuant to FERC staff's delegated authority, since FERC did not have a quorum at the time. On February 23, 2018, FERC re-affirmed its prior order.  Rehearings are pending at FERC. The outcome of this proceeding could have a material impact on future PJM capacity prices.

Complaints Related to Extension of Base Capacity— In 2015, FERC approved changes to PJM’s capacity market, which included moving from the Base Capacity product to the higher performance Capacity Performance product over the course of a five year transition.  Under this transition, as of the May 2017 BRA, the Base Capacity product will no longer be available.  Several parties have filed complaints at FERC seeking to maintain the RPM Base Capacity product for at least one more delivery year or until such time as PJM develops a model for seasonal resources to participate.  If the transition is delayed, capacity prices could be materially impacted.  The matters are pending at FERC.










Complaints Regarding Pseudo-Ties for Capacity— On April 6, 2017, Potomac Economics, the market monitor for MISO and NYISO, filed a complaint against PJM regarding the participation of external capacity resources in PJM’s auction. Currently, external resources must enter into a pseudo-tie agreement in order to sell capacity into PJM. The complaint alleges that the pseudo-tie requirement is causing market inefficiencies in PJM, New York and MISO and suggests a new protocol for incorporating external resources into PJM’s markets. In addition, other market participants have filed separate complaints at FERC against MISO or PJM, respectively, for issues resulting from pseudo-tied generators. The complainants argue that the generation owners with pseudo-ties from MISO to PJM are receiving double-charges for congestion. The outcome could impact the PJM, NYISO and MISO capacity markets.

Midwest Generation Reactive Power Compensation— On June 21, 2016, FERC issued an order directing Midwest Generation to make a compliance filing setting forth refunds for payments received in violation of its 2004 reactive power settlement or to show cause why it has not violated the settlement. FERC also ordered Midwest Generation to revise its tariff to reflect the costs of units continuing to provide reactive power or show cause why it should not be required to do so. FERC also referred this matter to FERC's Office of Enforcement. On June 30, 2016, Midwest Generation filed a revised tariff, and on July 22, 2016, Midwest Generation made a compliance filing as ordered by FERC. On October 13, 2016, FERC found that Midwest Generation should only be liable for refunds that accrued after bankruptcy on April 1, 2014 through June 30, 2016.   On November 16, 2017, Midwest Generation filed its Offer of Settlement, which was approved by FERC on February 22, 2018.   In addition, FERC's Office of Enforcement has closed the investigation into Midwest Generation without further action.

New England

Competitive Auctions with Sponsored Resources Proposal (CASPR)—On January 8, 2018, ISO-NE filed the CASPR proposal which attempts to accommodate state sponsored resources while maintaining competitive market pricing.  On January 29, 2018, NRG protested certain aspects of the proposal and also supported ISO-NE’s beginning attempts to address state sponsored resources entering the capacity market.  The outcome of this proceeding will potentially affect future capacity market prices.

Renewable Technology Resource (RTR) Exemption—In 2014, FERC approved a package of revisions that included a renewables exemption called the RTR Exemption.  After FERC denied rehearing, the case was appealed to the D.C. Circuit.  After a voluntary remand motion, the Court remanded the case back to FERC.  In 2016, FERC issued an order reaffirming its decision.  In 2017, a group of generators, including NRG, filed a petition for review with the D.C. Circuit.  Briefing is complete.  Oral argument is scheduled for April 13, 2018.

Challenge to ISO-NE’s Capacity Carry Forward Rule— On February 2, 2018, the D.C. Circuit remanded a FERC order regarding how generators that previously received a seven-year “price lock” should be priced in future auctions, known as the Capacity Carry Forward Rule.  The price-lock mechanism permits qualified new resources that clear the auction to receive their first-year clearing price for seven years.  Because the underlying orders focused on the implementation of the Capacity Carry Forward Rule, this remand does not implicate the validity of the underlying price-lock.  Because several auctions have been held under the existing rules, any subsequent order from FERC could affect future capacity prices in New England, as well as affect the price that non-price locked resources could receive from prior capacity auction.

2021/2022 ISO-NE Auction Results— On February 6, 2018, ISO-NE announced the results of its 2021/2022 forward capacity auction.  NRG cleared 1,529 MW at $4.631 kW-month providing expected annualized capacity revenues of $85 million.  The 333 MWs at Canal Unit 3, which previously cleared the tenth forward capacity auction with a seven year price lock at a price of $7.03 kW-month for the 2021/2022 deliverability year, are excluded from these results.

Massachusetts GHG Regulations— On September 11, 2017, multiple generators, including GenOn Energy, Inc. and the New England Power Generators Association, or NEPGA, filed complaints regarding the Massachusetts GHG regulations with the Superior Court in Massachusetts.  The complaint alleges that the final regulation does not demonstrate a lowering of emissions and that the regulation violates the state’s Global Warming Solutions Act law.  On January 30, 2018, the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court transferred the superior court cases to the Supreme Judicial Court for Suffolk County.  At the same time, the Court stayed two pending appeals of siting certificates, one of which is the certificate of NRG’s Canal 3 development.  The outcome of the matter may affect generators’ abilities to run their plants without violating environmental regulations.



Northern Pass Siting Application— On February 1, 2018, the New Hampshire Site Evaluation Committee denied the application for Northern Pass to cross the state with a 160-mile transmission line from Quebec into southern New Hampshire.  The Northern Pass transmission line project had previously been awarded a contract by the State of Massachusetts, which is now in doubt.The addition of 1,000 MW of additional Canadian hydropower associated with Northern Pass would have affected energy and capacity prices.












Peak Energy Rent Adjustment Complaint— On September 30, 2016, the New England Power Generators Association, or NEPGA, filed a complaint against ISO-NE asking FERC to find the Peak Energy Rent, or PER, unjust and unreasonable. The PER adjustment reduces capacity payments on days where energy prices exceed a pre-defined level, known as the "PER strike price." On January 9, 2017, FERC granted NEPGA’s complaint requiring a change to the methodology used to calculate the PER strike price. FERC also directed the parties to determine any refunds for PER paid between September 30, 2016 and May 31, 2018. On July 26, 2017, NEPGA filed settlement documents at FERC, which NRG supported. On February 20, 2018, FERC accepted the settlement and directed ISO-NE to submit a compliance filing setting out the PER calculation.

New York

Independent Power Producers of New York (IPPNY) Complaint— On January 9, 2017, EPSA requested FERC to promptly direct the NYISO to file tariff provisions to address pending market concerns related to out-of-market payments to existing generation in the NYISO.  This request was prompted by the ZEC program initiated by the NYSPSC.  This request follows IPPNY’s complaint at FERC against the NYISO on May 10, 2013, as amended on March 25, 2014.  The generators asked FERC to direct the NYISO to require that capacity from existing generation resources that would have exited the market but for out-of-market payments be mitigated. Failure to implement buyer-side mitigation measures could result in uneconomic entry, which artificially decreases capacity prices below competitive market levels.

New York Public Service Commission Retail Energy Market Proceedings— On February 23, 2016, the NYSPSC issued what it refers to as its “Retail Reset” order, or Reset Order, in docket 12-M-0476 et al. Among other things, the Reset Order placed a price cap on energy supply offers and required many retail providers to seek affirmative consent from certain retail customers. Various parties have challenged the NYPSC’s ability to regulate rates charged by competitive suppliers in New York state court. In conjunction with the court challenges, the NYPSC noticed both an evidentiary and a collaborative track to address the functioning of the competitive retail markets. An administrative hearing commenced on November 29, 2017 as part of the evidentiary track, which is ongoing. The outcome of the evidentiary and collaborative processes, combined with the outcome of the appeal of the Reset Order, could affect the viability of the New York retail energy market.

CAISO

Puente Power Project— On October 5, 2017, the California Energy Commission, or CEC, the agency responsible for permitting the Puente Power Project, issued a statement on behalf of the committee of two Commissioners overseeing the permitting process stating their intention to issue a proposed decision that would deny a permit for the Puente Power Project. On October 16, 2017, NRG filed a motion to suspend the permitting proceeding for at least six months, which was granted on November 3, 2017.  During the six month suspension period, which could be extended, NRG will evaluate the progress of a procurement process initiated by SCE to replace the Puente Power Project.

Environmental Matters

NRG is subject to numerous environmental laws in the development, construction, ownership and operation of projects. These laws generally require that governmental permits and approvals be obtained before construction and during operation of power plants.  Federal and state environmental laws historically have become more stringent over time.  Future laws may require the addition of emissions controls or other environmental controls or impose restrictions on our operations, which could affect the Company's operations. Complying with environmental laws often involves significant capital and operating expenses, as well as occasionally curtailing operations. NRG decides to invest capital for environmental controls based on the relative certainty of the requirements, an evaluation of compliance options, and the expected economic returns on capital.



A number of regulations that may affect the Company are under review by the EPA, including ESPS for GHGs, ash disposal requirements, NAAQS revisions and implementation and effluent limitation guidelines.  NRG will evaluate the impact of these regulations as they are revised but cannot fully predict the impact of each until anticipated legal challenges are resolved.



Air

The CAA and the resulting regulations (as well as similar state and local requirements) have the potential to affect air emissions, operating practices and pollution control equipment required at power plants. Under the CAA, the EPA sets NAAQS for certain pollutants including SO2, ozone, and PM2.5. Many of the Company's facilities are located in or near areas that are classified by the EPA as not achieving certain NAAQS (non-attainment areas). The relevant NAAQS have become more stringent. The Company maintains a comprehensive compliance strategy to address continuing and new requirements. Complying with increasingly stringent air regulations could require the installation of additional emissions control equipment at some NRG facilities or retiring of units if installing such controls is not economic. Significant changes to air regulatory programs affecting the Company are described below.










Ozone NAAQS— On October 26, 2015, the EPA promulgated a rule that reduces the ozone NAAQS to 0.070 ppm.  Challenges to this rule have been stayed at the request of the EPA so that it can evaluate the rule. If the rule is not altered by the EPA and survives legal challenges, this more stringent NAAQS will obligate the states to develop plans to reduce NOx(an ozone precursor), which could affect some of the Company's units.

Cross-State Air Pollution Rule

— The EPA finalized CSAPR in 2011, which was intended to replace CAIR in January 2012, to address certain states' obligations to reduce emissions so that downwind states can achieve federal air quality standards. In December 2011, the D.C. Circuit stayed the implementation of CSAPR and then vacated CSAPR in August 2012 but kept CAIR in place until the EPA could replace it. In April 2014, the U.S. Supreme Court reversed and remanded the D.C. Circuit's decision. In October 2014, the D.C. Circuit lifted the stay of CSAPR. In response, the EPA in November 2014 amended the CSAPR compliance dates. Accordingly, CSAPR replaced CAIR on January 1, 2015. On July 28, 2015, the D.C. Circuit held that the EPA had exceeded its authority by requiring certain reductions that were not necessary for downwind states to achieve federal standards. Although the D.C. Circuit kept the rule in place, the court ordered the EPA to revise the Phase 2 (or 2017) (i) SO


budgets for four states including Texas and (ii) ozone-season NO

budgets for 11 states including Maryland, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Texas. On October 26, 2016, the EPA finalized the CSAPR Update Rule, which reduces future NO

x

allocations and discounts the current banked allowances to account for the more stringent 2008 Ozone NAAQS and to address the D.C. Circuit's July 2015 decision. This rule has been challenged in the D.C. Circuit. The Company believes its investment in pollution controls and cleaner technologies leave the fleet well-positioned for compliance.

MATS

— In 2012, the EPA promulgated standards (the MATS rule) to control emissions of HAPs from coal and oil-fired electric generating units. The rule established limits for mercury, non-mercury metals, certain organics and acid gases, which had to be met beginning in April 2015 (with some units getting a 1-year extension). In June 2015, the U.S. Supreme Court issued a decision in the case of

Michigan v. EPA

, and held that the EPA unreasonably refused to consider costs when it determined that it was "appropriate and necessary" to regulate HAPs emitted by electric generating units. The U.S. Supreme Court did not vacate the MATS rule but rather remanded it to the D.C. Circuit for further proceedings. In December 2015, the D.C. Circuit remanded the MATS rule to the EPA without vacatur. On April 25, 2016, the EPA released a supplemental finding that the benefits of this regulation outweigh the costs to address the U.S. Supreme Court's ruling that the EPA had not properly considered costs. This finding has been challenged in the D.C. Circuit. On April 18, 2017, the EPA asked the D.C. Circuit to postpone oral argument that had been scheduled for May 18, 2017 because the EPA is closely reviewing the supplemental finding to determine whether it should reconsider all or part of the rule. On April 27, 2017, the D.C. Circuit granted the EPA's request to postpone the oral argument and hold the case in abeyance. While NRG cannot predict the final outcome of this rulemaking, NRG believes that because it has already invested in pollution controls and cleaner technologies, the fleet is well-positioned to comply with the MATS rule.

Clean Power Plan— The attention in recent years on GHG emissions has resulted in federal regulations and state legislative and regulatory action. In October 2015, the EPA finalized the Clean Power Plan, or CPP, addressing GHG emissions from existing EGUs. On February 9, 2016, the U.S. Supreme Court stayed the CPP. The D.C. Circuit heard oral argument on the legal challenges to the CPP in September 2016. At the EPA's request, the D.C. Circuit agreed on April 28, 2017 to hold the case in abeyance. On October 16, 2017, the EPA proposed a rule to repeal the CPP. The Company believes the CPP is not likely to survive.










Greenhouse Gas Emissions— NRG emits CO2and small quantities of other greenhouse gases, or GHGs, when generating electricity at most of its facilities. The graphs presented below illustrate NRG's domestic emissions of CO2efor 2015, 2016 and 2017. A significant majority (>99%) of NRG's emission sources are subject to federal (U.S. EPA) GHG reporting requirements programs. NRG anticipates further reductions in CO2eemissionsas the Company modernizes the fleet. From 2016 to 2017, the Company's CO2eemissions decreased from 48 million metric tons to approximately 46 million metric tons, representing a 4% reduction year over year. The primary factor leading to the decreased emissions include reductions in fleet wide annual net generation due to a continued market-driven shift towards increased generation from natural gas over coal. The Company's goal is to reduce CO2eemissions by 50% by 2030, and 90% by 2050, using 2014 as a baseline.



The effects from federal, regional or state regulation of GHGs on the Company's financial performance will depend on a number of factors, including the outcome of the legal challenges and actions of the current U.S. presidential administration.

Byproducts, Wastes, Hazardous Materials and Contamination

In April 2015, the EPA finalized the rule regulating byproducts of coal combustion (e.g., ash and gypsum) as solid wastes under the RCRA. On September 13, 2017, the EPA granted the petition for reconsideration that the Utility Solid Waste Activities Group filed in May 2017. The Company has evaluated the impact of the new rule on the Company's consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows and has accrued its environmental and asset retirement obligations under the rule based on current estimates as ofDecember 31, 2017.

Domestic Site Remediation Matters

Under certain federal, state and local environmental laws, a current or previous owner or operator of any facility, including an electric generating facility, may be required to investigate and remediate releases or threatened releases of hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum products. NRG may be responsible for property damage, personal injury and investigation and remediation costs incurred by a party in connection with hazardous material releases or threatened releases.  These laws, including the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 as amended by the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act of 1986, or SARA, impose liability without regard to whether the owner knew of or caused the presence of the hazardous substances, and the courts have interpreted liability under such laws to be strict (without fault) and joint and several.  Cleanup obligations can often be triggered during the closure or decommissioning of a facility, in addition to spills during its operations.  Further discussions of affected NRG sites can be found in Item 15 —Note 24,Environmental Matters, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.










Nuclear Waste— The federal government's program to construct a nuclear waste repository at Yucca Mountain, Nevada was discontinued in 2010. Since 1998, the U.S. DOE has been in default of the federal government's obligations to begin accepting spent nuclear fuel, or SNF, and high-level radioactive waste, or HLW, under the U.S. Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982, or the Nuclear Waste Policy Act. Owners of nuclear plants, including the owners of STP, had been required to enter into contracts setting out the obligations of the owners and the U.S. DOE, including the fees to be paid by the owners for the U.S. DOE's services to license a spent fuel repository. Effective May 16, 2014, the U.S. DOE stopped collecting the fees.

On February 5, 2013, STPNOC entered into a settlement agreement with the U.S. DOE for payment of damages relating to the U.S. DOE's failure to accept SNF and HLW under the Nuclear Waste Policy Act through December 31, 2013, which was extended through an addendum dated January 24, 2014, to December 31, 2016.  On December 12, 2016, STPNOC received the federal government's offer of another three-year extension of payment for continued failure to accept SNF and HLW.  The proposal was reviewed and accepted. There are no facilities for the reprocessing or permanent disposal of SNF currently in operation in the U.S., nor has the NRC licensed any such facilities. STPNOC currently stores all SNF generated by its nuclear generating facilities in on-site storage pools.  Since STPNOC's SNF storage pools do not have sufficient storage capacity for the life of the units, STPNOC is proceeding to construct dry cask storage capability on-site. STPNOC plans to continue to assert claims against the U.S. DOE for damages relating to the U.S. DOE's failure to accept SNF and HLW.

Under the federal Low-Level Radioactive Waste Policy Act of 1980, as amended, the state of Texas is required to provide, either on its own or jointly with other states in a compact, for the disposal of all low-level radioactive waste generated within the state.  STP's warehouse capacity is adequate for on-site storage until a site in Andrews County, Texas becomes fully operational.

Water

Clean Water Act—The Company is required under the CWA to comply with intake and discharge requirements, requirements for technological controls and operating practices.  As with air quality regulations, federal and state water regulations have become more stringent and imposed new requirements.

Once Through Cooling Regulation— In August 2014, EPA finalized the regulation regarding the use of water for once through cooling at existing facilities to address impingement and entrainment concerns.  NRG anticipates that more stringent requirements will be incorporated into some of its water discharge permits over the next several years as NPDES permits are renewed.

Effluent Limitations Guidelines— In November 2015, the EPA revised the Effluent Limitations Guidelines for Steam Electric Generating Facilities, which would have imposed more stringent requirements (as individual permits were renewed) for wastewater streams from flue gas desulfurization, or FGD, fly ash, bottom ash, and flue gas mercury control. In April 2017, the EPA granted two petitions to reconsider the rule and also administratively stayed some of the deadlines. On September 18, 2017, the EPA promulgated a final rule that (i) postpones the compliance dates to preserve the status quo for FGD wastewater and bottom ash transport water by two years to November 2020 until the EPA completes its next rulemaking and (ii) withdrew the April 2017 administrative stay. The legal challenges have been suspended while the EPA reconsiders and likely modifies the rule. Accordingly, the Company has largely eliminated its estimate of the environmental capital expenditures that would have been required to comply with permits incorporating the revised guidelines. The Company will revisit these estimates after the rule is revised.

Regional Environmental Developments

New Source Review—  In 2007, Midwest Generation received an NOV from the EPA alleging that past work at Crawford, Fisk, Joliet, Powerton, Waukegan and Will County generating stations violated NSR and other regulations. These alleged violations are the subject of litigation described in Item 15 —Note 22,Commitments and Contingencies.Additionally, in April 2013, the Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection issued four NOVs alleging that past work at oil-fired combustion turbines at the Torrington Terminal, Franklin, Branford and Middletown generating stations violated regulations regarding NSR.










Burton Island Old Ash Landfill— In January 2006, NRG's Indian River Power LLC was notified that it may be a potentially responsible party with respect to Burton Island Old Ash Landfill, a historic captive landfill located at the Indian River facility.  On October 1, 2007, NRG signed an agreement with DNREC to investigate the site through the Voluntary Clean-up Program, or the VCP.  On February 4, 2008, DNREC issued findings that no further action was required in relation to surface water and that a previously planned shoreline stabilization project would satisfactorily address shoreline erosion.  The landfill itself required a Remedial Investigation and Feasibility Study to determine the type and scope of any additional required work.  DNREC approved the Feasibility Study in December 2012.  In January 2013, DNREC proposed a remediation plan based on the Feasibility Study.  The remediation plan was approved in October 2013.  In December 2015, DNREC approved the Company's remediation design, the Company's Closure Report and the Company's Long Term Stewardship Plan. The cost of completing the work required by the approved remediation plan is consistent with amounts budgeted in early 2016 and remediation was completed in 2017.  The estimated cost to comply with the Long-Term Stewardship Plan was added to the liability in December 2016.

In addition to the VCP, on May 29, 2008, DNREC requested that NRG's Indian River Power LLC participate in the development and performance of a Natural Resource Damage Assessment at the Burton Island Old Ash Landfill.  NRG is currently working with DNREC and other trustees to close out the assessment process.

RGGI —The Company operates generating units in Connecticut, Delaware, Maryland, and New York that are subject to RGGI, which is a regional cap and trade system. In 2013, each of these states finalized a rule that reduced and will continue to reduce the number of allowances through 2020. The nine RGGI states re-evaluated the program and published a model rule to further reduce the number of allowances. The revisions being currently contemplated could adversely impact NRG's results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

Texas Regional Haze— On October 17, 2017, the EPA promulgated a final rule creating a Texas-only SO2cap-and-trade program to address regional haze. The program is scheduled to begin on January 1, 2019. Several of the Company's units in Texas will be affected by this rule. The rule has been challenged by several environmental groups in the Fifth Circuit of the U.S. Court of Appeals.

Customers

NRG sells to a wide variety of customers.Noindividual customer accounted for 10% or more of NRG's total revenue in2017. The Company owns and operates power plants to generate and sell power to wholesale customers such as utilities and other intermediaries. The Company also directly sells to end-use customers in the residential, commercial and industrial sectors.  NRG also receives significant revenues from PJM in its capacity as the regional transmission organization for the PJM footprint.

Employees

As ofDecember 31, 2017, NRG and its consolidated subsidiaries, including NRG Yield, Inc., had5,940employees, approximately24%of whom were covered by U.S. bargaining agreements. During2017, the Company did not experience any labor stoppages or labor disputes at any of its facilities.

Available Information

NRG's annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act are available free of charge through the Company's website,www.nrg.com, as soon as reasonably practicable after they are electronically filed with, or furnished to, the SEC.  The Company also routinely posts press releases, presentations, webcasts, sustainability reports and other information regarding the Company on the Company's website. The information posted on the Company's website is not a part of this report.












Item 1A — Risk Factors Related to NRG Energy, Inc.

Risks Related to the Operation of NRG's Business

The GenOn Entities filed voluntary petitions for relief under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code, and NRG is subject to the risks and uncertainties associated with bankruptcy proceedings.

On the Petition Date, the GenOn Entities filed voluntary petitions for relief under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code. GenOn Mid-Atlantic, as well as its consolidated subsidiaries, and REMA, did not file for relief under Chapter 11.

NRG is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties associated with the Chapter 11 Cases, which may lead to potential adverse effects on NRG’s business, results of operations, or financial condition. NRG cannot assure you of the outcome of the Chapter 11 Cases. Potential risks to NRG associated with the Chapter 11 Cases include the following:

•the length of time the GenOn Entities will operate under the Chapter 11 proceedings and their ability to successfully emerge, including with respect to obtaining any necessary regulatory approvals;

•the ability of the GenOn Entities to consummate their plan of reorganization;

•risks associated with third party motions, proceedings and litigation in the Chapter 11 proceedings, which may interfere with the GenOn Entities’ plan of reorganization;

•NRG’s and the GenOn Entities’ ability to manage contracts that are critical to NRG’s operations, and to obtain and maintain appropriate credit and other terms with customers, suppliers and service providers;

•NRG’s ability to attract, retain and motivate key employees;

•NRG’s ability to fund and execute its business plan;

•the disposition or resolution of all pre-petition claims against NRG and the GenOn Entities; and

•NRG’s ability to maintain existing customers and vendor relationships and expand sales to new customers.

The Settlement Agreement may not be consummated if certain conditions are not met. If the Settlement Agreement is not consummated, NRG may not be entitled to receive certain benefits contemplated by the Restructuring Support Agreement and plan of reorganization.

Under the Restructuring Support Agreement to which GenOn, NRG and certain of GenOn's and GenOn Americas Generation's senior unsecured noteholders are parties, each of them agreed to support Bankruptcy Court approval of the Settlement Agreement, subject to conditions.

While the Bankruptcy Court approved the Settlement Agreement and confirmed the proposed plan of reorganization on December 12, 2017, there can be no assurance that the conditions to the effectiveness of either the Settlement Agreement or plan of reorganization will be satisfied. In addition, GenOn is entitled to terminate the Restructuring Support Agreement and consider alternative transactions in accordance with its fiduciary duties. If the Settlement Agreement or plan of reorganization is not consummated, NRG may not receive certain of the benefits contemplated by the Restructuring Support Agreement.

The Chapter 11 Cases may disrupt NRG's business and may materially and adversely affect NRG's operations.

NRG has attempted to minimize the adverse effect of the GenOn Entities’ Chapter 11 Cases on NRG's relationships with its employees, suppliers, customers and other parties. Nonetheless, NRG's relationships with its employees, suppliers, customers and other parties may be adversely impacted by negative publicity or otherwise and NRG's operations could be materially and adversely affected. In addition, the Chapter 11 Cases could negatively affect NRG's ability to attract new employees and retain existing high performing employees or executives, which could materially and adversely affect NRG's operations.

As a result of the Chapter 11 Cases, NRG's historical financial information will not be indicative of NRG's future financial performance.

NRG's corporate structure will be significantly altered under any plan of reorganization. As of June 14, 2017, GenOn and its consolidated subsidiaries were deconsolidated from NRG's financial statements. Consequently, NRG's results of operations following the deconsolidation will not be comparable to the financial condition and results of operations reflected in NRG's historical financial statements for periods prior to the deconsolidation.










NRG adopted and initiated the Transformation Plan. If the Transformation Plan does not achieve its expected benefits, there could be negative impacts to NRG’s business, results of operations and financial condition.



NRG adopted and initiated the Transformation Plan, designed to significantly strengthen earnings and cost competitiveness, lower risk and volatility, and create significant shareholder value. The three-part, three-year plan is comprised of the following components: (i) operations and cost excellence; (ii) portfolio optimization; and (iii) capital structure and allocation enhancements.

As part of the Transformation, Plan, on February 6, 2018, NRG and GIP entered into a purchase and sale agreement for NRG to sell its ownership in NRG Yield, Inc. and its renewables platform to GIP for cash of $1.375 billion, subject to certain adjustments. Also on February 6, 2018, NRG and Cleco entered into a purchase and sale agreement for NRG to sell its South Central business to Cleco for cash of $1.0 billion, subject to certain adjustments. Both of these transactions are subject to various closing conditions and approvals.

NRG may be unable to fully implement the components of the Transformation Plan, in which case, NRG would not realize the anticipated benefits. Alternatively, such components of the Transformation Plan, even if implemented, may not result in the anticipated benefits to NRG’s business, results of operations and financial condition in a timely manner if at all. Further, NRG could experience unexpected delays, business disruptions resulting from supporting these initiatives during and following completion of these activities, decreased productivity, adverse effects on employee morale and employee turnover as a result of such initiatives, any of which may impair NRG’s ability to achieve anticipated results or otherwise harm NRG’s business, results of operations and financial condition.



The proposed sales of assets to GIP and Cleco could be delayed or fail to close, or otherwise cause unanticipated issues, which could adversely affect NRG's business, results of operations and financial condition.




















NRG's financial performance may be impacted by price fluctuations in the wholesale power and natural gas, coal and oil markets and other market factors that are beyond the Company's control.

Market prices for power, capacity, ancillary services, natural gas, coal and oil are unpredictable and tend to fluctuate substantially. Unlike most other commodities, electric power can only be stored on a very limited basis and generally must be produced concurrently with its use. As a result, power prices are subject to significant volatility due to supply and demand imbalances, especially in the day-ahead and spot markets. Long- and short-term power prices may also fluctuate substantially due to other factors outside of the Company's control, including:

•changes in generation capacity in the Company’s markets, including the addition of new supplies of power as a result of the development of new plants, expansion of existing plants, the continued operation of uneconomic power plants due to state subsidies, or additional transmission capacity;

•environmental regulations and legislation;

•electric supply disruptions, including plant outages and transmission disruptions;

•changes in power transmission infrastructure;

•fuel transportation capacity constraints or inefficiencies;

•changes in law, including judicial decisions;

•weather conditions, including extreme weather conditions and seasonal fluctuations, including the effects of climate change;

•changes in commodity prices and the supply of commodities, including but not limited to natural gas, coal and oil;

•changes in the demand for power or in patterns of power usage, including the potential development of demand-side management tools and practices, distributed generation, and more efficient end-use technologies;

•development of new fuels, new technologies and new forms of competition for the production of power;

•fuel price volatility;

•economic and political conditions;

•regulations and actions of the ISOs and RTOs;

•federal and state power regulations and legislation;

•changes in prices related to RECs; and

•changes in capacity prices and capacity markets.

Such factors and the associated fluctuations in power prices have affected the Company's wholesale power operating results in the past and will continue to do so in the future.

Many of NRG's power generation facilities operate, wholly or partially, without long-term power sale agreements.

Many of NRG's facilities operate as "merchant" facilities without long-term power sales agreements for some or all of their generating capacity and output and therefore are exposed to market fluctuations. Without the benefit of long-term power sales agreements for these assets, NRG cannot be sure that it will be able to sell any or all of the power generated by these facilities at commercially attractive rates or that these facilities will be able to operate profitably. This could lead to future impairments of the Company's property, plant and equipment or to the closing of certain of its facilities, resulting in economic losses and liabilities, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.

NRG's costs, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be adversely impacted by disruption of its fuel supplies.

NRG relies on natural gas, coal and oil to fuel a majority of its power generation facilities. Delivery of these fuels to the facilities is dependent upon the continuing financial viability of contractual counterparties as well as upon the infrastructure (including rail lines, rail cars, barge facilities, roadways, riverways and natural gas pipelines) available to serve each generation facility. As a result, the Company is subject to the risks of disruptions or curtailments in the production of power at its generation facilities if no fuel is available at any price or if a counterparty fails to perform or if there is a disruption in the fuel delivery infrastructure.










NRG has sold forward a substantial portion of its coal and nuclear power in order to lock in long-term prices that it deemed to be favorable at the time it entered into the forward power sales contracts. In order to hedge its obligations under these forward power sales contracts, the Company has entered into long-term and short-term contracts for the purchase and delivery of fuel. Many of the forward power sales contracts do not allow the Company to pass through changes in fuel costs or discharge the power sale obligations in the case of a disruption in fuel supply due to force majeure events or the default of a fuel supplier or transporter. Disruptions in the Company's fuel supplies may therefore require it to find alternative fuel sources at higher costs, to find other sources of power to deliver to counterparties at a higher cost, or to pay damages to counterparties for failure to deliver power as contracted. Any such event could have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial performance.

NRG also buys significant quantities of fuel on a short-term or spot market basis. Prices for all of the Company's fuels fluctuate, sometimes rising or falling significantly over a relatively short period of time. The price NRG can obtain for the sale of energy may not rise at the same rate, or may not rise at all, to match a rise in fuel or delivery costs. This may have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial performance. Changes in market prices for natural gas, coal and oil may result from the following:

•weather conditions;

•seasonality;

•demand for energy commodities and general economic conditions;

•disruption or other constraints or inefficiencies of electricity, gas or coal transmission or transportation;

•additional generating capacity;

•availability and levels of storage and inventory for fuel stocks;

•natural gas, crude oil, refined products and coal production levels;

•changes in market liquidity;

•federal, state and foreign governmental regulation and legislation; and

•the creditworthiness and liquidity and willingness of fuel suppliers/transporters to do business with the Company.

NRG's plant operating characteristics and equipment, particularly at its coal-fired plants, often dictate the specific fuel quality to be combusted. The availability and price of specific fuel qualities may vary due to supplier financial or operational disruptions, transportation disruptions and force majeure. At times, coal of specific quality may not be available at any price, or the Company may not be able to transport such coal to its facilities on a timely basis. In this case, the Company may not be able to run the coal facility even if it would be profitable. Operating a coal facility with different quality coal can lead to emission or operating problems. If the Company had sold forward the power from such a coal facility, it could be required to supply or purchase power from alternate sources, perhaps at a loss. This could have a material adverse impact on the financial results of specific plants and on the Company's results of operations.

Changes in the price of coal and natural gas could cause the Company to hold excess coal inventories and incur contract termination costs.

Low natural gas prices can cause natural gas to be the more cost-competitive fuel compared to coal for generating electricity. Because the Company enters into guaranteed supply contracts to provide for the amount of coal needed to operate its base load coal-fired generating facilities, the Company may experience periods where it holds excess amounts of coal if fuel pricing results in the Company reducing or idling coal-fired generating facilities. In addition, the Company may incur costs to terminate supply contracts for coal in excess of its generating requirements.










Volatile power supply costs and demand for power could adversely affect the financial performance of NRG's retail businesses.

Although NRG is the primary provider of its retail businesses' wholesale electricity supply requirements, the retail businesses purchase a significant portion of their supply requirements from third parties. As a result, financial performance depends on the ability to obtain adequate supplies of electric generation from third parties at prices below the prices it charges its customers. Consequently, the Company's earnings and cash flows could be adversely affected in any period in which the retail businesses' wholesale electricity supply costs rise at a greater rate than the rates it charges to customers. The price of wholesale electricity supply purchases associated with the retail businesses' energy commitments can be different than that reflected in the rates charged to customers due to, among other factors:

•varying supply procurement contracts used and the timing of entering into related contracts;

•subsequent changes in the overall price of natural gas;

•daily, monthly or seasonal fluctuations in the price of natural gas relative to the 12-month forward prices;

•transmission constraints and the Company's ability to move power to its customers; and

•changes in market heat rate (i.e., the relationship between power and natural gas prices).

The retail businesses' earnings and cash flows could also be adversely affected in any period in which its customers' actual usage of electricity significantly varies from the forecasted usage, which could occur due to, among other factors, weather events, competition and economic conditions.

There may be periods when NRG will not be able to meet its commitments under forward sale obligations at a reasonable cost or at all.

A substantial portion of the output from NRG's coal and nuclear facilities has been sold forward under fixed price power sales contracts through 2018 and the Company also sells forward the output from its intermediate and peaking facilities when it is commercially advantageous to do so. The Company also sells fixed price gas as a proxy for power. Because the obligations under most of these agreements are not contingent on a unit being available to generate power, NRG is generally required to deliver power to the buyer, even in the event of a plant outage, fuel supply disruption or a reduction in the available capacity of the unit. To the extent that the Company does not have sufficient lower-cost capacity to meet its commitments under its forward sale obligations, the Company would be required to supply replacement power either by running its other, higher cost power plants or by obtaining power from third-party sources at market prices that could substantially exceed the contract price. If NRG fails to deliver the contracted power, it would be required to pay the difference between the market price at the delivery point and the contract price, and the amount of such payments could be substantial.

In the Gulf Coast region, NRG has long-term contracts with rural cooperatives that require it to serve all of the cooperatives' requirements at prices for energy that generally reflect the cost of coal-fired generation.  On December 19, 2013, the Entergy region joined the MISO RTO, which employs a two settlement market in which NRG submits bids for energy to cover its load obligations and submits offers to sell energy from its resources.  Given the “full requirements” obligation contained in the cooperative contracts, and the possibility of unplanned forced outages of its generation, NRG may be exposed to locational market prices as a net buyer of energy for certain periods, which could have a negative impact on NRG's financial returns from its Gulf Coast region.

NRG's trading operations and use of hedging agreements could result in financial losses that negatively impact its results of operations.

The Company typically enters into hedging agreements, including contracts to purchase or sell commodities at future dates and at fixed prices, to manage the commodity price risks inherent in its power generation operations. These activities, although intended to mitigate price volatility, expose the Company to other risks. When the Company sells power forward, it gives up the opportunity to sell power at higher prices in the future, which not only may result in lost opportunity costs but also may require the Company to post significant amounts of cash collateral or other credit support to its counterparties. The Company also relies on counterparty performance under its hedging agreements and is exposed to the credit quality of its counterparties under those agreements. Further, if the values of the financial contracts change in a manner that the Company does not anticipate, or if a counterparty fails to perform under a contract, it could harm the Company's business, operating results or financial position.

NRG does not typically hedge the entire exposure of its operations against commodity price volatility. To the extent it does not hedge against commodity price volatility, the Company's results of operations and financial position may be improved or diminished based upon movement in commodity prices.










NRG may engage in trading activities, including the trading of power, fuel and emissions allowances that are not directly related to the operation of the Company's generation facilities or the management of related risks. These trading activities take place in volatile markets and some of these trades could be characterized as speculative. The Company would expect to settle these trades financially rather than through the production of power or the delivery of fuel. This trading activity may expose the Company to the risk of significant financial losses which could have a material adverse effect on its business and financial condition.

NRG may not have sufficient liquidity to hedge market risks effectively.

The Company is exposed to market risks through its power marketing business, which involves the sale of energy, capacity and related products and the purchase and sale of fuel, transmission services and emission allowances. These market risks include, among other risks, volatility arising from location and timing differences that may be associated with buying and transporting fuel, converting fuel into energy and delivering energy to a buyer.

NRG undertakes these marketing activities through agreements with various counterparties. Many of the Company's agreements with counterparties include provisions that require the Company to provide guarantees, offset of netting arrangements, letters of credit, a first lien on assets and/or cash collateral to protect the counterparties against the risk of the Company's default or insolvency. The amount of such credit support that must be provided typically is based on the difference between the price of the commodity in a given contract and the market price of the commodity. Significant movements in market prices can result in the Company being required to provide cash collateral and letters of credit in very large amounts. The effectiveness of the Company's strategy may depend on the amount of collateral available to enter into or maintain these contracts, and liquidity requirements may be greater than the Company anticipates or will be able to meet. Without a sufficient amount of working capital to post as collateral in support of performance guarantees or as a cash margin, the Company may not be able to manage price volatility effectively or to implement its strategy. An increase in the amount of letters of credit or cash collateral required to be provided to the Company's counterparties may negatively affect the Company's liquidity and financial condition.

Further, if any of NRG's facilities experience unplanned outages, the Company may be required to procure replacement power at spot market prices to fulfill contractual commitments. Without adequate liquidity to meet margin and collateral requirements, the Company may be exposed to significant losses, may miss significant opportunities, and may have increased exposure to the volatility of spot markets.

The accounting for NRG's hedging activities may increase the volatility in the Company's quarterly and annual financial results.

NRG engages in commodity-related marketing and price-risk management activities in order to financially hedge its exposure to market risk with respect to electricity sales from its generation assets, fuel utilized by those assets and emission allowances.

NRG generally attempts to balance its fixed-price physical and financial purchases and sales commitments in terms of contract volumes and the timing of performance and delivery obligations through the use of financial and physical derivative contracts. These derivatives are accounted for in accordance with the FASB ASC 815,Derivatives and Hedging,or ASC 815, which requires the Company to record all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value with changes in the fair value resulting from fluctuations in the underlying commodity prices immediately recognized in earnings, unless the derivative qualifies for cash flow hedge accounting treatment. Whether a derivative qualifies for cash flow hedge accounting treatment depends upon it meeting specific criteria used to determine if the cash flow hedge is and will remain appropriate for the term of the derivative. All economic hedges may not necessarily qualify for cash flow hedge accounting treatment. As a result, the Company's quarterly and annual results are subject to significant fluctuations caused by changes in market prices.

Competition in wholesale power markets may have a material adverse effect on NRG's results of operations, cash flows and the market value of its assets.

NRG has numerous competitors in all aspects of its business, and additional competitors may enter the industry. Because many of the Company's facilities are old, newer plants owned by the Company's competitors are often more efficient than NRG's aging plants, which may put some of the Company's plants at a competitive disadvantage to the extent the Company's competitors are able to consume the same or less fuel as the Company's plants consume. Over time, the Company's plants may be squeezed out of their markets or may be unable to compete with these more efficient plants.

In NRG's power marketing and commercial operations, NRG competes on the basis of its relative skills, financial position and access to capital with other providers of electric energy in the procurement of fuel and transportation services, and the sale of capacity, energy and related products. In order to compete successfully, the Company seeks to aggregate fuel supplies at competitive prices from different sources and locations and to efficiently utilize transportation services from third-party pipelines, railways and other fuel transporters and transmission services from electric utilities.










Other companies with which NRG competes may have greater liquidity, greater access to credit and other financial resources, lower cost structures, more effective risk management policies and procedures, greater ability to incur losses, longer-standing relationships with customers, greater potential for profitability from ancillary services or greater flexibility in the timing of their sale of generation capacity and ancillary services than NRG does.

NRG's competitors may be able to respond more quickly to new laws or regulations or emerging technologies, or to devote greater resources to the construction, expansion or refurbishment of their power generation facilities than NRG can. In addition, current and potential competitors may make strategic acquisitions or establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties. Accordingly, it is possible that new competitors or alliances among current and new competitors may emerge and rapidly gain significant market share. There can be no assurance that NRG will be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors, and any failure to do so would have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow.

Operation of power generation facilities involves significant risks and hazards customary to the power industry that could have a material adverse effect on NRG's revenues and results of operations, and NRG may not have adequate insurance to cover these risks and hazards.

Maintenance, expansion and refurbishment of power generation facilities involve significant risks that could result in unplanned power outages or reduced output and could have a material adverse effect on NRG's results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.

Many of NRG's facilities are old and require periodic maintenance and repair. Any unexpected failure, including failure associated with breakdowns, forced outages or any unanticipated capital expenditures could result in reduced profitability.

NRG cannot be certain of the level of capital expenditures that will be required due to changing environmental and safety laws (including changes in the interpretation or enforcement thereof), needed facility repairs and unexpected events (such as natural disasters or terrorist attacks). The unexpected requirement of large capital expenditures could have a material adverse effect on the Company's liquidity and financial condition.

If NRG significantly modifies a unit, the Company may be required to install the best available control technology or to achieve the lowest achievable emission rates as such terms are defined under the new source review provisions of the CAA, which would likely result in substantial additional capital expenditures.










The Company may incur additional costs or delays in the development, construction and operation of new plants, improvements to existing plants, or the implementation of environmental control equipment at existing plants and may not be able to recover their investment or complete the project.

The Company is developing or constructing new generation facilities, improving its existing facilities and adding environmental controls to its existing facilities. The development, construction, expansion, modification and refurbishment of power generation facilities involve many risks, including:

•inability to obtain sufficient funding on reasonable terms and/or necessary government financial incentives;

•delays in obtaining necessary permits and licenses;

•inability to sell down interests in a project or develop successful partnering relationships;

•environmental remediation of soil or groundwater at contaminated sites;

•interruptions to dispatch at the Company's facilities;

•supply interruptions;

•work stoppages;

•labor disputes;

•weather interferences;

•unforeseen engineering, environmental and geological problems, including those related to climate change;

•unanticipated cost overruns;

•exchange rate risks; and

•failure of contracting parties to perform under contracts, including EPC contractors.

Any of these risks could cause NRG's financial returns on new investments to be lower than expected or could cause the Company to operate below expected capacity or availability levels, which could result in lost revenues, increased expenses, higher maintenance costs and penalties. Insurance is maintained to protect against these risks, warranties are generally obtained for limited periods relating to the construction of each project and its equipment in varying degrees, and contractors and equipment suppliers are obligated to meet certain performance levels. The insurance, warranties or performance guarantees, however, may not be adequate to cover increased expenses. As a result, a project may cost more than projected and may be unable to fund principal and interest payments under its construction financing obligations, if any. A default under such a financing obligation could result in the Company losing its interest in a power generation facility.

Furthermore, where the Company has partnering relationships with a third party, the Company is subject to the viability and performance of the third party.  The Company's inability to find a replacement contracting party, particularly an EPC contractor, where the original contracting party has failed to perform, could result in the abandonment of the development and/or construction of such project, while the Company could remain obligated on other agreements associated with the project, including PPAs.

If the Company is unable to complete the development or construction of a facility or environmental control, or decides to delay, downsize, or cancel such project, it may not be able to recover its investment in that facility or environmental control.  Furthermore, if construction projects are not completed according to specification, the Company may incur liabilities and suffer reduced plant efficiency, higher operating costs and reduced net income.

NRG and its subsidiaries have guaranteed the performance of third parties, which may result in substantial costs in the event of non-performance.

NRG and its subsidiaries have issued certain guarantees of the performance of others, which obligate NRG and its subsidiaries to perform in the event that the third parties do not perform. In the event of non-performance by the third parties, NRG could incur substantial cost to fulfill their obligations under these guarantees. Such performance guarantees could have a material impact on the operating results, financial condition, or cash flows of the Company.










The Company's development programs are subject to financing and public policy risks that could adversely impact NRG's financial performance or result in the abandonment of such development projects.

While NRG currently intends to develop and finance its more capital intensive projects on a non-recourse or limited recourse basis through separate project financed entities and intends to seek additional investments in most of these projects from third parties, NRG anticipates that it will need to make significant equity investments in these projects. NRG may also decide to develop and finance some of the projects using corporate financial resources rather than non-recourse debt, which could subject NRG to significant capital expenditure requirements and to risks inherent in the development and construction of new generation facilities. In addition to providing some or all of the equity required to develop and build the proposed projects, NRG's ability to finance these projects on a non-recourse basis is contingent upon a number of factors, including the terms of the EPC contracts, construction costs, PPAs and fuel procurement contracts, capital markets conditions, the availability of tax credits and other government incentives for certain new technologies. To the extent NRG is not able to obtain non-recourse financing for any project or should credit rating agencies attribute a material amount of the project finance debt to NRG's credit, the financing of the development projects could have a negative impact on the credit ratings of NRG.

NRG may also choose to undertake the repowering, refurbishment or upgrade of current facilities based on the Company's assessment that such activity will provide adequate financial returns. Such projects often require several years of development and capital expenditures before commencement of commercial operations, and key assumptions underpinning a decision to make such an investment may prove incorrect, including assumptions regarding construction costs, timing, available financing and future fuel and power prices.

Furthermore, the viability of the Company's renewable development projects are contingent on public policy mechanisms including production and investment tax credits, cash grants, loan guarantees, accelerated depreciation tax benefits, renewable portfolio standards, or RPS, and carbon-related mandates or controls. These mechanisms have been implemented at the state and federal levels to support the development of renewable generation, demand-side and smart grid, and other clean infrastructure technologies. The availability and continuation of public policy support mechanisms will drive a significant part of the economics and viability of the Company's development program and expansion into clean energy investments.

The Company’s renewables business has a pipeline of projects across the utility scale and distributed generation markets, including both organically developed projects and projects acquired from third-parties.  If a number of the projects fail to proceed to construction or are not completed, the Company’s business, financial condition or operating results could be materially adversely affected.



The development process is long and includes many steps such as project siting, financing, construction, permitting, government approvals and the negotiation of project development agreements.  There can be no assurance that the projects in the Company’s renewables project pipeline will be completed on schedule or within budget, generate revenues, or receive the necessary financing for construction, among other risks. As the Company develops its renewables project pipeline, some of the projects in the pipeline may not be completed or proceed to construction as a result of various factors. These factors may include changes in applicable laws and regulations, including government incentives, environmental concerns regarding a project or changes in the economics related to a project, including the ability to finance a particular project. If a number of projects are not completed, the Company’s business, financial condition or operating results could be materially adversely affected.



Supplier and/or customer concentration at certain of NRG's facilities may expose the Company to significant financial credit or performance risks.

NRG often relies on a single contracted supplier or a small number of suppliers for the provision of fuel, transportation of fuel and other services required for the operation of certain of its facilities. If these suppliers cannot perform, the Company utilizes the marketplace to provide these services. There can be no assurance that the marketplace can provide these services as, when and where required or at comparable prices.

At times, NRG relies on a single customer or a few customers to purchase all or a significant portion of a facility's output, in some cases under long-term agreements that account for a substantial percentage of the anticipated revenue from a given facility. The Company has also hedged a portion of its exposure to power price fluctuations through forward fixed price power sales and natural gas price swap agreements. Counterparties to these agreements may breach or may be unable to perform their obligations. NRG may not be able to enter into replacement agreements on terms as favorable as its existing agreements, or at all. If the Company was unable to enter into replacement PPAs, the Company would sell its plants' power at market prices. If the Company is unable to enter into replacement fuel or fuel transportation purchase agreements, NRG would seek to purchase the Company's fuel requirements at market prices, exposing the Company to market price volatility and the risk that fuel and transportation may not be available during certain periods at any price.










The failure of any supplier or customer to fulfill its contractual obligations to NRG could have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial results. Consequently, the financial performance of the Company's facilities is dependent on the credit quality of, and continued performance by, suppliers and customers.

The Company's retail businesses may lose a significant number of retail customers due to competitive marketing activity by other retail electricity providers which could adversely affect the financial performance of the Company's retail businesses.

The Company's retail businesses face competition for customers.  Competitors may offer different products, lower prices, and other incentives, which may attract customers away from NRG's retail businesses.  In some retail electricity markets, the principal competitor may be the incumbent utility.  The incumbent utility has the advantage of long-standing relationships with its customers and strong brand recognition.  Furthermore, NRG's retail businesses may face competition from a number of other energy service providers, other energy industry participants, or nationally branded providers of consumer products and services, who may develop businesses that will compete with NRG and its retail businesses.

NRG relies on power transmission facilities that it does not own or control and that are subject to transmission constraints within a number of the Company's core regions. If these facilities fail to provide NRG with adequate transmission capacity, the Company may be restricted in its ability to deliver wholesale electric power to its customers and the Company may either incur additional costs or forego revenues. Conversely, improvements to certain transmission systems could also reduce revenues.

NRG depends on transmission facilities owned and operated by others to deliver the wholesale power it sells from the Company's power generation plants to its customers. If transmission is disrupted, or if the transmission capacity infrastructure is inadequate, NRG's ability to sell and deliver wholesale power may be adversely impacted. If a region's power transmission infrastructure is inadequate, the Company's recovery of wholesale costs and profits may be limited. If restrictive transmission price regulation is imposed, the transmission companies may not have sufficient incentive to invest in expansion of transmission infrastructure. The Company also cannot predict whether transmission facilities will be expanded in specific markets to accommodate competitive access to those markets.

In addition, in certain of the markets in which NRG operates, energy transmission congestion may occur and the Company may be deemed responsible for congestion costs if it schedules delivery of power between congestion zones during times when congestion occurs between the zones. If NRG were liable for such congestion costs, the Company's financial results could be adversely affected.

The Company has a significant amount of generation located in load pockets, making that generation valuable, particularly with respect to maintaining the reliability of the transmission grid. Expansion of transmission systems to reduce or eliminate these load pockets could negatively impact the value or profitability of the Company's existing facilities in these areas.

The Company’s use and enjoyment of real property rights for its projects may be adversely affected by the rights of lienholders and leaseholders that are superior to those of the grantors of those real property rights to the Company.



Solar and wind projects generally are, and are likely to be, located on land occupied by the project pursuant to long-term easements and leases. The ownership interests in the land subject to these easements and leases may be subject to mortgages securing loans or other liens (such as tax liens) and other easement and lease rights of third parties (such as leases of oil or mineral rights) that were created prior to the project’s easements and leases. As a result, the project’s rights under these easements or leases may be subject, and subordinate, to the rights of those third parties. The Company performs title searches and obtains title insurance to protect itself against these risks. Such measures may, however, be inadequate to protect the Company against all risk of loss of its rights to use the land on which the renewable projects are located, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition and results of operations.



One of the Company's subsidiaries, NRG Yield, Inc., is a publicly traded corporation, which may involve a greater exposure to legal liability than the Company's historic business operations.

One of the Company's subsidiaries is NRG Yield, Inc., a publicly traded corporation. NRG's controlling voting interest in NRG Yield, Inc. and the position of certain of its executive officers that are serving on the Board of Directors of NRG Yield, Inc. or as executive officers may increase the possibility of claims of breach of fiduciary duties including claims of conflicts of interest related to NRG Yield, Inc. Any liability resulting from such claims could have a material adverse effect on NRG's future business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.










Because NRG owns less than a majority of the ownership interests of some of its project investments, the Company cannot exercise complete control over their operations.

NRG has limited control over the operation of some project investments and joint ventures because the Company's investments are in projects where it beneficially owns less than a majority of the ownership interests. NRG seeks to exert a degree of influence with respect to the management and operation of projects in which it owns less than a majority of the ownership interests by negotiating to obtain positions on management committees or to receive certain limited governance rights, such as rights to veto significant actions. However, the Company may not always succeed in such negotiations. NRG may be dependent on its co-venturers to operate such projects. The Company's co-venturers may not have the level of experience, technical expertise, human resources management and other attributes necessary to operate these projects optimally. The approval of co-venturers also may be required for NRG to receive distributions of funds from projects or to transfer the Company's interest in projects.

NRG may be unable to integrate the operations of acquired entities in the manner expected.

NRG enters into acquisitions that result in various benefits, including, among other things, cost savings and operating efficiencies. Achieving the anticipated benefits of these acquisitions depends on whether the businesses can be integrated into NRG in an efficient and effective manner. The integration process could take longer than anticipated and could result in the loss of valuable employees, the disruption of NRG's businesses, processes and systems or inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures, practices, policies and compensation arrangements, any of which could adversely affect the Company's ability to achieve the anticipated benefits of the acquisitions. NRG may have difficulty addressing possible differences in corporate cultures and management philosophies. Failure to achieve these anticipated benefits could result in increased costs or decreases in the amount of expected revenues and could adversely affect NRG's future business, financial condition, operating results and prospects.

Future acquisition or disposition activities could involve unknown risks and may have materially adverse effects.

NRG's business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely impacted by strikes or work stoppages by its unionized employees or inability to replace employees as they retire.

As ofDecember 31, 2017, approximately24%of NRG's employees at its U.S. generation plants were covered by collective bargaining agreements. In the event that the Company's union employees strike, participate in a work stoppage or slowdown or engage in other forms of labor strife or disruption, NRG would be responsible for procuring replacement labor or the Company could experience reduced power generation or outages. Although NRG's ability to procure such labor is uncertain, contingency staffing planning is completed as part of each respective contract negotiations.  Strikes, work stoppages or the inability to negotiate future collective bargaining agreements on favorable terms could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, a number of the Company's employees at NRG's plants are close to retirement. The Company's inability to replace retiring workers could create potential knowledge and expertise gaps as such workers retire.

Changes in technology may impair the value of NRG's power plants.

Research and development activities are ongoing to provide alternative and more efficient technologies to produce power, including wind, photovoltaic (solar) cells, energy storage, and improvements in traditional technologies and equipment, such as more efficient gas turbines. Advances in these or other technologies could reduce the costs of power production to a level below what the Company has currently forecasted, which could adversely affect its cash flows, results of operations or competitive position.










The Company may potentially be affected by emerging technologies that may over time affect change in capacity markets and the energy industry overall with the inclusion of distributed generation and clean technology.

Some emerging technologies like distributed renewable energy technologies, broad consumer adoption of electric vehicles and energy storage devices could affect the price of energy.  These emerging technologies may affect the financial viability of utility counterparties and could have significant impacts on wholesale market prices, which could ultimately have a material adverse effect on NRG's financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

Risks that are beyond NRG's control, including but not limited to acts of terrorism or related acts of war, natural disaster, hostile cyber intrusions or other catastrophic events could  have a material adverse effect on NRG's financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

NRG's generation facilities and the facilities of third parties on which they rely may be targets of terrorist activities, as well as events occurring in response to or in connection with them, that could cause environmental repercussions and/or result in full or partial disruption of the facilities ability to generate, transmit, transport or distribute electricity or natural gas. Strategic targets, such as energy-related facilities, may be at greater risk of future terrorist activities than other domestic targets. Hostile cyber intrusions, including those targeting information systems as well as electronic control systems used at the generating plants and for the distribution systems, could severely disrupt business operations and result in loss of service to customers, as well as significant expense to repair security breaches or system damage. Any such environmental repercussions or disruption could result in a significant decrease in revenues or significant reconstruction or remediation costs, beyond what could be recovered through insurance policies which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, significant weather events or terrorist actions could damage or shut down the power transmission and distribution facilities upon which the Company's retail businesses are dependent. Power supply may be sold at a loss if these events cause a significant loss of retail customer load.

The operation of NRG’s businesses is subject to cyber-based security and integrity risk.

Numerous functions affecting the efficient operation of NRG’s businesses depend on the secure and reliable storage, processing and communication of electronic data and the use of sophisticated computer hardware and software systems. The operation of NRG’s generation plants, including STP, and of NRG's energy and fuel trading businesses rely on cyber-based technologies and, therefore, subject to the risk that such systems could be the target of disruptive actions, particularly through cyber-attack or cyber intrusion, including by computer hackers, foreign governments and cyber terrorists, or otherwise be compromised by unintentional events. As a result, operations could be interrupted, property could be damaged and sensitive customer information could be lost or stolen, causing NRG to incur significant losses of revenues, other substantial liabilities and damages, costs to replace or repair damaged equipment and damage to NRG's reputation. In addition, NRG may experience increased capital and operating costs to implement increased security for its cyber systems and plants.

The Company's retail businesses are subject to the risk that sensitive customer data may be compromised, which could result in an adverse impact to its reputation and/or the results of operations of the Company's retail businesses.

The Company's retail businesses require access to sensitive customer data in the ordinary course of business.  Examples of sensitive customer data are names, addresses, account information, historical electricity usage, expected patterns of use, payment history, credit bureau data, credit and debit card account numbers, driver's license numbers, social security numbers and bank account information.  NRG's retail businesses may need to provide sensitive customer data to vendors and service providers, who require access to this information in order to provide services, such as call center operations, to NRG's retail businesses.  If a significant breach occurred, the reputation of NRG and its retail businesses may be adversely affected, customer confidence may be diminished, or NRG and its retail businesses may be subject to legal claims, any of which may contribute to the loss of customers and have a negative impact on the business and/or results of operations.

Risks Related to Governmental Regulation and Laws

NRG's business is subject to substantial energy regulation and may be adversely affected by legislative or regulatory changes, as well as liability under, or any future inability to comply with, existing or future energy regulations or requirements.

NRG's business is subject to extensive U.S. federal, state and local laws and foreign laws. Compliance with the requirements under these legal and regulatory regimes may cause the Company to incur significant additional costs, and failure to comply with such requirements could result in the shutdown of a non-complying facility, the imposition of liens, fines, and/or civil or criminal liability.










Substantially all of the Company's generation assets are also subject to the reliability standards promulgated by the designated Electric Reliability Organization (currently NERC) and approved by FERC.  If NRG fails to comply with the mandatory reliability standards, NRG could be subject to sanctions, including substantial monetary penalties and increased compliance obligations. NRG is also affected by legislative and regulatory changes, as well as changes to market design, market rules, tariffs, cost allocations, and bidding rules that occur in the existing ISOs. The ISOs that oversee most of the wholesale power markets impose, and in the future may continue to impose, mitigation, including price limitations, offer caps, non-performance penalties and other mechanisms to address some of the volatility and the potential exercise of market power in these markets. These types of price limitations and other regulatory mechanisms may have a material adverse effect on the profitability of NRG's generation facilities that sell energy and capacity into the wholesale power markets.



NRG’s business may be affected by state interference in the competitive wholesale marketplace.

NRG’s legacy generation and competitive retail businesses rely on a competitive wholesale marketplace.  The competitive wholesale marketplace may be undermined by out-of-market subsidies provided by states or state entities, including bailouts of uneconomic nuclear plants, imports of power from Canada, renewable mandates or subsidies, as well as out-of-market payments to new generators.  These out-of-market subsidies to existing or new generation undermine the competitive wholesale marketplace, which can lead to premature retirement of existing facilities, including those owned by the Company.  If these measures continue, capacity and energy prices may be suppressed, and the Company may not be successful in its efforts to insulate the competitive market from this interference.

Government regulations providing incentives for renewable generation could change at any time and such changes may adversely impact NRG's business, revenues, margins, results of operations and cash flows.

The Company's growth strategy depends in part on government policies that support renewable generation and enhance the economic viability of owning renewable electric generation assets.  Renewable generation assets currently benefit from various federal, state and local governmental incentives such as ITCs, PTCs, cash grants in lieu of ITCs, loan guarantees, RPS programs, modified accelerated cost-recovery system of depreciation and bonus depreciation. For example, in December 2015, the U.S. Congress enacted an extension of the 30% solar ITC so that projects which began construction in 2016 through 2019 will continue to qualify for the 30% ITC.  Projects beginning construction in 2020 and 2021 will be eligible for the ITC at the rates of 26% and 22%, respectively.  The same legislation also extended the 10-year wind PTC for wind projects which began construction in 2016 through 2019.  Wind projects which begin construction in the years 2017, 2018 and 2019 are eligible for PTCs at 80%, 60% and 40% of the statutory rate per kWh, respectively.










Many states have adopted RPS programs mandating that a specified percentage of electricity sales come from eligible sources of renewable energy.  However, the regulations that govern the RPS programs, including pricing incentives for renewable energy, or reasonableness guidelines for pricing that increase valuation compared to conventional power (such as a projected value for carbon reduction or consideration of avoided integration costs), may change.  If the RPS requirements are reduced or eliminated, it could lead to fewer future power contracts or lead to lower prices for the sale of power in future power contracts, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's future growth prospects.

Such material adverse effects may result from decreased revenues, reduced economic returns on certain project company investments, increased financing costs, and/or difficulty obtaining financing. Furthermore, the ARRA included incentives to encourage investment in the renewable energy sector, such as cash grants in lieu of ITCs, bonus depreciation and expansion of the U.S. DOE loan guarantee program. It is uncertain what loan guarantees may be made by the U.S. DOE loan guarantee program in the future. In addition, the cash grant in lieu of ITCs program only applies to facilities that commenced construction prior to December 31, 2011, which commencement date may be determined in accordance with the safe harbor if more than 5% of the total cost of the eligible property was paid or incurred by December 31, 2011.

If the Company is unable to utilize various federal, state and local government incentives to acquire additional renewable assets in the future, or the terms of such incentives are revised in a manner that is less favorable to the Company, it may suffer a material adverse effect on the business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

The integration of the Capacity Performance product into the PJM market and the Pay-for-Performance mechanism in ISO-NE could lead to substantial changes in capacity income and non-performance penalties, which could have a material adverse effect on NRG’s results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.



Both ISO-NE and PJM operate a pay-for-performance model where capacity payments are modified based on real-time generator performance.  Capacity market prices are sensitive to design parameters, as well as additions of new capacity.  NRG may experience substantial changes in capacity income and non-performance penalties, which could have a material adverse effect on NRG’s results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.



Certain of NRG's long-term bilateral contracts result from state-mandated procurements and could be declared invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction.



A significant portion of NRG’s revenues are derived from long-term bilateral contracts with utilities that are regulated by their respective states, and have been entered into pursuant to certain state programs.  Certain long-term contracts that other companies have with state-regulated utilities have been challenged in federal court and have been declared unconstitutional on the grounds that the rate for energy and capacity established by the contracts impermissibly conflicts with the rate for energy and capacity established by FERC pursuant to the FPA. If certain of the Company's state-mandated agreements with utilities are ever held to be invalid, NRG may be unable to replace such contracts, which could have a material adverse effect on NRG's business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.



NRG's ownership interest in a nuclear power facility subjects the Company to regulations, costs and liabilities uniquely associated with these types of facilities.

Under the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, or AEA, ownership and operation of STP, of which NRG indirectly owns a 44% interest, is subject to regulation by the NRC.  Such regulation includes licensing, inspection, enforcement, testing, evaluation and modification of all aspects of nuclear reactor power plant design and operation, environmental and safety performance, technical and financial qualifications, decommissioning funding assurance and transfer and foreign ownership restrictions.  The current facility operating licenses for STP expire on August 20, 2047 (Unit 1) and December 15, 2048 (Unit 2).










There are unique risks to owning and operating a nuclear power facility.  These include liabilities related to the handling, treatment, storage, disposal, transport, release and use of radioactive materials, particularly with respect to spent nuclear fuel, and uncertainties regarding the ultimate, and potential exposure to, technical and financial risks associated with modifying or decommissioning a nuclear facility.  The NRC could require the shutdown of the plant for safety reasons or refuse to permit restart of the unit after unplanned or planned outages.  New or amended NRC safety and regulatory requirements may give rise to additional operation and maintenance costs and capital expenditures.  Additionally, aging equipment may require more capital expenditures to keep each of these nuclear power plants operating efficiently.  This equipment is also likely to require periodic upgrading and improvement.  Any unexpected failure, including failure associated with breakdowns, forced outages, or any unanticipated capital expenditures, could result in reduced profitability.  STP will be obligated to continue storing spent nuclear fuel if the U.S. DOE continues to fail to meet its contractual obligations to STP made pursuant to the U.S. Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 to accept and dispose of STP's spent nuclear fuel.  See also Item 1

—



Regulatory Matters — Nuclear Operations - Decommissioning Trusts

and Item 1

— Environmental Matters — Federal Environmental Initiatives — Nuclear Waste

for further discussion.  Costs associated with these risks could be substantial and could have a material adverse effect on NRG's results of operations, financial condition or cash flow to the extent not covered by the Decommissioning Trusts or recovered from ratepayers.  In addition, to the extent that all or a part of STP is required by the NRC to permanently or temporarily shut down or modify its operations, or is otherwise subject to a forced outage, NRG may incur additional costs to the extent it is obligated to provide power from more expensive alternative sources — either NRG's own plants, third party generators or the ERCOT — to cover the Company's then existing forward sale obligations.  Such shutdown or modification could also lead to substantial costs related to the storage and disposal of radioactive materials and spent nuclear fuel.

While STP maintains property and liability insurance for losses related to nuclear operations, there may be limitations on the amounts and types of insurance commercially available.  See also Item 15—Note 22,Commitments and Contingencies,Nuclear Insurance.  An accident at STP or another nuclear facility could have a material adverse effect on NRG's financial condition, its operational results, or liquidity as losses may exceed the insurance coverage available and/or may result in the obligation to pay retrospective premium obligations.

NRG is subject to environmental laws that impose extensive and increasingly stringent requirements on the Company's ongoing operations, as well as potentially substantial liabilities arising out of environmental contamination. These environmental requirements and liabilities could adversely impact NRG's results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

NRG is subject to the environmental laws of foreign and U.S., federal, state and local authorities.  The Company must comply with numerous environmental laws and obtain numerous governmental permits and approvals to build and operate the Company's plants.  Federal and state environmental laws generally have become more stringent over time, although this trend could slow or pause. Should NRG fail to comply with any environmental requirements that apply to its operations, the Company could be subject to administrative, civil and/or criminal liability and fines, and regulatory agencies could take other actions seeking to curtail the Company's operations.  In addition, when new requirements take effect or when existing environmental requirements are revised, reinterpreted or subject to changing enforcement policies, NRG's business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected.

NRG's businesses are subject to physical, market and economic risks relating to potential effects of climate change.

Climate change is producing changes in weather and other environmental conditions, including temperature and precipitation levels, and thus may affect consumer demand for electricity. In addition, the potential physical effects of climate change, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, floods and other climatic events, could disrupt NRG's operations and supply chain, and cause them to incur significant costs in preparing for or responding to these effects. These or other meteorological changes could lead to increased operating costs, capital expenses or power purchase costs. NRG's commercial and residential customers may also experience the potential physical impacts of climate change and may incur significant costs in preparing for or responding to these efforts, including increasing the mix and resiliency of their energy solutions and supply.

Climate change could also affect the availability of a secure and economical supply of water in some locations, which is essential for the continued operation of NRG's generation plants. Water risk is monitored by the risk owners (individual plant operators) and reported to Company management upon changes with a significance threshold of 20% in water consumption and withdrawal levels.   If it is determined that a water supply risk exists that could impact projected generation levels at any plant within the subsequent two year time frame, risk mitigation efforts are identified and economically evaluated for implementation. Water risk regarding the impact for barge delivery is evaluated on a daily basis, with contingency plans developed as needed.

GHG regulation could increase the cost of electricity generated by fossil fuels, and such increases could reduce demand for the power NRG generates and markets. Also, demand for NRG's energy-related services could be similarly impacted by consumers’ preferences or market factors favoring energy efficiency, low-carbon power sources or reduced electricity usage.










Policies at the national, regional and state levels to regulate GHG emissions, as well as mitigate climate change, could adversely impact NRG's results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

NRG's GHG emissions for2017can be found in Item 1,Business — Environmental Matters.In 2015, the EPA promulgated the final GHG emissions rules for new and existing fossil-fuel-fired electric generating units, which have been stayed by the U.S. Supreme Court and the EPA has proposed repealing.

The Company operates generating units in Connecticut, Delaware, Maryland, and New York that are subject to RGGI, which is a regional cap and trade system. In 2013, each of these states finalized a rule that reduced and will continue to reduce the number of allowances through 2020.  The nine RGGI states re-evaluated the program and published a model rule to further reduce the number of allowances. The revisions being currently contemplated could adversely impact NRG's results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

California has a CO2cap and trade program for electric generating units greater than 25 MW. The impact on the Company depends on the cost of the allowances and the ability to pass these costs through to customers.

Hazards customary to the power production industry include the potential for unusual weather conditions, which could affect fuel pricing and availability, the Company's route to market or access to customers,i.e., transmission and distribution lines, or critical plant assets. The contribution of climate change to the frequency or intensity of weather-related events could affect NRG's operations and planning process.

NRG's retail businesses are subject to changing state rules and regulations that could have a material impact on the profitability of its business lines.

The competitiveness of NRG's retail businesses partially depends on state regulatory policies that establish the structure, rules, terms and conditions on which services are offered to retail customers.  These state policies, which can include controls on the retail rates NRG's retail businesses can charge, the imposition of additional costs on sales, restrictions on the Company's ability to obtain new customers through various marketing channels and disclosure requirements, which can affect the competitiveness of NRG's retail businesses.  Additionally, state or federal imposition of net metering or RPS programs can make it more or less expensive for retail customers to supplement or replace their reliance on grid power.  NRG's retail businesses have limited ability to influence development of these policies, and its business model may be more or less effective, depending on changes to the regulatory environment.

The Company's international operations are exposed to political and economic risks, commercial instability and events beyond the Company's control in the countries in which it operates, which risks may negatively impact the Company's business.

The Company's international operations depend on products manufactured, purchased and sold in the U.S. and internationally, including in countries with political and economic instability.  In some cases, these countries have greater political and economic volatility and greater vulnerability to infrastructure and labor disruptions than in NRG's other markets.  The Company's business could be negatively impacted by adverse fluctuations in freight costs, limitations on shipping and receiving capacity, and other disruptions in the transportation and shipping infrastructure at important geographic points of exit and entry for the Company's products. Operating and seeking to expand business in a number of different regions and countries exposes the Company to a number of risks, including:

•multiple and potentially conflicting laws, regulations and policies that are subject to change;

•imposition of currency restrictions on repatriation of earnings or other restraints;

•imposition of burdensome tariffs or quotas;

•national and international conflict, including terrorist acts; and

•political and economic instability or civil unrest that may severely disrupt economic activity in affected countries.

The occurrence of one or more of these events may negatively impact the Company's business, results of operations and financial condition.










Risks Related to Economic and Financial Market Conditions

NRG's level of indebtedness could adversely affect its ability to raise additional capital to fund its operations or return capital to stockholders. It could also expose it to the risk of increased interest rates and limit its ability to react to changes in the economy or its industry.

NRG's substantial debt could have negative consequences, including:

•increasing NRG's vulnerability to general economic and industry conditions;

•requiring a substantial portion of NRG's cash flow from operations to be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on its indebtedness, therefore reducing NRG's ability to pay dividends to holders of its preferred or common stock or to use its cash flow to fund its operations, capital expenditures and future business opportunities;

•limiting NRG's ability to enter into long-term power sales or fuel purchases which require credit support;

•exposing NRG to the risk of increased interest rates because certain of its borrowings, including borrowings under its senior secured credit facility are at variable rates of interest;

•limiting NRG's ability to obtain additional financing for working capital including collateral postings, capital expenditures, debt service requirements, acquisitions and general corporate or other purposes; and

•limiting NRG's ability to adjust to changing market conditions and placing it at a competitive disadvantage compared to its competitors who have less debt.

The indentures for NRG's notes and senior secured credit facility contain financial and other restrictive covenants that may limit the Company's ability to return capital to stockholders or otherwise engage in activities that may be in its long-term best interests.  Furthermore, financial and other restrictive covenants contained in any project level subsidiary debt may limit the ability of NRG to receive distributions from such subsidiary. NRG's failure to comply with those covenants could result in an event of default which, if not cured or waived, could result in the acceleration of all of the Company's indebtedness.

In addition, NRG's ability to arrange financing, either at the corporate level, a non-recourse project-level subsidiary or otherwise, and the costs of such capital, are dependent on numerous factors, including:

•general economic and capital market conditions;

•credit availability from banks and other financial institutions;

•investor confidence in NRG, its partners and the regional wholesale power markets;

•NRG's financial performance and the financial performance of its subsidiaries;

•NRG's level of indebtedness and compliance with covenants in debt agreements;

•maintenance of acceptable credit ratings;

•cash flow; and

•provisions of tax and securities laws that may impact raising capital.

NRG may not be successful in obtaining additional capital for these or other reasons. The failure to obtain additional capital from time to time may have a material adverse effect on its business and operations.

Adverse economic conditions could adversely affect NRG’s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

Adverse economic conditions and declines in wholesale energy prices, partially resulting from adverse economic conditions, may impact NRG’s earnings. The breadth and depth of negative economic conditions may have a wide-ranging impact on the U.S. business environment, including NRG’s businesses. In addition, adverse economic conditions also reduce the demand for energy commodities. Reduced demand from negative economic conditions continues to impact the key domestic wholesale energy markets NRG serves. The combination of lower demand for power and increased supply of natural gas has put downward price pressure on wholesale energy markets in general, further impacting NRG’s energy marketing results. In general, economic and commodity market conditions will continue to impact NRG’s unhedged future energy margins, liquidity, earnings growth and overall financial condition. In addition, adverse economic conditions, declines in wholesale energy prices, reduced demand for power and other factors may negatively impact the trading price of NRG’s common stock and impact forecasted cash flows, which may require NRG to evaluate its goodwill and other long-lived assets for impairment. Any such impairment could have a material impact on NRG’s financial statements.










Goodwill and/or other intangible assets not subject to amortization that NRG has recorded in connection with its acquisitions are subject to mandatory annual impairment evaluations and as a result, the Company could be required to write off some or all of this goodwill and other intangible assets, which may adversely affect the Company's financial condition and results of operations.

In accordance with ASC 350,Intangibles — Goodwill and Other,or ASC 350, goodwill is not amortized but is reviewed annually or more frequently for impairment and other intangibles are also reviewed at least annually or more frequently, if certain conditions exist, and may be amortized. Any reduction in or impairment of the value of goodwill or other intangible assets will result in a charge against earnings which could materially adversely affect NRG's reported results of operations and financial position in future periods.

A valuation allowance may be required for NRG's deferred tax assets.

A valuation allowance may need to be recorded against the Company's remaining net deferred tax assets, which are predominantly related to NRG Yield, Inc., that the Company estimates as more likely than not to be unrealizable, based on available evidence including cumulative and forecasted pretax book earnings at the time the estimate is made.  Currently, the Company has recorded a valuation allowance of approximately$1.8 billionagainst NRG's net deferred tax assets that are not related to NRG Yield, Inc.  A valuation allowance related to deferred tax assets can be affected by changes to tax laws, statutory tax rates and future taxable income levels. In the event that the Company determines that it would not be able to realize all or a portion of its net deferred tax assets in the future, the Company would reduce such amounts accordingly through a charge to income tax expense in the period in which that determination was made, which could have a material adverse impact on the Company's financial condition and results of operations.

The Company has made investments, and may continue to make investments, in new business initiatives predominantly focused on consumer products and in markets that may not be successful, may not achieve the intended financial results or may result in product liability and reputational risk that could adversely affect the Company.

NRG continues to pursue growth in its existing businesses and markets and further diversification across the competitive energy value chain. NRG is continuing to pursue investment opportunities in renewables, consumer products and distributed generation.  Such initiatives may involve significant risks and uncertainties, including distraction of management from current operations, inadequate return on capital, and unidentified issues not discovered in the diligence performed prior to launching an initiative or entering a market.

As part of these initiatives, the Company may be liable to customers for any damage caused to customers’ homes, facilities, belongings or property during the installation of Company products and systems, such as residential solar systems and mass market back-up generators. In addition, shortages of skilled labor for Company projects could significantly delay a project or otherwise increase its costs.  The products that the Company sells or manufactures may expose the Company to product liability claims relating to personal injury, death, or environmental or property damage, and may require product recalls or other actions. Although the Company maintains liability insurance, the Company cannot be certain that its coverage will be adequate for liabilities actually incurred or that insurance will continue to be available to the Company on economically reasonable terms, or at all.  Further, any product liability claim or damage caused by the Company could significantly impair the Company’s brand and reputation, which may result in a failure to maintain customers and achieve the Company’s desired growth initiatives in these new businesses.

(a)Inter-segment sales and net derivative gains and losses included in operating revenues.



Energy revenue consists of revenues received from third parties as well as from the Company's retail businesses, for sales of electricity in the day-ahead and real-time markets, as well as bilateral sales.  It also includes energy sold through long-term PPAs for renewable facilities.  In addition, energy revenue includes revenues from the settlement of financial instruments and net realized trading revenues.

Capacity revenue consists of revenues received from a third party at either the market or negotiated contract rates for making installed generation capacity available in order to satisfy system integrity and reliability requirements.  Capacity revenue also includes revenues from the settlement of financial instruments.  In addition, capacity revenue includes revenues received under tolling arrangements, which entitle third parties to dispatch NRG's facilities and assume title to the electrical generation produced from that facility.

Retail revenue, representing operating revenues of NRG's retail businesses, consists of revenues from retail sales to residential, small business, commercial, industrial and governmental/institutional customers, revenues from the sale of excess supply into various markets, primarily in Texas, as well as product sales.

Mark-to-market for economic hedging activities includes asset-backed hedges that have not been designated as cash flow hedges and ineffectiveness on cash flow hedges.



Contract amortization revenue consists of the amortization of the intangible assets for net in-market C&I contracts established in connection with the acquisitions of Reliant Energy and Green Mountain Energy, as well as acquired power contracts, gas derivative instruments, and certain power sales agreements assumed at Fresh Start and Texas Genco purchase accounting dates related to the sale of electric capacity and energy in future periods.  These amounts are amortized into revenue over the term of the underlying contracts based on actual generation or contracted volumes.

Other revenues include revenues generated by the Thermal Business consisting of revenues received from the sale of steam, hot and chilled water generally produced at a central district energy plant and sold to commercial, governmental and residential buildings for space heating, domestic hot water heating and air conditioning.  It also includes the sale of high-pressure steam produced and delivered to industrial customers that is used as part of an industrial process.  Other revenues also consists of operations and maintenance fees, or O&M fees, construction management services, or CMA fees, sale of natural gas and emission allowances, and revenues from ancillary services. O&M fees consist of revenues received from providing certain unconsolidated affiliates with services under long-term operating agreements.  CMA fees are earned where NRG provides certain management and oversight of construction projects pursuant to negotiated agreements such as for the GenConn, Cedar Bayou 4 and certain solar construction projects.  Ancillary services are comprised of the sale of energy-related products associated with the generation of electrical energy such as spinning reserves, reactive power and other similar products.  Other revenues also include unrealized trading activities.

As you read this discussion and analysis, refer to NRG's Consolidated Statements of Operations to this Form 10-K, which presents the results of the Company's operations for the years endedDecember 31, 2017,2016, and2015, and also refer to Item 1 to this Form 10-K for more detailed discussion about the Company's business.

Executive Summary

NRG Energy, Inc., or NRG or the Company, is a leading integrated power company built on the strength of a diverse competitive electric generation portfolio and leading retail electricity platform.  NRG aims to create a sustainable energy future by producing, selling and delivering electricity and related products and services in major competitive power markets in the U.S. in a manner that delivers value to all of NRG's stakeholders. The Company owns and operates approximately30,000MW of generation; trades wholesale energy, capacity and related products; transacts in and trades fuel and transportation services; and directly sells energy, services, and innovative, sustainable products and services to retail customers under the names “NRG”, "Reliant" and other retail brand names owned by NRG.

Business Environment

The industry dynamics and external influences affecting the Company and its businesses, and the power generation and retail energy industry in general in2017and for the future medium term include:

Capacity Markets— Capacity markets are a major source of revenue for the Company.  Centralized capacity markets exist in ISO-NE, MISO, NYISO and PJM. Bilateral markets exist in CAISO and MISO.  These auctions are either an annual market held three years ahead of the delivery period as in the case of PJM and ISO-NE, or six months to one month ahead as in the case of NYISO.  Many variables affect the prices derived in these auctions.  These variables include the load forecast, the target reserve margin, rules surrounding demand response, capacity performance penalties, capacity imports and exports from the region, new generation entrants, slope of the demand curve, generation retirements, the cost of retrofitting old generation to meet new environmental rules, expected profitability of the units themselves in the energy market and various other auction rules.  In theory, a high capacity price indicates that the ISO doesn't have sufficient generation capacity against its needed reserve margin and new construction should enter the market.  Similarly, a low capacity price suggests the market is over-built and units should retire.  The Company has seen many swings in the pricing for capacity markets and the rules in many of the markets are undergoing significant changes, as discussed in thisManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.

Commodities Markets— The price of natural gas plays an important role in setting the price of electricity in many of the regions where NRG operates power plants.  Natural gas prices are driven by variables including demand from the industrial, residential, and electric sectors, productivity across natural gas supply basins, costs of natural gas production, changes in pipeline infrastructure, and the financial and hedging profile of natural gas consumers and producers.  In2017, average natural gas prices at Henry Hub were 26.3% higher than in2016.

If long-term gas prices decrease, the Company is likely to encounter lower realized energy prices, leading to lower energy revenues as higher priced hedge contracts mature and are replaced by contracts with lower gas and power prices.  NRG's retail gross margins have historically improved as natural gas prices decline and are likely to partially offset the impact of declining gas prices on conventional wholesale power generation.  To further mitigate this impact, NRG may increase its percentage of coal and nuclear capacity sold forward using a variety of hedging instruments, as described under the heading "Energy-Related Commodities" in Item 15 —Note 5,Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities,to the Consolidated Financial Statements.










Natural gas prices are a primary driver of coal demand.  The low priced commodity environment has stressed coal equities, leading coal suppliers to file for bankruptcy protection, launch debt exchanges, rationalize assets, and cut production.  If multiple parties withdraw from the market, liquidity could be challenged in the short term.  Inventory overhang will be utilized to offset production losses.  Coal prices are typically affected by the price of natural gas.

Electricity Prices— The price of electricity is a key determinant of the profitability of the Company.  Many variables such as the price of different fuels, weather, load growth and unit availability all coalesce to impact the final price for electricity and the Company's profitability. The following table summarizes average on-peak power prices for each of the major markets in which NRG operates for the years endedDecember 31, 2017,2016, and2015.  For the year endedDecember 31, 2017as compared to the same period in2016, the average on-peak power prices increased primarily due to the increase in natural gas prices.  For the year endedDecember 31, 2016as compared to the same period in2015the average on-peak power prices decreased primarily due to the decrease in natural gas prices.

Environmental Regulatory Landscape

Environmental Matters

, for further discussion.

Public Policy Support and Government Financial Incentives for Clean Infrastructure Development— Policy mechanisms including production and investment tax credits, cash grants, loan guarantees, accelerated depreciation tax benefits, RPS, and carbon trading plans have been implemented at the state and federal levels to support the development of renewable generation, demand-side and smart grid, and other clean infrastructure technologies.  The availability and continuation of public policy support mechanisms will drive a significant part of the economics of the Company's development program.  In December 2015, the U.S. Congress enacted an extension of the 30% solar ITC so that projects that began construction in 2016 through 2019 will continue to qualify for the 30% ITC.  Projects beginning construction in 2020 and 2021 will be eligible for the ITC at the rates of 26% and 22% respectively.  The same legislation also extended the 10 year wind PTC for wind projects that began construction in years 2016 through 2019.  Wind projects that begin construction in the years 2017, 2018 and 2019 are eligible for PTC at 80%, 60% and 40% of the statutory rate per kilowatt hour respectively.

Weather— Weather conditions in the regions of the U.S. in which NRG does business influence the Company's financial results.  Weather conditions can affect the supply and demand for electricity and fuels.  Weather may also impact the availability of the Company's generating assets.  Changes in energy supply and demand may impact the price of these energy commodities in both the spot and forward markets, which may affect the Company's results in any given period. Typically, demand for and the price of electricity is higher in the summer and the winter seasons, when temperatures are more extreme. The demand for and price of natural gas is also generally higher in the winter.  However, all regions of the U.S. typically do not experience extreme weather conditions at the same time, thus NRG is typically not exposed to the effects of extreme weather in all parts of its business at once.

Wind and Solar Resource Availability— The availability of the wind and solar resources affects the financial performance of the wind and solar facilities, which may impact the Company’s overall financial performance. Due to the variable nature of the wind and solar resources, the Company cannot predict the availability of the wind and solar resources and the potential variances from expected performance levels from quarter to quarter. To the extent the wind and solar resources are not available at expected levels, it could have a negative impact on the Company’s financial performance for such periods.

ERCOT Retirements— A number of announced retirement notices of coal generating facilities owned by others in Texas could lower reserve margins in ERCOT. This trend of retirement notices could have an effect on the Company’s results of operations and future business performance, particularly in the ERCOT market.

Net Impact of Tax Reform— The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, or the Tax Act, which was signed into law on December 22, 2017, makes significant changes to the taxation of U.S. businesses.  These changes include a permanent reduction to the federal corporate income tax rate, changes in the deductibility of interest on certain debt obligations and limiting the amount of NOL available to offset taxable income, among other things.  The Tax Act requires the Company to revalue its deferred tax assets, which reduced the Company’s deferred tax assets by $733 million offset by valuation allowance of $660 million.  In addition, the Company established a non-current receivable for its refundable AMT credits of $64 million, net of sequestration.  The net impact of the Tax Act on net income is a decrease of $9 million due to the expense of $73 million resulting from the Company's revaluation of its net deferred tax asset, partially offset by a $64 million benefit from establishing the AMT credit receivable.










Other Factors— A number of other factors significantly influence the level and volatility of prices for energy commodities and related derivative products for NRG's business.  These factors include:

•seasonal, daily and hourly changes in demand;

•extreme peak demands;

•available supply resources;

•transportation and transmission availability and reliability within and between regions;

•location of NRG's generating facilities relative to the location of its load-serving opportunities;

•procedures used to maintain the integrity of the physical electricity system during extreme conditions; and

•changes in the nature and extent of federal and state regulations.

These factors can affect energy commodity and derivative prices in different ways and to different degrees.  These effects may vary throughout the country as a result of regional differences in:

•weather conditions;

•market liquidity;

•capability and reliability of the physical electricity and gas systems;

•During 2017, NRG received cash proceeds from asset sales in the amount of $150 million, which includes the sales to NRG Yield, Inc. (also included below in Transfers of Assets Under Common Control) and sale of Minnesota wind projects to third parties.

•On February 6, 2018, NRG entered into a purchase and sale agreement with GIP to sell NRG's ownership in NRG Yield, Inc. and NRG's renewables platform for a total purchase price of $1.375 billion, subject to certain conditions.

•On February 6, 2018, NRG entered into a purchase and sale agreement with Cleco to sell NRG's South Central business for a total purchase price of $1.0 billion, subject to certain adjustments.

•On January 24, 2018, the Company entered into an agreement with NRG Yield, Inc. to sell 100% of its ownership interest in Buckthorn Solar for cash consideration of $42 million, subject to other adjustments.

•On February 6, 2018, the Company entered into an agreement with NRG Yield, Inc. to sell 100% of the membership interests in Carlsbad Energy Holdings LLC, which owns the Carlsbad project, a 527 MW natural gas fired project in Carlsbad, CA, pursuant to the ROFO Agreement.

In addition, the Company established a non-current receivable for its refundable AMT credits of $64 million, net of sequestration.  The net impact of the Tax Act on net income is a decrease of $9 million primarily due to the expense of $73 million resulting from the Company's revaluation of its net deferred tax asset, partially offset by a $64 million benefit from establishing the AMT credit receivable.

Transfers of Assets Under Common Control

•During 2017, the Company completed the sale of several projects totaling 555 MW to NRG Yield, Inc. for aggregate cash consideration of approximately $245 million, as discussed in more detail in Item 15—Note 3,Discontinued Operations, Acquisitions and Dispositions, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Gross Margin

The Company calculates gross margin in order to evaluate operating performance as operating revenues less cost of sales, which includes cost of fuel, other costs of sales, contract and emission credit amortization and mark-to-market for economic hedging activities.

Economic Gross Margin

In addition to gross margin, the Company evaluates its operating performance using the measure of economic gross margin, which is not a GAAP measure and may not be comparable to other companies’ presentations or deemed more useful than the GAAP information provided elsewhere in this report.  Economic gross margin should be viewed as a supplement to and not a substitute for the Company's presentation of gross margin, which is the most directly comparable GAAP measure.  Economic gross margin is not intended to represent gross margin.  The Company believes that economic gross margin is useful to investors as it is a key operational measure reviewed by the Company's chief operating decision maker.  Economic gross margin is defined as the sum of energy revenue, capacity revenue and other revenue, less cost of fuels and other cost of sales.

Economic gross margin does not include mark-to-market gains or losses on economic hedging activities, contract amortization, emission credit amortization, or other operating costs.

The tables below present the composition and reconciliation of gross margin and economic gross margin which reflects the Company's current view of reporting segments for the years endedDecember 31, 2017and2016:

Retail gross margin decreased$214 millionand economic gross margin decreased$32 millionfor the year endedDecember 31, 2017, compared to the same period in2016, due to:

(In millions)Lower gross margin due to lower rates to customers driven by customer product, term, and mix of $103 million or approximately $1.60 per MWh, partially offset by lower supply costs of $28 million or approximately $0.50 per MWh driven primarily by a decrease in power prices at the time of procurement$(75)Lower gross margin due to milder weather conditions in 2017 as compared to 2016 resulting in a reduction in load of  350,000 MWh(11)Lower gross margin related to the impact of Hurricane Harvey in 2017, driven by $9 million due to a reduction in load of 200,000 MWh, and the unfavorable impact of selling back excess supply along with $7 million of customer relief(16)Higher gross margin driven by higher average customer counts of 85,000 along with higher average usage due to customer mix70Decrease in economic gross margin$(32)Decrease in mark-to-market for economic hedging primarily due to net unrealized gains/losses on open positions related to economic hedges(188)Increase in contract and emission credit amortization6Decrease in gross margin$(214)





Renewables gross margin and economic gross margin

Renewables gross margin increased$17 millionand economic gross margin increased$22 millionfor the year endedDecember 31, 2017, compared to the same period in2016,  primarily driven by new distributed generation solar projects placed in service, increased margin in operations and maintenance agreements which focus on servicing NRG Yield assets and receipt of insurance proceeds offsetting lower volume at the Ivanpah solar plant.












NRG Yield gross margin and economic gross margin

NRG Yield gross margin decreased$22 millionand economic gross margin decreased$28 millionfor the year endedDecember 31, 2017, compared to the same period in2016,  primarily due to a 5% decrease in volume generated at our Alta Wind and NRG Wind TE Holdco projects, due to lower wind resources.

(a) Represents the elimination of the intercompany activity between Retail and Generation.

Mark-to-market results consist of unrealized gains and losses on contacts that are yet to be settled.  The settlement of these transactions is reflected in the same revenue or cost caption as the items being hedged.

The reversals of acquired gain or loss positions were valued based upon the forward prices on the acquisition date.

For the year ended December 31, 2017, the $239 million gain in operating revenues from economic hedge positions was driven primarily by the reversal of previously recognized unrealized losses on contracts that settled during the period and an increase in value of open positions as a result of decreases in gas prices.  The $46 million loss in operating costs and expenses from economic hedge positions was driven primarily by the reversal of previously recognized unrealized gains on contracts that settled during the period partially offset by an increase in the value of open positions as a result of increases in ERCOT heat rate.



In accordance with ASC 815, the following table represents the results of the Company's financial and physical trading of energy commodities for the years endedDecember 31, 2017and2016.

Gross Margin

The Company calculates gross margin in order to evaluate operating performance as operating revenues less cost of sales, which includes cost of fuel, other costs of sales, contract and emission credit amortization and mark-to-market for economic hedging activities.

Economic Gross Margin

In addition to gross margin, the Company evaluates its operating performance using the measure of economic gross margin, which is not a GAAP measure and may not be comparable to other companies’ presentations or deemed more useful than the GAAP information provided elsewhere in this report.  Economic gross margin should be viewed as a supplement to and not a substitute for the Company's presentation of gross margin, which is the most directly comparable GAAP measure.  Economic gross margin is not intended to represent gross margin.  The Company believes that economic gross margin is useful to investors as it is a key operational measure reviewed by the Company's chief operating decision maker.  Economic gross margin is defined as the sum of energy revenue, capacity revenue and other revenue, less cost of fuels and other cost of sales.

Economic gross margin does not include mark-to-market gains or losses on economic hedging activities, contract amortization, emission credit amortization, or other operating costs.

The tables below present the composition and reconciliation of gross margin and economic gross margin which reflects the Company's current view of reporting segments for the years endedDecember 31, 2016and2015:

Mark-to-market results consist of unrealized gains and losses on contracts that are not yet settled. The settlement of these transactions is reflected in the same revenue or cost caption as the items being hedged.

The reversals of acquired gain or loss positions were valued based upon the forward prices on the acquisition date.

For the year endedDecember 31, 2016, the$642 millionloss in operating revenues from economic hedge positions was driven primarily by the reversal of previously recognized unrealized gains on contracts that settled during the period and a decrease in value of open positions as a result of increases in gas prices. The$508 milliongain in operating costs and expenses from economic hedge positions was driven primarily by the reversal of previously recognized unrealized losses on contracts that settled during the period and an increase in the value of open positions as a result of increases in coal and gas prices partially offset by the reversal of acquired contracts.

In accordance with ASC 815, the following table represents the results of the Company's financial and physical trading of energy commodities for the years endedDecember 31, 2016and2015.

NRG's interest expense decreased by$42 millionfor the year endedDecember 31, 2016, compared to the same period in2015, due to the following:

The effective tax rate was(0.5)%and(27.0)%for the years endedDecember 31, 2016and2015, respectively.

For the year endedDecember 31, 2016, NRG's overall effective tax rate was different than the statutory rate of 35% primarily due to recording of a valuation allowance on the federal and certain state net deferred tax assets that may not be realizable under a “more likely than not” measurement. In addition, a portion of the book goodwill impairment is classified as a permanent reversal impacting the effective tax rate.

The effective income tax rate may vary from period to period depending on, among other factors, the geographic and business mix of earnings and losses and changes in valuation allowances in accordance with ASC 740.

First Lien Structure

NRG has granted first liens to certain counterparties on a substantial portion of the Company's assets, excluding assets acquired in the GenOn and EME (including Midwest Generation) acquisitions, assets held by NRG Yield, Inc. and NRG's assets that have project-level financing.  NRG uses the first lien structure to reduce the amount of cash collateral and letters of credit that it would otherwise be required to post from time to time to support its obligations under out-of-the-money hedge agreements for forward sales of power or gas used as a proxy for power.  To the extent that the underlying hedge positions for a counterparty are out-of-the-money to NRG, the counterparty would have claim under the first lien program.  The first lien program limits the volume that can be hedged, not the value of underlying out-of-the-money positions.  The first lien program does not require NRG to post collateral above any threshold amount of exposure.  Within the first lien structure, the Company can hedge up to 80% of its coal and nuclear capacity and 10% of its other assets with these counterparties for the first 60 months and then declining thereafter.  Net exposure to a counterparty on all trades must be positively correlated to the price of the relevant commodity for the first lien to be available to that counterparty.  The first lien structure is not subject to unwind or termination upon a ratings downgrade of a counterparty and has no stated maturity date.

The Company's first lien counterparties may have a claim on its assets to the extent market prices exceed the hedged prices.  As ofDecember 31, 2017, all hedges under the first liens werein-the-moneyon a counterparty aggregate basis.

The following table summarizes the amount of MW hedged against the Company's coal and nuclear assets and as a percentage relative to the Company's coal and nuclear capacity under the first lien structure as ofDecember 31, 2017:

Equivalent Net Sales Secured by First Lien Structure(a)2018201920202021In MW719———As a percentage of total net coal and nuclear capacity(b)13%—%—%—%

(a)Equivalent Net Sales include natural gas swaps converted using a weighted average heat rate by region.

(b)Net coal and nuclear capacity represents 80% of the Company's total coal and nuclear assets eligible under the first lien, which excludes coal assets acquired in the GenOn  and EME (including Midwest Generation) acquisitions, assets in NRG Yield, Inc. and NRG's assets that have project-level financing.












Uses of Liquidity

The Company's requirements for liquidity and capital resources, other than for operating its facilities, can generally be categorized by the following: (i) commercial operations activities; (ii) debt service obligations, as described more fully in Item 15 —Note 12,Debt and Capital Leases, to the Consolidated Financial Statements; (iii) capital expenditures, including repowering and renewable development, and environmental; and (iv) allocations in connection with acquisition opportunities, debt repayments, return of capital and dividend payments to stockholders, as described in Item 15 —Note 15,Capital Structure, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Restructuring Support Agreement

As described in

Note 3

,

Discontinued Operations, Acquisitions and Dispositions

, NRG, the GenOn Entities and certain holders of the GenOn and GenOn Americas Generation Senior Notes entered into a Restructuring Support Agreement that provides for a restructuring and recapitalization of GenOn through a prearranged plan of reorganization.  Certain principal terms of the Restructuring Support Agreement include that NRG will provide settlement consideration to GenOn of $261.3 million, which will be paid in cash less any amounts owed to NRG under the intercompany secured revolving credit facility. As of June 30, 2017, GenOn owed NRG approximately $125 million under the intercompany secured revolving credit facility. NRG agreed to provide GenOn with a letter of credit facility during the pendency of the Chapter 11 Cases, to be utilized for required letters of credit in lieu of the intercompany secured revolving credit facility. GenOn can no longer utilize the intercompany secured revolving credit facility and, on July 27, 2017, the letter of credit facility was terminated, as GenOn has obtained a separate letter of credit facility with a third party financial institution. In addition, NRG will retain the pension liability for GenOn employees for service provided prior to the completion of the reorganization. GenOn’s net pension liability as of

December 31, 2017

, was approximately

$92 million

. NRG will also retain the liability for GenOn’s post-employment and retiree health and welfare benefits, in an amount up to $25 million, which was recorded as a liability as of

December 31, 2017

.

Commercial Operations

The Company's commercial operations activities require a significant amount of liquidity and capital resources. These liquidity requirements are primarily driven by: (i) margin and collateral posted with counterparties; (ii) margin and collateral required to participate in physical markets and commodity exchanges; (iii) timing of disbursements and receipts (i.e. buying fuel before receiving energy revenues); (iv) initial collateral for large structured transactions; and (v) collateral for project development.  As ofDecember 31, 2017, commercial operations had total cash collateral outstanding of$187 millionand$515 millionoutstanding in letters of credit to third parties primarily to support its commercial activities for both wholesale and retail transactions.   As ofDecember 31, 2017, total collateral held from counterparties was$38 millionin cash and$17 millionof letters of credit.

Future liquidity requirements may change based on the Company's hedging activities and structures, fuel purchases, and future market conditions, including forward prices for energy and fuel and market volatility. In addition, liquidity requirements are dependent on the Company's credit ratings and general perception of its creditworthiness.

2017 Senior Note Redemptions

During the year ended  December 31, 2017, the Company redeemed $1.5 billion in aggregate principal of its Senior Notes for $1.5 billion, which included accrued interest of $29 million.

NRG's current contracts with the Company's rural electrical customers in the Gulf Coast region allow for recovery of a portion of the region's capital costs once in operation, along with a capital return incurred by complying with any change in law, including interest over the asset life of the required expenditures.  The actual recoveries will depend, among other things, on the timing of the completion of the capital projects and the remaining duration of the contracts.












Common Stock Dividends

The following table lists the dividends paid during 2017:

Fourth Quarter 2017Third Quarter 2017Second Quarter 2017First Quarter 2017Dividends per Common Share$0.030$0.030$0.030$0.030

OnJanuary 19, 2018, NRG declared a quarterly dividend on the Company's common stock of$0.03per share, or$0.12per share on an annualized basis, payable onFebruary 15, 2018, to stockholders of record as ofFebruary 1, 2018.  The Company's common stock dividends are subject to available capital, market conditions, and compliance with associated laws and regulations.    The Company expects that, based on current circumstances, comparable cash dividends will continue to be paid in the foreseeable future.

Share Repurchases

The Company’s board of directors has authorized the repurchase of up to $1 billion of the Company's common stock, with the first $500 million program to begin in the first quarter of 2018.  Following completion of the initial program, and as NRG progresses towards the closing of the announced asset sales, the Company expects to execute the remaining $500 million of the $1 billion share repurchase program.

Fuel Repowerings

Carlsbad—The Company is currently overseeing construction of the Carlsbad project, which when completed will consist of approximately 527 MWs of net generation capacity.   On February 6, 2018, the Company entered into an agreement with NRG Yield, Inc. to sell the Carlsbad project pursuant to the ROFO Agreement. The transaction is expected to close during the fourth quarter of 2018.

Canal 3— The Company is currently overseeing construction of the Canal 3 project, a dual-fueled peaking facility, which when completed will consist of approximately 333 MWs of net generating capacity.  In January 2018, Final Notice To Proceed was issued, and construction commenced with an anticipated COD by summer 2019.  Under a cooperation agreement with GenOn, GenOn has the right to purchase the project from NRG until March 31, 2018.

Puente Power Project— On October 5, 2017, the California Energy Commission, or CEC, the agency responsible for permitting the Puente Power Project, issued a statement on behalf of the committee of two Commissioners overseeing the permitting process stating their intention to issue a proposed decision that would deny a permit for the Puente Power Project. On October 16, 2017, NRG filed a motion to suspend the permitting proceeding for at least six months, which was granted on November 3, 2017.  During the six month suspension period, which could be extended, NRG will evaluate the progress of a procurement process initiated by SCE to replace the Puente Power Project.

NOLs, Deferred Tax Assets and Uncertain Tax Position Implications, under ASC 740

As ofDecember 31, 2017, the Company had domestic pre-tax book loss of$1,557 millionand foreign pre-tax book income of$17 million.  For the year endedDecember 31, 2017, the Company generated an NOL of$630 milliondue to a current year taxable loss.  As ofDecember 31, 2017, the Company has cumulative domestic federal NOL carryforwards of$2.8 billion, which will begin expiring in 2026 and cumulative state NOL carryforwards of$2.2 billionfor financial statement purposes.  In addition, NRG has cumulative foreign NOL carryforwards of$224 million, which do not have an expiration date.  As a result of the Company's tax position, including the benefit of a worthless stock deduction of $9.5 billion upon GenOn emerging from bankruptcy and upon evaluation of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act potential impact on taxable income and based on current forecasts, the Company anticipates income tax payments, primarily due to state and local jurisdictions, of up to$20 millionin 2018.

The Company has recorded a long term receivable of $64 million representing refundable alternative minimum tax credits from the IRS, net of sequestration, which are anticipated to be received from 2019 through 2022 pursuant to the 50% annual limitation as enacted by the Tax Act upon repeal of corporate AMT effective January 1, 2018.

In addition to these amounts, the Company has$30 millionof tax effected uncertain tax benefits for which the Company has recorded a non-current tax liability of$33 millionuntil such final resolution with the related taxing authority. The$33 millionnon-current tax liability for uncertain tax benefits is from positions taken on various state returns, including accrued interest.

The Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal income tax examinations for years prior to 2015.  With few exceptions, state and local income tax examinations are no longer open for years before 2010.



Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

Obligations under Certain Guarantee Contracts

NRG and certain of its subsidiaries enter into guarantee arrangements in the normal course of business to facilitate commercial transactions with third parties. These arrangements include financial and performance guarantees, stand-by letters of credit, debt guarantees, surety bonds and indemnifications. See also Item 15 —Note 26,Guarantees,to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion.

Retained or Contingent Interests

NRG does not have any material retained or contingent interests in assets transferred to an unconsolidated entity.

Obligations Arising Out of a Variable Interest in an Unconsolidated Entity

Variable interest in Equity investments— As ofDecember 31, 2017, NRG has several investments with an ownership interest percentage of 50% or less in energy and energy-related entities that are accounted for under the equity method of accounting. Several of these investments are variable interest entities for which NRG is not the primary beneficiary.

NRG's pro-rata share of non-recourse debt held by unconsolidated affiliates was approximately$606 millionas ofDecember 31, 2017.  This indebtedness may restrict the ability of these subsidiaries to issue dividends or distributions to NRG. See also Item 15 —Note 16,Investments Accounted for by the Equity Method and Variable Interest Entities,to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion.










Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments

NRG has a variety of contractual obligations and other commercial commitments that represent prospective cash requirements in addition to the Company's capital expenditure programs. The following tables summarize NRG's contractual obligations and contingent obligations for guarantees. See also Item 15 —Note 12,Debt and Capital Leases,Note 22,Commitments and Contingencies, andNote 26,Guarantees, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion.

Fair Value of Derivative Instruments

NRG may enter into power purchase and sales contracts, fuel purchase contracts and other energy-related financial instruments to mitigate variability in earnings due to fluctuations in spot market prices and to hedge fuel requirements at generation facilities or retail load obligations. In addition, in order to mitigate interest rate risk associated with the issuance of the Company's variable rate and fixed rate debt, NRG enters into interest rate swap agreements.

NRG's trading activities are subject to limits in accordance with the Company's Risk Management Policy. These contracts are recognized on the balance sheet at fair value and changes in the fair value of these derivative financial instruments are recognized in earnings.

The tables below disclose the activities that include both exchange and non-exchange traded contracts accounted for at fair value in accordance with ASC 820,Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures, or ASC 820. Specifically, these tables disaggregate realized and unrealized changes in fair value; disaggregate estimated fair values atDecember 31, 2017, based on their level within the fair value hierarchy defined in ASC 820; and indicate the maturities of contracts atDecember 31, 2017.  For a full discussion of the Company's valuation methodology of its contracts, seeDerivative Fair Value Measurementsin Item 15 —Note 4,Fair Value of Financial Instruments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

The Company has elected to disclose derivative assets and liabilities on a trade-by-trade basis and does not offset amounts at the counterparty master agreement level. Also, collateral received or posted on the Company's derivative assets or liabilities are recorded on a separate line item on the balance sheet. Consequently, the magnitude of the changes in individual current and non-current derivative assets or liabilities is higher than the underlying credit and market risk of the Company's portfolio. As discussed in Item 7A— Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk, Commodity Price Risk, NRG measures the sensitivity of the Company's portfolio to potential changes in market prices using VaR, a statistical model which attempts to predict risk of loss based on market price and volatility. NRG's risk management policy places a limit on one-day holding period VaR, which limits the Company's net open position.  As the Company's trade-by-trade derivative accounting results in a gross-up of the Company's derivative assets and liabilities, the net derivative assets and liability position is a better indicator of NRG's hedging activity.  As ofDecember 31, 2017, NRG's net derivative asset was$46 million, an increase to total fair value of$174 millionas compared toDecember 31, 2016.  This increase was primarily driven by gains in fair value and roll off trades that were settled during the period, partially offset by derivatives reclassified to held for sale.

Based on a sensitivity analysis using simplified assumptions, the impact of a $0.50 per MMBtu increase in natural gas prices across the term of the derivative contracts would result in an increase of approximately$64 millionin the net value of derivatives as ofDecember 31, 2017.

The impact of a $0.50 per MMBtu decrease in natural gas prices across the term of the derivative contracts would result in a decrease of approximately$67 millionin the net value of derivatives as ofDecember 31, 2017.












Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

NRG's discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations are based upon the Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements and related disclosures in compliance with GAAP requires the application of appropriate technical accounting rules and guidance as well as the use of estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. The application of these policies involves judgments regarding future events, including the likelihood of success of particular projects, legal and regulatory challenges, and the fair value of certain assets and liabilities. These judgments, in and of themselves, could materially affect the financial statements and disclosures based on varying assumptions, which may be appropriate to use. In addition, the financial and operating environment may also have a significant effect, not only on the operation of the business, but on the results reported through the application of accounting measures used in preparing the financial statements and related disclosures, even if the nature of the accounting policies have not changed.

On an ongoing basis, NRG evaluates these estimates, utilizing historic experience, consultation with experts and other methods the Company considers reasonable. In any event, actual results may differ substantially from the Company's estimates. Any effects on the Company's business, financial position or results of operations resulting from revisions to these estimates are recorded in the period in which the information that gives rise to the revision becomes known.

NRG's significant accounting policies are summarized in Item 15 —Note 2,Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to the consolidated financial statements. The Company identifies its most critical accounting policies as those that are the most pervasive and important to the portrayal of the Company's financial position and results of operations, and that require the most difficult, subjective and/or complex judgments by management regarding estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain.

Derivative Instruments

The Company follows the guidance of ASC 815 to account for derivative instruments. ASC 815 requires the Company to mark-to-market all derivative instruments on the balance sheet and recognize changes in the fair value of non-hedge derivative instruments immediately in earnings.  In certain cases, NRG may apply hedge accounting to the Company's derivative instruments. The criteria used to determine if hedge accounting treatment is appropriate are: (i) the designation of the hedge to an underlying exposure; (ii) whether the overall risk is being reduced; and (iii) if there is a correlation between the changes in fair value of the derivative instrument and the underlying hedged item.  Changes in the fair value of derivatives instruments accounted for as hedges are deferred and recorded as a component of OCI and subsequently recognized in earnings when the hedged transactions occur.

For purposes of measuring the fair value of derivative instruments, NRG uses quoted exchange prices and broker quotes.  When external prices are not available, NRG uses internal models to determine the fair value.  These internal models include assumptions of the future prices of energy commodities based on the specific market in which the energy commodity is being purchased or sold, using externally available forward market pricing curves for all periods possible under the pricing model.  In order to qualify the derivative instruments for hedged transactions, NRG estimates the forecasted generation and forecasted borrowings for interest rate swaps occurring within a specified time period. Judgments related to the probability of forecasted generation occurring are based on available baseload capacity, internal forecasts of sales and generation, and historical physical delivery on similar contracts.  Judgments related to the probability of forecasted borrowings are based on the estimated timing of project construction, which can vary based on various factors.  The probability that hedged forecasted generation and forecasted borrowings will occur by the end of a specified time period could change the results of operations by requiring amounts currently classified in OCI to be reclassified into earnings, creating increased variability in the Company's earnings.  These estimations are considered to be critical accounting estimates.

Certain derivative instruments that meet the criteria for derivative accounting treatment also qualify for a scope exception to derivative accounting, as they are considered to be NPNS.  The availability of this exception is based upon the assumption that NRG has the ability and it is probable to deliver or take delivery of the underlying item.  These assumptions are based on available baseload capacity, internal forecasts of sales and generation and historical physical delivery on contracts.  Derivatives that are considered to be NPNS are exempt from derivative accounting treatment and are accounted for under accrual accounting.  If it is determined that a transaction designated as NPNS no longer meets the scope exception due to changes in estimates, the related contract would be recorded on the balance sheet at fair value combined with the immediate recognition through earnings.

Income Taxes and Valuation Allowance for Deferred Tax Assets

As ofDecember 31, 2017, NRG had a valuation allowance of$1.8 billion. This amount is comprised of domestic federal net deferred tax assets of approximately$1.5 billion, domestic state net deferred tax assets of$267 million, foreign net operating loss carryforwards of$66 million, and foreign capital loss carryforwards of approximately$1 million.  The Company believes it is more likely than not that the results of future operations will not generate sufficient taxable income which includes the future reversal of existing taxable temporary differences to realize deferred tax assets, requiring a valuation allowance to be recorded.  In December 2017, the SEC staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118, which addresses how a company may recognize provisional amounts for the effect of the changes related to the Tax Act. Consistent with that guidance, the Company recognized provisional amounts based upon our interpretation of the tax laws and estimates which require significant judgments.

NRG continues to be under audit for multiple years by taxing authorities in other jurisdictions.  Considerable judgment is required to determine the tax treatment of a particular item that involves interpretations of complex tax laws including the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act effective December 22, 2017.  NRG is subject to examination by taxing authorities for income tax returns filed in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and various state and foreign jurisdictions including operations located in Australia.

The Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal income tax examinations for years prior to 2015.  With few exceptions, state and local income tax examinations are no longer open for years before 2010.












Evaluation of Assets for Impairment and Other-Than-Temporary Decline in Value

In accordance with ASC 360,Property, Plant, and Equipment, or ASC 360, NRG evaluates property, plant and equipment and certain intangible assets for impairment whenever indicators of impairment exist. Examples of such indicators or events are:

•Significant decrease in the market price of a long-lived asset;

•Significant adverse change in the manner an asset is being used or its physical condition;

•Adverse business climate;

•Accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected for the construction or acquisition of an asset;

•Current period loss combined with a history of losses or the projection of future losses; and

•Change in the Company's intent about an asset from an intent to hold to a greater than 50% likelihood that an asset will be sold or disposed of before the end of its previously estimated useful life.

Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of the assets to the future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset, through considering project specific assumptions for long-term power pool prices, escalated future project operating costs and expected plant operations. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets by factoring in the probability weighting of different courses of action available to the Company. Generally, fair value will be determined using valuation techniques such as the present value of expected future cash flows. NRG uses its best estimates in making these evaluations and considers various factors, including forward price curves for energy, fuel costs and operating costs. However, actual future market prices and project costs could vary from the assumptions used in the Company's estimates, and the impact of such variations could be material.

For assets to be held and used, if the Company determines that the undiscounted cash flows from the asset are less than the carrying amount of the asset, NRG must estimate fair value to determine the amount of any impairment loss. Assets held-for-sale are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less the cost to sell. The estimation of fair value under ASC 360, whether in conjunction with an asset to be held and used or with an asset held-for-sale, and the evaluation of asset impairment are, by their nature, subjective. NRG considers quoted market prices in active markets to the extent they are available. In the absence of such information, the Company may consider prices of similar assets, consult with brokers, or employ other valuation techniques. NRG will also discount the estimated future cash flows associated with the asset using a single interest rate representative of the risk involved with such an investment or employ an expected present value method that probability-weights a range of possible outcomes. The use of these methods involves the same inherent uncertainty of future cash flows as previously discussed with respect to undiscounted cash flows. Actual future market prices and project costs could vary from those used in the Company's estimates, and the impact of such variations could be material.

Annually, during the fourth quarter, the Company revises its views of power and fuel prices including the Company's fundamental view for long term prices, forecasted generation and operating and capital expenditures, in connection with the preparation of its annual budget.  Changes to the Company’s views of long term power and fuel prices impacted the Company’s projections of profitability, based on management's estimate of supply and demand within the sub-markets for each plant and the physical and economic characteristics of each plant. During the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company completed its annual budget and revised its view of long-term power and fuel prices and the corresponding impact on estimated cash flows associated with its long-lived assets. The most significant impact was a decrease in the Company’s long-term view of natural gas prices which resulted in a reduction to long-term power prices and had a negative impact on the Company’s coal, nuclear and renewable facilities.

As a result, the following long-lived asset impairments were recorded during the fourth quarter of 2017, as further described in Item 15 —Note 10,Asset Impairments, to the consolidated financial statements:

•South Texas Project, or STP- The Company recognized an impairment loss of$1,248 millionrelated to its interest in STP as a result of the decrease in the Company's view of long-term power prices in ERCOT.

•Indian River- The Company recognized an impairment loss of$36 millionfor Indian River as a result of the decrease in the Company's view of long-term power prices in PJM.

•Keystone and Conemaugh- The Company recognized impairment losses of$35 millionfor Keystone and$35 millionfor Conemaugh as a result of the decrease in the Company's view of long-term power prices in PJM.

•Wind Facilities- The Company recorded impairment losses of$110 million,$26 millionand$4 millionfor Langford, Elbow Creek and Forward, respectively, as a result of the decrease in the Company's view of long-term merchant power prices in ERCOT and PJM. While Elbow Creek and Forward have contracts to sell power, the significant decrease in estimated power prices had an impact on cash flows in post-contract periods.










The Company also recorded the following impairments in 2017 based on specific triggering events that occurred:

•Bacliff Project- On June 16, 2017, NRG Texas Power LLC provided notice to BTEC New Albany, LLC that it was exercising its right to terminate the Amended and Restated Membership Interest Purchase Agreement, or MIPA, due to the Bacliff Project, a new peaking facility at the former P.H. Robinson Electric Generating Station, not achieving commercial completion by the contractual expiration date of May 31, 2017.  As a result of the MIPA termination, the Company recorded an impairment loss of$41 millionto reduce the carrying amount of the related construction in progress to zero during the second quarter of 2017.

•Other Impairments -During the second, third and fourth quarters of 2017, the Company recorded impairment losses of approximately$22 million,$14 millionand$15 million, respectively, in connection with the Company's Renewables business.  These impairment losses were primarily to record the value of certain long-lived assets, including property, plant and equipment and intangible assets, at fair market value at acquisition date or in connection with an impairment indicator.



NRG is also required to evaluate its equity method and cost method investments to determine whether or not they are impaired in accordance with ASC 323,Investments - Equity Method and Joint Ventures, or ASC 323.  The standard for determining whether an impairment must be recorded under ASC 323 is whether a decline in the value is considered an other-than-temporary decline in value.  The evaluation and measurement of impairments under ASC 323 involves the same uncertainties as described for long-lived assets that the Company owns directly and accounts for in accordance with ASC 360.  Similarly, the estimates that NRG makes with respect to its equity and cost-method investments are subjective, and the impact of variations in these estimates could be material.  Additionally, if the projects in which the Company holds these investments recognize an impairment under the provisions of ASC 360, NRG would record its proportionate share of that impairment loss and would evaluate its investment for an other-than-temporary decline in value under ASC 323.  During the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company recorded impairment losses on its equity method and cost method investments of$79 milliondue to other-than-temporary declines in value, including the following:

During the fourth quarter of 2017, in connection with the preparation of the annual budget, management revised its view of oil production expectations with respect to Petra Nova Parish Holdings. As a result, the Company reviewed its 50% interest in Petra Nova Parish Holdings for impairment utilizing the other-than-temporary impairment model. In determining fair value, the Company utilized an income approach and considered project specific assumptions for the future project cash flows. The carrying amount of the Company's equity method investment exceeded the fair value of the investment and the Company concluded that the decline is considered to be other-than-temporary. As a result, the Company measured the impairment loss as the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value of the investment and recorded an impairment loss of$69 million.



Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

AtDecember 31, 2017, NRG reported goodwill of$539 million, consisting of $165 million associated with the acquisition of EME, $341 million for retail business acquisitions, and $33 million associated with other business acquisitions.

The Company applies ASC 805,

Business Combinations

The Company performed its qualitative assessment of macroeconomic, industry and market events and circumstances, and the overall financial performance of the NRG Business Solutions (NRG Curtailment Solutions) and Retail Mass reporting units.  The Company determined it was not more likely than not that the fair value of the goodwill attributed to these reporting units were less than their carrying amount and accordingly, no impairment existed for the year ended December 31, 2017.










The Company performed a quantitative assessment for the reporting units in the following table.  The Company determined the fair value of these reporting units using primarily an income approach.  Under the income approach, the Company estimated the fair value of the reporting units' invested capital exceeds its carrying value and, as such, the Company concluded that goodwill associated with the reporting units in the following table is not impaired as ofDecember 31, 2017:

Reporting Unit% Fair Value Over Carrying ValueMidwest Generation (Generation Segment)133%Texas Non-Commodity - excluding Goal Zero (Retail Segment)325%Goal Zero (Retail Segment)141%

The Company believes the methodology and assumptions used in its quantitative assessment are consistent with the views of market participants.  Significant inputs to the determination of fair value were as follows:

•The Company applied a discounted cash flow methodology to the long-term budgets for all of the plants in the region. The significant assumptions used to derive the long-term budgets used in the income approach are affected by the following key inputs:

◦The Company's views of power and fuel prices consider market prices for the first five-year period and the Company's fundamental view for the longer term, which reflect the Company's long-term view of the price of natural gas.  The Company's fundamental view for the longer term reflects the implied power price and heat rate that would support new build of a combined cycle gas plant. The price of natural gas plays an important role in setting the price of electricity in many of the regions where NRG operates power plants.  Hedging is included to the extent of contracts already in place;

◦The Company's estimate of generation, fuel costs, capital expenditure requirements and the existing and anticipated impact of environmental regulations;

◦The Company's fundamental view for the longer term, cash flows for the plants in the region were included in the fair value calculation through the end of each plants' estimated useful life; and

◦Projected generation and resulting energy gross margin in the long-term budgets is based on an hourly dispatch that simulates dispatch of each unit into the power market.  The dispatch simulation is based on power prices, fuel prices, and the physical and economic characteristics of each plant.

•The Company applied a discounted cash flow methodology to the long-term budgets for the Texas Non-Commodity and Goal Zero reporting units.  The significant assumptions used to derive the long-term budgets used in the income approach are affected by the following key inputs: a terminal value utilizing assumed growth rates and discount rates that reflect the inherent cash flow risk for each reporting unit.

During the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company concluded that BETM was held for sale in connection with board approval and advanced negotiations to sell the business.  Accordingly, the Company recorded the assets and liabilities at fair market value as of December 31, 2017, which resulted in an impairment loss of$90 millionto record BETM's goodwill at fair market value.

During the fourth quarter of 2017, NRG sold its interests in certain SPP projects to NRG Yield.  The goodwill recorded during the SPP acquisition was related primarily to its development pipeline, which was not sold to NRG Yield.  As the Company does not expect to separately develop these projects and accordingly, has no cash flow stream associated with the goodwill, an impairment loss of$12 millionwas recorded to reduce the value to zero as of December 31, 2017.



Fair value determinations require considerable judgment and are sensitive to changes in underlying assumptions and factors.  As a result, there can be no assurance that the estimates and assumptions made for purposes of the annual goodwill impairment test will prove to be accurate predictions of the future.

Contingencies

NRG records reserves for estimated losses from contingencies when information available indicates that a loss is probable and the amount of the loss, or range of loss, can be reasonably estimated. Gain contingencies are not recorded until management determines it is certain that the future event will become or does become a reality.  Such determinations are subject to interpretations of current facts and circumstances, forecasts of future events, and estimates of the financial impacts of such events.  NRG describes in detail its contingencies in Item 15 —Note 22,Commitments and Contingencies,to the consolidated financial statements.










Recent Accounting Developments

See Item 15 —Note 2,Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of recent accounting developments.












Item 7A — Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

NRG is exposed to several market risks in the Company's normal business activities.  Market risk is the potential loss that may result from market changes associated with the Company's merchant power generation or with an existing or forecasted financial or commodity transaction.  The types of market risks the Company is exposed to are commodity price risk, interest rate risk, liquidity risk, credit risk and currency exchange risk.  In order to manage these risks, the Company uses various fixed-price forward purchase and sales contracts, futures and option contracts traded on NYMEX, and swaps and options traded in the over-the-counter financial markets to:

•Manage and hedge fixed-price purchase and sales commitments;

•Manage and hedge exposure to variable rate debt obligations;

•Reduce exposure to the volatility of cash market prices, and

•Hedge fuel requirements for the Company's generating facilities.

Commodity Price Risk

Commodity price risks result from exposures to changes in spot prices, forward prices, volatilities, and correlations between various commodities, such as natural gas, electricity, coal, oil, and emissions credits.  NRG manages the commodity price risk of the Company's merchant generation operations and load serving obligations by entering into various derivative or non-derivative instruments to hedge the variability in future cash flows from forecasted sales and purchases of electricity and fuel.  These instruments include forwards, futures, swaps, and option contracts traded on various exchanges, such as NYMEX and ICE, as well as over-the-counter markets.  The portion of forecasted transactions hedged may vary based upon management's assessment of market, weather, operation and other factors.

While some of the contracts the Company uses to manage risk represent commodities or instruments for which prices are available from external sources, other commodities and certain contracts are not actively traded and are valued using other pricing sources and modeling techniques to determine expected future market prices, contract quantities, or both.  NRG uses the Company's best estimates to determine the fair value of those derivative contracts.  However, it is likely that future market prices could vary from those used in recording mark-to-market derivative instrument valuation and such variations could be material.

NRG measures the risk of the Company's portfolio using several analytical methods, including sensitivity tests, scenario tests, stress tests, position reports, and VaR.  NRG uses a Monte Carlo simulation based VaR model to estimate the potential loss in the fair value of the Company's energy assets and liabilities, which includes generation assets, load obligations, and bilateral physical and financial transactions.  The key assumptions for the Company's VaR model include: (i) lognormal distribution of prices; (ii) one-day holding period; (iii) 95% confidence interval; (iv) rolling 36-month forward looking period; and (v) market implied volatilities and historical price correlations.

As ofDecember 31, 2017, the VaR for NRG's commodity portfolio, including generation assets, load obligations and bilateral physical and financial transactions calculated using the VaR model was$46 million.

The following table summarizes average, maximum and minimum VaR for NRG for the years endedDecember 31, 2017and2016:

(In millions)20172016VaR as of December 31,$46$41For the year ended December 31,Average$51$53Maximum6672Minimum4032

Due to the inherent limitations of statistical measures such as VaR, the evolving nature of the competitive markets for electricity and related derivatives, and the seasonality of changes in market prices, the VaR calculation may not capture the full extent of commodity price exposure.  As a result, actual changes in the fair value of mark-to-market energy assets and liabilities could differ from the calculated VaR, and such changes could have a material impact on the Company's financial results.

In order to provide additional information, the Company also uses VaR to estimate the potential loss of derivative financial instruments that are subject to mark-to-market accounting. These derivative instruments include transactions that were entered into for both asset management and trading purposes. The VaR for the derivative financial instruments calculated using the diversified VaR model for the entire term of these instruments entered into for both asset management and trading was$30 millionas ofDecember 31, 2017, primarily driven by asset-backed transactions.










Interest Rate Risk

NRG is exposed to fluctuations in interest rates through the Company's issuance of fixed rate and variable rate debt.  Exposures to interest rate fluctuations may be mitigated by entering into derivative instruments known as interest rate swaps, caps, collars and put or call options. These contracts reduce exposure to interest rate volatility and result in primarily fixed rate debt obligations when taking into account the combination of the variable rate debt and the interest rate derivative instrument. NRG's risk management policies allow the Company to reduce interest rate exposure from variable rate debt obligations.

In addition to those discussed above, the Company's project subsidiaries enter into interest rate swaps, intended to hedge the risks associated with interest rates on non-recourse project level debt. See Item 15 —Note 12,Debt and Capital Leases, to the Consolidated Financial Statements, for more information about interest rate swaps of the Company's project subsidiaries.

If all of the above swaps had been discontinued onDecember 31, 2017, the Company would have owed the counterparties$11 million. Based on the investment grade rating of the counterparties, NRG believes its exposure to credit risk due to nonperformance by counterparties to its hedge contracts to be insignificant.

NRG has both long and short-term debt instruments that subject the Company to the risk of loss associated with movements in market interest rates. As ofDecember 31, 2017, a 1% change in interest rates would result in a$14.2 millionchange in interest expense on a rolling twelve month basis.

As ofDecember 31, 2017, the Company's debt fair value was$16.9 billionand carrying value was$16.6 billion. NRG estimates that a 1% decrease in market interest rates would have increased the fair value of the Company's long-term debt by$989 million.

Liquidity Risk

Liquidity risk arises from the general funding needs of the Company's activities and in the management of the Company's assets and liabilities. The Company is currently exposed to additional collateral posting if natural gas prices decline primarily due to the long natural gas equivalent position at various exchanges used to hedge NRG's retail supply load obligations.

Based on a sensitivity analysis for power and gas positions under marginable contracts, a $0.50 per MMBtu change in natural gas prices across the term of the marginable contracts would cause a change in margin collateral posted of approximately$120 millionas ofDecember 31, 2017, and a 1.00 MMBtu/MWh change in heat rates for heat rate positions would result in a change in margin collateral posted of approximately$64 millionas ofDecember 31, 2017. This analysis uses simplified assumptions and is calculated based on portfolio composition and margin-related contract provisions as ofDecember 31, 2017.

Counterparty Credit Risk

Credit risk relates to the risk of loss resulting from non-performance or non-payment by counterparties pursuant to the terms of their contractual obligations. The Company monitors and manages credit risk through credit policies that include: (i) an established credit approval process; (ii) a daily monitoring of counterparties' credit limits; (iii) the use of credit mitigation measures such as margin, collateral, prepayment arrangements, or volumetric limits; (iv) the use of payment netting agreements; and (v) the use of master netting agreements that allow for the netting of positive and negative exposures of various contracts associated with a single counterparty. Risks surrounding counterparty performance and credit could ultimately impact the amount and timing of expected cash flows. The Company seeks to mitigate counterparty risk by having a diversified portfolio of counterparties. The Company also has credit protection within various agreements to call on additional collateral support if and when necessary. Cash margin is collected and held at the Company to cover the credit risk of the counterparty until positions settle.










As ofDecember 31, 2017, aggregate counterparty credit exposure to a significant portion of the Company's counterparties totaled$220 million, of which the Company held collateral (cash and letters of credit) against those positions of$30 millionresulting in a net exposure of$196 million. Approximately73%of the Company's exposure before collateral is expected to roll off by the end of2019. The following table highlights the net counterparty credit exposure by industry sector and by counterparty credit quality. Net counterparty credit exposure is defined as the aggregate net asset position for NRG with counterparties where netting is permitted under the enabling agreement and includes all cash flow, mark-to-market, NPNS, and non-derivative transactions. As ofDecember 31, 2017, the aggregate credit exposure is shown net of collateral held, and includes amounts net of receivables or payables.

CategoryNet Exposure(a) (b)(% of Total)Financial institutions14%Utilities, energy merchants, marketers and other86Total100%CategoryNet Exposure(a) (b)(% of Total)Investment grade69%Non-Investment grade/Non-Rated31Total100%

(a)Counterparty credit exposure excludes uranium and coal transportation contracts because of the unavailability of market prices.

(b)The figures in the tables above exclude potential counterparty credit exposure related to RTOs, ISOs, registered commodity exchanges and certain long term contracts.



The Company has credit exposure to certain wholesale counterparties, each of which represent more than 10% of the total net exposure discussed above and the aggregate credit exposure to such counterparties was$37 millionas ofDecember 31, 2017.  Changes in hedge positions and market prices will affect credit exposure and counterparty concentration. Given the credit quality, diversification and term of the exposure in the portfolio, the Company does not anticipate a material impact on its financial position or results of operations from nonperformance by any counterparty.

RTOs and ISOs

The Company participates in the organized markets of CAISO, ERCOT, ISO-NE, MISO, NYISO and PJM, known as RTOs or ISOs. Trading in these markets is approved by FERC, or in the case of ERCOT, approved by the PUCT and include credit policies that, under certain circumstances, require that losses arising from the default of one member on spot market transactions be shared by the remaining participants. As a result, the counterparty credit risk to these markets is limited to NRG’s applicable share of the overall market and are excluded from the above exposures.



Exchange Traded Transactions

The Company enters into commodity transactions on registered exchanges, notably ICE and NYMEX. These clearinghouses act as the counterparty and transactions are subject to extensive collateral and margining requirements. As a result, these commodity transactions have limited counterparty credit risk.










Long Term Contracts

Counterparty credit exposure described above excludes credit risk exposure under certain long term contracts, including California tolling agreements, Gulf Coast load obligations, and wind and solar PPAs. As external sources or observable market quotes are not available to estimate such exposure, the Company values these contracts based on various techniques including but not limited to internal models based on a fundamental analysis of the market and extrapolation of observable market data with similar characteristics. Based on these valuation techniques, as ofDecember 31, 2017, aggregate credit risk exposure managed by NRG to these counterparties was approximately$4.1 billion, of which$2.6 billionrelated to assets of NRG Yield, Inc., for the next five years. This amount excludes potential credit exposures for projects with long term PPAs that have not reached commercial operations. The majority of these power contracts are with utilities or public power entities with strong credit quality and public utility commission or other regulatory support. However, such regulated utility counterparties can be impacted by changes in government regulations, which NRG is unable to predict.

Retail Customer Credit Risk

NRG is exposed to retail credit risk through its retail electricity providers, which serve C&I customers and the Mass market. Retail credit risk results in losses when a customer fails to pay for services rendered.  The losses could be incurred from nonpayment of customer accounts receivable and any in-the-money forward value.  NRG manages retail credit risk through the use of established credit policies that include monitoring of the portfolio, and the use of credit mitigation measures such as deposits or prepayment arrangements.

As ofDecember 31, 2017, the Company's retail customer credit exposure to C&I and Mass customers was diversified across many customers and various industries, as well as government entities. The Company is also subject to risk with respect to its residential solar customers. The Company's bad debt expense resulting from credit risk was$68 million,$48 million, and$64 millionfor the years ending December 31,2017,2016, and2015, respectively. Current economic conditions may affect the Company's customers' ability to pay bills in a timely manner, which could increase customer delinquencies and may lead to an increase in bad debt expense.

Credit Risk Related Contingent Features

Certain of the Company's hedging agreements contain provisions that require the Company to post additional collateral if the counterparty determines that there has been deterioration in credit quality, generally termed "adequate assurance" under the agreements, or require the Company to post additional collateral if there were a one notch downgrade in the Company's credit rating.  The collateral required for contracts that have adequate assurance clauses that are in a net liability position as ofDecember 31, 2017, was$25 million.  The collateral required for contracts with credit rating contingent features that are in a net liability position as ofDecember 31, 2017, was$7 million.  The Company is also a party to certain marginable agreements under which it has a net liability position, but the counterparty has not called for the collateral due, which is approximately$4 millionas ofDecember 31, 2017.

Currency Exchange Risk

NRG's foreign earnings and investments may be subject to foreign currency exchange risk, which NRG generally does not hedge.  As these earnings and investments are not material to NRG's consolidated results, the Company's foreign currency exposure is limited.

Item 9A — Controls and Procedures

Conclusion Regarding the Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls and Procedures and Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Under the supervision and with the participation of NRG's management, including its principal executive officer, principal financial officer and principal accounting officer, NRG conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of its disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act. Based on this evaluation, the Company's principal executive officer, principal financial officer and principal accounting officer concluded that the disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Management's report on the Company's internal control over financial reporting and the report of the Company's independent registered public accounting firm are incorporated under the caption "Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting" and under the caption "Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year endedDecember 31, 2017.

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting

There were no changes in NRG’s internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred in the fourth quarter of2017that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, NRG’s internal control over financial reporting.

Inherent Limitations over Internal Controls

NRG's internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of consolidated financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP. The Company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that:

1.Pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the Company's assets;

2.Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and that the Company's receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of its management and directors; and

3.Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company's assets that could have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements.

Internal control over financial reporting cannot provide absolute assurance of achieving financial reporting objectives because of its inherent limitations, including the possibility of human error and circumvention by collusion or overriding of controls. Accordingly, even an effective internal control system may not prevent or detect material misstatements on a timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

The Company's management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f). Under the supervision and with the participation of the Company's management, including its principal executive officer, principal financial officer and principal accounting officer, the Company conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting based on the framework inInternal Control — Integrated Framework (2013)issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on the Company's evaluation under the framework inInternal Control — Integrated Framework (2013), the Company's management concluded that its internal control over financial reporting was effective as ofDecember 31, 2017.

(1)Consists of shares issuable under the NRG LTIP and the ESPP.  The NRG LTIP became effective upon the Company's emergence from bankruptcy.  On April 27, 2017, the NRG LTIP was amended and restated to increase the number of shares available for issuance to 25,000,000.  The ESPP, as amended and restated, was approved by the Company's stockholders on April 27, 2017, and became effective April 28, 2017.  As ofDecember 31, 2017, there were 3,107,050 shares reserved from the Company's treasury shares for the ESPP.

(2)Consists of shares issuable under the NRG GenOn LTIP.  On December 14, 2012, in connection with the Merger, NRG assumed the GenOn Energy, Inc. 2010 Omnibus Incentive Plan and changed the name to the NRG 2010 Stock Plan for GenOn Employees, or the NRG GenOn LTIP.  While the GenOn Energy, Inc. 2010 Omnibus Incentive Plan was previously approved by stockholders of RRI Energy, Inc. before it became GenOn, the plan is listed as “not approved” because the NRG GenOn LTIP was not subject to separate line item approval by NRG's stockholders when the Merger (which included the assumption of this plan) was approved.  As part of the Merger, NRG also assumed the GenOn Energy, Inc. 2002 Long-Term Incentive Plan, the GenOn Energy, Inc. 2002 Stock Plan, and the Mirant Corporation 2005 Omnibus Incentive Compensation Plan.  NRG has no intention of making any grants or awards of its own equity securities under these plans.  The number of securities to be issued upon the exercise of outstanding awards under these plans is227,531at a weighted-average exercise price of$36.07.  See Item 15—Note 20,Stock-Based Compensation, to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of the NRG GenOn LTIP.

(3)Consists of 8,724,595 shares of common stock under NRG's LTIP and 3,107,050 shares of treasury stock reserved for issuance under the ESPP.  In the first quarter of 2018,175,862shares were issued to employees' accounts from the treasury stock reserve for the ESPP.  Beginning January 2018, NRG suspended the ESPP.

(4)Upon adoption of the NRG Amended and Restated LTIP effective April 27, 2017, no securities remain available for future issuance under the NRG GenOn LTIP.  SeeNote 20,Stock-Based Compensation, for additional information.

Both the NRG LTIP and the NRG GenOn LTIP provide for grants of stock options, restricted stock, market stock units, performance stock units, deferred stock units and dividend equivalent rights.  NRG's directors, officers and employees, as well as other individuals performing services for, or to whom an offer of employment has been extended by the Company, are eligible to receive grants under the NRG LTIP and the NRG GenOn LTIP.  However, participants eligible for the NRG LTIP at the time of the Merger are not eligible to receive grants under the NRG GenOn LTIP.  The purpose of the NRG LTIP and the NRG GenOn LTIP is to promote the Company's long-term growth and profitability by providing these individuals with incentives to maximize stockholder value and otherwise contribute to the Company's success and to enable the Company to attract, retain and reward the best available persons for positions of responsibility.  The Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors administers the NRG LTIP and the NRG GenOn LTIP.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as ofDecember 31, 2017and2016, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three‑year period endedDecember 31, 2017, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as ofDecember 31, 2017, based on criteria established inInternal Control - Integrated Framework (2013)issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, and our report datedMarch 1, 2018expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.

Basis for Opinion

These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

NRG ENERGY, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS



Note 1—Nature of Business

General

NRG Energy, Inc., or NRG or the Company, is a leading integrated power company built on the strength of a diverse competitive electric generation portfolio and leading retail electricity platform.  NRG aims to create a sustainable energy future by producing, selling and delivering electricity and related products and services in major competitive power markets in the U.S. in a manner that delivers value to all of NRG's stakeholders. The Company owns and operates approximately30,000MW of generation; engages in the trading of wholesale energy, capacity and related products; transacts in and trades fuel and transportation services; and directly sells energy, services, and innovative, sustainable products and services to retail customers under the names “NRG”, "Reliant" and other retail brand names owned by NRG.

Generation consists of the Company’s wholesale operations, commercial operations, EPC operations, energy services and other critical related functions.  NRG has traditionally referred to this business as its wholesale power generation business.  In addition to the traditional functions from NRG’s wholesale power generation business, Generation also includes NRG’s business solutions, which include demand response, commodity sales, energy efficiency and energy management services, and NRG’s conventional distributed generation business, consisting of reliability, combined heat and power, thermal and district heating and cooling and large-scale distributed generation.

Retail is a consumer facing business that includes the Company’s residential retail and C&I business. Products and services range from retail energy, portable solar and battery products home services, and a variety of bundled products which combine energy with protection products, energy efficiency and renewable energy solutions as well as other distributed and reliability products.

Renewables operates the Company’s existing renewables business, including operation of the NRG Yield renewable assets. Renewables is also one of the largest solar and wind power developers and owner-operators in the U.S., having developed, constructed and financed a full range of solutions for utilities, schools, municipalities and commercial market segments.

GenOn Chapter 11 Cases

On June 14, 2017, or the Petition Date, GenOn, along with GenOn Americas Generation and certain of their directly and indirectly-owned subsidiaries, or collectively the GenOn Entities, filed voluntary petitions for relief under Chapter 11, or the Chapter 11 Cases, of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, or the Bankruptcy Code, in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Texas, Houston Division, or the Bankruptcy Court. GenOn Mid-Atlantic, as well as its consolidated subsidiaries, REMA and certain other subsidiaries, did not file for relief under Chapter 11.



As a result of the bankruptcy filings and beginning on June 14, 2017, GenOn and its subsidiaries were deconsolidated from NRG’s consolidated financial statements. NRG recorded its investment in GenOn under the cost method with an estimated fair value ofzero. NRG determined that this disposal of GenOn and its subsidiaries is a discontinued operation; and, accordingly, the financial information for all historical periods has been recast to reflect GenOn as a discontinued operation.  In connection with the disposal, NRG recorded a loss on deconsolidation of$208 millionduring the quarter ended June 30, 2017. SeeNote 3,Discontinued Operations, Acquisitions and Dispositions, for more information.



Prior to the GenOn Entities' filing the Chapter 11 Cases, on June 12, 2017, NRG entered into a restructuring support and lock-up agreement, or the Restructuring Support Agreement, with the GenOn Entities and certain holders of the GenOn and GenOn Americas Generation Senior Notes, that provides for a restructuring and recapitalization of the GenOn Entities through a prearranged plan of reorganization.  On December 12, 2017, the Bankruptcy Court entered an order confirming the plan of reorganization. There is no assurance that the GenOn Entities' plan will be successfully implemented. The principal terms of the Restructuring Support Agreement and further information regarding the Chapter 11 Cases are described further inNote 3,Discontinued Operations, Acquisitions and Dispositions.














Transformation Plan

On July 12, 2017, NRG announced its Transformation Plan designed to significantly strengthen earnings and cost competitiveness, lower risk and volatility, and create significant shareholder value. The three-part,three-year plan is comprised of the following targets:

Operations and cost excellence— Cost savings and margin enhancement of$1,065 millionrecurring, which consists of$590 millionof annual cost savings, a$215 millionnet margin enhancement program,$50 millionannual reduction in maintenance capital expenditures, and$210 millionin permanent selling, general and administrative expense reduction associated with asset sales.

Portfolio optimization— Targeting up to$3.2 billionof asset sale net cash proceeds, including divestitures of6GWs of conventional generation and businesses (excluding GenOn) and the expected monetization of100%of its interest in NRG Yield, Inc. and its renewables platform.



Capital structure and allocation enhancements— A prioritized capital allocation strategy that targets a reduction in consolidated debt from approximately$19.5 billion($18 billionnet debt) to approximately$6.5 billion($6 billionnet debt).  Following the completion of the contemplated asset sales, the Company expects$5.3 billionin excess cash to be available for allocation through 2020, after achieving its targeted3.0x net debt / Adjusted EBITDA corporate credit ratio.



The Company expects to fully implement the Transformation Plan by the end of 2020 with significant completion by the end of 2018. The Company expects to realize (i)$370 millionof working capital improvements through 2020 and (ii) approximately$290 million, one-time costs to achieve.



NRG Yield, Inc. Ownership

In 2013, the Company formed NRG Yield, Inc. to own and operate a portfolio of contracted generation assets and thermal infrastructure assets that have historically been owned and/or operated by NRG and its subsidiaries. In 2013 and 2014, NRG Yield, Inc. issued Class A common stock to its public shareholders and utilized the proceeds to acquire a controlling interest in NRG Yield LLC, through its ownership of Class A units. At that time, the Company owned the Class B common stock of NRG Yield, Inc. and the Class B units of NRG Yield LLC. On May 14, 2015, NRG Yield, Inc. completed a stock split in connection with which each outstanding share of Class A common stock was split into one share of Class A common stock and one share of Class C common stock, and each outstanding share of Class B common stock was split into one share of Class B common stock and one share of Class D common stock. A similar split was effected at NRG Yield LLC with respect to its member units. The Company consolidates NRG Yield, Inc. for financial reporting purposes as it maintains a controlling voting interest, and presents the public ownership of the Class A and Class C common stock as noncontrolling interest. The Company receives distributions from NRG Yield LLC, through its ownership of Class B and Class D units.










The following table represents the structure of NRG Yield, Inc. as ofDecember 31, 2017:





Note 2—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Basis of Presentation and Principles of Consolidation

The Company's consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with GAAP.  The ASC, established by the FASB, is the source of authoritative GAAP to be applied by nongovernmental entities.  In addition, the rules and interpretative releases of the SEC under authority of federal securities laws are also sources of authoritative GAAP for SEC registrants.

The consolidated financial statements include NRG's accounts and operations and those of its subsidiaries in which the Company has a controlling interest. All significant intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation.  The usual condition for a controlling financial interest is ownership of a majority of the voting interests of an entity.  However, a controlling financial interest may also exist through arrangements that do not involve controlling voting interests.  As such, NRG applies the guidance of ASC 810,Consolidations,or ASC 810, to determine when an entity that is insufficiently capitalized or not controlled through its voting interests, referred to as a VIE, should be consolidated.

Segment Reporting

The Company's businesses are segregated as follows: Generation, which includes generation, international and BETM; Retail, which includes Mass customers, and Business Solutions, which includes C&I customers and other distributed and reliability products; Renewables, which includes solar and wind assets, excluding those in NRG Yield; NRG Yield; and corporate activities. On June 14, 2017, as described inNote 3,Discontinued Operations, Acquisitions and Dispositions, NRG deconsolidated GenOn for financial reporting purposes. The financial information for all historical periods has been recast to reflect the presentation of GenOn as discontinued operations within the corporate segment. The Company's segment structure and its allocation of corporate expenses were updated to reflect how management makes financial decisions and allocates resources. The Company has recast data from prior periods to reflect this change in reportable segments to conform to the current year presentation.










Cash and Cash Equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents include highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less at the time of purchase.

Funds Deposited by Counterparties

Funds deposited by counterparties consist of cash held by the Company as a result of collateral posting obligations from its counterparties. Some amounts are segregated into separate accounts that are not contractually restricted but, based on the Company's intention, are not available for the payment of general corporate obligations. Depending on market fluctuations and the settlement of the underlying contracts, the Company will refund this collateral to the hedge counterparties pursuant to the terms and conditions of the underlying trades. Since collateral requirements fluctuate daily and the Company cannot predict if any collateral will be held for more thantwelvemonths, the funds deposited by counterparties are classified as a current asset on the Company's balance sheet, with an offsetting liability for this cash collateral received within current liabilities. As ofDecember 31, 2016,$79 millionof the cash collateral received was from GenOn, previously a consolidated subsidiary, and is included in cash collateral received in current liabilities as a result of deconsolidating GenOn, with the offset included in cash and cash equivalents.

Restricted Cash

The following table provides a reconciliation of cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash and funds deposited by counterparties reported within the consolidated balance sheet that sum to the total of the same such amounts shown in the statement of cash flows.

Year Ended December 31,201720162015(In millions)Cash and cash equivalents$991$938$853Funds deposited by counterparties37255Restricted cash508446414Cash and cash equivalents, funds deposited by counterparties and restricted cash shown in the statement of cash flows$1,536$1,386$1,322

Restricted cash consists primarily of funds held to satisfy the requirements of certain debt agreements and funds held within the Company's projects that are restricted in their use. Of these funds, as ofDecember 31, 2017, approximately$51 millionis designated for current debt service payments,$65 millionis designated to fund operating expenses, and$57 millionis designated to fund distributions, with the remaining$335 millionrestricted for reserves including debt service, performance obligations and other reserves, as well as capital expenditures.

Trade Receivables and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts

Trade receivables are reported in the balance sheet at outstanding principal adjusted for any write-offs and the allowance for doubtful accounts.  For its retail business, the Company accrues an allowance for doubtful accounts based on estimates of uncollectible revenues by analyzing counterparty credit ratings (for commercial and industrial customers), historical collections, accounts receivable aging and other factors.  The retail business writes-off accounts receivable balances against the allowance for doubtful accounts when it determines a receivable is uncollectible.  In addition, the Company considers a reserve for doubtful accounts based on the credit worthiness of the customers and continually reviews and adjusts for current economic trends that might impact the level of future credit losses. The reserve represents management's best estimate of uncollectible amounts. As ofDecember 31, 2017and2016, the allowance for doubtful accounts was$28 millionand$29 million, respectively.

Inventory

Inventory is valued at the lower of weighted average cost or market, and consists principally of fuel oil, coal and raw materials used to generate electricity or steam.  The Company removes these inventories as they are used in the production of electricity or steam.  Spare parts inventory is valued at weighted average cost.  The Company removes these inventories when they are used for repairs, maintenance or capital projects.  The Company expects to recover the fuel oil, coal, raw materials, and spare parts costs in the ordinary course of business.   Finished goods inventory is valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value with cost being determined on a first-in first-out basis.  The Company removes these inventories as they are sold to customers. Sales of inventory are classified as an operating activity in the consolidated statements of cash flows.










Property, Plant and Equipment

Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost or, in the case of business acquisitions, fair value; however, impairment adjustments are recorded whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying values may not be recoverable. SeeNote 3,Discontinued Operations, Acquisitions and Dispositions,for more information on acquired property, plant and equipment. NRG also classifies nuclear fuel related to the Company's44%ownership interest in STP as part of the Company's property, plant, and equipment. Significant additions or improvements extending asset lives are capitalized as incurred, while repairs and maintenance that do not improve or extend the life of the respective asset are charged to expense as incurred.  Depreciation, other than nuclear fuel, is computed using the straight-line method, while nuclear fuel is amortized based on units of production over the estimated useful lives. Certain assets and their related accumulated depreciation amounts are adjusted for asset retirements and disposals with the resulting gain or loss included in cost of operations in the consolidated statements of operations.

Asset Impairments

Long-lived assets that are held and used are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate carrying values may not be recoverable. Such reviews are performed in accordance with ASC 360. An impairment loss is indicated if the total future estimated undiscounted cash flows expected from an asset are less than its carrying value. An impairment charge is measured by the difference between an asset's carrying amount and fair value with the difference recorded in operating costs and expenses in the consolidated statements of operations. Fair values are determined by a variety of valuation methods, including third-party appraisals, sales prices of similar assets, and present value techniques.

Investments accounted for by the equity method are reviewed for impairment in accordance with ASC 323,Investments-Equity Method and Joint Ventures, or ASC 323, which requires that a loss in value of an investment that is an other-than-temporary decline should be recognized. The Company identifies and measures losses in the value of equity method investments based upon a comparison of fair value to carrying value.

For further discussion of these matters, refer toNote 10,Asset Impairments.

Development Costs and Capitalized Interest

Development costs include project development costs, which are expensed in the preliminary stages of a project and capitalized when the project is deemed to be commercially viable. Commercial viability is determined by one or a series of actions including, among others, Board of Director approval pursuant to a formal project plan that subjects the Company to significant future obligations that can only be discharged by the use of a Company asset. When a project is available for operations, capitalized interest and capitalized project development costs are reclassified to property, plant and equipment and depreciated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the project's related assets. Capitalized costs are charged to expense if a project is abandoned or management otherwise determines the costs to be unrecoverable.

Interest incurred on funds borrowed to finance capital projects is capitalized until the project under construction is ready for its intended use. The amount of interest capitalized for the years endedDecember 31, 2017,2016, and2015, was$34 million,$30 million, and$25 million, respectively.

Debt Issuance Costs

Debt issuance costs are capitalized and amortized as interest expense on a basis which approximates the effective interest method over the term of the related debt. Debt issuance costs are presented as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of the related debt.

Intangible Assets

Intangible assets represent contractual rights held by the Company. The Company recognizes specifically identifiable intangible assets including customer contracts, customer relationships, energy supply contracts, marketing partnerships, power purchase agreements, trade names, emission allowances, and fuel contracts when specific rights and contracts are acquired.  In addition, the Company also established values for emission allowances and power contracts upon adoption of Fresh Start reporting.  These intangible assets are amortized based on expected volumes, expected delivery, expected discounted future net cash flows, straight line or units of production basis. As ofDecember 31, 2017and2016, the Company had accumulated amortization related to its intangible assets of$1.8 billionand$1.7 billion, respectively.

Intangible assets determined to have indefinite lives are not amortized, but rather are tested for impairment at least annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that such acquired intangible assets have been determined to have finite lives and should now be amortized over their useful lives.










Emission allowances held-for-sale, which are included in other non-current assets on the Company's consolidated balance sheet, are not amortized; they are carried at the lower of cost or fair value and reviewed for impairment in accordance with ASC 360.

Goodwill

In accordance with ASC 350, the Company recognizes goodwill for the excess cost of an acquired entity over the net value assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed.  NRG performs goodwill impairment tests annually, during the fourth quarter, and when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.

The Company first assesses qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. The more-likely-than-not threshold is defined as having a likelihood of more than 50 percent.  If it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, there is no goodwill impairment.

In the absence of sufficient qualitative factors, the Company performs a quantitative assessment by determining the fair value of the reporting unit and comparing the fair value to its book value. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its book value, goodwill of the reporting unit is not considered impaired. If the book value exceeds fair value, the Company recognizes an impairment loss equal to the difference between book value and fair value.

For further discussion of goodwill and goodwill impairment losses recognized during2017and2016, refer toNote 11,Goodwill and Other Intangibles.

Income Taxes

The Company accounts for income taxes using the liability method in accordance with ASC 740, which requires that the Company use the asset and liability method of accounting for deferred income taxes and provide deferred income taxes for all significant temporary differences.

The Company has two categories of income tax expense or benefit — current and deferred, as follows:

•Current income tax expense or benefit consists solely of current taxes payable less applicable tax credits, and

•Deferred income tax expense or benefit is the change in the net deferred income tax asset or liability, excluding amounts charged or credited to accumulated other comprehensive income.

The Company reports some of its revenues and expenses differently for financial statement purposes than for income tax return purposes, resulting in temporary and permanent differences between the Company's financial statements and income tax returns.  The tax effects of such temporary differences are recorded as either deferred income tax assets or deferred income tax liabilities in the Company's consolidated balance sheets.  The Company measures its deferred income tax assets and deferred income tax liabilities using income tax rates that are currently in effect. The Company believes it is more likely than not that the results of future operations will generate sufficient taxable income which includes the future reversal of existing taxable temporary differences to realize deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowances. In arriving at this conclusion to utilize projections of future profit before tax in its estimate of future taxable income, including the potential impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act legislation, or the Tax Act, the Company considered the profit before tax generated in recent years.  A valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the Company's net deferred tax assets to an amount that is more-likely-than-not to be realized.

The Company reduces its current income tax expense in the consolidated statement of operations for any investment tax credits, or ITCs, that are not convertible into cash grants, as well as other tax credits, in the period the tax credit is generated.  ITCs that are convertible into cash grants, as well as the deferred income tax benefit generated by the difference in the financial statement and tax basis of the related assets, are recorded as a reduction to the carrying value of the underlying property and subsequently amortized to earnings on a straight-line basis over the useful life of each underlying property.

The Company accounts for uncertain tax positions in accordance with ASC 740, which applies to all tax positions related to income taxes.  Under ASC 740, tax benefits are recognized when it is more-likely-than-not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination by the authorities.  The benefit recognized from a position that has surpassed the more-likely-than-not threshold is the largest amount of benefit that is more than50%likely to be realized upon settlement.  The Company recognizes interest and penalties accrued related to uncertain tax benefits as a component of income tax expense.

In accordance with ASC 805 and as discussed further inNote 19,Income Taxes, changes to existing net deferred tax assets or valuation allowances or changes to uncertain tax benefits, are recorded to income tax expense.










Revenue Recognition

Energy— Both physical and financial transactions are entered into to optimize the financial performance of the Company's generating facilities. Electric energy revenue is recognized upon transmission to the customer. Physical transactions, or the sale of generated electricity to meet supply and demand, are recorded on a gross basis in the Company's consolidated statements of operations. Financial transactions, or the buying and selling of energy for trading purposes, are recorded net within operating revenues in the consolidated statements of operations in accordance with ASC 815.

Capacity— Capacity revenues are recognized when contractually earned, and consist of revenues billed to a third party at either the market or a negotiated contract price for making installed generation capacity available in order to satisfy system integrity and reliability requirements.

Sale of Emission Allowances— The Company records its bank of emission allowances as part of intangible assets. From time to time, management may authorize the transfer of emission allowances in excess of usage from the Company's emission bank to intangible assets held-for-sale for trading purposes. The Company records the sale of emission allowances on a net basis within operating revenue in the Company's consolidated statements of operations.

Contract Amortization— Assets and liabilities recognized from power sales agreements assumed at Fresh Start and through acquisitions related to the sale of electric capacity and energy in future periods for which the fair value has been determined to be significantly less (more) than market are amortized to revenue over the term of each underlying contract based on actual generation and/or contracted volumes.

Retail revenues— Gross revenues for energy sales and services to retail customers are recognized upon delivery under the accrual method. Energy sales and services that have been delivered but not billed by period end are estimated. Gross revenues also includes energy revenues from resales of purchased power, which were$187 million,$154 millionand$165 millionfor the years endedDecember 31, 2017,2016, and2015, respectively. These revenues represent the sale of excess supply to third parties in the market.

Accrued unbilled revenues are based on estimates of customer usage since the date of the last meter reading provided by the independent system operators or electric distribution companies. Volume estimates are based on daily forecasted volumes and estimated customer usage by class. Unbilled revenues are calculated by multiplying these volume estimates by the applicable rate by customer class. Estimated amounts are adjusted when actual usage is known and billed. The Company recorded receivables for unbilled revenues of$376 million,$321 millionand$307 millionas ofDecember 31, 2017,2016, and2015, respectively, for retail energy sales and services.

Consumer product revenues are recognized when title and risk of loss pass to the retailer, distributor, or end-customer and when all of the following have occurred: a firm sales agreement is in place, delivery has occurred, pricing is fixed and determinable, and collection is reasonably assured. Revenue is recognized as the net amount expected to be received after deducting estimated amounts for product returns, discounts, and allowances based on historical return rates and reasonable judgment.

Lessor Accounting

Certain of the Company’s revenues are obtained through PPAs or other contractual agreements.  Many of these agreements are accounted for as operating leases under ASC 840Leases.

Certain of these leases have no minimum lease payments and all of the rent is recorded as contingent rent on an actual basis when the electricity is delivered.  Judgment is required by management in determining the economic life of each generating facility, in evaluating whether certain lease provisions constitute minimum payments or represent contingent rent and other factors in determining whether a contract contains a lease and whether the lease is an operating lease or capital lease.  Contingent rental income recognized in the years endedDecember 31, 2017,2016, and2015was$879 million,$912 million, and$753 million, respectively.

Gross Receipts and Sales Taxes

In connection with its retail business, the Company records gross receipts taxes on a gross basis in revenues and cost of operations in its consolidated statements of operations.  During the years endedDecember 31, 2017,2016, and2015, the Company's revenues and cost of operations included gross receipts taxes of$92 million,$101 million, and$110 million, respectively.  Additionally, the retail business records sales taxes collected from its taxable customers and remitted to the various governmental entities on a net basis; thus, there is no impact on the Company's consolidated statement of operations.










Cost of Energy for Retail Operations

The cost of energy for electricity sales and services to retail customers is included in cost of operations and is based on estimated supply volumes for the applicable reporting period. A portion of the cost of energy ($107 million,$90 millionand$85 millionas ofDecember 31, 2017,2016, and2015, respectively) was accrued and consisted of estimated transmission and distribution charges not yet billed by the transmission and distribution utilities. In estimating supply volumes, the Company considers the effects of historical customer volumes, weather factors and usage by customer class.  Transmission and distribution delivery fees are estimated using the same method used for electricity sales and services to retail customers.  In addition, ISO fees are estimated based on historical trends, estimated supply volumes and initial ERCOT ISO settlements. Volume estimates are then multiplied by the supply rate and recorded as cost of operations in the applicable reporting period.

Derivative Financial Instruments

The Company accounts for derivative financial instruments under ASC 815, which requires the Company to record all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value unless they qualify for a NPNS exception. Changes in the fair value of non-hedge derivatives are immediately recognized in earnings. Changes in the fair value of derivatives accounted for as cash flow hedges, if elected for hedge accounting, are deferred and recorded as a component of accumulated OCI until the hedged transactions occur and are recognized in earnings.

The Company's primary derivative instruments are power purchase or sales contracts, fuels purchase contracts, other energy related commodities, and interest rate instruments used to mitigate variability in earnings due to fluctuations in market prices and interest rates.  On an ongoing basis, the Company assesses the effectiveness of all derivatives that are designated as hedges for accounting purposes in order to determine that each derivative continues to be highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of hedged items. Internal analyses that measure the statistical correlation between the derivative and the associated hedged item determine the effectiveness of such a contract designated as a hedge.  If it is determined that the derivative instrument is not highly effective as a hedge, hedge accounting will be discontinued prospectively.  In this case, the gain or loss previously deferred in accumulated OCI would be frozen until the underlying hedged instrument is delivered unless the transactions being hedged are no longer probable of occurring in which case the amount in OCI would be immediately reclassified into earnings. If the derivative instrument is terminated, the effective portion of this derivative deferred in accumulated OCI will be frozen until the underlying hedged item is delivered.

Revenues and expenses on contracts that qualify for the NPNS exception are recognized when the underlying physical transaction is delivered.  While these contracts are considered derivative financial instruments under ASC 815, they are not recorded at fair value, but on an accrual basis of accounting.  If it is determined that a transaction designated as NPNS no longer meets the scope exception, the fair value of the related contract is recorded on the balance sheet and immediately recognized through earnings.

NRG's trading activities are subject to limits in accordance with the Company's Risk Management Policy.  These contracts are recognized on the balance sheet at fair value and changes in the fair value of these derivative financial instruments are recognized in earnings.

Foreign Currency Translation and Transaction Gains and Losses

The local currencies are generally the functional currency of NRG's foreign operations.  Foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities are translated at end-of-period rates of exchange. Revenues, expenses, and cash flows are translated at the weighted-average rates of exchange for the period.  The resulting currency translation adjustments are not included in the Company's consolidated statements of operations for the period, but are accumulated and reported as a separate component of stockholders' equity until sale or complete or substantially complete liquidation of the net investment in the foreign entity takes place.  Foreign currency transaction gains or losses are reported within other income/(expense) in the Company's consolidated statements of operations.  For the years endedDecember 31, 2017,2016, and2015, amounts recognized as foreign currency transaction gains (losses) were immaterial.  The Company's cumulative translation adjustment balances as ofDecember 31, 2017,2016, and2015were$(2) million,$(11) millionand$(10) million, respectively.










Concentrations of Credit Risk

Financial instruments which potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of trust funds, accounts receivable, notes receivable, derivatives, and investments in debt securities. Trust funds are held in accounts managed by experienced investment advisors. Certain accounts receivable, notes receivable, and derivative instruments are concentrated within entities engaged in the energy industry. These industry concentrations may impact the Company's overall exposure to credit risk, either positively or negatively, in that the customers may be similarly affected by changes in economic, industry or other conditions. Receivables and other contractual arrangements are subject to collateral requirements under the terms of enabling agreements. However, the Company believes that the credit risk posed by industry concentration is offset by the diversification and creditworthiness of its customer base. SeeNote 4,Fair Value of Financial Instruments,for a further discussion of derivative concentrations.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments

The carrying amount of cash and cash equivalents, funds deposited by counterparties, receivables, accounts payable, and accrued liabilities approximate fair value because of the short-term maturity of these instruments. SeeNote 4,Fair Value of Financial Instruments,for a further discussion of fair value of financial instruments.

Asset Retirement Obligations

The Company accounts for AROs in accordance with ASC 410-20,Asset Retirement Obligations,or ASC 410-20.  Retirement obligations associated with long-lived assets included within the scope of ASC 410-20 are those for which a legal obligation exists under enacted laws, statutes, and written or oral contracts, including obligations arising under the doctrine of promissory estoppel, and for which the timing and/or method of settlement may be conditional on a future event. ASC 410-20 requires an entity to recognize the fair value of a liability for an ARO in the period in which it is incurred and a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made.

Upon initial recognition of a liability for an ARO, the Company capitalizes the asset retirement cost by increasing the carrying amount of the related long-lived asset by the same amount.  Over time, the liability is accreted to its future value, while the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset.  SeeNote 13,Asset Retirement Obligations,for a further discussion of AROs.

Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits

The Company offers pension benefits through a defined benefit pension plan.  In addition, the Company provides postretirement health and welfare benefits for certain groups of employees. The Company accounts for pension and other postretirement benefits in accordance with ASC 715,Compensation — Retirement Benefits.The Company recognizes the funded status of the Company's defined benefit plans in the statement of financial position and records an offset for gains and losses as well as all prior service costs that have not been included as part of the Company's net periodic benefit cost to other comprehensive income.  The determination of the Company's obligation and expenses for pension benefits is dependent on the selection of certain assumptions.  These assumptions determined by management include the discount rate, the expected rate of return on plan assets and the rate of future compensation increases. The Company's actuarial consultants determine assumptions for such items as retirement age.  The assumptions used may differ materially from actual results, which may result in a significant impact to the amount of pension obligation or expense recorded by the Company.

The Company measures the fair value of its pension assets in accordance with ASC 820,Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures,or ASC 820.

Stock-Based Compensation

The Company accounts for its stock-based compensation in accordance with ASC 718,Compensation — Stock Compensation,or ASC 718.The fair value of the Company's non-qualified stock options and market stock units are estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model and the Monte Carlo valuation model, respectively.  NRG uses the Company's common stock price on the date of grant as the fair value of the Company's restricted stock units and deferred stock units.  Forfeiture rates are estimated based on an analysis of the Company's historical forfeitures, employment turnover, and expected future behavior.  The Company recognizes compensation expense for both graded and cliff vesting awards on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period for the entire award.










Investments Accounted for by the Equity Method

The Company has investments in various domestic energy projects, as well as one Australian project.  The equity method of accounting is applied to such investments in affiliates, which include joint ventures and partnerships, because the ownership structure prevents the Company from exercising a controlling influence over the operating and financial policies of the projects.  Under this method, equity in pre-tax income or losses of domestic partnerships and, generally, in the net income or losses of its Australian project, are reflected as equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates. For certain investments that relate to tax equity arrangements, equity earnings are allocated using the hypothetical liquidation at book value, or HLBV, method which is described below. Distributions from equity method investments that represent earnings on the Company's investment are included within cash flows from operating activities and distributions from equity method investments that represent a return of the Company's investment are included within cash flows from investing activities.

Tax Equity Arrangements

Redeemable Noncontrolling Interest

To the extent that the third-party has the right to redeem their interests for cash or other assets, the Company has included the noncontrolling interest attributable to the third party as a component of temporary equity in the mezzanine section of the consolidated balance sheet. The following table reflects the changes in the Company's redeemable noncontrolling interest balance for the years endedDecember 31, 2017,2016, and2015.

(In millions)Balance as of December 31, 2014$19Cash contributions from redeemable noncontrolling interest27Comprehensive loss attributable to redeemable noncontrolling interest(17)Balance as of December 31, 201529Distributions to redeemable noncontrolling interest(1)Contributions from redeemable noncontrolling interest33Non-cash adjustments to redeemable noncontrolling interest23Comprehensive loss attributable to redeemable noncontrolling interest(38)Balance as of December 31, 201646Distributions to redeemable noncontrolling interest(2)Contributions from redeemable noncontrolling interest99Non-cash adjustments to redeemable noncontrolling interest7Comprehensive loss attributable to redeemable noncontrolling interest(72)Balance as of December 31, 2017$78










Sale-Leaseback Arrangements

NRG is party to sale-leaseback arrangements that provide for the sale of certain assets to a third party and simultaneous leaseback to the Company.  In accordance with ASC 840-40,Sale-Leaseback Transactions, if the seller-lessee retains, through the leaseback, substantially all of the benefits and risks incident to the ownership of the property sold, the sale-leaseback transaction is accounted for as a financing arrangement.  An example of this type of continuing involvement would include an option to repurchase the assets or the buyer-lessor having the option to sell the assets back to the Company.  This provision is included in most of the Company’s sale-leaseback arrangements.  As such, the Company accounts for these arrangements as financings.

Under the financing method, the Company does not recognize as income any of the sale proceeds received from the lessor that contractually constitutes payment to acquire the assets subject to these arrangements.  Instead, the sale proceeds received are accounted for as financing obligations and leaseback payments made by the Company are allocated between interest expense and as a reduction to the financing obligation.  Interest on the financing obligation is calculated using the Company’s incremental borrowing rate at the inception of the arrangement on the outstanding financing obligation.  Judgment is required to determine the appropriate borrowing rate for the arrangement and in determining any gain or loss on the transaction that would be recorded either at the end of or over the lease term.

Marketing and Advertising Costs

The Company expenses its marketing and advertising costs as incurred and which are included within selling, general and administrative expenses.  Marketing and advertising expenses for the years endedDecember 31, 2017,2016, and2015were$184 million,$247 million, and$309 million, respectively.  The costs of tangible assets used in advertising campaigns are recorded as fixed assets or deferred advertising costs and amortized as advertising costs over the shorter of the useful life of the asset or the advertising campaign.  The Company has several long-term sponsorship arrangements.  Payments related to these arrangements are deferred and expensed over the term of the arrangement.  Advertising expenses for the years endedDecember 31, 2017,2016, and2015were$42 million,$53 million, and$135 million, respectively.

Reorganization Costs

Reorganization costs include costs incurred by the Company related to the Transformation Plan implementation and primarily reflect personnel costs related to cost savings initiatives.  As of December 31, 2017,$44 millionhas been incurred.

Business Combinations

The Company accounts for its business combinations in accordance with ASC 805,Business Combinations,or ASC 805. ASC 805 requires an acquirer to recognize and measure in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree at fair value at the acquisition date.  It also recognizes and measures the goodwill acquired or a gain from a bargain purchase in the business combination and determines what information to disclose to enable users of an entity's financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination.  In addition, transaction costs are expensed as incurred.

Use of Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.  Actual results could differ from these estimates.

In recording transactions and balances resulting from business operations, the Company uses estimates based on the best information available. Estimates are used for such items as plant depreciable lives, tax provisions, uncollectible accounts, actuarially determined benefit costs, the valuation of energy commodity contracts, environmental liabilities, legal costs incurred in connection with recorded loss contingencies, and assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business combinations, among others.  In addition, estimates are used to test long-lived assets and goodwill for impairment and to determine the fair value of impaired assets.  As better information becomes available or actual amounts are determinable, the recorded estimates are revised.  Consequently, operating results can be affected by revisions to prior accounting estimates.

Reclassifications

Certain prior-year amounts have been reclassified for comparative purposes. The reclassifications did not affect results from operations, net assets or cash flows.










Recent Accounting Developments - Guidance Adopted in 2017

ASU 2018-02— In February 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-02,Income Statement - Reporting Comprehensive Income (Topic 220), Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income, or ASU No. 2018-02. Prior to ASU No. 2018-02, GAAP required the remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities as a result of a change in tax laws or rates to be presented in net income from continuing operations, even in situations in which the related income tax effects of items in accumulated other comprehensive income were originally recognized in other comprehensive income. As a result, such items, referred to as stranded tax effects, did not reflect the appropriate tax rate. Under ASU No. 2018-02, entities are permitted, but not required, to reclassify from accumulated other comprehensive income to retained earnings those stranded tax effects resulting from the Tax Act. ASU No. 2018-02 is effective for all entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. The Company adopted the new standard effective December 31, 2017. As a result of the adoption, the Company reclassified$13 millionfrom accumulated other comprehensive loss to retained earnings in the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2017.

ASU 2017-12— In August 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-12,Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815), Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities, or ASU No. 2017-12. The amendments of ASU No. 2017-12 were issued to simplify the application of hedge accounting guidance and more closely align financial reporting for hedging relationships with economic results of an entity's risk management activities. The issues addressed by ASU No. 2017-12 include but are not limited to alignment of risk management activities and financial reporting, risk component hedging, accounting for the hedged item in fair value hedges of interest rate risk, recognition and presentation of the effects of hedging instruments, amounts excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness, and other simplifications of hedge accounting guidance. The Company adopted the guidance in ASU No. 2017-12 during the fourth quarter of 2017, with no material adjustments recorded to the consolidated results of operations, cash flows, and statement of financial position.

ASU 2016-18— In November 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-18,Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230), Restricted Cash, or ASU No. 2016-18. The amendments of ASU No. 2016-18 require an entity to include amounts generally described as restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents, including funds deposited by counterparties with cash and cash equivalents when reconciling the beginning of period and end of period total amounts on the statement of cash flows. The amendments of ASU No. 2016-18 are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those annual periods. Early adoption is permitted and the adoption of ASU No. 2016-18 will be applied retrospectively. The Company adopted the guidance in ASU No. 2016-18 during the second quarter of 2017. In connection with the adoption of the standard, the Company has applied the guidance retrospectively which resulted in a (decrease)/increase in cash flows from operations of$(53) millionand$37 millionand an increase/(decrease) in cash flows from investing of$32 millionand$(43) millionon the statement of cash flows for the years endedDecember 31, 2016and2015, respectively.

ASU 2016-16— In October 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-16,Income Taxes (Topic 740), Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory, or ASU No. 2016-16.  Previous GAAP prohibited the recognition of current and deferred income taxes for an intra-entity asset transfer until the asset has been sold to an outside party which has resulted in diversity in practice and increased complexity within financial reporting.  The amendments of ASU No. 2016-16 require an entity to recognize the income tax consequences of an intra-entity transfer of an asset other than inventory when the transfer occurs.  The Company adopted the guidance in ASU No. 2016-16 effective January 1, 2017. In connection with the adoption of the standard, the Company recorded a reduction to non-current assets of$267 millionwith a corresponding reduction to cumulative retained deficit as ofDecember 31, 2017.

ASU 2016-15— In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15,Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230), Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments, or ASU No. 2016-15. The amendments of ASU No. 2016-15 were issued to address eight specific cash flow issues for which stakeholders have indicated to the FASB that a diversity in practice existed in how entities were presenting and classifying these items in the statement of cash flows. The issues addressed by ASU No. 2016-15 include but are not limited to the classification of debt prepayment and debt extinguishment costs, payments made for contingent consideration for a business combination, proceeds from the settlement of insurance proceeds, distributions received from equity method investees and separately identifiable cash flows and the application of the predominance principle. The Company adopted the guidance in ASU No. 2016-15 effective January 1, 2017. In connection with the adoption of the standard, the Company has applied the guidance retrospectively which resulted in an increase in cash flows from operations of$121 millionand a decrease in cash flows from financing of$121 millionon the statement of cash flows for the year endedDecember 31, 2016. There was no impact to the statement of cash flows for the year endedDecember 31, 2015, as a result of adoption.










ASU 2016-09— In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09,Compensation - Stock Compensation(Topic 718), or ASU No. 2016-09. The amendments focused on simplification specifically with regard to share-based payment transactions, including income tax consequences, classification of awards as equity or liabilities and classification on the statement of cash flows. The Company adopted the guidance in ASU No. 2016-09 effective January 1, 2017, with no material adjustments recorded to the Company's consolidated financial statements.

Recent Accounting Developments - Guidance Not Yet Adopted

ASU 2017-07— In March 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-07,Compensation - Retirement Benefits (Topic 715), Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Cost, or ASU No. 2017-07.   Current GAAP does not indicate where the amount of net benefit cost should be presented in an entity’s income statement and does not require entities to disclose the amount of net benefit cost that is included in the income statement. The amendments of ASU No. 2017-07 require an entity to report the service cost component of net benefit costs in the same line item as other compensation costs arising from services rendered by the related employees during the applicable service period. The other components of net benefit cost are required to be presented separately from the service cost component and outside the subtotal of income from operations. Further, ASU No. 2017-07 prescribes that only the service cost component of net benefit costs is eligible for capitalization. The Company adopted the amendments of ASU No. 2017-07 effective January 1, 2018. The adoption of ASU No. 2017-07 will not have a material impact on the Company's results of operations, cash flows, and statement of financial position.

Note 3—Discontinued Operations, Acquisitions and Dispositions

Discontinued Operations

As described inNote 1,Nature of Business, on the Petition Date, the GenOn Entities filed voluntary petitions for relief under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code in the Bankruptcy Court. As a result of the bankruptcy filings, NRG concluded that it no longer controls GenOn as it is subject to the control of the Bankruptcy Court; and, accordingly, NRG no longer consolidates GenOn for financial reporting purposes.










By eliminating a large portion of its operations in the PJM market with the deconsolidation of GenOn, NRG concluded that GenOn meets the criteria for discontinued operations, as this represents a strategic shift in the markets in which NRG operates. As such, all prior period results for GenOn have been reclassified as discontinued operations while NRG will record all ongoing results of GenOn as a cost method investment, which was valued atzeroat the date of deconsolidation.

Summarized results of discontinued operations were as follows:

Year ended December 31,(In millions)20172016Operating revenues$646$1,862Operating costs and expenses(702)(1,896)Gain on sale of assets—294Other expenses(98)(168)(Loss)/Income from operations of discontinued components, before tax(154)92Income tax expense911(Loss)/Income from operations of discontinued components(163)81Interest income - affiliate811(Loss)/Income from operations of discontinued components, net of tax(155)92Pre-tax loss on deconsolidation(208)—Settlement consideration and services credit(289)—Pension and post-retirement liability assumption(131)—Other(6)—Loss on disposal of discontinued components, net of tax(634)—(Loss)/Income from discontinued operations, net of tax$(789)$92



The following table summarizes the major classes of assets and liabilities classified as discontinued operations as of December 31, 2016. As of June 14, 2017, NRG no longer consolidates GenOn for financial reporting purposes.

Chapter 11 Cases

Prior to the GenOn Entities' filing the Chapter 11 Cases, on June 12, 2017, NRG entered into a restructuring support and lock-up agreement, or the Restructuring Support Agreement, with the GenOn Entities and certain holders of the GenOn and GenOn Americas Generation Senior Notes, that provides for a restructuring and recapitalization of the GenOn Entities through a prearranged plan of reorganization. There is no assurance that the GenOn Entities' plan will be successfully implemented. The principal terms of the Restructuring Support Agreement are described further below.












On September 18, 2017, and October 2, 2017, the GenOn Entities filed amendments to the plan of reorganization and the disclosure statement which primarily provided the GenOn Entities with the flexibility to complete sales of certain assets pursuant to the amended plan of reorganization and removed the GenOn Entities' requirement to conduct a rights offering in connection with the GenOn Entities' exit financing.

On October 31, 2017, the GenOn Entities announced that they entered into a Consent Agreement with certain holders of GenOn’s Senior Notes and GenOn Americas Generation's Senior Notes, collectively, the Consenting Holders, whereby the GenOn Entities and the Consenting Holders agreed to extend the milestones in the Restructuring Support Agreement, by which the plan of reorganization must become effective, or the Effective Date.  Specifically, the Consent Agreement extended the Effective Date milestone to June 30, 2018, or September 30, 2018, if regulatory approvals are still pending, or the Extended Effective Dates.

On December 12, 2017, the Bankruptcy Court entered an order confirming the plan of reorganization, and effective December 12, 2017, GenOn and NRG entered into agreements concerning (i) timeline and transition, (ii) cooperation and co-development matters, (iii) post-employment and retiree health and welfare benefits and pension benefits, (iv) tax matters, and (v) intercompany balances and releases, consistent with the Restructuring Support Agreement, which among other things, provide for the transition of GenOn to a standalone enterprise, the resolution of substantial intercompany claims between GenOn and NRG, and the allocation of certain costs and liabilities between GenOn and NRG. On December 12, 2017, the Bankruptcy Court also entered an order giving effect to the Consent Agreement.

Forms of certain of the definitive documents that make up the plan supplement were filed with the Bankruptcy Court by the GenOn Entities and approved by the Bankruptcy Court in connection with the confirmation of the plan of reorganization. It is a condition precedent to the occurrence of the effective date of the plan of reorganization that the final version of the plan supplement be consistent with the Restructuring Support Agreement, in all material respects.

Restructuring Support Agreement

As described inNote 1,Nature of Business, NRG, GenOn and certain holders representing greater than93%in aggregate principal amount of GenOn’s Senior Notes and certain holders representing greater than93%in aggregate principal amount of GenOn Americas Generation’s Senior Notes entered into a Restructuring Support Agreement that provides for a restructuring and recapitalization of the GenOn Entities through a prearranged plan of reorganization that was approved by the Bankruptcy Court pursuant to an order of confirmation. Completion of the agreed upon terms is contingent upon certain milestones in the Restructuring Support Agreement and the satisfaction or waiver or certain conditions precedent. Certain principal terms of the Restructuring Support Agreement and the plan of reorganization are detailed below:

1)The dismissal of litigation and full releases from GenOn and GenOn Americas Generation in favor of NRG upon the earlier of the consummation of the GenOn Entities' plan of reorganization or the Settlement Agreement; a condition precedent to the consummation of the Settlement Agreement is a full release or indemnification in favor of NRG from any claims of GenOn Mid-Atlantic and REMA.

2)NRG will provide settlement cash consideration to GenOn of$261.3 million, which will be paid in cash less any amounts owed to NRG under the intercompany secured revolving credit facility. As of December 31, 2017, GenOn owed NRG approximately$125 millionunder the intercompany secured revolving credit facility. SeeNote 21,Related Party Transactions, for further discussion of the intercompany secured revolving credit facility.

3)NRG will consent to the cancellation of its interests in the equity of GenOn and be entitled to a worthless stock deduction, as further described in the tax matters agreement. The equity interests in the reorganized GenOn will be issued to the holders of the GenOn Senior Notes.

4)NRG will retain the pension liability, including payment of approximately$13 millionof 2017 pension contributions, for GenOn employees for service provided prior to the completion of the reorganization, which was paid in September 2017. GenOn’s pension liability as of December 31, 2017, was approximately$92 million. NRG will also retain the liability for GenOn’s post-employment and retiree health and welfare benefits, in an amount up to$25 million.

5)The shared services agreement between NRG and GenOn was terminated and replaced as of the plan confirmation date with a transition services agreement. Under the transition services agreement, NRG will continue to provide the shared services and other separation services at an annualized rate of$84 million, subject to certain credits and adjustments. SeeNote 21,Related Party Transactions, for further discussion of the Services Agreement.

6)NRG will provide a credit of$28 millionto GenOn to apply against amounts owed under the transition services agreement. Any unused amount can be paid in cash at GenOn’s request. The credit was intended to reimburse GenOn for its payment of financing costs.

7)NRG agreed to provide GenOn with a letter of credit facility during the pendency of the Chapter 11 Cases, which could be utilized for required letters of credit in lieu of the intercompany secured revolving credit facility.  GenOn can no longer utilize the intercompany secured revolving credit facility and, on July 27, 2017, the letter of credit facility was terminated, as GenOn had obtained a separate letter of credit facility with a third party financial institution. SeeNote 21,Related Party Transactions, for further discussion of the intercompany secured revolver credit facility










and the letter of credit facility obtained in July 2017.

8)NRG and GenOn have agreed to cooperate in good faith to maximize the value of certain development projects. Pursuant to this, GenOn made a one-time payment in the amount of$15 millionto NRG in December 2017 as compensation for a purchase option with respect to the Canal 3 project.

Settlement Consideration

NRG has determined that the payment of the settlement consideration is probable and has recorded a liability for the amount due of$261.3 millionin accrued expenses and other current liabilities - affiliate with a corresponding loss from discontinued operations.  NRG expects to pay this amount net of amounts due from GenOn under the intercompany secured revolving credit facility, which is further described inNote 21,Related Party Transactions.

Pension Liability

NRG will retain the pension liability, including payment of approximately$13 millionof 2017 pension contributions, which was paid in September 2017, for the GenOn employees for service provided prior to emergence from bankruptcy.  NRG determined that the retention of this liability is probable and has recorded the estimated accumulated pension benefit obligation as of December 31, 2017 of$92 millionin other non-current liabilities with a corresponding loss from discontinued operations. NRG's obligation for this liability will be revalued through and at GenOn's emergence from bankruptcy.

Services Agreement

In December 2017, in conjunction with the confirmation of the GenOn Entities' plan of reorganization, the Services Agreement was terminated and replaced by the transition services agreement. Under the transition services agreement, NRG will continue to provide shared services and other separation services to GenOn at an annualized rate of$84 millionuntil June 30, 2018, which may be extended by GenOn through September 30, 2018.  NRG may provide additional separation services that are necessary for or reasonably related to the operation of GenOn's business after such date, subject to NRG's prior written consent, not to be unreasonably withheld.

Beginning on June 14, 2017, and through December 2017, NRG recorded amounts earned for shared services of approximately$5 millionper month. In December 2017, NRG provided GenOn with a$3.5 millioncredit for services provided under the transition services agreement and began recording amounts earned for shared services of approximately$7 millionper month. NRG has also agreed to provide GenOn with a credit of$28 millionagainst amounts owed under the transition services agreement.  Any unused amount can be paid in cash at GenOn’s request, subject to the terms and conditions of the transition services agreement.  As a result, NRG has concluded that the liability for this credit is probable and has recorded a payable to GenOn for$28 millionin accrued expenses and other current liabilities - affiliate with a corresponding loss from discontinued operations.

Commercial Operations

For pre-disposal periods, NRG provided GenOn with services as described inNote 21,Related Party Transactions.Under intercompany agreements, NRG Power Marketing LLC has entered into physical and financial intercompany commodity and hedging transactions with GenOn and certain of its subsidiaries. Subject to applicable collateral thresholds, these arrangements may provide for the bilateral exchange of credit support based upon market exposure and potential market movements. The terms and conditions of the agreements are generally consistent with industry practices and other third party arrangements.  For current and pre-disposal periods, revenue and expense associated with these transactions is recorded in continuing operations.

GenOn Debt

As of June 14, 2017, the GenOn Senior Notes and GenOn Americas Generation Senior Notes, which totaled approximately$2.5 billion, were deconsolidated from NRG's consolidated financial statements.  The filing of the Chapter 11 Cases constitutes an event of default under the following debt instruments of GenOn:

1)The intercompany secured revolving credit facility with NRG;

2)The indenture governing the GenOn7.875%Senior Notes due 2017 (as amended or supplemented from time to time);

3)The indenture governing the GenOn9.500%Notes due 2018 (as amended or supplemented from time to time);

4)The indenture governing the GenOn9.875%Notes due 2020 (as amended or supplemented from time to time);

5)The indenture governing the GenOn Americas Generation8.50%Senior Notes due 2021 (as amended or supplemented from time to time); and

6)The indenture governing the GenOn Americas Generation9.125%Senior Notes due 2031 (as amended or supplemented from time to time).










Dispositions

2016 Disposition of Majority Interest in EVgo

On June 17, 2016, the Company completed the sale of a majority interest in its EVgo business to Vision Ridge Partners for total consideration of approximately

$39 million

, including

$17 million

in cash received, which is net of

$2.5 million

in working capital adjustments,

$15 million

contributed as capital to the EVgo business and

$7 million

of future contributions by Vision Ridge Partners, all of which were determined based on forecasted cash requirements to operate the business in future periods.  In addition, the Company has future earnout potential of up to

$70 million

based on future profitability targets. NRG retained its original financial obligation of

$102.5 million

under its agreement with the CPUC whereby EVgo will build at least


public fast charging Freedom Station sites and perform the associated work to prepare

10,000

commercial and multi-family parking spaces for electric vehicle charging in California. As part of the sale, NRG has contracted with EVgo to continue to build the remaining required Freedom Stations and commercial and multi-family parking spaces for electric vehicle charging required under this obligation and EVgo will be directly reimbursed by NRG for the costs. As a result of the sale, the Company recorded a loss on sale of

during the second quarter of 2016, which reflects the loss on the sale of the equity interest of

$27 million

and the accrual of NRG's remaining obligation under its agreement with the CPUC of

$56 million

, of which

$25 million

remains as of December 31, 2017.  On February 22, 2017, the Company and CPUC entered into a second amendment to the agreement which extended the operating period commitment for the Freedom Stations to December 5, 2020. As of December 31, 2017, the Company's remaining

35%

interest in EVgo of

$1 million

was accounted for as an equity method investment.



2016 Rockford Disposition

On May 12, 2016, the Company entered into an agreement with RA Generation, LLC to sell100%of its interests in the Rockford I and Rockford II generating stations, or Rockford, for cash consideration of$55 million, subject to adjustments for working capital and the results of the PJM 2019/2020 base residual auction.  Rockford is a450-MW natural gas facility located in Rockford, Illinois. The transaction triggered an indicator of impairment as the sales price was less than the carrying amount of the assets and, as a result, the assets were considered to be impaired.  The Company measured the impairment loss as the difference between the carrying amount of the assets and the agreed-upon sales price.  The Company recorded an impairment loss of$17 millionduring the quarter ended June 30, 2016 to reduce the carrying amount of the assets held for sale to the fair market value.  On July 12, 2016, the Company completed the sale of Rockford for cash proceeds of$56 million, including$1 millionin adjustments for the PJM base residual auction results.  For further discussion on this impairment, refer toNote 10,Asset Impairments.

2015 Disposition of Altenex

On December 31, 2015, the Company completed the sale of its32%interest in Altenex, LLC to Edison Energy, LLC and Edison Energy NewCo 2, LLC for cash consideration of$26 million.  The Company had accounted for its investment in Altenex as an equity method investment and recognized a loss of$14 millionas a result of the transactions within the Company's consolidated statements of operations.

Acquisitions

2016 Utility-Scale Solar and Wind Acquisition

On November 2, 2016, the Company acquired equity interests in a tax equity portfolio from SunEdison, located in Utah, comprised of530MW of mechanically-complete solar assets, of which NRG’s net interest based on cash to be distributed is265MW, for upfront cash consideration of$111 million.  In connection with the acquisition, the Company assumed non-recourse debt of$222 million.  The Company also borrowed additional amounts of$65 millionduring the fourth quarter of 2016, as described inNote 12,Debt and Capital Leases, which effectively reduced the Company's use of liquidity related to the acquisition. The Company does not have a controlling interest in the tax equity portfolio and, accordingly, its interest is recorded as an equity method investment. The purchase price was allocated to the equity method investment balance of approximately$328 million, current assets of$5 millionand the assumed non-recourse debt of$222 million. The assets reached commercial operations during the fourth quarter of 2016 and have20-year PPAs with PacifiCorp.

The Company acquired a110-MW portfolio of construction-ready and71MW of development solar assets in Hawaii from SunEdison for upfront cash consideration of$2 millionon October 3, 2016, and a154-MW construction-ready solar project in Texas for upfront cash consideration of$11 millionon November 9, 2016.

In addition to the total$124 millionin upfront cash consideration paid for the above acquisitions, the Company expects to make an estimated$59 millionin additional payments contingent upon future development milestones, of which$20 millionwas paid as of December 31, 2017.










2016 Solar Distributed Generation Acquisition

On October 3, 2016, the Company acquired a29-MW portfolio of mechanically-complete and construction-ready distributed generation solar assets from SunEdison for cash consideration of approximately$67 millionexcluding post-closing adjustments which reduced the purchase price by$5 million.  Subsequent to the acquisition, the Company sold these assets into a tax-equity financed portfolio within the DGPV Holdco partnership between NRG and NRG Yield, Inc. The purchase price was allocated to$47 millionin construction in progress and$15 millionin intangible assets.

2015 Acquisition of Desert Sunlight

On September 1, 2016, the Company completed the sale of its remaining51.05%interest in the CVSR project to NRG Yield, Inc. for total cash consideration of$78.5 million, plus an immaterial working capital adjustment. In addition, NRG Yield, Inc. assumed non-recourse project level debt of$496 million.

On November 3, 2015, the Company sold75%of the Class B interests of NRG Wind TE Holdco, which owns a portfolio of12wind facilities totaling814net MW, to NRG Yield, Inc.  NRG Yield, Inc. paid total cash consideration of$209 million, subject to working capital adjustments.  NRG Yield, Inc. is responsible for its pro-rata share of non-recourse project debt of$193 millionand noncontrolling interest associated with a tax equity structure of$159 million(as of the acquisition date).  In February 2016, the Company made a final working capital payment of$2 millionto NRG Yield, Inc. reducing total cash consideration to$207 million.



On January 2, 2015, the Company sold the following facilities to NRG Yield, Inc.: Walnut Creek, the Tapestry projects (Buffalo Bear, Pinnacle and Taloga) and Laredo Ridge.

The above sales were recorded as transfers of entities under common control and the related assets were transferred at their carrying value.














Note 4—Fair Value of Financial Instruments

For cash and cash equivalents, funds deposited by counterparties, accounts and other receivables, accounts payable, restricted cash, and cash collateral posted and received in support of energy risk management activities, the carrying amount approximates fair value because of the short-term maturity of those instruments and are classified as Level 1 within the fair value hierarchy.

The estimated carrying values and fair values of the Company's recorded financial instruments not carried at fair market value are as follows:

As of December 31,20172016Carrying AmountFair ValueCarrying AmountFair Value(In millions)AssetsNotes receivable(a)$16$15$34$34LiabilitiesLong-term debt, including current portion(b)$16,603$16,894$16,655$16,620

(a)  Includes the current portion of notes receivable which is recorded in prepayments and other current assets on the Company's consolidated balance sheets.

(b)  Excludes deferred financing costs, which are recorded as a reduction to long-term debt on the Company's consolidated balance sheets.

The fair value of the Company's publicly-traded long-term debt is based on quoted market prices and is classified as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy.  The fair value of debt securities, non-publicly traded long-term debt, and certain notes receivable of the Company are based on expected future cash flows discounted at market interest rates or current interest rates for similar instruments with equivalent credit quality and are classified as Level 3 within the fair value hierarchy. The following table presents the level within the fair value hierarchy for long-term debt, including current portion as ofDecember 31, 2017and2016:

As of December 31, 2017As of December 31, 2016Level 2Level 3Level 2Level 3(In millions)Long-term debt, including current portion$8,934$7,960$9,205$7,415



Fair Value Accounting under ASC 820

ASC 820 establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three levels as follows:

•Level 1 — quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Company has the ability to access as of the measurement date. NRG's financial assets and liabilities utilizing Level 1 inputs include active exchange-traded securities, energy derivatives, and trust fund investments.

•Level 2 — inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are directly observable for the asset or liability or indirectly observable through corroboration with observable market data. NRG's financial assets and liabilities utilizing Level 2 inputs include fixed income securities, exchange-based derivatives, and over the counter derivatives such as swaps, options and forward contracts.

•Level 3 — unobservable inputs for the asset or liability only used when there is little, if any, market activity for the asset or liability at the measurement date. NRG's financial assets and liabilities utilizing Level 3 inputs include infrequently-traded, non-exchange-based derivatives and commingled investment funds, and are measured using present value pricing models.

In accordance with ASC 820, the Company determines the level in the fair value hierarchy within which each fair value measurement in its entirety falls, based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety.










Recurring Fair Value Measurements

Debt securities, equity securities, and trust fund investments, which are comprised of various U.S. debt and equity securities, and derivative assets and liabilities, are carried at fair market value.

The following tables present assets and liabilities measured and recorded at fair value on the Company's consolidated balance sheets on a recurring basis and their level within the fair value hierarchy:

There have beennotransfers during the year endedDecember 31, 2017between Levels 1 and 2.  The following tables reconcile, for the years endedDecember 31, 2017and2016, the beginning and ending balances for financial instruments that are recognized at fair value in the consolidated financial statements at least annually using significant unobservable inputs:

(c)All Trust Fund Investments were considered transferred out of Level 3 as these investments are measured using net asset value as a practical expedient and are thus classified outside of the fair value hierarchy as of December 31, 2016.

Realized and unrealized gains and losses included in earnings that are related to the energy derivatives are recorded in operating revenues and cost of operations.

Non-derivative fair value measurements

NRG's investments in debt securities are classified as Level 3 and consist of non-traded debt instruments that are valued based on third-party market value assessments.

The trust fund investments are held primarily to satisfy NRG's nuclear decommissioning obligations.  These trust fund investments hold debt and equity securities directly and equity securities indirectly through commingled funds.  The fair values of equity securities held directly by the trust funds are based on quoted prices in active markets and are categorized in Level 1.  In addition, U.S. government and federal agency obligations are categorized as Level 1 because they trade in a highly liquid and transparent market.  The fair values of corporate debt securities are based on evaluated prices that reflect observable market information, such as actual trade information of similar securities, adjusted for observable differences and are categorized in Level 2.  Certain equity securities, classified as commingled funds, are analogous to mutual funds, are maintained by investment companies, and hold certain investments in accordance with a stated set of fund objectives.  The fair value of the equity securities classified as commingled funds are based on net asset values per fund share (the unit of account), derived from the quoted prices in active markets of the underlying equity securities.  However, because the shares in the commingled funds are not publicly quoted, not traded in an active market and are subject to certain restrictions regarding their purchase and sale, the commingled funds are categorized in Level 3.  See alsoNote 6,Nuclear Decommissioning Trust Fund.










Derivative fair value measurements

6%

of derivative assets and

10%

of derivative liabilities.  The fair value of each contract is discounted using a risk free interest rate.  In addition, the Company applies a credit reserve to reflect credit risk, which for interest rate swaps is calculated utilizing the bilateral method based on published default probabilities.  For commodities, to the extent that NRG's net exposure under a specific master agreement is an asset, the Company uses the counterparty's default swap rate.  If the exposure under a specific master agreement is a liability, the Company uses NRG's default swap rate.  For interest rate swaps and commodities, the credit reserve is added to the discounted fair value to reflect the exit price that a market participant would be willing to receive to assume NRG's liabilities or that a market participant would be willing to pay for NRG's assets.  As of

December 31, 2017

, the credit reserve resulted in no change in fair value in operating revenue and cost of operations.  As of

December 31, 2016

the credit reserve resulted in a

$10 million

decrease in fair value in operating revenue and cost of operations.

The fair values in each category reflect the level of forward prices and volatility factors as ofDecember 31, 2017, and may change as a result of changes in these factors. Management uses its best estimates to determine the fair value of commodity and derivative contracts NRG holds and sells. These estimates consider various factors including closing exchange and over-the-counter price quotations, time value, volatility factors and credit exposure. It is possible, however, that future market prices could vary from those used in recording assets and liabilities from energy marketing and trading activities and such variations could be material.

NRG's significant positions classified as Level 3 include physical and financial power executed in illiquid markets as well as financial transmission rights, or FTRs. The significant unobservable inputs used in developing fair value include illiquid power location pricing which is derived as a basis to liquid locations. The basis spread is based on observable market data when available or derived from historic prices and forward market prices from similar observable markets when not available. For FTRs, NRG uses the most recent auction prices to derive the fair value.

The following tables quantify the significant unobservable inputs used in developing the fair value of the Company's Level 3 positions as ofDecember 31, 2017and2016:

Under the guidance of ASC 815, entities may choose to offset cash collateral posted or received against the fair value of derivative positions executed with the same counterparties under the same master netting agreements.  The Company has chosen not to offset positions as defined in ASC 815.  As ofDecember 31, 2017, the Company recorded$171 millionof cash collateral posted and$37 millionof cash collateral received on its balance sheet.

Concentration of Credit Risk

In addition to the credit risk discussion as disclosed inNote 2,Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, the following item is a discussion of the concentration of credit risk for the Company's financial instruments. Credit risk relates to the risk of loss resulting from non-performance or non-payment by counterparties pursuant to the terms of their contractual obligations.  The Company monitors and manages credit risk through credit policies that include: (i) an established credit approval process; (ii) a daily monitoring of counterparties' credit limits; (iii) the use of credit mitigation measures such as margin, collateral, prepayment arrangements, or volumetric limits; (iv) the use of payment netting agreements; and (v) the use of master netting agreements that allow for the netting of positive and negative exposures of various contracts associated with a single counterparty. Risks surrounding counterparty performance and credit could ultimately impact the amount and timing of expected cash flows. The Company seeks to mitigate counterparty risk by having a diversified portfolio of counterparties. The Company also has credit protection within various agreements to call on additional collateral support if and when necessary. Cash margin is collected and held at the Company to cover the credit risk of the counterparty until positions settle.










Counterparty Credit Risk

As ofDecember 31, 2017, counterparty credit exposure, excluding credit exposure from RTOs, ISOs, and registered commodity exchanges and certain long-term agreements, was$220 millionand NRG held collateral (cash and letters of credit) against those positions of$30 million, resulting in a net exposure of$196 million.  Approximately73%of the Company's exposure before collateral is expected to roll off by the end of2019. Counterparty credit exposure is valued through observable market quotes and discounted at a risk free interest rate.  The following tables highlight net counterparty credit exposure by industry sector and by counterparty credit quality.  Net counterparty credit exposure is defined as the aggregate net asset position for NRG with counterparties where netting is permitted under the enabling agreement and includes all cash flow, mark-to-market and NPNS, and non-derivative transactions.  The exposure is shown net of collateral held, and includes amounts net of receivables or payables.

(a)Counterparty credit exposure excludes uranium and coal transportation contracts because of the unavailability of market prices.

(b)The figures in the tables above exclude potential counterparty credit exposure related to RTOs, ISOs, registered commodity exchanges and certain long term contracts.

NRG has counterparty credit risk exposure to certain counterparties, each of which represent more than10%of total net exposure discussed above.  The aggregate of such counterparties' exposure was$37 millionas ofDecember 31, 2017.  Changes in hedge positions and market prices will affect credit exposure and counterparty concentration. Given the credit quality, diversification and term of the exposure in the portfolio, NRG does not anticipate a material impact on the Company's financial position or results of operations from nonperformance by any of NRG's counterparties.

RTOs and ISOs

The Company participates in the organized markets of CAISO, ERCOT, ISO-NE, MISO, NYISO and PJM, known as RTOs or ISOs. Trading in these markets is approved by FERC, or in the case of ERCOT, approved by the PUCT and includes credit policies that, under certain circumstances, require that losses arising from the default of one member on spot market transactions be shared by the remaining participants. As a result, the counterparty credit risk to these markets is limited to NRG’s share of overall market and are excluded from the above exposures.

Exchange Traded Transactions

The Company enters into commodity transactions on registered exchanges, notably ICE and NYMEX. These clearinghouses act as the counterparty and transactions are subject to extensive collateral and margining requirements. As a result, these commodity transactions have limited counterparty credit risk.

Long Term Contracts

Counterparty credit exposure described above excludes credit risk exposure under certain long term agreements, including California tolling agreements, Gulf Coast load obligations, wind and solar PPAs.  As external sources or observable market quotes are not available to estimate such exposure, the Company values these contracts based on various techniques including, but not limited to, internal models based on a fundamental analysis of the market and extrapolation of observable market data with similar characteristics.  Based on these valuation techniques, as ofDecember 31, 2017, aggregate credit risk exposure managed by NRG to these counterparties was approximately$4.1 billion, including$2.6 billionrelated to assets of NRG Yield, Inc., for the nextfiveyears.  This amount excludes potential credit exposures for projects with long term PPAs that have not reached commercial operations.  The majority of these power contracts are with utilities or public power entities with strong credit quality and public utility commission or other regulatory support.  However, such regulated utility counterparties can be impacted by changes in government regulations, which NRG is unable to predict.










Retail Customer Credit Risk

The Company is exposed to retail credit risk through the Company's retail electricity providers, which serve C&I customers and the Mass market. Retail credit risk results in losses when a customer fails to pay for services rendered. The losses may result from both nonpayment of customer accounts receivable and the loss of in-the-money forward value. The Company manages retail credit risk through the use of established credit policies that include monitoring of the portfolio and the use of credit mitigation measures such as deposits or prepayment arrangements.

As ofDecember 31, 2017, the Company's retail customer credit exposure to C&I and Mass customers was diversified across many customers and various industries, as well as government entities. The Company is also subject to risk with respect to its residential solar customers. The Company's bad debt expense was$68 million,$48 million, and$64 millionfor the years ending December 31,2017,2016, and2015, respectively.  Current economic conditions may affect the Company's customers' ability to pay bills in a timely manner, which could increase customer delinquencies and may lead to an increase in bad debt expense.



Note 5—Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities

ASC 815 requires the Company to recognize all derivative instruments on the balance sheet as either assets or liabilities and to measure them at fair value each reporting period unless they qualify for a NPNS exception.  The Company may elect to designate certain derivatives as cash flow hedges, if certain conditions are met, and defer the change in fair value of the derivatives to accumulated OCI, until the hedged transactions occur and are recognized in earnings.

For derivatives that are not designated as cash flow hedges or do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment, the changes in the fair value will be immediately recognized in earnings.  Certain derivative instruments may qualify for the NPNS exception and are therefore exempt from fair value accounting treatment.  ASC 815 applies to NRG's energy related commodity contracts, interest rate swaps, and equity contracts.

As the Company engages principally in the trading and marketing of its generation assets and retail businesses, some of NRG's commercial activities qualify for hedge accounting.  In order for the generation assets to qualify, the physical generation and sale of electricity should be highly probable at inception of the trade and throughout the period it is held, as is the case with the Company's baseload plants.  For this reason, trades in support of NRG's baseload units may qualify for NPNS or cash flow hedge accounting treatment, and trades in support of NRG's peaking units' asset optimization will generally not qualify for hedge accounting treatment, with any changes in fair value likely to be reflected on a mark-to-market basis in the statement of operations.  Most of the retail load contracts either qualify for the NPNS exception or fail to meet the criteria for a derivative and the majority of the retail supply and fuels supply contracts are recorded under mark-to-market accounting.  All of NRG's hedging and trading activities are subject to limits within the Company's Risk Management Policy.

Energy-Related Commodities

To manage the commodity price risk associated with the Company's competitive supply activities and the price risk associated with wholesale power sales from the Company's electric generation facilities and retail power sales from NRG's retail businesses, NRG enters into a variety of derivative and non-derivative hedging instruments, utilizing the following:

•Forward contracts, which commit NRG to purchase or sell energy commodities or purchase fuels in the future;

•Futures contracts, which are exchange-traded standardized commitments to purchase or sell a commodity or financial instrument;

•Swap agreements, which require payments to or from counterparties based upon the differential between two prices for a predetermined contractual, or notional, quantity;

•Option contracts, which convey to the option holder the right but not the obligation to purchase or sell a commodity;

•Extendable swaps, which include a combination of swaps and options executed simultaneously for different periods.  This combination of instruments allows NRG to sell out-year volatility through call options in exchange for natural gas swaps with fixed prices in excess of the market price for natural gas at that time.  The above-market swap combined with its later-year call option are priced in aggregate at market at the trade's inception; and

•Weather derivative products used to mitigate a portion of lost revenue due to weather.

The objectives for entering into derivative contracts designated as hedges include:

•Fixing the price for a portion of anticipated future electricity sales that provides an acceptable return on the Company's electric generation operations;

•Fixing the price of a portion of anticipated fuel purchases for the operation of the Company's power plants; and

•Fixing the price of a portion of anticipated power purchases for the Company's retail sales.










NRG's trading and hedging activities are subject to limits within the Company's Risk Management Policy. These contracts are recognized on the balance sheet at fair value and changes in the fair value of these derivative financial instruments are recognized in earnings.

As ofDecember 31, 2017, NRG's derivative assets and liabilities consisted primarily of the following:

•Forward and financial contracts for the purchase/sale of electricity and related products economically hedging NRG's generation assets' forecasted output or NRG's retail load obligations through 2031;

•Forward and financial contracts for the purchase of fuel commodities relating to the forecasted usage of NRG's generation assets through 2019; and

•Other energy derivatives instruments extending through 2024.

Also, as ofDecember 31, 2017, NRG had other energy-related contracts that did not meet the definition of a derivative instrument or qualified for the NPNS exception and were therefore exempt from fair value accounting treatment as follows:

•Load-following forward electric sale contracts extending through 2026;

•Power tolling contracts through 2043;

•Coal purchase contracts through 2021;

•Power transmission contracts through 2025;

•Natural gas transportation contracts and storage agreements through 2030; and

•Coal transportation contracts through 2029.

Interest Rate Swaps

NRG is exposed to changes in interest rates through the Company's issuance of variable rate debt. In order to manage the Company's interest rate risk, NRG enters into interest rate swap agreements.  As ofDecember 31, 2017, NRG had interest rate derivative instruments on recourse debt extending through 2021 and non-recourse debt extending through 2041, some of which are designated as cash flow hedges.

Volumetric Underlying Derivative Transactions

The following table summarizes the net notional volume buy/(sell) of NRG's open derivative transactions broken out by commodity, excluding those derivatives that qualified for the NPNS exception as ofDecember 31, 2017and2016. Option contracts are reflected using delta volume.   Delta volume equals the notional volume of an option adjusted for the probability that the option will be in-the-money at its expiration date.

Amounts reclassified from accumulated OCI into income are recorded to operating revenue for commodity contracts and interest expense for interest rate contracts.



Accounting guidelines require a high degree of correlation between the derivative and the hedged item throughout the period in order to qualify as a cash flow hedge.  As of December 31, 2016, the Company's regression analysis for Viento Funding II interest rate swaps, while positively correlated, did not meet the required threshold for cash flow hedge accounting. As a result, the Company de-designated the Viento Funding II cash flow hedges as of December 31, 2016, and will prospectively mark these derivatives to market through the income statement.



The Company's regression analysis for Marsh Landing, Walnut Creek and Avra Valley interest rate swaps, while positively correlated, no longer contain matching terms for cash flow hedge accounting.  As a result, the Company voluntarily de-designated the Marsh Landing, Walnut Creek and Avra Valley cash flow hedges as of April 28, 2017, and will prospectively mark these derivatives to market through the income statement.



Impact of Derivative Instruments on the Statement of Operations

Unrealized gains and losses associated with changes in the fair value of derivative instruments not accounted for as cash flow hedges are reflected in current period earnings.

The following table summarizes the pre-tax effects of economic hedges that have not been designated as cash flow hedges, and trading activity on the Company's statement of operations. The effect of commodity hedges is included within operating revenues and cost of operations and the effect of interest rate hedges is included in interest expense.

The reversal of gain or loss positions acquired as part of acquisitions were valued based upon the forward prices on the acquisition dates.  The roll-off amounts were offset by realized gains or losses at the settled prices and are reflected in revenue or cost of operations during the same period.

For the year endedDecember 31, 2017, the$146 milliongain from economic hedge positions was primarily the result of an increase in the value of forward purchases of ERCOT heat rate contracts due to ERCOT heat rate expansion.

For the year endedDecember 31, 2016, the$6 milliongain from economic hedge positions was primarily the result of an increase in the value of forward purchases of natural gas due to an increase in natural gas prices.










For the year endedDecember 31, 2015, the$9 millionloss from economic hedge positions was primarily the result of a decrease in the value of forward purchases of natural gas due to a decrease in natural gas prices.

Credit Risk Related Contingent Features

Certain of the Company's hedging agreements contain provisions that require the Company to post additional collateral if the counterparty determines that there has been deterioration in credit quality, generally termed "adequate assurance" under the agreements, or require the Company to post additional collateral if there were a one notch downgrade in the Company's credit rating.   The collateral required for contracts that have adequate assurance clauses that are in net liability positions as ofDecember 31, 2017was$25 million.  The collateral required for contracts with credit rating contingent features that are in a net liability position as ofDecember 31, 2017was$7 million.  The Company is also a party to certain marginable agreements under which it has a net liability position, but the counterparty has not called for the collateral due, which was approximately$4 millionas ofDecember 31, 2017.

SeeNote 4,Fair Value of Financial Instruments,for discussion regarding concentration of credit risk.



Note 6—Nuclear Decommissioning Trust Fund

NRG's Nuclear Decommissioning Trust Fund assets, which are for the decommissioning of STP, are comprised of securities classified as available-for-sale and recorded at fair value based on actively quoted market prices. Although NRG is responsible for managing the decommissioning of its44%interest in STP, the predecessor utilities that owned STP are authorized by the PUCT to collect decommissioning funds from their ratepayers to cover decommissioning costs on behalf of NRG. NRC requirements determine the decommissioning cost estimate which is the minimum required level of funding. In the event that funds from the ratepayers that accumulate in the nuclear decommissioning trust are ultimately determined to be inadequate to decommission the STP facilities, the utilities will be required to collect through rates charged to rate payers all additional amounts, with no obligation from NRG, provided that NRG has complied with PUCT rules and regulations regarding decommissioning trusts. Following completion of the decommissioning, if surplus funds remain in the decommissioning trusts, any excess will be refunded to the respective ratepayers of the utilities.

NRG accounts for the Nuclear Decommissioning Trust Fund in accordance with ASC 980,Regulated Operations, or ASC 980, because the Company's nuclear decommissioning activities are subject to approval by the PUCT, with regulated rates that are designed to recover all decommissioning costs and that can be charged to and collected from the ratepayers per PUCT mandate. Since the Company is in compliance with PUCT rules and regulations regarding decommissioning trusts and the cost of decommissioning is the responsibility of the Texas ratepayers, not NRG, all realized and unrealized gains or losses (including other-than-temporary impairments) related to the Nuclear Decommissioning Trust Fund are recorded to the Nuclear Decommissioning Trust liability and are not included in net income or accumulated other comprehensive income, consistent with regulatory treatment.

The following table summarizes the aggregate fair values and unrealized gains and losses (including other-than-temporary impairments) for the securities held in the trust funds, as well as information about the contractual maturities of those securities.

Note 10—Asset Impairments

2017 Impairment Losses



During the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company completed its annual budget and revised its view of long-term power and fuel prices and the corresponding impact on estimated cash flows associated with its long-lived assets. The most significant impact was a decrease in the Company's long-term view of natural gas prices which resulted in a reduction to long-term power prices and had a negative impact on the Company's coal, nuclear and renewable facilities. Each of the facilities below had estimated cash flows that were lower than the carrying amount and the assets were considered impaired.



The fair values of the assets were determined using an income approach by applying a discounted cash flow methodology to the long-term budget for the facility. The income approach utilized estimates of discounted future cash flows, which were Level 3 fair value measurements, an include key inputs such as forecasted power prices, nuclear fuel costs, forecasted operating and maintenance costs, plant investment capital expenditures and discount rates.



South Texas Project, or STP —The Company recognized an impairment loss of$1,248 millionrelated to its interest in STP as a result of the decrease in the Company's view of long-term power prices in ERCOT.



Indian River —The Company recognized an impairment loss of$36 millionfor Indian River as a result of the decrease in the Company's view of long-term power prices in PJM.



Keystone and Conemaugh —The Company recognized impairment losses of$35 millionfor Keystone and$35 millionfor Conemaugh as a result of the decrease in the Company's view of long-term power prices in PJM.



Wind Facilities —The Company recorded impairment losses of$110 million,$26 millionand$4 millionfor Langford, Elbow Creek and Forward, respectively, as a result of the decrease in the Company's view of long-term merchant power prices in ERCOT and PJM. While Elbow Creek and Forward have contracts to sell power, the significant decrease in estimated power prices had an impact on cash flows in post-contract periods.



The Company also recorded the following impairments in 2017 based on specific triggering events that occurred:



Bacliff Project—  On June 16, 2017, NRG Texas Power LLC provided notice to BTEC New Albany, LLC that it was exercising its right to terminate the Amended and Restated Membership Interest Purchase Agreement, or MIPA, due to the Bacliff Project, a new peaking facility at the former P.H. Robinson Electric Generating Station, not achieving commercial completion by the contractual expiration date of May 31, 2017.  As a result of the MIPA termination, the Company recorded an impairment loss of$41 millionto reduce the carrying amount of the related construction in progress tozeroduring the second quarter of 2017. On July 14, 2017, the Company gave notice to BTEC New Albany, LLC that it owes NRG Texas Power LLC approximately$48 millionunder the terminated MIPA, consisting of$38 millionin purchaser incurred costs and$10 millionin liquidated damages.



Other Long-Lived Asset Impairments —During the second, third and fourth quarters of 2017, the Company recorded impairment losses of approximately$22 million,$14 millionand$15 million, respectively, in connection with the Company's Renewables business. These impairment losses were primarily to record the value of certain long-lived assets, including property, plant and equipment and intangible assets, at fair market value at acquisition date or in connection with an impairment indicator.



Petra Nova Parish Holdings— In connection with the preparation of the annual budget during the fourth quarter, management revised its view of oil production expectations with respect to Petra Nova Parish Holdings. As a result, the Company reviewed its50%interest in Petra Nova Parish Holdings for impairment utilizing the other-than-temporary impairment model. In determining fair value, the Company utilized an income approach and considered project specific assumptions for the future project cash flows. The carrying amount of the Company's equity method investment exceeded the fair value of the investment and the Company concluded that the decline is considered to be other-than-temporary. As a result, the Company measured the impairment loss as the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value of the investment and recorded an impairment loss of$69 million.



The Company also recorded an additional$11 millionin impairment losses for other investments during the fourth quarter of 2017.



2016 Impairment Losses












Rockford—As described inNote 3,Discontinued Operations, Acquisitions and Dispositions, on May 12, 2016, the Company entered into an agreement with RA Generation, LLC to sell100%of its interests in the Rockford generating stations for cash consideration of$55 million.  The transaction triggered an indicator of impairment as the sale price was less than the carrying amount of the assets, and, as a result, the assets were considered to be impaired.  The Company measured the impairment loss as the difference between the carrying amount of the assets and the agreed-upon sale price.  The Company recorded an impairment loss of$17 millionduring the year ended December 31, 2016, to reduce the carrying amount of the assets held for sale to the fair market value.



Wind Facilities— During the fourth quarter of 2016, as the Company updated its estimated future cash flows in connection with the preparation of its annual budget, the Company determined that the cash flows for the Elbow Creek and Goat Wind projects, located in Texas and the Forward project, located in Pennsylvania were below the carrying value of the related assets, primarily driven by the declining merchant power prices in post-contract periods, and the assets were considered impaired. The fair values of the facilities were determined using an income approach by applying a discounted cash flow methodology to the long-term budgets for each respective plant.  The income approach utilized estimates of discounted future cash flows, which were Level 3 fair value measurements and include key inputs, such as forecasted power prices, operations and maintenance expense and discount rates.  The Company measured the impairment loss as the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value of the assets and recorded impairment losses of$117 million,$60 millionand$6 millionfor Elbow Creek, Goat Wind and Forward, respectively.

Long Beach—During the fourth quarter of 2016, the Company determined that by the end of 2017 it would retire its Long Beach generation station located in Long Beach, California.  The generating station was not awarded a PPA extension in SCE's capacity auction during the fourth quarter of 2016 for the PPA set to expire on July 31, 2017.  The Company considered this to be an indicator of impairment and performed an impairment test.  The Company measured the impairment loss as the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value of the assets and recorded an impairment loss of$36 million. Subsequently, management decided to continue to operate in 2018, which did not significantly impact fair value.

Other Impairments— During 2016, the Company recorded other impairment losses of$153 million, which included$23 millionin excess SO2allowances,$23 millionfor other intangible assets,$19 millionin previously purchased solar panels,$18 millionin deferred marketing expenses,$22 millionin other investments and$48 millionof other impairment losses.

Petra Nova Parish Holdings—During the first quarter of 2016, management changed its plans with respect to its future capital commitments driven in part by the continued decline in oil prices. As a result, the Company reviewed its50%interest in Petra Nova Parish Holdings for impairment utilizing the other-than-temporary impairment model. In determining fair value, the Company utilized an income approach and considered project specific assumptions for the future project cash flows.  The carrying amount of the Company's equity method investment exceeded the fair value of the investment and the Company concluded that the decline is considered to be other-than-temporary.  As a result, the Company measured the impairment loss as the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value of the investment and recorded an impairment loss of$140 million.

Community Wind North and Sherbino—During the fourth quarter of 2016, the Company offered several projects to NRG Yield including its interest in Community Wind North.  The offer price was below its current carrying amount and this decline in fair value was determined to be other-than-temporary.  Accordingly, the Company recorded an impairment loss of$36 millionto reduce its carrying amount to fair value.  In addition, in connection with the preparation of the annual budget, the Company noted that due to the anticipated difficulty in refinancing Sherbino’s debt that will mature in 2018, the project’s fair value had decreased significantly below its carrying amount and this decline was determined to be other-than-temporary.  Accordingly, the Company determined that an other-than-temporary impairment existed and recorded an impairment loss on its investment in Sherbino of$70 million.



2015 Impairment Losses

Limestone and W.A. Parish—During the fourth quarter of 2015, as the Company updated its estimates of future cash flows in connection with the preparation of its annual budget, it was noted that the cash flows for the Limestone and W.A. Parish coal-fired facilities located in Texas were lower than the carrying amount, primarily driven by declining power prices as the cost of commodities continues to decline and the assets were impaired.  The fair value of the Limestone and W.A. Parish plants was determined using an income approach by applying a discounted cash flow methodology to the long-term budgets for each respective plant.  The income approach utilized estimates of discounted future cash flows, which were Level 3 fair value measurements, and include key inputs such as forecasted power prices, fuel costs and emissions credit expense, forecasted operating and capital expenditures and discount rates. The Company measured the impairment loss as the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value of the assets and recognized impairment losses of$1,514 millionand$1,295 millionrelated to Limestone and W.A. Parish, respectively.










Huntley—On August 25, 2015, the Company filed a notice with the NYSPSC of its intent to retire Huntley's operating units on March 1, 2016.  The Company considered this to be an indicator of impairment and performed an impairment test for these assets under ASC 360,Property, Plant and Equipment. On October 14, 2015, the Company filed a cost-of-service filing at FERC in anticipation that the Huntley operating units would be needed for reliability purposes, proposing a reliability must run service agreement for afour-year period beginning on March 1, 2016.  On October 30, 2015, NYISO released the results of its reliability study, indicating that the Huntley operating units are not needed for bulk system reliability.  The Company considered the impact of the reliability study conducted and evaluated the estimated cash flows associated with the facility.  Accordingly, the Company determined that the carrying amount of the assets was higher than the estimated future net cash flows expected to be generated by the assets and that the assets were impaired. The fair value of the Huntley operating units was determined using the income approach. The income approach utilized estimates of discounted future cash flows, which were Level 3 fair value measurements, and include key inputs such as forecasted contract prices, forecasted operating expenses and discount rates. The Company recorded an impairment loss of$132 millionduring the year ended December 31, 2015.



Dunkirk—The Company signed aten-year agreement in November 2014 with National Grid to add natural gas-burning capabilities at the Dunkirk facility.  On August 25, 2015, NRG announced that Dunkirk Unit 2 would be mothballed on January 1, 2016 at the expiration of its reliability support services agreement. The project to add natural gas-burning capabilities has been suspended, pending the outcome of litigation with respect to the gas addition contract and its validity.  On October 30, 2015, NYISO released the results of its reliability study, indicating that the Dunkirk facility is not needed for system reliability.  In connection with the planned mothball of the facility, the pending litigation and the latest reliability assessment completed by NYISO, the Company evaluated whether the related fixed assets were impaired. The Company determined that the carrying amount of the assets was higher than the estimated future net cash flows expected to be generated by the assets and that the assets were impaired. The fair value of the Dunkirk facility was determined using the income approach. The income approach utilized estimates of discounted future cash flows, which were Level 3 fair value measurements, and include key inputs such as forecasted contract prices, forecasted operating and capital expenditures and discount rates. The Company recorded an impairment loss of$160 millionduring the year ended December 31, 2015.



Gregory— During the fourth quarter of 2015, the Company determined that the carrying amount of the assets was higher than the estimated future net cash flows expected to be generated by the assets and that the assets were impaired.  The fair value of the Gregory facility was determined using the income approach, which utilized estimates of discounted future cash flows, which were Level 3 fair value measurements, and include key inputs such as forecasted prices, operating and capital expenditures and discount rates. The Company recorded an impairment loss of$176 millionduring the year ended December 31, 2015.



Solar Panels—During the fourth quarter of 2015, the Company recorded an impairment loss of$29 millionto reduce the carrying value of certain solar panels to their approximate fair value.

Investments—During the fourth quarter of 2015, the Company reviewed certain of its cost method and equity method investments and concluded that losses incurred by these investments were other-than-temporary.  These losses were primarily driven by the sustained decline in stock price of a publicly traded investment as well as change in financing structures of certain non-publicly traded investments. As a result, the Company recorded losses related to these investments of$56 million.



Note 11—Goodwill and Other Intangibles

Goodwill

NRG's goodwill balance was$539 millionand$662 millionas ofDecember 31, 2017and2016, respectively. As ofDecember 31, 2017, and2016, NRG had approximately$460 millionand$547 million, respectively, of goodwill that is deductible for U.S. income tax purposes in future periods.  As of December 31, 2017, goodwill consisted of$165 millionassociated with the acquisition of EME,$341 millionfor Retail business acquisitions, and$33 millionassociated with other business acquisitions.

2017Impairments of Goodwill

BETM —During the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company concluded that BETM was held for sale in connection with board approval and advanced negotiations to sell the business.  Accordingly, the Company recorded the assets and liabilities at fair market value as ofDecember 31, 2017, which resulted in an impairment loss of$90 millionto record BETM’s goodwill at fair market value.  The remaining goodwill balance for BETM of$21 millionis included within non-current assets held-for-sale as ofDecember 31, 2017.












SPP —During the fourth quarter of 2017, NRG sold its interests in certain SPP projects to NRG Yield.  The goodwill recorded during the SPP acquisition was related primarily to its development pipeline, which was not sold to NRG Yield.  As the Company does not expect to separately develop these projects and accordingly, has no cash flow stream associated with the goodwill, an impairment loss of$12 millionwas recorded to reduce the value tozeroas ofDecember 31, 2017.

2016Impairments of Goodwill

During the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company recorded a goodwill impairment charge of$337 millionrelated to its Texas reporting unit, reducing the goodwill balance for Texas tozero.



In connection with the annual impairment assessment, the Company performed step one of the two-step impairment test for the Texas reporting unit, for which

$1.7 billion

of goodwill was recognized as part of the Texas Genco acquisition in 2006 and

$1.4 billion

was written off in 2015.  The Company determined the fair value of the Texas reporting unit primarily using an income approach through which the Company applied a discounted cash flow methodology to the long-term budgets for all plants in the regions.  Significant inputs impacting the income approach include the Company's views of power and fuel prices for the first five-year period and the Company's view for the longer term, which were finalized in connection with the preparation of the fourth quarter financial statements, projected generation based on an hourly dispatch meant to simulate the dispatch of each unit into the power market which is impacted by power prices, fuel prices, and the physical and economic characteristics of each plant, intangible value to Texas for synergies it provides to NRG's retail businesses, and the discount rate applied to cash flow projections.  Under step one, the estimated fair value of the Texas invested capital was

43%

below its carrying value as of December 31, 2016, and the Company concluded step two was required.  Based on the results of step two of the impairment test, the Company determined the carrying amount of the reporting unit was higher than the fair value, and accordingly, the Company recognized an impairment loss of

$337 million

as of

December 31, 2016

.

Intangible Assets



The Company's intangible assets as ofDecember 31, 2017, primarily reflect intangible assets established with the acquisitions of various companies and are comprised of the following:

•Emission Allowances— These intangibles primarily consist of SO2and NOxemission allowances established with the 2006 Texas Genco acquisition and also include RGGI emission credits which NRG began purchasing in 2009. These emission allowances are held-for-use and are amortized to cost of operations, with NOxallowances amortized on a straight-line basis and SO2allowances and RGGI credits amortized based on units of production. During the year endedDecember 31, 2017, the Company recorded an impairment loss of$20 millionto reduce the value of excess SO2allowances to zero.

•Energy supply contracts— Established with the acquisitions of Reliant Energy and Green Mountain Energy, these represent the fair value at the acquisition date of in-market contracts for the purchase of energy to serve retail electric customers. The contracts are amortized to cost of operations based on the expected delivery under the respective contracts.

•In-market fuel (gas and nuclear) contracts— These intangibles were established with the Texas Genco acquisition in 2006 and are amortized to cost of operations over expected volumes over the life of each contract.

•Customer contracts— Established with the acquisitions of Reliant Energy, Green Mountain Energy, and Northwind Phoenix,these intangibles represent the fair value at the acquisition date of contracts that primarily provide electricity to Reliant Energy's and Green Mountain Energy's C&I customers. These contracts are amortized to revenues based on expected volumes to be delivered for the portfolio.

Interest Rate Swaps—Project Financings

Many of NRG's project subsidiaries entered into interest rate swaps, intended to hedge the risks associated with interest rates on non-recourse project level debt.  These swaps amortize in proportion to their respective loans and are floating for fixed where the project subsidiary pays its counterparty the equivalent of a fixed interest payment on a predetermined notional value and will receive quarterly the equivalent of a floating interest payment based on the same notional value.  All interest rate swap payments by the project subsidiary and its counterparty are made quarterly, and the LIBOR is determined in advance of each interest period.  The following table summarizes the swaps, some of which are forward starting as indicated, related to NRG's project level debt as ofDecember 31, 2017.

Note 14—Benefit Plans and Other Postretirement Benefits

NRG sponsors and operates defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans.

NRG pension benefits are available to eligible non-union and union employees through various defined benefit pension plans.  These benefits are based on pay, service history and age at retirement.  Most pension benefits are provided through tax-qualified plans.  NRG also provides postretirement health and welfare benefits for certain groups of employees.  Cost sharing provisions vary by the terms of any applicable collective bargaining agreements.

NRG maintains two separate qualified pension plans, the NRG Pension Plan for Bargained Employees and the NRG Pension Plan. Employees of both NRG and GenOn participate in each of the pension plans, depending upon whether their employment is covered by a bargaining agreement. As controlled group members, ERISA requires that NRG and GenOn are jointly and severally liable for the NRG Pension Plan for Bargained Employees and the NRG Pension Plan, including pension liabilities associated with GenOn employees.

As described in

Note 1

,

Nature of Business

, and

Note 3

,

Discontinued Operations, Acquisitions and Dispositions

,

NRG and GenOn entered into a Restructuring Support Agreement and various support agreements, including a transition services agreement, that provides for a restructuring and recapitalization of the GenOn Entities through a prearranged plan of reorganization and was approved by the Bankruptcy Court pursuant to an order of confirmation on December 12, 2017.



In accordance with the agreements, NRG will retain GenOn's pension liability for service provided by GenOn employees prior to the completion of the reorganization. NRG determined that the retention of this liability is probable and has recorded the estimated accumulated pension benefit obligation as of

December 31, 2017

of

$92 million

in other non-current liabilities with a corresponding loss from discontinued operations. The balance reflects a contribution of

$13 million

to the plans with respect to GenOn's employees paid in September 2017. NRG will also retain the liability for GenOn's post-employment and retiree health and welfare benefits, in an amount up to

$25 million

. Retention of this liability is probable and accordingly, NRG has recorded the

$25 million

in other non-current liabilities with a corresponding loss from discontinued operations as of

December 31, 2017

. NRG's obligation for both of these liabilities will be revalued through and at GenOn's emergence from bankruptcy, with NRG's obligation for the post-employment and retiree health and welfare plan capped at

$25 million

.

NRG expects to contribute$31 millionto the Company's pension plans in2018. Of this amount,$13 millionrelated to employees of GenOn.

As a result of GenOn's deconsolidation during 2017, NRG reduced the loss recorded in other comprehensive income by$28 millionrelated to GenOn's pension and other postretirement benefits.










The Company's estimated unrecognized loss and unrecognized prior service cost for NRG's pension plan that will be amortized from accumulated OCI to net periodic cost over the next fiscal year is less than$1 million. The Company's estimated unrecognized gain and unrecognized prior service credit for NRG's postretirement plan that will be amortized from accumulated OCI to net periodic cost over the next fiscal year is less than$1 millionand$7 million, respectively.

The following table presents the balances of significant components of NRG's pension plan:

NRG's market-related value of its plan assets is the fair value of the assets.  The fair values of the Company's pension plan assets by asset category and their level within the fair value hierarchy are as follows:

In accordance with ASC 820, the Company determines the level in the fair value hierarchy within which each fair value measurement in its entirety falls, based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety.  The fair value of the common/collective trust investments is valued at fair value which is equal to the sum of the market value of all of the fund's underlying investments.  Certain common/collective trust investments have readily determinable fair value as they publish daily net asset value, or NAV, per share and are categorized as Level 2.  Certain other common/collective trust investments and partnerships/joint ventures use NAV per share, or its equivalent, as a practical expedient for valuation, and thus have been removed from the fair value hierarchy table.

NRG uses December 31 of each respective year as the measurement date for the Company's pension and other postretirement benefit plans.  The Company sets the discount rate assumptions on an annual basis for each of NRG's defined benefit retirement plans as of December 31.  The discount rate assumptions represent the current rate at which the associated liabilities could be effectively settled at December 31.  The Company utilizes the Aon Hewitt AA Above Median, or AA-AM, yield curve to select the appropriate discount rate assumption for each retirement plan.  The AA-AM yield curve is a hypothetical AA yield curve represented by a series of annualized individual spot discount rates from6months to99years.  Each bond issue used to build this yield curve must be non-callable, and have an average rating of AA when averaging available Moody's Investor Services, Standard & Poor's and Fitch ratings.

NRG employs a total return investment approach, whereby a mix of equities and fixed income investments are used to maximize the long-term return of plan assets for a prudent level of risk.  Risk tolerance is established through careful consideration of plan liabilities, plan funded status, and corporate financial condition.  The Investment Committee reviews the asset mix periodically and as the plan assets increase in future years, the Investment Committee may examine other asset classes such as real estate or private equity.  NRG employs a building block approach to determining the long-term rate of return assumption for plan assets, with proper consideration given to diversification and rebalancing.  Historical markets are studied and long-term historical relationships between equities and fixed income are preserved, consistent with the widely accepted capital market principle that assets with higher volatility generate a greater return over the long run.  Current factors such as inflation and interest rates are evaluated before long-term capital market assumptions are determined.  Peer data and historical returns are reviewed to check for reasonableness and appropriateness.

In 2016, NRG changed the approach utilized to estimate the service cost and interest cost components of net periodic benefit cost for pension and postretirement benefit plans. Historically, the Company estimated these components by using a single weighted average discount rate derived from the yield curve used to measure the benefit obligation. The Company has elected to use a spot rate approach in the estimation of the components of benefit cost by applying specific spot rates along the yield curve to the relevant projected cash flows, as this provides a better estimate of service and interest costs. This election is considered a change in estimate and, accordingly, has been accounted for starting in 2016. This change does not affect the measurement of NRG's total benefit obligation.












The target allocations of NRG's pension plan assets were as follows for the year endedDecember 31, 2017:

U.S. equity22%Non-U.S. equity14%Non-core assets19%U.S. fixed income45%

Plan assets are currently invested in a diversified blend of equity and fixed-income investments.  Furthermore, equity investments are diversified across U.S., non-U.S., global, and emerging market equities, as well as among growth, value, small and large capitalization stocks.

Investment risk and performance are monitored on an ongoing basis through quarterly portfolio reviews of each asset fund class to a related performance benchmark, if applicable, and annual pension liability measurements.  Performance benchmarks are composed of the following indices:

Asset ClassIndexU.S. equitiesDow Jones U.S. Total Stock Market IndexNon-U.S. equitiesMSCI All Country World Ex-U.S. IMI IndexNon-core assets(a)Various (per underlying asset class)Fixed income securitiesBarclays Capital Long Term Government/Credit Index & Barclays Strips 20+ Index

(a)Non-Core Assets are defined as diversifying asset classes approved by the Investment Committee that are intended to enhance returns and/or reduce volatility of the U.S. and non-U.S. equities. Asset classes considered Non-Core include, but may not be limited to: Emerging Market Equity, Emerging Market Debt, Non-US Developed Market Small Cap, High Yield Fixed Income, Real Estate, Bank Loans, Global Infrastructure and other Alternatives.

NRG's expected future benefit payments for each of the next five years, and in the aggregate for the five years thereafter, are as follows:

Preferred Stock

On May 24, 2016, NRG entered an agreement with Credit Suisse Group to     repurchase100%of the outstanding shares of its$344.5 million2.822%preferred stock.  On June 13, 2016, the Company completed the repurchase from Credit Suisse of100%of the outstanding shares at a price of$226 million. The transaction resulted in a gain on redemption of$78 million, measured as the difference between the fair value of the cash consideration paid upon redemption of$226 millionand the carrying value of the preferred stock at the time of the redemption of$304 million. This amount is reflected in net income/(loss) available to NRG common stockholders in the calculation of earnings per share.

Note 16—Investments Accounted for by the Equity Method and Variable Interest Entities










Entities that are not Consolidated

NRG accounts for the Company's significant investments using the equity method of accounting.  NRG's carrying value of equity investments can be impacted by impairments, unrealized gains and losses on derivatives and movements in foreign currency exchange rates, as well as other adjustments.

The following table summarizes NRG's equity method investments as ofDecember 31, 2017:

Variable Interest Entities

NRG accounts for its interests in certain entities that are considered VIEs under ASC 810, for which NRG is not the primary beneficiary, under the equity method.

Utility-Scale Solar Portfolio—As described inNote 3,Discontinued Operations, Acquisitions and Dispositions, on November 2, 2016, the Company acquired equity interests in a tax equity financed portfolio comprised of530MW of mechanically-complete solar assets located in Utah, and subsequently sold these interests to NRG Yield, Inc. on March 27, 2017. These equity interests in Four Brothers Solar, LLC, Granite Mountain Holdings, LLC, and Iron Springs Holdings, LLC are accounted for as equity method investments as the Company does not have a controlling financial interest. The assets reached commercial operations during the fourth quarter of 2016 and have 20-year PPAs with PacifiCorp. NRG's maximum exposure to loss is limited to its equity investment, which was$345 millionas ofDecember 31, 2017.

GenConn— NRG owns a50%interest in GenConn, a limited liability company formed to construct, own and operatetwo190-MW peaking generation facilities in Connecticut at NRG's Devon and Middletown sites.

GenConn has a$237 millionnote with an interest rate of4.73%and a maturity date of July 2041 and a5-year,$35 millionworking capital facility which can be used to issue letters of credit at an interest rate of1.875%.  As ofDecember 31, 2017,$204 millionwas outstanding under the note and$14 millionof letters of credit issued under the working capital facility. The note is secured by all of the GenConn assets.  NRG's maximum exposure to loss is limited to its equity investment, which was$102 millionas ofDecember 31, 2017.










Other Equity Investments

Gladstone— Through a joint venture, NRG owns a37.5%interest in Gladstone, a1,613MW coal-fueled power generation facility in Queensland, Australia. The power generation facility is managed by the joint venture participants and the facility is operated by NRG. Operating expenses incurred in connection with the operation of the facility are funded by each of the participants in proportion to their ownership interests. Coal is sourced from local mines in Queensland. NRG and the joint venture participants receive their respective share of revenues directly from the off takers in proportion to the ownership interests in the joint venture. Power generated by the facility is primarily sold to an adjacent aluminum smelter, with excess power sold to the Queensland Government owned utility under long term supply contracts. NRG's investment in Gladstone was$139 millionas ofDecember 31, 2017.

Entities that are Consolidated

The Company has a controlling financial interest in certain entities which have been identified as VIEs under ASC 810.  These arrangements are primarily related to tax equity arrangements entered into with third-parties in order to finance the cost of solar energy systems under operating leases and wind facilities eligible for certain tax credits as further described inNote 2,Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.  For one of the tax equity arrangements, the Company has a deficit restoration obligation equal to$110 millionas ofDecember 31, 2017, which would be required to be funded if the arrangement were to be dissolved.

Note 17—Earnings/(Loss) Per Share

Basic earnings/(loss) per common share is computed by dividing net income/(loss) less accumulated preferred stock dividends by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. Shares issued and treasury shares repurchased during the year are weighted for the portion of the year that they were outstanding. Diluted earnings/(loss) per share is computed in a manner consistent with that of basic earnings/(loss) per share while giving effect to all potentially dilutive common shares that were outstanding during the period.

Dilutive effect for equity compensation and other equity instruments— The outstanding non-qualified stock options, non-vested restricted stock units, and market stock units are not considered outstanding for purposes of computing basic earnings/(loss) per share. However, these instruments are included in the denominator for purposes of computing diluted earnings/(loss) per share under the treasury stock method.  The if-converted method was used to determine the dilutive effect of embedded derivatives in the Company's2.822%Preferred Stock for the year ended December 31, 2015. During 2016, the Company repurchased100%of the outstanding shares of its2.822%preferred stock.

The reconciliation of NRG's basic earnings/(loss) per share to diluted earnings/(loss) per share is shown in the following table:

Note 18—Segment Reporting

The Company's segment structure reflects how management currently makes financial decisions and allocates resources. The Company's businesses are segregated as follows: Generation, which includes generation, international and BETM; Retail, which includes Mass customers and Business Solutions, which includes C&I customers and other distributed and reliability products; Renewables, which includes solar and wind assets, excluding those in NRG Yield; NRG Yield; and corporate activities.  Intersegment sales are accounted for at market.

NRG Yield includes certain of the Company's contracted generation assets.  During 2017, NRG Yield acquired several  projects totaling555MW for cash consideration of approximately$245 millionfrom NRG. These acquisitions were treated as a transfer of entities under common control and accordingly, the financial information for years endedDecember 31, 2017,2016, and2015have been recast to reflect these changes.

On June 14, 2017, as described inNote 3,Discontinued Operations, Acquisitions and Dispositions, NRG deconsolidated GenOn for financial reporting purposes. The financial information for years endedDecember 31, 2017,2016, and2015have been recast to present GenOn as discontinued operations within the corporate segment.

NRG’s chief operating decision maker, its chief executive officer, evaluates the performance of its segments based on operational measures including adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or Adjusted EBITDA, free cash flow and capital for allocation, as well as net income/(loss) and net income/(loss) attributable to NRG Energy, Inc.

For the year endedDecember 31, 2017, NRG's overall effective tax rate was different than the statutory rate of 35% primarily due to tax expense recorded from the revaluation of the existing net deferred tax asset and state taxes, partially offset by the change in valuation allowance, establishing the AMT credit receivable and the generation of PTC’s from various wind facilities. The tax expense recorded for revaluation of the net deferred tax asset is required to reflect the reduction in the corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% in accordance with the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, or the Tax Act.

For the year endedDecember 31, 2016, NRG's overall effective tax rate was different than the statutory rate of35%primarily due to the change in valuation allowance, the impact of non-taxable equity earnings and current state tax expense, partially offset by the generation of PTCs from various wind facilities.

For the year endedDecember 31, 2015,  NRG's overall effective tax rate was different than the statutory rate of35%primarily due to recording of a valuation allowance on the federal and certain state net deferred tax assets that may not be realizable under a “more likely than not” measurement. In addition, a portion of the book goodwill impairment is classified as a permanent reversal impacting the effective tax rate.

The temporary differences, which gave rise to the Company's deferred tax assets and liabilities consisted of the following:

As of December 31,20172016(In millions)Net deferred tax asset — noncurrent$134$225Net deferred tax liability — noncurrent(21)(20)Net deferred tax asset$113$205

The primary driver for the decrease in the net deferred tax asset from$205 millionto$113 millionis the revaluation of the ending balance utilizing a 21% corporate income tax rate instead of a 35% corporate income tax rate pursuant to the Tax Act as of December 22, 2017.  NRG Energy, Inc.’s revaluation is completely offset by its valuation allowance.  Since NRG Yield, Inc. does not have a valuation allowance against its net deferred tax asset, its ending balance remains atDecember 31, 2017.  Additionally, due to GenOn's petition for bankruptcy on June 14, 2017, its inventory of deferreds is reclassed to discontinued operations for the year endedDecember 31, 2016and is completely deconsolidated for the year endedDecember 31, 2017.

Deferred tax assets and valuation allowance

Net deferred tax balance— As ofDecember 31, 2017and2016, NRG recorded a net deferred tax asset of$1.9 billionand$2.2 billion, respectively. The Company believes the federal and certain state net deferred tax assets may not be realizable under a “more likely than not” measurement and as such, a valuation allowance has been recorded to reduce the asset accordingly. The Company assesses cumulative and forecasted pretax book earnings and the future reversal of existing taxable temporary differences, including the potential impacts of the recently enacted Tax Act. In December 2017, the SEC staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118, which addresses how a company may recognize provisional amounts for the effect of the changes related to the Tax Act. Consistent with that guidance, the Company recognized provisional amounts based upon our interpretation of the tax laws and estimates which require significant judgments.

Based on the Company's assessment of positive and negative evidence, including available tax planning strategies, NRG believes that it is more likely than not that a benefit will not be realized on$1.8 billionand$2.0 billionof tax assets as ofDecember 31, 2017, and2016, respectively, thus a valuation allowance has been recorded. The net deferred tax asset of$113 millionis predominantly due to the inclusion of NRG Yield Inc.'s net deferred tax asset consisting primarily of net operating losses.

NOL carryforwards— AtDecember 31, 2017, the Company had tax effected cumulative domestic NOLs consisting of carryforwards for federal income tax purposes of$596 millionand state of$140 million.  The Company estimates it will need to generate future taxable income to fully realize the net federal deferred tax asset before expiration commencing in 2026. In addition, NRG has cumulative foreign NOL carryforwards of$66 millionwith no expiration date.

Valuation allowance— As ofDecember 31, 2017, the Company's tax effected valuation allowance was$1.8 billion, consisting of domestic federal net deferred tax assets of approximately$1.5 billion, domestic state net deferred tax assets of$267 million, foreign net operating loss carryforwards of$66 millionand foreign capital loss carryforwards of approximately$1 million. Based upon the assessment of cumulative and forecasted pretax book earnings, and the future reversal of existing taxable temporary differences, it was determined that a valuation allowance was required to be recorded during the year.

Taxes Receivable and Payable

As ofDecember 31, 2017, NRG recorded a current tax payable of$7 millionthat represents a tax liability due for state income taxes.  NRG has a tax receivable of$1 million, comprised of refunds due from state income tax estimated payments and return filings for 2017 and 2016, respectively.

Uncertain tax benefits

NRG has identified uncertain tax benefits whose after-tax value is$30 millionfor which, as ofDecember 31, 2017and2016, NRG has recorded a non-current tax liability of$33 millionand$37 million, respectively.  The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to uncertain tax benefits in income tax expense.  During the year endedDecember 31, 2017, the Company recognized an expense of$1 millionin interest.  As ofDecember 31, 2017and2016, NRG had cumulative interest and penalties related to these uncertain tax benefits of$3 millionand$4 million, respectively.

Tax jurisdictions— NRG is subject to examination by taxing authorities for income tax returns filed in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and various state and foreign jurisdictions including operations located in Australia.










The Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal income tax examinations for years prior to 2015.  With few exceptions, state and local income tax examinations are no longer open for years before 2010.

Restricted Stock Units

As ofDecember 31, 2017, RSUs granted under the Company's LTIPs typically havethree-year graded vesting schedules beginning on the grant date. Fair value of the RSUs is based on the closing price of NRG common stock on the date of grant.  The following table summarizes the Company's non-vested RSU awards and changes during the year:

The total fair value of RSUs vested during the years endedDecember 31, 2017,2016, and2015, was$19 million,$11 millionand$10 million, respectively.  The weighted average grant date fair value of RSUs granted during the years endedDecember 31, 2017,2016, and2015was$12.44,$11.54, and$27.31, respectively.

Deferred Stock Units

DSUs represent the right of a participant to be paid one share of NRG common stock at the end of a deferral period established under the terms of the award. DSUs granted under the Company's LTIPs are fully vested at the date of issuance. Fair value of the DSUs, which is based on the closing price of NRG common stock on the date of grant, is recorded as compensation expense in the period of grant.

The following table summarizes the Company's outstanding DSU awards and changes during the year:

The aggregate intrinsic values for DSUs outstanding as ofDecember 31, 2017,2016, and2015were approximately$12 million,$6 million, and$5 million, respectively.  The aggregate intrinsic values for DSUs converted to common stock for the years endedDecember 31, 2017,2016, and2015were$4 million,$1 million, andless than a million, respectively.  The weighted average grant date fair value of DSUs granted during the years endedDecember 31, 2017,2016, and2015was$16.76,$16.85and$25.14, respectively.

Performance Stock Units

PSUs entitle the recipient to stock upon vesting. The amount of the award is subject to the Company's achievement of certain performance measures over the vesting period. As ofDecember 31, 2017, non-vested PSUs consist of Market Stock Units, or MSUs, and Relative Performance Stock Units, or RPSUs.

Relative Performance Stock Units —RPSUs are restricted grants where the quantity of shares increases and decreases alongside the Company's Total Shareholder Return, or TSR, relative to the TSR of the Company’s current proxy peer group and the total returns of select indexes, or Peer Group. Each RPSU represents the potential to receive NRG common stock after the completion of the performance period, typically three years of service from the date of grant. The number of shares of NRG common stock to be paid (if any) as of the vesting date for each RPSU will depend on the Company’s percentile rank within the Peer Group. The number of shares of common stock to be paid as of the vesting date for each RPSU is linearly interpolated for TSR performance between the following points: (i) 0% if ranked below the 25th percentile; (ii) 25% if ranked at the 25th percentile; (iii) 100% if ranked at the 55th percentile (or the 65th percentile if the Company’s absolute TSR is less than negative 15%); and (iv) 200% if ranked at the 75th percentile or above. The value of the common stock on the date of grant is based on the closing price of NRG common stock on the date of grant.










Market Stock Units —MSUs are restricted grants where the quantity of shares increases and decreases alongside the Company's TSR. Each MSU represents the potential to receive NRG common stock after the completion of the performance period, typically three years of service from the date of grant. The number of shares of common stock to be paid as of the vesting date for each MSU is : (i) zero shares, if the TSR has decreased by more than 25% over the performance period, (ii) three-quarters of one share, if the TSR has decreased by 25% over the performance period; (iii) interpolated between three-quarters of one share and one share, if the TSR has decreased less than 25% over the performance period; (iv) one share, if there is no change in TSR over the performance period; (v) interpolated between one share and two shares, if TSR increases less than 100% during the performance period; and (vi) two shares, if the TSR increases 100% over the performance period. The value of the common stock on the date of grant is based on the closing price of NRG common stock on the date of grant.The Company last granted MSUs during the year endedDecember 31, 2016.

The following table summarizes the Company's non-vested PSU awards and changes during the year:

Units(a)Weighted Average Grant-Date Fair Value per UnitNon-vested at December 31, 20161,282,588$21.47Granted738,83015.91Forfeited(162,597)31.85Non-vested at December 31, 20171,858,82118.27(a) There werenoPSUs granted to GenOn employees and outstanding as ofDecember 31, 2017.

The weighted average grant date fair value of PSUs granted during the years endedDecember 31, 2017,2016and2015, was$15.91,$14.73and$26.68, respectively.

The fair value of PSUs is estimated on the date of grant using a Monte Carlo simulation model and expensed over the service period, which equals the vesting period. Significant assumptions used in the fair value model with respect to the Company's PSUs are summarized below:

20172016RPSUsMSUsExpected volatility43.96%34.33%Expected term (in years)33Risk free rate1.5%1.31%

For the years endedDecember 31, 2017and2016, expected volatility is calculated based on NRG's historical stock price volatility data over the period commensurate with the expected term of the PSU, which equals the vesting period.

Services Agreement and Transition Services Agreement with GenOn

The Company provides GenOn with various management, personnel and other services, which include human resources, regulatory and public affairs, accounting, tax, legal, information systems, treasury, risk management, commercial operations, and asset management, as set forth in the services agreement with GenOn, or the Services Agreement.  The initial term of the Services Agreement was through December 31, 2013, with an automatic renewal absent a request for termination. The fee charged was determined based on a fixed amount as described in the Services Agreement and was calculated based on historical GenOn expenses prior to the NRG Merger. The annual fees under the Services Agreement were approximately$193 millionand management has concluded that this method of charging overhead costs is reasonable. As described inNote 3,Discontinued Operations, Acquisitions and Dispositions, in connection with the Restructuring Support Agreement, NRG agreed to provide shared services to GenOn under the Services Agreement for an adjusted annualized fee of$84 million.  Beginning on June 14, 2017, and through December 2017, NRG recorded amounts earned for shared services of approximately$5 millionper month.

In December 2017, in conjunction with the confirmation of the GenOn Entities' plan of reorganization, the Services Agreement was terminated and replaced by the transition services agreement. Under the transition services agreement, NRG will continue to provide the shared services and other separation services at an annualized rate of$84 million, subject to certain credits and adjustments, until June 30, 2018, which may be extended by GenOn through September 30, 2018.  NRG may provide additional separation services that are necessary for or reasonably related to the operation of GenOn's business after such date, subject to NRG's prior written consent, not to be unreasonably withheld. For the year endedDecember 31, 2017, NRG recorded other income - affiliate related to these services of$87 millionprior to the Chapter 11 Filing and$42 millionagainst selling, general and administrative expenses post-Chapter 11 Filing. For the year endedDecember 31, 2016, NRG recorded other income - affiliate related to these services of$193 million.

Also in December 2017, NRG provided GenOn with a$3.5 millioncredit for services provided under the transition services agreement and began recording amounts earned of approximately$7 millionper month.  NRG has also agreed to provide GenOn with a$28 millioncredit against amounts owed to NRG under the transition services agreement.  The credit is intended to reimburse GenOn for its payment of financing costs. Any unused amount can be paid in cash at GenOn's request, subject to the terms and conditions of the transition services agreement.

SeeNote 3,Discontinued Operations, Acquisitions and Dispositions, for further discussion regarding the December 2017 agreed upon changes to the Restructuring Support Agreement and transition services agreement, based on which NRG recorded a reserve of$12 millionagainst affiliate receivable balances as ofDecember 31, 2017.

Credit Agreement with GenOn

NRG and GenOn are party to a secured intercompany revolving credit agreement.  The intercompany revolving credit agreement provided for a$500 millionrevolving credit facility, all of which was available for revolving loans and letters of credit.  AtDecember 31, 2017andDecember 31, 2016,$92 millionand$272 million, respectively, of letters of credit were issued and outstanding under the NRG credit agreement for GenOn. Additionally, as ofDecember 31, 2017, there were$125 millionof loans outstanding under the intercompany secured revolving credit facility.  As ofDecember 31, 2016,noloans were outstanding under this intercompany secured revolving credit facility. In addition, the intercompany secured revolving credit facility contains customary covenants and events of default. As ofDecember 31, 2017, GenOn was in default under the secured intercompany revolving credit agreement due to the filing of the Chapter 11 Cases.

As a result of the Chapter 11 Cases, no additional revolving loans or letters of credit are available to GenOn. In addition, NRG agreed to provide GenOn with a letter of credit facility during the pendency of the Chapter 11 Cases, which could be utilized for required letters of credit in lieu of the intercompany secured revolving credit facility.  The letter of credit facility provided availability of up to$330 millionless amounts borrowed and letters of credit provided are required to be cash collateralized at103%of the letter of credit amount. On July 27, 2017, this letter of credit facility was terminated as GenOn has obtained a separate letter of credit facility with a third party financial institution. Effective with completion of the reorganization, GenOn must repay NRG for all revolving loans outstanding, with such amount to be netted against the settlement payment owed from NRG to GenOn.  Accordingly, the affiliate receivable is recorded net within accrued expenses and other current liabilities - affiliate on the consolidated balance sheet as ofDecember 31, 2017. Interest continues to accrue during the pendency of the Chapter 11 Cases and borrowings remain secured obligations.










Commercial Operations Agreement

NRG Power Marketing LLC has entered into physical and financial intercompany commodity and hedging transactions with GenOn and certain of its subsidiaries. Subject to applicable collateral thresholds, these arrangements may provide for the bilateral exchange of credit support based upon market exposure and potential market movements. The terms and conditions of the agreements are generally consistent with industry practices and other third party arrangements.  As ofDecember 31, 2017, derivative assets and liabilities associated with these transactions are recorded within NRG's derivative instruments balances on the consolidated balance sheet, with related revenues and costs within operating revenues and cost of operations, respectively. Additionally, as ofDecember 31, 2017andDecember 31, 2016, the Company had$32 millionand$79 million, respectively, of cash collateral posted in support of energy risk management activities by GenOn.

The Company leases100%interests in the Powerton facility and Unit 7 and Unit 8 of the Joliet facility through2034and2030, respectively, through its indirect subsidiary, Midwest Generation, LLC.  The Company accounts for these leases as operating leases and records lease expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term.  In connection with the acquisition of EME, the Company recorded the out-of-market value as a liability in out-of-market contracts of$159 million.  The liability will be amortized through rent expense on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.  The Company expects to record lease expense, net of amortization of the out-of-market liability, of approximately$14 millionper year through the term of the lease.

Lignite Contract with Texas Westmoreland Coal Co.

The Company's Limestone facility utilizes a blend of coal including lignite obtained from the Jewett mine, a surface mine adjacent to the Limestone facility, under a long-term contract with Texas Westmoreland Coal Co., or TWCC.  The contract is a cost-plus arrangement with certain performance incentives and penalties.  On August 18, 2016, NRG gave notice to TWCC terminating the active mining of lignite under the contract, effective on December 31, 2016.

Under the contract, TWCC continues to be responsible for reclamation activities. NRG is responsible for reclamation costs and has recorded an adequate ARO liability. The Railroad Commission of Texas has imposed a bond obligation of$95.5 millionon TWCC for the reclamation of the mine.  Pursuant to the contract with TWCC, NRG supports this obligation through surety bonds.  Additionally, NRG is obligated to provide additional performance assurance if required by the Railroad Commission of Texas.










Nuclear Insurance

STP maintains required insurance coverage for liability claims arising from nuclear incidents pursuant to the Price-Anderson Act.  Effective January 1, 2017, the current liability limit per incident is

$13.44 billion

, subject to change to account for the effects of inflation and the number of licensed reactors.  An inflation adjustment must be made at least once every five years with the next due no later than September 10, 2018.   Under the Price-Anderson Act, owners of nuclear power plants in the U.S. are required to purchase primary insurance limits of

$450 million

for each operating site.  In addition, the Price-Anderson Act requires an additional layer of protection through mandatory participation in a retrospective rating plan for power reactors resulting in an additional

$13 billion

in funds available for public liability claims.  The current maximum assessment per incident, per reactor, is approximately

$127 million

, taking into account a

5%

adjustment for administrative fees, payable at approximately

$19 million

per year, per reactor.  NRG would be responsible for

44%

of the maximum assessment, or

$8 million

per year, per reactor, and a maximum of

$112 million

per incident.  In addition, the U.S. Congress retains the ability to impose additional financial requirements on the nuclear industry to pay liability claims that exceed

$13 billion

for a single incident.  The liabilities of the co-owners of STP with respect to the retrospective premium assessments for nuclear liability insurance are joint and several.

STP purchases insurance for property damage and site decontamination cleanup costs from Nuclear Electric Insurance Limited, or NEIL, an industry mutual insurance company, of which STP is a member.  STP has purchased

$2.75 billion

in limits for nuclear events and

$1.5 billion

in limits for non-nuclear events, the maximum available from NEIL.  The upper

$1.25 billion

in limits (excess of the first

$1.5 billion

in limits) is a single limit blanket policy shared with two Diablo Canyon nuclear reactors, which have no affiliation with the Company.  This shared limit is not subject to automatic reinstatement in the event of a loss.  The NEIL policy covers both nuclear and non-nuclear property damage events, and a NEIL companion policy provides Accidental Outage coverage for the co-owners of STP's lost revenue following a property damage event, at a weekly indemnity limit of

$2.52 million

per unit up to a maximum of

$274.4 million

nuclear and

$183.5 million

non-nuclear, and is subject to an eight-week waiting period.  NRG also purchases an Accidental Outage policy from NEIL, which provides protection for lost revenue due to an insurable event.  This coverage allows for reimbursement up to

$1.98 million

per week per unit up to a maximum of

$215.6 million

nuclear and

$144 million

non-nuclear, and is subject to an eight-week waiting period.  Under the terms of the NEIL policies, member companies may be assessed up to

ten

times their annual premium if the NEIL Board of Directors determines their surplus has been depleted due to the payment of property losses at any of the licensed reactors in a single policy year.  NEIL requires that its members maintain an investment grade credit rating or insure their annual retrospective obligation by providing a financial guarantee, letter of credit, deposit premium, or an insurance policy.  NRG has purchased an insurance policy from NEIL to guarantee the Company's obligation; however this insurance will only respond to retrospective premium adjustments assessed within

twenty-four

months after the policy term, whereas NEIL's Board of Directors can make such an adjustment up to


years after the policy expires.

Contingencies

The Company's material legal proceedings are described below.  The Company believes that it has valid defenses to these legal proceedings and intends to defend them vigorously.  NRG records reserves for estimated losses from contingencies when information available indicates that a loss is probable and the amount of the loss, or range of loss, can be reasonably estimated.  As applicable, the Company has established an adequate reserve for the matters discussed below. In addition, legal costs are expensed as incurred.  Management has assessed each of the following matters based on current information and made a judgment concerning its potential outcome, considering the nature of the claim, the amount and nature of damages sought, and the probability of success.  Unless specified below, the Company is unable to predict the outcome of these legal proceedings or reasonably estimate the scope or amount of any associated costs and potential liabilities.  As additional information becomes available, management adjusts its assessment and estimates of such contingencies accordingly.  Because litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties and unfavorable rulings or developments, it is possible that the ultimate resolution of the Company's liabilities and contingencies could be at amounts that are different from its currently recorded reserves and that such difference could be material.

In addition to the legal proceedings noted below, NRG and its subsidiaries are party to other litigation or legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business.  In management's opinion, the disposition of these ordinary course matters will not materially adversely affect NRG's consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.

Midwest Generation Asbestos Liabilities— The Company, through its subsidiary, Midwest Generation, may be subject to potential asbestos liabilities as a result of its acquisition of EME.  The Company is currently analyzing the scope of potential liability as it may relate to Midwest Generation. The Company believes that it has established an adequate reserve for these cases.

Energy Plus Holdings—On August 7, 2012, Energy Plus Holdings received a subpoena from the NYAG which generally sought information and business records related to Energy Plus Holdings' sales, marketing and business practices.  Energy Plus Holdings provided documents and information to the NYAG.  On June 22, 2015, the NYAG issued another subpoena seeking additional information. Energy Plus Holdings provided responsive documents to this second subpoena. On August 28, 2017, the parties entered into an Assurance of Discontinuance resolving this matter.










Midwest Generation New Source Review Litigation— In August 2009, the EPA and the Illinois Attorney General, or the Government Plaintiffs, filed a complaint, or the Governments’ Complaint, in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois alleging violations of CAA PSD requirements by Midwest Generation arising from maintenance, repair or replacement projects at six Illinois coal-fired electric generating stations performed by Midwest Generation or ComEd, a prior owner of the stations, including alleged failures to obtain PSD construction permits and to comply with BACT requirements.   The Government Plaintiffs also alleged violations of opacity and PM standards at the Midwest Generation plants.  Finally, the Government Plaintiffs alleged that Midwest Generation violated certain operating permit requirements under Title V of the CAA allegedly arising from such claimed PSD, opacity and PM emission violations. Several environmental groups intervened as plaintiffs in this litigation and filed a complaint, or the Intervenors’ Complaint, which alleged opacity, PM and related Title V violations.  Midwest Generation filed a motion to dismissnineof thetenPSD counts in the Governments’ Complaint, and to dismiss the tenth PSD count to the extent the Governments’ Complaint sought civil penalties for that count.  The trial court granted the motion in March 2010.

In June 2010, the Government Plaintiffs and Intervenors each filed an amended complaint.  The Governments’ Amended Complaint again alleged that Midwest Generation violated PSD (based upon the same projects as alleged in their original complaint, but adding allegations that the Company was liable as the “successor” to ComEd), Title V and opacity and PM standards.  It named EME and ComEd as additional defendants and alleged PSD violations (again, premised on the same projects) against them.  The Intervenors’ Amended Complaint named only Midwest Generation as a defendant and alleged Title V and opacity/PM violations, as well as

one

of the

ten

PSD violations alleged in the Governments’ Amended Complaint.  Midwest Generation again moved to dismiss all but

one

of the Government Plaintiffs’ PSD claims and the related Title V claims.  Midwest Generation also filed a motion to dismiss the PSD claim in the Intervenors’ Amended Complaint and the related Title V claims.  In March 2011, the trial court granted Midwest Generation’s partial motion to dismiss the Government Plaintiffs’ PSD claims. The trial court denied Midwest Generation’s motion to dismiss the PSD claim asserted in the Intervenors’ Amended Complaint, but noted that the plaintiffs would be required to convince the court that the statute of limitations should be equitably tolled. The trial court did not address other counts in the amended complaints that allege violations of opacity and PM emission limitations under the Illinois State Implementation Plan and related Title V claims. The trial court also granted the motions to dismiss the PSD claims asserted against EME and ComEd.

Following the trial court ruling, the Government Plaintiffs appealed the trial court’s dismissals of their PSD claims, including the dismissal ofnineof thetenPSD claims against Midwest Generation and of the PSD claims against the other defendants.  Those PSD claim dismissals were affirmed by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit in July 2013.  In addition, in 2012, all butoneof the environmental groups that had intervened in the case dismissed their claims without prejudice.  As a result, onlyoneenvironmental group remains a plaintiff intervenor in the case. In February 2018, the parties agreed in principal to settle the matter. After the settlement agreement is signed by all parties (which the Company expects to occur in March 2018) and approved by the court, Midwest Generation will be required to (x) pay$500,000to each of the State of Illinois and the Federal Government and (y) make and maintain certain operational improvements.

Telephone Consumer Protection Act Purported Class Actions

—





Three

purported class action lawsuits have been filed against NRG Residential Solar Solutions, LLC —

one

in California and

two

in New Jersey.  The plaintiffs generally allege misrepresentation by the call agents and violations of the TCPA, claiming that the defendants engaged in a telemarketing campaign placing unsolicited calls to individuals on the “Do Not Call List.” The plaintiffs seek statutory damages of up to

$1,500

per plaintiff, actual damages and equitable relief. On June 22, 2017, plaintiffs in the California case filed a motion for leave to file a second amended complaint to substitute new plaintiffs. Defendants filed an opposition to this motion on June 26, 2017. The court granted plaintiffs' motion to substitute new plaintiffs and on August 1, 2017, defendants filed an answer to the second amended complaint. On August 31, 2017, the court in the California case agreed that the litigation should be stayed pending final court approval of the New Jersey settlement. On July 12, 2017, the parties in the New Jersey action reached an agreement in principle to resolve the class allegations which was confirmed by a term sheet signed by the parties on July 28, 2017. On September 27, 2017, plaintiffs in the New Jersey case filed their motion for preliminary approval of the class settlement which was approved by the court on November 17, 2017. On February 20, 2018 at the close of the objection deadline, two objections were filed to the Dobkin class settlement.












California Department of Water Resources and San Diego Gas & Electric Company v. Sunrise Power Company LLC

— On January 29, 2016, CDWR and SDG&E filed a lawsuit against Sunrise Power Company, along with NRG and Chevron Power Corporation.  In June 2001, CDWR and Sunrise entered into a


-year PPA under which Sunrise would construct and operate a generating facility and provide power to CDWR.  At the time the PPA was entered into, Sunrise had a transportation services agreement, or TSA, to purchase natural gas from Kern River through April 30, 2018.  In August 2003, CDWR entered into an agreement with Sunrise and Kern River in which CDWR accepted assignment of the TSA through the term of the PPA.  After the PPA expired, Kern River demanded that any reassignment be to a party which met certain creditworthiness standards which Sunrise did not.  As such, the plaintiffs brought this lawsuit against the defendants alleging breach of contract, breach of covenant of good faith and fair dealing and improper distributions.  Plaintiffs generally claim damages of

$1.2 million

per month for the remaining


months of the TSA.  On April 20, 2016, the defendants filed objections in response to the plaintiffs' complaint.  The objections were granted on June 14, 2016; however, the plaintiffs were allowed to file amended complaints on July 1, 2016. On July 27, 2016, defendants filed objections to the amended complaints.  On November 18, 2016, the court sustained the objections and allowed plaintiffs another opportunity to file a second amended lawsuit which they did on January 13, 2017. On April 21, 2017, the court issued an order sustaining the objections without leave to amend. On July 14, 2017, CDWR filed a notice of appeal. On January 10, 2018, CDWR filed its appellate brief.

Morgantown v. GenOn Mid-Atlantic— On June 8, 2017, Morgantown and Dickerson Owner Lessors filed a lawsuit against GenOn Mid-Atlantic, LLC, NRG North America LLC, GenOn Americas Generation, LLC, NRG Americas, Inc., GenOn Energy Holdings, Inc., GenOn Energy, Inc., and NRG Energy, Inc. in New York State Supreme Court.  The plaintiffs allege that they were overcharged by defendants for certain services outlined in a Services Agreement and that defendants caused a Qualified Credit Support portion of a Participation Agreement, or QCS Agreement, to be violated by causing the transfer of certain money outside the allowable confines set forth in the QCS Agreement. In addition, plaintiffs claim that the transfers were unfairly executed and done so in an effort to defraud plaintiffs and hinder their ability to continue to do business.  As such, plaintiffs seek, among other things, the return of certain transferred funds and service charges paid and to bar defendants from executing additional transfers on plaintiffs’ behalf. On November 7, 2017, the Bankruptcy Court issued an order estimating the claims to be valued at$0.  On December 14, 2017, a settlement agreement was executed between GenOn and NRG which should ultimately resolve this lawsuit.

BTEC v. NRG Texas Power— On July 18, 2017, BTEC New Albany LLC, or BTEC, filed a lawsuit against NRG Texas Power LLC, or NRG Texas Power, in the Harris County District Court in Texas.  On January 15, 2013, the parties entered into a Membership  Interest and Purchase Agreement, or MIPA, whereby BTEC agreed to dismantle, transport and rebuild an electric power generation facility at the former P.H. Robinson Electric Generating Station in Bacliff, Texas.  The MIPA required BTEC to meet a Guaranteed Commercial Completion Date of May 31, 2016.  But even a year later, BTEC had not satisfied all of the contractually-required acceptance criteria.  As a result and given that the MIPA expiration date passed on May 31, 2017, NRG elected to terminate the contract in June 2017. BTEC claims that NRG Texas Power breached the MIPA by improperly terminating it, and seeks a declaratory judgment as to the rights and obligations of the parties.  In addition, BTEC seeks damages, interest and attorney’s fees. On August 14, 2017, NRG Texas Power served its answer to the lawsuit.  On September 7, 2017, NRG Texas Power filed a counterclaim seeking damages in excess of$48 million.

Natural Gas Litigation



—



In May 2016 inoneof the Kansas cases, the U.S. District Court for the District of Nevada granted the defendants' motion for summary judgment.  Subsequently in December 2016, the plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal with the Ninth Circuit. The appeal has been fully briefed by the parties and was argued on February 16, 2018. GenOn has agreed to indemnify CenterPoint against certain losses relating to these lawsuits.

In September 2012, the State of Nevada Supreme Court, which was handling the remaining case, affirmed dismissal by the Eighth Judicial District Court for Clark County, Nevada of all plaintiffs' claims against GenOn.  In February 2013, the plaintiffs in the Nevada case filed a petition for a writ of certiorari to the U.S. Supreme Court.  In June 2013, the U.S. Supreme Court denied the petition for a writ of certiorari, thereby endingoneof thefivelawsuits.

Potomac River Environmental Investigation—In March 2013, NRG Potomac River LLC, a subsidiary of GenOn, received notice that the District of Columbia Department of Environment (now renamed the Department of Energy and Environment, or DOEE) was investigating potential discharges to the Potomac River originating from the Potomac River Generating facility site, a site where the generation facility is no longer in operation. In connection with that investigation, DOEE served a civil subpoena on NRG Potomac River LLC requesting information related to the site and potential discharges occurring from the site.  NRG Potomac River LLC provided various responsive materials.  In January 2016, DOEE advised NRG Potomac River LLC that DOEE believed various environmental violations had occurred as a result of discharges DOEE believes occurred to the Potomac River from the Potomac River Generating facility site and as a result of associated failures to accurately or sufficiently report such discharges.  DOEE has indicated it believes that penalties are appropriate in light of the violations.  NRG Potomac River LLC is currently reviewing the information provided by DOEE.










Natixis v. GenOn Mid-Atlantic—On February 16, 2018, Natixis Funding Corp. and Natixis, New York Branch filed a complaint in the Supreme Court of the State of New York against GenOn Mid-Atlantic, the owner lessors under GenOn Mid-Atlantic’s operating leases of the Dickerson and Morgantown coal generation units, and the lease indenture trustee under those leases.  The plaintiffs’ allegations against GenOn Mid-Atlantic relate to a payment agreement between GenOn Mid-Atlantic and Natixis Funding Corp. to procure credit support for the payment of certain lease payments owed pursuant to the GenOn Mid-Atlantic operating leases for Morgantown and Dickerson.  Plaintiffs seek approximately$34 millionin damages arising from GenOn Mid-Atlantic’s purported breach of certain warranties in the payment agreement.

Zero-Emission Credits for Nuclear Plants in Illinois

— In 2016, Illinois enacted a Zero Emission Credit, or ZEC, program for selected nuclear units in Illinois.  In total, the program directs over $2.5 billion over ten years to nuclear plants in Illinois that would otherwise retire.  Pursuant to the legislation

,

the Illinois Power Agency, or IPA, conducts a competitive solicitation to procure ZECs, although both the Governor of Illinois and Exelon have already announced that the ZECs will be awarded to two Exelon-owned nuclear power plants in Illinois.  These ZECs are out-of-market subsidies that threaten to artificially suppress market prices and interfere with the wholesale power market.  On February 14, 2017, NRG, along with other companies, filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois alleging that the state program is preempted by federal law and in violation of the dormant commerce clause.  Another plaintiff group filed a similar complaint on the same day.



Subsequently, on March 31, 2017, NRG, along with other companies, filed a motion for preliminary injunction. On April 10, 2017, Exelon, as an intervenor defendant, and State defendants filed motions to dismiss. On July 14, 2017, Defendants' motions to dismiss were granted. On July 17, 2017, NRG, along with other companies, filed a notice of appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit. Briefing is complete. Oral argument was held on January 3, 2018, with supplemental briefs filed on January 26, 2018. On February 21, 2018, the Seventh Circuit invited the U.S. to file an amicus brief in the proceeding.

Zero-Emission Credits for Nuclear Plants in New York— On August 1, 2016, the NYSPSC issued its Clean Energy Standard, or CES, which provided for ZECs which would provide more than $7.6 billion over 12 years in out-of-market subsidy payments to certain selected nuclear generating units in the state.  These ZECs are out-of-market subsidies that threaten to artificially suppress market prices and interfere with the wholesale power market.  On October 19, 2016, NRG, along with other companies, filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, challenging the validity of the NYSPSC action and the ZEC program.  On March 29, 2017, the U.S. District Court heard oral arguments on a motion to dismiss filed by defendants. On July 25, 2017, the defendants' motions to dismiss were granted. On August 24, 2017, NRG, along with other plaintiff companies, filed a notice of appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. Briefing is complete. Oral argument has been noticed for March 12, 2018.

Department of Energy's Proposed Grid Resiliency Pricing Rule— On September 29, 2017, the Department of Energy issued a proposed rulemaking titled the "Grid Resiliency Pricing Rule." The rulemaking directs FERC to take action to reform the ISO/RTO markets to value certain reliability and resiliency attributes of electric generation resources. On October 2, 2017, FERC issued a notice inviting comments. On October 4, 2017, FERC staff issued a series of questions requesting commenters to address. On October 23, 2017, NRG filed comments encouraging FERC to act expeditiously to modernize energy and capacity markets in a manner compatible with robust competitive markets. On January 8, 2018, FERC terminated the proposed rulemaking and opened a new rulemaking asking each ISO/RTO to address specific questions focused on grid resilience.










East/West

Montgomery County Station Power Tax—On December 20, 2013, NRG received a letter from Montgomery County, Maryland requesting payment of an energy tax for the consumption of station power at the Dickerson Facility over the previous three years.  Montgomery County seeks payment in the amount of$22 million, which includes tax, interest and penalties.  NRG disputed the applicability of the tax.  On December 11, 2015, the Maryland Tax Court reversed Montgomery County's assessment.  Montgomery County filed an appeal, and on February 2, 2017, the Montgomery County Circuit Court affirmed the decision of the tax court. On February 17, 2017, Montgomery County filed an appeal to the Court of Special Appeals of Maryland. On February 1, 2018, the court heard oral arguments.

California Station Power—As the result of unfavorable final and non-appealable litigation, the Company has accrued a liability associated with consumption of station power at three of the Company’s power plants in California, after August 30, 2010.  In December 2017, subsidiaries of the Company entered into settlements with SCE for the liabilities associated with the Company's El Segundo and Long Beach facilities.  The Company has established an appropriate reserve pending potential regulatory action by SDG&E regarding Encina.

Puente Power Project— On October 5, 2017, the California Energy Commission, or CEC, the agency responsible for permitting the Puente Power Project, issued a statement on behalf of the committee of two Commissioners overseeing the permitting process stating their intention to issue a proposed decision that would deny a permit for the Puente Power Project. On October 16, 2017, NRG filed a motion to suspend the permitting proceeding for at least six months, which was granted on November 3, 2017.  During the six month suspension period, which could conceivably be extended, NRG will evaluate the progress of a procurement process initiated by SCE to replace the Puente Power Project.



Note 24—Environmental Matters

NRG is subject to a wide range of environmental laws in the development, construction, ownership and operation of projects. These laws generally require that governmental permits and approvals be obtained before construction and during operation of power plants. NRG is also subject to laws regarding the protection of wildlife, including migratory birds, eagles and threatened and endangered species. The electric generation industry has been facing requirements regarding GHGs, combustion byproducts, water discharge and use, and threatened and endangered species that have been put in place in recent years. However, under the current U.S. presidential administration, some of these rules are being reconsidered and reviewed. In general, future laws are expected to require the addition of emissions controls or other environmental controls or to impose certain restrictions on the operations of the Company's facilities, which could have a material effect on the Company's consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. Federal and state environmental laws generally have become more stringent over time, although this trend could slow or pause in the near term with respect to federal laws under the current U.S. presidential administration.

The EPA finalized CSAPR in 2011, which was intended to replace CAIR in January 2012, to address certain states' obligations to reduce emissions so that downwind states can achieve federal air quality standards. In December 2011, the D.C. Circuit stayed the implementation of CSAPR and then vacated CSAPR in August 2012 but kept CAIR in place until the EPA could replace it. In April 2014, the U.S. Supreme Court reversed and remanded the D.C. Circuit's decision. In October 2014, the D.C. Circuit lifted the stay of CSAPR. In response, the EPA in November 2014 amended the CSAPR compliance dates. Accordingly, CSAPR replaced CAIR on January 1, 2015. On July 28, 2015, the D.C. Circuit held that the EPA had exceeded its authority by requiring certain reductions that were not necessary for downwind states to achieve federal standards. Although the D.C. Circuit kept the rule in place, the court ordered the EPA to revise the Phase 2 (or 2017) (i) SO


budgets for four states including Texas and (ii) ozone-season NO

x

budgets for 11 states including Maryland, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Texas. On October 26, 2016, the EPA finalized the CSAPR Update Rule, which reduces future NO

x

allocations and discounts the current banked allowances to account for the more stringent 2008 Ozone NAAQS and to address the D.C. Circuit's July 2015 decision. This rule has been challenged in the D.C. Circuit. The Company believes its investment in pollution controls and cleaner technologies leave the fleet well-positioned for compliance.










Water

In August 2014, the EPA finalized the regulation regarding the use of water for once through cooling at existing facilities to address impingement and entrainment concerns. NRG anticipates that more stringent requirements will be incorporated into some of its water discharge permits over the next several years as NPDES permits are renewed.

Effluent Limitations Guidelines— In November 2015, the EPA revised the Effluent Limitations Guidelines for Steam Electric Generating Facilities, which would have imposed more stringent requirements (as individual permits were renewed) for wastewater streams from flue gas desulfurization, or FGD, fly ash, bottom ash, and flue gas mercury control.  In April 2017, the EPA granted two petitions to reconsider the rule and also administratively stayed some of the deadlines. On September 18, 2017, the EPA promulgated a final rule that (i) postpones the compliance dates to preserve the status quo for FGD wastewater and bottom ash transport water by two years to November 2020 until the EPA completes its next rulemaking and (ii) withdrew the April 2017 administrative stay. The legal challenges have been suspended while the EPA reconsiders and likely modifies the rule. Accordingly, the Company has largely eliminated its estimate of the environmental capital expenditures that would have been required to comply with permits incorporating the revised guidelines. The Company will revisit these estimates after the rule is revised.

Byproducts, Wastes, Hazardous Materials and Contamination

In April 2015, the EPA finalized the rule regulating byproducts of coal combustion (e.g., ash and gypsum) as solid wastes under the RCRA. On September 13, 2017, the EPA granted the petition for reconsideration that the Utility Solid Waste Activities Group filed in May 2017. The Company has evaluated the impact of the new rule on the Company's consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows and has accrued its environmental and asset retirement obligations under the rule based on current estimates as of December 31, 2017.

East/West Region

New Source Review— The EPA and various states have been investigating compliance of electric generating facilities with the pre-construction permitting requirements of the CAA known as “new source review,” or NSR.  In 2007, Midwest Generation received an NOV from the EPA alleging that past work at Crawford, Fisk, Joliet, Powerton, Waukegan and Will County generating stations violated NSR and other regulations. These alleged violations are the subject of litigation described in Item 15 —Note 22,Commitments and Contingencies.Additionally, in April 2013, the Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection issued four NOVs alleging that past work at oil-fired combustion turbines at the Torrington Terminal, Franklin, Branford and Middletown generating stations violated regulations regarding NSR.

Burton Island Old Ash Landfill— In January 2006, NRG's Indian River Power LLC was notified that it may be a potentially responsible party with respect to Burton Island Old Ash Landfill, a historic captive landfill located at the Indian River facility.  On October 1, 2007, NRG signed an agreement with DNREC to investigate the site through the Voluntary Clean-up Program, or the VCP.  On February 4, 2008, DNREC issued findings that no further action was required in relation to surface water and that a previously planned shoreline stabilization project would satisfactorily address shoreline erosion.  The landfill itself required a Remedial Investigation and Feasibility Study to determine the type and scope of any additional required work.  DNREC approved the Feasibility Study in December 2012.  In January 2013, DNREC proposed a remediation plan based on the Feasibility Study.  The remediation plan was approved in October 2013.  In December 2015, DNREC approved the Company's remediation design, the Company's Closure Report and the Company's Long Term Stewardship Plan. In the second quarter of 2017, the Company completed the remediation requirements in the remediation plan. The cost of completing the work required by the remediation plan was within amounts budgeted in early 2016 and remediation was completed in 2017.  The estimated cost to comply with the Long-Term Stewardship Plan was added to the liability in December 2016.










In addition to the VCP, on May 29, 2008, DNREC requested that NRG's Indian River Power LLC participate in the development and performance of a Natural Resource Damage Assessment at the Burton Island Old Ash Landfill.  NRG is currently working with DNREC and other trustees to close out the assessment process.

For further discussion of these matters, refer toNote 22,Commitments and Contingencies.

Note 26—Guarantees

NRG and its subsidiaries enter into various contracts that include indemnification and guarantee provisions as a routine part of the Company's business activities. Examples of these contracts include asset purchases and sale agreements, commodity sale and purchase agreements, retail contracts, joint venture agreements, EPC agreements, operation and maintenance agreements, service agreements, settlement agreements, and other types of contractual agreements with vendors and other third parties, as well as affiliates.  These contracts generally indemnify the counterparty for tax, environmental liability, litigation and other matters, as well as breaches of representations, warranties and covenants set forth in these agreements. The Company is obligated with respect to customer deposits associated with the Company's retail businesses.  In some cases, NRG's maximum potential liability cannot be estimated, since the underlying agreements contain no limits on potential liability.

The following table summarizes the maximum potential exposures that can be estimated for NRG's guarantees, indemnities, and other contingent liabilities by maturity:

By Remaining Maturity at December 31,2017GuaranteesUnder1 Year1-3 Years3-5 YearsOver5 YearsTotal2016 Total(In millions)Letters of credit and surety bonds(a)$1,467$66$7$93$1,633$1,837Asset sales guarantee obligations——25755312677Other guarantees—32—613645253Total guarantees$1,467$98$264$761$2,590$2,767

(a)Excludes$92 millionand$272 millionof letters of credit issued under the intercompany revolving credit agreement between NRG and GenOn as ofDecember 31, 2017and 2016, respectively.

Letters of credit and surety bonds— As ofDecember 31, 2017, NRG and its consolidated subsidiaries were contingently obligated for a total of$1.6 billionunder letters of credit and surety bonds.  Most of these letters of credit and surety bonds are issued in support of the Company's obligations to perform under commodity agreements and obligations associated with future closure and maintenance of ash sites, as well as for financing or other arrangements.  A majority of these letters of credit and surety bonds expire withinoneyear of issuance, and it is typical for the Company to renew them on similar terms.

The material indemnities, within the scope of ASC 460, are as follows:

Asset sales— The purchase and sale agreements which govern NRG's asset or share investments and divestitures customarily contain guarantees and indemnifications of the transaction to third parties.  The contracts indemnify the parties for liabilities incurred as a result of a breach of a representation or warranty by the indemnifying party, or as a result of a change in tax laws.  These obligations generally have a discrete term and are intended to protect the parties against risks that are difficult to predict or estimate at the time of the transaction.  In several cases, the contract limits the liability of the indemnifier. NRG has no reason to believe that the Company currently has any material liability relating to such routine indemnification obligations.










Other guarantees— NRG has issued other guarantees of obligations including payments under certain agreements with respect to certain of its unconsolidated subsidiaries, payment or performance by fuel providers and payment or reimbursement of credit support and deposits. The Company does not believe that it will be required to perform under these guarantees.

Other indemnities— Other indemnifications NRG has provided cover operational, tax, litigation and breaches of representations, warranties and covenants.  NRG has also indemnified, on a routine basis in the ordinary course of business, consultants or other vendors who have provided services to the Company.  NRG's maximum potential exposure under these indemnifications can range from a specified dollar amount to an indeterminate amount, depending on the nature of the transaction.  Total maximum potential exposure under these indemnifications is not estimable due to uncertainty as to whether claims will be made or how they will be resolved.  NRG does not have any reason to believe that the Company will be required to make any material payments under these indemnity provisions.

Because many of the guarantees and indemnities NRG issues to third parties and affiliates do not limit the amount or duration of its obligations to perform under them, there exists a risk that the Company may have obligations in excess of the amounts described above.  For those guarantees and indemnities that do not limit the Company's liability exposure, it may not be able to estimate what the Company's liability would be, until a claim is made for payment or performance, due to the contingent nature of these contracts.





Note 27—Jointly Owned Plants

Certain NRG subsidiaries own undivided interests in jointly-owned plants, as described below.  These plants are maintained and operated pursuant to their joint ownership participation and operating agreements.  NRG is responsible for its subsidiaries' share of operating costs and direct expenses and includes its proportionate share of the facilities and related revenues and direct expenses in these jointly-owned plants in the corresponding balance sheet and income statement captions of the Company's consolidated financial statements.

The following table summarizes NRG's proportionate ownership interest in the Company's jointly-owned facilities:
