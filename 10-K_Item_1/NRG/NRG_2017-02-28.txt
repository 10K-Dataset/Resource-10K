Item 1 — Business

General

NRG Energy, Inc., or NRG or the Company, is a leading integrated power company built on the strength of the nation's largest and most diverse competitive electric generation portfolio and leading retail electricity platform.  NRG aims to create a sustainable energy future by producing, selling and delivering electricity and related products and services in major competitive power markets in the U.S. in a manner that delivers value to all of NRG's stakeholders. The Company owns and operates approximately 47,000 MW of generation; engages in the trading of wholesale energy, capacity and related products; transacts in and trades fuel and transportation services; and directly sells energy, services, and innovative, sustainable products and services to retail customers under the names “NRG”, "Reliant" and other retail brand names owned by NRG. NRG was incorporated as a Delaware corporation on May 29, 1992.

Strategy

NRG's strategy is to maximize stockholder value through the safe production and sale of reliable and affordable power to its customers in the markets served by the Company, while positioning the Company to meet the market's increasing demand for sustainable, low carbon and customized energy solutions for the benefit of the end-use energy consumer. This strategy is intended to enable the Company to achieve sustainable growth at reasonable margins while de-risking the Company in terms of reduced and mitigated exposure both to environmental risk and cyclical commodity price risk. At the same time, the Company's relentless commitment to safety for its employees, customers and partners continues unabated.

To effectuate the Company’s strategy, NRG is focused on: (i) excellence in operating performance of its existing assets including repowering its power generation assets at premium sites and optimal hedging of generation assets and retail load operations; (ii) serving the energy needs of end-use residential, commercial and industrial customers in competitive markets through multiple brands and channels with a variety of retail energy products and services differentiated by innovative features, premium service, sustainability, and loyalty/affinity programs; (iii) investing in alternative power generation technologies in its wholesale business, like wind and solar, and deploying innovative energy solutions for consumers within its retail businesses; and (iv) engaging in a proactive capital allocation plan focused on achieving the regular return of and on stockholder capital within the dictates of prudent balance sheet management, including pursuing selective acquisitions, joint ventures, divestitures and investments.

Business Overview

The Company’s core businesses include wholesale conventional generation, retail electricity including personal power solutions and Business Solutions (included in the Retail segment, effective in January 2017), contracted generation owned by NRG Yield, Inc. (included in the NRG Yield segment) and renewable utility scale and distributed generation assets that are constructed or in development and that are not otherwise owned by NRG Yield, Inc. (included in the Renewables segment).

Generation

The Company’s wholesale power generation business includes the Company's wholesale operations including plant operations, commercial operations, EPC, energy services and other critical related functions. In addition to the traditional functions, the wholesale power generation business also includes NRG’s conventional distributed generation business, consisting of reliability, combined heat and power and large-scale distributed generation.

The wholesale generation business is capital-intensive and commodity-driven with numerous industry participants that compete on the basis of the location of their plants, fuel mix, plant efficiency and the reliability of the services offered. The Company has one of the largest and most diversified power generation portfolios in the U.S., with approximately 42,000 MW of fossil fuel and nuclear generation capacity at 85 plants as of December 31, 2016.  The Company's power generation assets are diversified by fuel-type, dispatch level and region, which helps mitigate the risks associated with fuel price volatility and market demand cycles.  NRG's U.S. baseload and intermediate facilities provide the Company with a significant source of cash flow, while its peaking facilities provide NRG with opportunities to capture significant upside potential that can arise during periods of high demand, which typically drive higher energy prices. As of December 31, 2016, less than 25% of the Company's consolidated operating revenues were derived from coal-fired operating assets.










Wholesale power generation is a regional business that is currently highly fragmented and diverse in terms of industry structure. As such, there is a wide variation in terms of the capabilities, resources, nature and identities of the companies the Company competes with depending on the market. Competitors include regulated utilities, municipalities, cooperatives and other independent power producers, and power marketers or trading companies, including those owned by financial institutions.  Many of the Company's generation assets, however, are located within densely populated areas that tend to have higher wholesale pricing as a result of relatively favorable local supply-demand balance.  The Company has generation assets located in or near Houston, New York City, Chicago, Washington D.C., New Jersey, southwestern Connecticut, Pittsburgh, Cleveland, and the Los Angeles, San Diego, and San Francisco metropolitan areas.  These facilities, some of which are aging, are often ideally situated for repowering or the addition of new capacity because their location and existing infrastructure give them significant advantages over undeveloped sites. The Company believes that its extensive generation portfolio provides many asset optimization opportunities. During 2016, the Company completed gas conversion projects on facilities totaling more than 2,200 MW. The Company currently has over 1,000 MW targeted for Repowering initiatives, all of which are under development or construction.

In addition, the Company continuously evaluates opportunities for development of new generation, on both a merchant and contracted basis. As such, the majority of the Company's current developments are in response to RFPs for new generation and/or generating capacity backed by contracts with credit-worthy counterparties.  Many RFPs are issued by regulated utilities or electric system operators in response to reliability or renewable power mandates.  The Company competes against other power plant developers when responding to these RFPs.  The number and type of competitors vary based on the location, generation type, project size and counterparty specified in the RFP.  Bids are awarded based on many factors including price, location of existing generation, prior experience developing generation resources similar to that specified in the RFP, and creditworthiness.

Retail

Retail provides energy and related services as well as personal power to Mass Market consumers through various brands and sales channels across the U.S. Retail also includes C&I customers and other distributed and reliability products which are within NRG's Business Solutions group.  In 2016, Retail delivered approximately 42 TWhs and served approximately 2.8 million mass Recurring Customers. Retail's results make it the largest competitive Mass Market energy retailer in the U.S. and Texas, and one of the top six Mass Market energy retailers in the Eastern and Midwestern U.S. The majority of Retail's sales come in the competitive retail energy markets of Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Texas, as well as the District of Columbia.

Mass Market consumers make purchase decisions based on a variety of factors, including price, customer service, brand, product choices and value-added features.  These consumers purchase products through a variety of sales channels, including direct sales, call centers, websites, brokers and brick-and-mortar stores.  Through its broad range of service offerings and value propositions, Retail is able to attract, retain, and increase the value of its customer relationships. Retail's brands are recognized for exemplary customer service, innovative smart energy and technology product offerings and environmentally friendly solutions.

Included in Retail is the Company's Business Solutions group, which focuses on providing distributed products and services as businesses seek greater reliability, cleaner power or other benefits that they cannot obtain from the grid.  These solutions include system power, distributed generation, solar and wind products, carbon management and specialty services, backup generation, storage and distributed solar, demand response and energy efficiency. In providing on-site energy solutions, the Company often benefits from its ability to supply energy products from its wholesale generation portfolio to commercial and industrial retail customers.

The Company also provides energy services including operations, maintenance, technical, development and asset management services to its own facilities and to external customers.


























Renewables

The Company’s renewables business focuses on the acquisition, development and operation and maintenance of utility scale wind and solar, community solar and distributed solar generation assets as well as the management and operations of the renewable generation assets owned by NRG Yield, Inc.  A substantial portion of the utility scale wind and solar generation facilities contained within the Company’s renewables business are subject to the ROFO Agreement between the Company and NRG Yield, Inc.  In 2016, the Company acquired 1,637 MW of utility scale solar and wind projects and 107 MW of distributed generation and community solar projects that are currently under development or in operation across 12 states.  The renewables business has in-house expertise that covers the full spectrum of development capabilities to execute on utility, distributed generation, and community solar projects. The asset management and operations and maintenance groups within the renewables business manage a portfolio of wind and solar assets across 26 states, serving as the primary commercial asset manager on the vast majority of assets owned by NRG and NRG Yield, Inc. In addition, the operations and maintenance groups self-perform plant operations on 2,675 MW on the consolidated fleet of assets owned by NRG and NRG Yield, Inc. and 224 MW on assets owned by third parties.

The utility wind and solar generation business targets strategic partnerships with utilities, municipalities and large national corporations for offsite wind and solar solutions. The distributed solar business targets partnerships with companies, municipalities, schools and communities to provide on-site and virtual net metering off-site renewable generation.  The community solar business targets relationships with companies and municipalities as well as residential homeowners to provide off-site solar generation under community solar regulations and tariffs. In addition to assets in operation, as of December 31, 2016, the Company held a backlog of in-construction, contracted and awarded projects of 543 MW, and a pipeline of 3,268 MW across the utility and distributed solar renewables markets.

Similar to the wholesale business, the renewables business also competes for new generation opportunities through both RFPs and bilateral solicitations. The renewables business selects markets and projects to compete based on resource relative to the value of the power, while seeking to make use of NRG capabilities in a competitive landscape. The number and type of competitors vary based on location, generation type, project size and counterparty.  The renewables business competes with traditional utilities as well as companies that provide products and services in the downstream solar and wind energy value chains.

NRG Yield

NRG Yield, Inc. is a publicly-traded, dividend growth-oriented company formed to serve as the primary vehicle through which NRG owns, operates and acquires diversified contracted renewable and conventional generation and thermal infrastructure assets.  As of December 31, 2016, NRG owns a 55.1% voting interest in the outstanding common stock of NRG Yield, Inc. NRG Yield, Inc.’s contracted generation portfolio collectively represents 4,563 net MW as of December 31, 2016. Each of the assets sells substantially all of its output pursuant to long-term, fixed price offtake agreements with creditworthy counterparties. NRG Yield, Inc. also owns thermal infrastructure assets with an aggregate steam and chilled water capacity of 1,319 net MWt and electric generation capacity of 123 net MW. These thermal infrastructure assets provide steam, hot water and/or chilled water, and in some instances electricity, to commercial businesses, universities, hospitals and governmental units in multiple locations, principally through long-term contracts or pursuant to rates regulated by state utility commissions.

NRG Yield, Inc. provides the Company with a more competitive cost of capital consistent with the lower risk profile of long-term contracted or regulated assets. As such, NRG believes that it directly benefits from NRG Yield, Inc.’s growth through its controlling interest in NRG Yield, Inc. and by providing NRG Yield, Inc. a platform of growth through the completion of future sales of assets pursuant to the ROFO Agreement. The proceeds of such future sales are expected to provide the Company with a portion of the capital utilized under its capital allocation program.










GenOn Liquidity

As disclosed in Item 15 - Note 1,Nature of Business, and Note 12,Debt and Capital Leases, to the Consolidated Financial Statements, $691 million of GenOn's Senior Notes, excluding $8 million of associated premiums, are current within the GenOn consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2016 and are due on June 15, 2017.  GenOn's future profitability continues to be adversely affected by (i) a sustained decline in natural gas prices and its resulting effect on wholesale power prices and capacity prices, and (ii) the inability of GenOn Mid-Atlantic and REMA to make distributions of cash and certain other restricted payments to GenOn.  Based on current projections, GenOn is not expected to have sufficient liquidity to repay the Senior Notes due in June 2017.  As a result of these factors, there is substantial doubt about GenOn's ability to continue as a going concern. As a result of the substantial doubt about GenOn’s ability to continue as a going concern, along with additional factors, there is substantial doubt about certain of GenOn’s subsidiaries’ ability to continue as a going concern.

The Company, GenOn's parent company, has no obligation to provide any financial support to GenOn other than under the secured intercompany revolving credit agreement between the Company and GenOn and NRG Americas. As of December 31, 2016, $228 million was available to be used by GenOn under the $500 million revolving credit agreement. As controlled group members, ERISA requires that NRG and GenOn are jointly and severally liable for the NRG Pension Plan for Bargained Employees and the NRG Pension Plan, including the pension liabilities associated with GenOn employees.

GenOn is currently considering all options available to it, including negotiations with creditors, refinancing the GenOn Senior Notes, potential sales of certain generating assets as well as the possibility for a need to file for protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.  During 2016, GenOn appointed two independent directors, retained advisors and established a separate audit committee as part of this process. Any resolution may have a material impact on the Company's statement of operations, cash flows and financial position.



As of December 31, 2016, GenOn represents 15.6% of the Company's consolidated total assets, 16.9% of the Company's consolidated total liabilities and contributed $94 million to the Company's consolidated cash from operations in 2016.

NRG's portfolio diversification and commercial operations hedging strategy provides the Company with reliable future cash flows.NRG has hedged a portion of its coal and nuclear capacity with decreasing hedge levels through 2021.  Over a third of the Company's generation is in markets with forward capacity markets that extend three years into the future. These capacity revenues not only enhance the reliability of future cash flows but are not correlated to natural gas prices.  NRG also has cooperative load contract obligations in the Gulf Coast region extending through various dates in 2025, which largely hedges a portion of the Company's generation in this region.  In addition, as ofDecember 31, 2016, the Company had purchased fuel forward under fixed price contracts, with contractually-specified price escalators, for approximately 30% of its expected coal requirement from2017to 2021.  The Company enters into additional hedges when it deems market conditions to be favorable.

The Company also has the advantage of being able to supply its retail businesses with its own generation, which can reduce the need to sell and buy power from other institutions and intermediaries, resulting in lower transaction costs and credit exposures.  This combination of generation and retail allows for a reduction in actual and contingent collateral, through offsetting transactions and by reducing the need to hedge the retail power supply through third parties.

The generation and retail combination also provides stability in cash flows, as changes in commodity prices generally have offsetting impacts between the two businesses.  The offsetting nature of generation and retail, in relation to changes in market prices, is an integral part of NRG's goal of providing a reliable source of future cash flow for the Company.










When developing new renewable and conventional power generation facilities, NRG typically secures long-term PPAs, which insulate the Company from commodity market volatility and provide future cash flow stability.  These PPAs are typically contracted with high credit quality local utilities and typically have durations from 10 years to as much as 25 years.

Commercial Operations Overview

NRG seeks to maximize profitability and manage cash flow volatility through the marketing, trading and sale of energy, capacity and ancillary services into spot, intermediate and long-term markets and through the active management and trading of emissions allowances, fuel supplies and transportation-related services.  The Company's principal objectives are the realization of the full market value of its asset base, including the capture of its extrinsic value, the management and mitigation of commodity market risk and the reduction of cash flow volatility over time.

NRG enters into power sales and hedging arrangements via a wide range of products and contracts, including PPAs, fuel supply contracts, capacity auctions, natural gas derivative instruments and other financial instruments.  In addition, because changes in power prices in the markets where NRG operates are generally correlated to changes in natural gas prices, NRG uses hedging strategies that may include power and natural gas forward sales contracts to manage the commodity price risk primarily associated with the Company's coal and nuclear generation assets.  The objective of these hedging strategies is to stabilize the cash flow generated by NRG's portfolio of assets.

NRG also trades electric power, natural gas and related commodity and financial products, including forwards, futures, options and swaps, through its ownership of BETM, which is also an energy management service provider for primarily third-party generating assets.  Certain other NRG entities trade to a lesser extent, utilizing similar products as well as oil and weather products. The Company seeks to generate profits from volatility in the price of electricity, capacity, fuels and transmission congestion by buying and selling contracts in wholesale markets under guidelines approved by the Company's risk management committee.

Coal and Nuclear Operations

Capacity and Other Contracted Revenue Sources

NRG's revenues and cash flows benefit from capacity/demand payments and other contracted revenue sources, originating from market clearing capacity prices, Resource Adequacy contracts, tolling arrangements, PPAs and other long-term contractual arrangements:

•Capacity auctions— The Company's largest sources of capacity revenues are capacity auctions in PJM, ISO-NE, and NYISO.  Both ISO-NE and PJM operate a pay-for-performance model where capacity payments are modified based on real-time performance, where NRG's actual revenues will be the combination of revenues based on the cleared auction MWs plus the net of any over- and under-performance of NRG's fleet. In addition, MISO has an annual auction, known as the Planning Resource Auction, or PRA. The Gulf Coast assets situated in the MISO market may participate in this auction.  Recent changes have made the decision to import external capacity into the PJM market more complicated, and the Company is evaluating the feasibility of continuing to import.

•Resource Adequacy and bilateral contracts— In California, there is a resource adequacy requirement that is satisfied through bilateral contracts. The Company's newer generation in California is contracted under long-term tolling agreements. Certain other sites in California have short-term tolling agreements or resource adequacy contracts. In addition, NRG earns demand payments from its long-term full-requirements load contracts with nine Louisiana distribution cooperatives, which expire in 2025. NRG also had full requirements contracts in PJM in 2016.  Demand payments from the current long-term contracts are tied to summer peak demand and provide a mechanism for recovering a portion of the costs associated with new or changed environmental laws or regulations. In Texas, capacity and contracted revenues are through bilateral contracts with load serving entities.

•Long-term PPAs— Output from the majority of renewable energy assets and certain conventional energy plants is sold through long-term PPAs and tolling agreements to a single counterparty, which is often a utility or commercial customer.












Fuel Supply and Transportation

NRG's fuel requirements consist of various forms of fossil fuel (including coal, natural gas and oil) and nuclear fuel. The prices of fossil fuels are highly volatile. The Company obtains its fossil fuels from multiple suppliers and through multiple transporters. Although availability is generally not an issue, localized shortages, transportation availability, delays arising from extreme weather conditions and supplier financial stability issues can and do occur.  The preceding factors related to the sources and availability of raw materials are fairly uniform across the Company's business segments and fuel products used.

Coal— The Company believes it is adequately hedged, using forward coal supply agreements, for its domestic coal consumption for2017.  NRG actively manages its coal requirements based on forecasted generation, market volatility and its inventory on site.  As ofDecember 31, 2016, NRG had purchased forward contracts to provide fuel for approximately 27% of the Company's expected requirements from2017through2021, including expected coal inventory draw down.  NRG purchased approximately 25 million tons of coal in2016, of which 84% was Powder River Basin coal and lignite. For fuel transport, NRG has entered into various rail and barge transportation and rail car lease agreements with varying tenures that provide for most of the Company's transportation requirements of Powder River Basin coal for the next 5 years and for all of the Company's transportation requirements of Appalachian and Colorado coal for the next two years.

The following table shows the percentage of the Company's coal requirements from2017through 2021 that have been purchased forward as ofDecember 31, 2016:

Percentage ofCompany'sRequirement(a)201795%201841%2019—%2020—%2021—%

(a)Includes expected coal inventory draw down.

Natural Gas— NRG operates a fleet of mid-merit and peaking natural gas plants across all its U.S. wholesale regions.  Fuel needs are managed on a spot basis, especially for peaking assets, as the Company does not believe it is prudent to forward purchase natural gas for these types of units, the dispatch of which is highly unpredictable.  The Company contracts for natural gas storage services as well as natural gas transportation services to deliver natural gas when needed.

Nuclear Fuel— STP's owners satisfy their fuel supply requirements by: (i) acquiring uranium concentrates and contracting for conversion of the uranium concentrates into uranium hexafluoride; (ii) contracting for enrichment of uranium hexafluoride; and (iii) contracting for fabrication of nuclear fuel assemblies. Through its proportionate participation in STPNOC, which is the NRC-licensed operator of STP and responsible for all aspects of fuel procurement, NRG is party to a number of long-term forward purchase contracts with many of the world's largest suppliers covering STP's requirements for uranium concentrates with only approximately 25% of STP's requirements outstanding for the duration of the operating license.  Similarly, NRG is party to long-term contracts to procure STP's requirements for conversion and enrichment services and fuel fabrication for the life of the operating license.

Retail Operations

In2016, NRG's retail businesses sold electricity to residential, commercial and industrial consumers at either fixed, indexed or variable prices.  Residential and smaller commercial consumers typically contract for terms ranging from one month to two years while industrial contracts are often between one year and five years in length.  In2016, NRG's retail businesses sold approximately61TWhs of electricity. In any given year, the quantity of TWhs sold can be affected by weather, economic conditions and competition.  The wholesale supply is typically purchased as the load is contracted from a combination of NRG's wholesale portfolio and other third parties.  The ability to choose supply from the market or the Company's portfolio allows for an optimal combination to support and stabilize retail margins.










Operational Statistics

The following are industry statistics for the Company's fossil and nuclear plants, as defined by the NERC, and are more fully described below:

Annual Equivalent Availability Factor, or EAF— Measures the percentage of maximum generation available over time as the fraction of net maximum generation that could be provided over a defined period of time after all types of outages and deratings, including seasonal deratings, are taken into account.

Net Heat Rate— The net heat rate represents the total amount of fuel in BTU required to generate one net kWh provided.

Net Capacity Factor— The net amount of electricity that a generating unit produces over a period of time divided by the net amount of electricity it could have produced if it had run at full power over that time period. The net amount of electricity produced is the total amount of electricity generated minus the amount of electricity used during generation.

The tables below present these performance metrics for the Company's U.S. power generation portfolio, including leased facilities and those accounted for through equity method investments, for the years endedDecember 31, 2016and2015:

Seasonality and Price Volatility

Annual and quarterly operating results of the Company's wholesale power generation segments can be significantly affected by weather, including wind resource availability, and energy commodity price volatility.  Significant other events, such as the demand for natural gas, interruptions in fuel supply infrastructure and relative levels of hydroelectric capacity can increase seasonal fuel and power price volatility.  The preceding factors related to seasonality and price volatility are fairly uniform across the Company's wholesale generation business segments.

The sale of electric power to retail customers is also a seasonal business with the demand for power generally peaking during the summer months.  As a result, net working capital requirements for the Company's retail operations generally increase during summer months along with the higher revenues, and then decline during off-peak months.  Weather may impact operating results and extreme weather conditions could materially affect results of operations.  The rates charged to retail customers may be impacted by fluctuations in total power prices and market dynamics like the price of natural gas, transmission constraints, competitor actions, and changes in market heat rates.

Market Framework

Organized Energy Markets in CAISO, ERCOT, ISO-NE, MISO, NYISO and PJM

The majority of NRG's fleet operates in one of the organized energy markets, known as RTOs or ISOs. Each organized market administers day-ahead and real-time centralized bid-based energy and ancillary services markets pursuant to tariffs approved by FERC, or in the case of ERCOT, market rules approved by the PUCT.  These tariffs and rules dictate how the energy markets operate, how market participants make bilateral sales with one another, and how entities with market-based rates are compensated.  Established prices reflect the value of energy at the specific location and time it is delivered, which is known as the Locational Marginal Price, or LMP.  Each market is subject to market mitigation measures designed to limit the exercise of locational market power.  These market structures facilitate NRG's sale of power and capacity products at market-based rates.

Other than ERCOT, each of the ISO regions also operates a capacity or resource adequacy market that provides an opportunity for generating and demand response resources to earn revenues to offset their fixed costs that are not recovered in the energy and ancillary services markets.  The ISOs are also responsible for transmission planning and operations.

Gulf Coast

NRG's Gulf Coast wholesale power generation business is principally located in the ERCOT and MISO markets.  The ERCOT market is one of the nation's largest and historically fastest growing power markets.  ERCOT is an energy only market, and has implemented market rule changes to provide pricing more reflective of higher energy value when operating reserves are scarce or constrained.  NRG also operates generation assets that are principally located within MISO, participating in the MISO day-ahead and real-time energy and ancillary services markets. Additionally, MISO employs a one-year forward resource adequacy construct, in which capacity resources can compete for fixed cost recovery in the capacity auction.  NRG continues to provide full requirements service to LSEs, including cooperatives and municipalities in the MISO region.












East

NRG's generation and demand response assets located in the East region of the U.S. are within the control areas of ISO-NE, NYISO and PJM.  Each of the market regions in the East region provides for robust competition in the day-ahead and real-time energy and ancillary services markets.  Additionally, the East region receives a significant portion of its revenues from capacity markets in ISO-NE, NYISO and PJM.  PJM and ISO-NE use a three-year forward capacity auction construct, while NYISO uses a month-ahead capacity auction construct.  Capacity market prices are sensitive to design parameters, as well as additions of new capacity.  Both ISO-NE and PJM operate a pay-for-performance model where capacity payments are modified based on real-time generator performance.  In such markets, NRG’s actual revenues will be the combination of cleared auction prices times the quantity of MWs cleared, plus the net of any over-performance “bonus payments” and any under-performance charges. In both markets, bidding rules allow for the incorporation of a risk premium into generator bids.

West

NRG operates a fleet of natural gas fired facilities located entirely within the CAISO footprint.  The CAISO operates day-ahead and real-time locational markets for energy and ancillary services, while managing congestion primarily through nodal prices.  The CAISO system facilitates NRG's sale of power, ancillary services and capacity products at market-based rates, either within the CAISO's centralized energy and ancillary service markets or bilaterally pursuant to tolling arrangements or other capacity sales with California's LSEs.  The CPUC also determines capacity requirements for LSEs and for specified local areas utilizing inputs from the CAISO.  Both the CAISO and CPUC rules require LSEs to contract with sufficient generation resources in order to maintain minimum levels of generation within defined local areas.  Additionally, the CAISO has independent authority to contract with needed resources under certain circumstances, typically either when LSEs have failed to procure sufficient resources, or system conditions change unexpectedly. NRG is also pursuing Repowering projects at several southern California sites pursuant to long-term contracts.

Renewables

NRG operates a fleet of utility scale and distributed renewable generating assets across the U.S.  Many states have implemented their own renewable portfolio standards requiring LSEs to provide a given percentage of their energy sales from renewable resources.  As a result, a number of LSEs have entered into long-term PPAs with the NRG's utility scale renewable generating facilities.  There are examples of states increasing their RPS from initially stated levels, such as California’s recently enacted 50% RPS by 2030 and Hawaii’s goal of achieving 100% renewables by 2045. In addition, given the cost competitiveness of renewables, LSEs are procuring renewables in excess of their RPS obligations. In December 2015, the U.S. Congress extended the 30% solar ITC so that projects which begin construction in 2016 through 2019 will continue to qualify for the 30% ITC.  Projects beginning construction in 2020 and 2021 will be eligible for the ITC at the rates of 26% and 22%, respectively.  The same legislation also extended the 10-year wind PTC for wind projects which begin construction in years 2016 through 2019.  Wind projects which begin construction in the years 2017, 2018 and 2019 are eligible for PTC at 80%, 60% and 40% of the statutory rate per kWh, respectively.

Retail










Regulatory Matters

As owners of power plants and participants in wholesale and retail energy markets, certain NRG entities are subject to regulation by various federal and state government agencies.  These include the CFTC, FERC, NRC and the PUCT, as well as other public utility commissions in certain states where NRG's generating, thermal, or distributed generation assets are located.  In addition, NRG is subject to the market rules, procedures and protocols of the various ISO and RTO markets in which it participates.  Likewise, certain NRG entities participating in the retail markets are subject to rules and regulations established by the states in which NRG entities are licensed to sell at retail.  NRG must also comply with the mandatory reliability requirements imposed by NERC and the regional reliability entities in the regions where NRG operates.

NRG's operations within the ERCOT footprint are not subject to rate regulation by FERC, as they are deemed to operate solely within the ERCOT market and not in interstate commerce.  These operations are subject to regulation by the PUCT, as well as to regulation by the NRC with respect to NRG's ownership interest in STP.

Federal Regulation

CFTC

The CFTC, among other things, regulates the trading of swaps, futures and many commodities under the Commodity Exchange Act, or CEA. Since 2010, there have been a number of reforms to the regulation of the derivatives markets, both in the U.S. and internationally.  These regulations, and any further changes thereto, or adoption of additional regulations, including any regulations relating to position limits on futures and other derivatives or margin for derivatives, could negatively impact NRG’s ability to hedge its portfolio in an efficient, cost-effective manner by, among other things, potentially decreasing liquidity in the forward commodity and derivatives markets or limiting NRG’s ability to utilize non-cash collateral for derivatives transactions.

FERC

FERC, among other things, regulates the transmission and the wholesale sale by public utilities of electricity in interstate commerce under the authority of the FPA.  Under existing regulations, FERC determines whether an entity owning a generation facility is an EWG as defined in the PUHCA. FERC also determines whether a generation facility meets the ownership and technical criteria of a QF under PURPA.  The transmission of electric energy occurring wholly within ERCOT is not subject to FERC's rate jurisdiction under Sections 203 or 205 of the FPA.  Each of NRG's non-ERCOT U.S. generating facilities either qualifies as a QF, or the subsidiary owning the facility qualifies as an EWG.

Public utilities are required to obtain FERC's acceptance, pursuant to Section 205 of the FPA, of their rate schedules for the wholesale sale of electricity.  Generally all of NRG's non-QF generating and power marketing entities located outside of ERCOT make sales of electricity pursuant to market-based rates, as opposed to traditional cost-of-service regulated rates.

Current Administration and Changeover at FERC— FERC is currently without a quorum and cannot issue orders in contested proceedings until a new Commissioner is appointed.  FERC’s day-to-day work can continue through authority that has been delegated to FERC Staff.  With a new administration and three vacant positions at FERC, NRG’s business may be affected because its generation fleet is subject to changes in FERC regulatory policy.



State Regulation

In Texas, NRG's operations within the ERCOT footprint are not subject to rate regulation by FERC, as they are deemed to operate solely within the ERCOT market and not in interstate commerce.  These operations are subject to regulation by the PUCT, as well as to regulation by the NRC with respect to NRG's ownership interest in STP.

In New York, NRG's generation subsidiaries are electric corporations subject to "lightened" regulation by the NYSPSC.  As such, the NYSPSC exercises its jurisdictional authority over certain non-rate aspects of the facilities, including safety, retirements, and the issuance of debt secured by recourse to NRG's generation assets located in New York.  NRG currently has blanket authorization from the NYSPSC for the issuance of $15 billion of debt.  Additionally, the NYSPSC has provided GenOn Bowline with a separate debt authorization of $1.488 billion.

In California, NRG's generation subsidiaries are subject to regulation by the CPUC with regard to certain non-rate aspects of the facilities, including health and safety, outage reporting and other aspects of the facilities' operations.  Additionally, the competitiveness of many of NRG's new businesses depends on state competition and other policies.










Nuclear Operations

NRG South Texas LP is a 44% owner of a joint undivided interest in STP, the other owners of STP being the City of Austin, Texas (16%) and the City Public Service Board of San Antonio (40%).  STP Nuclear Operating Company, or STPNOC, was founded by the then-owners in 1997 to operate the plant and it is the operator licensee and holder of the Facility Operating Licenses NPF-76 and NPF-80. STPNOC is a nonstock, nonprofit, nonmember corporation. Each owner of STP appoints a board member (and the three directors then choose a fourth director who also serves as the chief executive officer of STPNOC). A participation agreement establishes an owners' committee with voting interests consistent with ownership interests.

As a holder of an ownership interest in STP, NRG South Texas LP is an NRC licensee and is subject to NRC regulation.  The NRC license gives the Company the right only to possess an interest in STP but not to operate it.  As a possession-only licensee, i.e., non-operating co-owner, the NRC's regulation of NRG South Texas LP is primarily focused on the Company's ability to meet its financial and decommissioning funding assurance obligations.  In connection with the NRC license, the Company and its subsidiaries have a support agreement to provide up to $120 million to support operations at STP.

Decommissioning Trusts— Upon expiration of the operating licenses for the two generating units at STP, currently scheduled for 2027 and 2028, the co-owners of STP are required under federal law to decontaminate and decommission the STP facility.  Under NRC regulations, a power reactor licensee generally must pre-fund the full amount of its estimated NRC decommissioning obligations unless it is a rate-regulated utility, or a state or municipal entity that sets its own rates, or has the benefit of a state-mandated non-bypassable charge available to periodically fund the decommissioning trust such that the trust, plus allowable earnings, will equal the estimated decommissioning obligations by the time the decommissioning is expected to begin.

NRG South Texas LP, through its 44% ownership interest, is the beneficiary of decommissioning trusts that have been established to provide funding for decontamination and decommissioning of STP. CenterPoint and AEP collect, through rates or other authorized charges to their electric utility customers, amounts designated for funding NRG South Texas LP's portion of the decommissioning of the facility. See also Item 15 —Note 6,Nuclear Decommissioning Trust Fund,to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion.

In the event that the funds from the trusts are ultimately determined to be inadequate to decommission the STP facilities, the original owners of the Company's STP interests, CenterPoint and AEP, each will be required to collect, through their PUCT-authorized non-bypassable rates or other charges to customers, additional amounts required to fund NRG South Texas LP's obligations relating to the decommissioning of the facility.  Following the completion of the decommissioning, if surplus funds remain in the decommissioning trusts, those excesses will be refunded to the respective rate payers of CenterPoint or AEP, or their successors.

STP License Amendment— STP Unit 1 was operating with a single-cycle license amendment issued on December 11, 2015 after a control rod was determined to be inoperable following a scheduled refueling and maintenance outage. The approved license amendment to support STP Unit 1 operation with the inoperable control rod and the associated control rod drive shaft removed was granted by the NRC on December 21, 2016.










Regional Regulatory Developments

NRG is affected by rule/tariff changes that occur in the ISO regions.  For further discussion on regulatory developments see Item 15 —Note 23,Regulatory Matters,to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

East Region

PJM

2019/2020 PJM Auction Results— On May 24, 2016, PJM announced the results of its 2019/2020 base residual auction.  NRG cleared approximately 11,155 MW of Capacity Performance product and 371 MW of Base Capacity product in the 2019/2020 base residual auction. NRG’s expected capacity revenues from the base residual auction for the 2019/2020 delivery year are approximately $569 million.

The table below provides a detailed description of NRG’s 2019/2020 base residual auction results from May 24, 2016:

(a) Includes imports. Does not include capacity sold by NRG Curtailment Specialists. Excludes cleared capacity related to Aurora and Rockford, the   sales of which were completed on July 12, 2016.

(b) Includes GenOn.



PJM Capacity Performance Appeals— On or about July 8, 2016, four petitions were filed at the D.C. Circuit seeking review of the FERC orders approving PJM’s Capacity Performance revisions to its forward capacity market after motions for rehearing at FERC were denied on May 10, 2016.  NRG intervened in these matters on July 29, 2016.  On December 9, 2016, NRG, along with other generators and industry trade groups, filed a joint brief in support of FERC's decision. Briefing is complete and oral argument occurred in February 2017. This case governs capacity revenues already received by NRG, as well as the revenues for forward periods.

PJM Seasonal Capacity Proceeding— On November 17, 2016, PJM proposed to enhance the ability of capacity storage resources, intermittent resources, demand response, energy efficiency, and environmentally limited resources, or collectively the seasonal capacity performance resources, to participate in the BRA and qualify as a resource providing the capacity performance product through aggregation.  NRG filed comments specifically supporting PJM’s proposal to modify the aggregation rules to allow seasonal capacity resources to aggregate across LDAs and to allow aggregations through RPM auctions. On January 23, 2017, PJM amended its proposal to address questions from FERC. The outcome of this proceeding could have a material impact on future PJM capacity prices.



Complaints Related to Extension of Base Capacity—In 2015, FERC approved changes to PJM’s capacity market, which included moving from the Base Capacity product to the higher performance Capacity Performance product over the course of a five year transition.  Under this transition, as of the May 2017 BRA, the Base Capacity product will no longer be available.  Several parties have filed complaints at FERC seeking to maintain the RPM Base Capacity product for at least one more delivery year or until such time as PJM develops a model for seasonal resources to participate.  If the transition is delayed, capacity prices could be materially impacted.  The matters are pending at FERC.



MOPR Revisions— On May 2, 2013, FERC accepted PJM's proposal to substantially revise its Minimum Offer Price Rule, or MOPR.  Among other things, FERC approved the portions of the PJM proposal that exempt many new entrants from demonstrating that their proposed projects are economic, as well as providing a similar exemption for public power entities and certain self-supply entities. This exemption is subject to certain conditions designed to limit the financial incentive of such entities to suppress market prices.  On June 3, 2013, NRG filed a request for rehearing of the FERC order and subsequently protested the manner in which PJM proposed to implement the FERC order. On October 15, 2015, FERC denied the requests for rehearing and accepted PJM’s compliance filing.  NRG, along with other parties, filed a petition for review of FERC's decision with the D.C. Circuit. Briefing is complete. The case is pending at the D.C. Circuit.












Illinois Zero Emission Credit Legislation and Related PJM Complaint—Pursuant to legislation in Illinois,the Illinois Power Agency is to procure contracts for Zero Emission Credits, or ZECs, through a process that would take into account environmental benefits, including the preservation of zero emission facilities.  The procurement would be subject to review by the Illinois Commerce Commission.  These ZECs are out-of-market subsidies that threaten to artificially suppress prices in the PJM auctions.  On February 14, 2017, NRG, along with other companies, filed a complaint in the District Court for the Northern District of Illinois; another plaintiff group filed a similar complaint on the same day.



As a result of the ZEC scheme adopted by the Illinois legislature and to address the effect of subsidies set to be paid to Illinois to certain nuclear units, on January 9, 2017, NRG and other generators and its trade association filed a joint amendment to the pending complaint seeking to apply the MOPR in the capacity market to existing resources that receive out-of-market subsidies.  This amendment is to the March 21, 2016 complaint filed by NRG and other companies related to ratepayer-funded subsidies approved by the PUCO.



Midwest Generation, LLC Reactive Power Compensation— On June 21, 2016, FERC issued an order directing MWG to make a compliance filing setting forth refunds for payments received in violation of its 2004 reactive power settlement or to show cause why it has not violated the settlement. FERC also ordered MWG to revise its tariff to reflect the costs of units continuing to provide reactive power or show cause why it should not be required to do so. The Commission also referred this matter to the Commission's Office of Enforcement. On June 30, 2016, MWG filed a revised tariff, and on July 22, 2016, MWG made a compliance filing as ordered by FERC. On October 13, 2016, FERC found that MWG should only be liable for refunds that accrued after bankruptcy on April 1, 2014 through June 30, 2016.   MWG is currently in settlement discussions regarding its revised reactive power schedule. The matter is still pending at the Commission's Office of Enforcement.

New England

2020/2021 ISO-NE Auction Results— On February 6, 2017, ISO-NE announced the results of its 2020/2021 forward capacity auction.  NRG cleared 2,641 MW at $5.297 KW per month providing expected annual capacity revenues of $167.9 million.  The 333 MWs at Canal Unit 3, which previously cleared the tenth forward capacity auction with a seven year price lock at a price of $7.17 KW per month for the 2020/2021 deliverability year, are excluded from these results.



Peak Energy Rent Adjustment Complaint— On September 30, 2016, the New England Power Generators Association, or NEPGA, filed a complaint against ISO-NE asking FERC to find the Peak Energy Rent, or PER, unjust and unreasonable.  On January 9, 2017, FERC granted NEPGA’s complaint requiring a change to how the PER strike price is calculated and determine any refunds during the time period provided for in the complaint. The first FERC-ordered settlement conference occurred on February 16, 2017.

Performance Incentive Proposal— On January 17, 2014, ISO-NE filed at FERC to revise its forward capacity market, or FCM, by making a resource’s forward capacity market compensation dependent on resource output during short intervals of operating reserve scarcity.  The ISO-NE proposal would replace the existing shortage event penalty structure with a new performance incentive mechanism, resulting in capacity payments to resources that would be the combination of two components: (1) a base capacity payment and (2) a performance payment or charge.  The performance payment or charge would be entirely dependent upon the resource’s delivery of energy or operating reserves during scarcity conditions, and could be larger than the base payment.

On May 30, 2014, FERC found that most of the provisions in the ISO-NE proposal, with modifications, together with an increase to the reserve constraint penalty factors, provided a just and reasonable structure. FERC instituted a proceeding for further hearings and required ISO-NE to make a compliance filing to modify its proposal and adopt the increases to the reserve constraint penalty factors. FERC denied rehearing. The NEPGA filed a petition for review of FERC's decision with the D.C. Circuit.  Briefing is complete.

New York

Dunkirk Power Reliability Service and Natural Gas Addition—On February 13, 2014, Dunkirk Power LLC and National Grid agreed to a term sheet for a 10-year agreement to govern the addition of natural gas-burning capabilities to the Dunkirk facility. This term sheet, known as the DNG Agreement Term Sheet, was approved by the NYSPSC on June 13, 2014. On February 27, 2015, Entergy filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of New York alleging that the NYSPSC’s approval of the DNG Agreement Term Sheet impermissibly interfered with FERC’s exclusive jurisdiction over the wholesale markets. Entergy moved to withdraw the lawsuit, and on November 18, 2016, the U.S. District Court dismissed the lawsuit with prejudice.












New York Clean Energy Standard and Zero Emission Credit Nuclear Bailout— On August 1, 2016, the NYSPSC issued its Clean Energy Standard, or CES, order.  The CES order included three main components: (i) a commitment to move New York to 50% renewables by 2030; (ii) new renewable energy credit pricing for both new and existing renewable facilities; and (iii) a ZEC that would provide more than $7.6 billion over 12 years in out-of-market subsidy payments to certain selected nuclear generating units in the state. The stated purpose of the ZECs is to keep nuclear units running even though they would be uneconomic and likely retire if they received compensation only from the FERC-jurisdictional wholesale power market.  The ZECs would have the effect of suppressing wholesale market prices and interfere with the wholesale market.  On October 19, 2016, NRG, along with other entities, filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, challenging the validity of the NYSPSC action and the ZEC program. On December 9, 2016, Exelon, the NYSPSC and other parties filed a motion to dismiss the complaint. On January 6, 2017, NRG, along with other parties, filed an opposition to the motions to dismiss. The motions are pending before the U.S. District Court.

Independent Power Producers of New York (IPPNY) Complaint— On January 9, 2017, EPSA requested FERC to promptly direct the NYISO to file tariff provisions to address pending market concerns related to out of market payments to existing generation in the NYISO.  This request was prompted by the ZEC program initiated by the NYSPSC.  This request follows IPPNY’s complaint at FERC against the NYISO on May 10, 2013, as amended on March 25, 2014.  The generators asked FERC to direct the NYISO to require that capacity from existing generation resources that would have exited the market but for out-of-market payments. Failure to implement buyer-side mitigation measures could result in uneconomic entry, which artificially decreases capacity prices below competitive market levels.

New York Public Service Commission Retail Energy Market Proceedings— On February 23, 2016, the NYSPSC issued what it refers to as its “Retail Reset” order, or Reset Order, in docket 12-M-0476et al.  Among other things, the Reset Order instituted a price cap on energy supply offers and required many retail providers to seek affirmative consent from certain retail customers over a very short period of time to retain those customers.  Retail suppliers who cannot meet these conditions will be required to return their customers to energy supply service provided by the local utility. On July 25, 2016, the New York Supreme Court vacated part of the Reset Order on procedural grounds and remanded the matter to the NYSPSC for further consideration. Additionally, the Court affirmed the NYSPSC’s authority to regulate Energy Service Companies prices.  The matter is now on appeal before the Supreme Court of New York, Appellate Division. On December 2, 2016 in the same docket, the NYSPSC issued notice of an evidentiary proceeding and collaborative process to determine the future structure of the retail energy market in New York.  The outcome of this evidentiary and collaborative process, combined with the outcome of the appeal of the Reset Order, could affect the viability of the New York retail energy market.

ERCOT

Greens Bayou Unit 5 RMR Status— On March 29, 2016, NRG filed notice with ERCOT of its intent to mothball Greens Bayou Unit 5.  On May 27, 2016, ERCOT made a final determination that the unit is needed for reliability must-run, or RMR, service to address potential operational contingencies. On June 14, 2016, the ERCOT Board confirmed ERCOT’s determination and approved a two-year RMR agreement, effective June 1, 2016 through June 30, 2018; provided, however, ERCOT may terminate the RMR agreement at any time upon 90 days' notice.  ERCOT has a standard form contract that provides for recovery of the operating costs of the unit, together with additional performance metrics and incentives.  The estimated budget for the unit is $58 million for the contract period, which amount does not include any incentives.  Under the RMR agreement, the unit is only available to ERCOT during the months of June through September.  On July 13, 2016, ERCOT issued a request for proposals for alternatives to the RMR agreement. No alternatives were selected by ERCOT. As a result of rule changes, ERCOT determined that the RMR agreement is only needed until a new 1,100 MW combined cycle plant at Colorado Bend Generating Station comes on line, expected in mid-2017.



MISO

Revisions to MISO Capacity Construct— On November 20, 2015, FERC issued a final order denying NRG’s request for rehearing of a 2012 FERC order approving the MISO capacity construct.  NRG filed a petition for review of FERC’s decision with the D.C. Circuit on the grounds that FERC’s order denies merchant generators in MISO’s footprint any reasonable opportunity to recover their fixed costs.  On November 2, 2016, NRG filed its initial brief and briefing continues.  The eventual outcome of this proceeding could impact MISO’s attempts to redesign its capacity markets and thereby affect the value of NRG’s uncontracted assets within the MISO footprint.












MISO Forward Capacity Market Design for Retail Choice States— MISO staff has proposed revisions to its market design by implementing a three-year Forward Resource Auction for Illinois and the portion of Michigan with Retail Choice Load with a Sloped Demand Curve.  On November 1, 2016, MISO filed its proposal with FERC. On December 14, 2016, NRG filed a protest to MISO’s proposal.  On February 2, 2017, FERC rejected MISO’s proposal.



West Region

CAISO

Carlsbad Energy Center— On May 21, 2015, the CPUC approved the Carlsbad Energy Center PPTA for a nominally rated 500 MW five unit natural gas peaking plant. On December 7, 2015, three parties filed two petitions for a writ of review with the California Court of Appeal appealing the CPUC's decision. On November 30, 2016, the California Court of Appeals issued a decision affirming the CPUC's approval of the PPTA.  The period in which to seek review of that decision in the California Supreme Court has passed, and the CPUC’s decision is now final.

Puente Power Project— On May 26, 2016, the CPUC approved the resource adequacy purchase agreement, or RAPA, between SCE and NRG for the construction of the 262 MW natural gas peaking Puente Power Project. On July 1, 2016, four different parties sought rehearing of the CPUC's approval of the RAPA. On December 1, 2016, the CPUC affirmed approval of the RAPA in a rehearing decision. On January 4, 2017, a petition for writ of review was filed in the California Court of Appeal seeking to reverse the CPUC's approval of the RAPA.

Environmental Matters

NRG is subject to a wide range of environmental laws in the development, construction, ownership and operation of projects. These laws generally require that governmental permits and approvals be obtained before construction and during operation of power plants. NRG is also subject to laws regarding the protection of wildlife, including migratory birds, eagles and threatened and endangered species. New requirements regarding GHGs, combustion byproducts, water discharge and use, and threatened and endangered species have been put in place in recent years. Future laws may require the addition of emissions controls or other environmental controls or impose restrictions on the operations of the Company's facilities, which could have a material effect on the Company's operations. Complying with environmental laws involves significant capital and operating expenses. NRG decides to invest capital for environmental controls based on the relative certainty of the requirements, an evaluation of compliance options, and the expected economic returns on capital.

A number of regulations with the potential to affect the Company and its facilities are in development, under review or have been recently promulgated by the EPA, including ESPS/NSPS for GHGs, ash disposal requirements, NAAQS revisions and implementation and effluent guidelines.  NRG is currently reviewing the outcome and any resulting impact of recently promulgated regulations and cannot fully predict such impact until legal challenges are resolved and the new presidential administration decides how to proceed with some of the more controversial regulations. Federal and state environmental laws generally have become more stringent over time, although this trend could change in the near term with respect to federal laws under the new U.S. presidential administration.

Air

The CAA and the resulting regulations (as well as similar state and local requirements) have the potential to affect air emissions, operating practices and pollution control equipment required at power plants.  Under the CAA, the EPA sets NAAQS for certain pollutants including SO2, ozone, and PM2.5.  Many of the Company's facilities are located in or near areas that are classified by the EPA as not achieving certain NAAQS (non-attainment areas).  The relevant NAAQS have historically become more stringent.  The Company maintains a comprehensive compliance strategy to address continuing and new requirements.  Complying with increasingly stringent NAAQS could require the installation of additional emissions control equipment at some NRG facilities or retiring of units if installing such controls is not economical.  Significant changes to air regulatory programs affecting the Company are described below.

Ozone NAAQS— On October 26, 2015, the EPA promulgated a rule that reduces the ozone NAAQS to 0.070 ppm.  If it survives legal challenges, this more stringent NAAQS will obligate the states to develop plans to reduce NOx(an ozone precursor), which could affect some of the Company's units.










Cross-State Air Pollution Rule

— The EPA finalized CSAPR in 2011, which was intended to replace CAIR in January 2012, to address certain states' obligations to reduce emissions so that downwind states can achieve federal air quality standards. In December 2011, the D.C. Circuit stayed the implementation of CSAPR and then vacated CSAPR in August 2012 but kept CAIR in place until the EPA could replace it. In April 2014, the U.S. Supreme Court reversed and remanded the D.C. Circuit's decision. In October 2014, the D.C. Circuit lifted the stay of CSAPR. In response, the EPA in November 2014 amended the CSAPR compliance dates. Accordingly, CSAPR replaced CAIR on January 1, 2015. On July 28, 2015, the D.C. Circuit held that the EPA had exceeded its authority by requiring certain reductions that were not necessary for downwind states to achieve federal standards. Although the D.C. Circuit kept the rule in place, the court ordered the EPA to revise the Phase 2 (or 2017) (i) SO


budgets for four states including Texas and (ii) ozone-season NO

budgets for 11 states including Maryland, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Texas. On October 26, 2016, the EPA finalized the CSAPR Update Rule, which reduces future NO

x

allocations and discounts the current banked allowances to account for the more stringent 2008 Ozone NAAQS and to address the D.C. Circuit's July 2015 decision. This rule has been challenged in the D.C. Circuit. The Company believes its investment in pollution controls and cleaner technologies leave the fleet well-positioned for compliance.

MATS— In February 2012, the EPA promulgated standards (the MATS rule) to control emissions of HAPs from coal and oil-fired electric generating units. The rule established limits for mercury, non-mercury metals, certain organics and acid gases, which had to be met beginning in April 2015 (with some units getting a 1-year extension). In June 2015, the U.S. Supreme Court issued a decision in the case ofMichigan v. EPA, and held that the EPA unreasonably refused to consider costs when it determined that it was "appropriate and necessary" to regulate HAPs emitted by electric generating units. The U.S. Supreme Court did not vacate the MATS rule but rather remanded it to the D.C. Circuit for further proceedings. In December 2015, the D.C. Circuit remanded the MATS rule to the EPA without vacatur. On April 25, 2016, the EPA released a supplemental finding that the benefits of this regulation outweigh the costs to address the U.S. Supreme Court's ruling that the EPA had not properly considered costs. This finding has been challenged in the D.C. Circuit. While NRG cannot predict the final outcome of this rulemaking, NRG believes that because it has already invested in pollution controls and cleaner technologies, the fleet is well-positioned to comply with the MATS rule.

Clean Power Plan— The attention in recent years on GHG emissions has resulted in federal regulations and state legislative and regulatory action. In October 2015, the EPA finalized the Clean Power Plan, or CPP, addressing GHG emissions from existing EGUs. On February 9, 2016, the U.S. Supreme Court stayed the CPP. The D.C. Circuit, sittingen banc, heard oral argument on the legal challenges to the CPP in September 2016. Due to the ongoing litigation and the potential impact of the new U.S. presidential administration, the Company believes the CPP is not likely to survive.










CO2Emissions— NRG emits CO2when generating electricity at most of its facilities. The graphs presented below illustrate NRG's U.S. Scope 1 emissions of CO2efor 2014, 2015 and 2016. The percentage of Scope 1 emissions covered under emissions-limiting regulations is 18% and the percentage of Scope 1 emissions covered under emission-reporting regulations is 82%. NRG anticipates reductions in its future emissions profile as the Company modernizes the fleet through repowering, improves generation efficiencies, and explores methods to capture CO2. From 2015 to 2016, the Company's CO2eemissions decreased from 86 million metric tons to approximately 66 million metric tons, representing a 19% reduction year over year. Factors leading to the decreased emissions include reductions in fleetwide annual net generation due to an overall decrease in market demand and a market-driven shift towards increased generation from natural gas over coal. The Company's goal is to reduce its total U.S. Scope 1, 2 and 3 CO2eemissions by 50% by 2030, and 90% by 2050, using 2014 as a baseline.



The effects from federal, regional or state regulation of GHGs on the Company's financial performance will depend on a number of factors, including the outcome of the legal challenges, regulatory design, level of GHG reductions, the availability of offsets, actions of the new U.S. presidential administration, and the extent to which NRG would be entitled to receive CO2emissions credits without having to purchase them in an auction or on the open market.  Thereafter, under any such legislation or regulation, the impact on NRG would depend on the Company's level of success in developing and deploying low and no carbon technologies.

Byproducts, Wastes, Hazardous Materials and Contamination

In April 2015, the EPA finalized the rule regulating byproducts of coal combustion (e.g., ash and gypsum) as solid wastes under the RCRA. The Company has evaluated the impact of the new rule on the Company's consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows and has accrued its environmental and asset retirement obligations under the rule based on current estimates as of December 31, 2016.














Domestic Site Remediation Matters

Under certain federal, state and local environmental laws, a current or previous owner or operator of any facility, including an electric generating facility, may be required to investigate and remediate releases or threatened releases of hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum products at the facility. NRG may be responsible for property damage, personal injury and investigation and remediation costs incurred by a party in connection with hazardous material releases or threatened releases.  These laws, including the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 as amended by the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act of 1986, or SARA, impose liability without regard to whether the owner knew of or caused the presence of the hazardous substances, and the courts have interpreted liability under such laws to be strict (without fault) and joint and several.  Cleanup obligations can often be triggered during the closure or decommissioning of a facility, in addition to spills during its operations.  Further discussions of affected NRG sites can be found in Item 15 —Note 24,Environmental Matters, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Nuclear Waste— The federal government's program to construct a nuclear waste repository at Yucca Mountain, Nevada was discontinued in 2010. Since 1998, the U.S. DOE has been in default of the federal government's obligations to begin accepting spent nuclear fuel, or SNF, and high-level radioactive waste, or HLW, under the U.S. Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982, or the Nuclear Waste Policy Act. Owners of nuclear plants, including the owners of STP, had been required to enter into contracts setting out the obligations of the owners and the U.S. DOE, including the fees to be paid by the owners for the U.S. DOE's services to license a spent fuel repository. Effective May 16, 2014, the U.S. DOE stopped collecting the fees.

On February 5, 2013, STPNOC entered into a settlement agreement with the U.S. DOE for payment of damages relating to the U.S. DOE's failure to accept SNF and HLW under the Nuclear Waste Policy Act through December 31, 2013, which was extended through an addendum dated January 24, 2014, to December 31, 2016.  On December 12, 2016, STPNOC received the federal government's offer of another three-year extension of payment for continued failure to accept SNF and HLW.  The proposal has been reviewed for adequacy and, with advice of counsel, was accepted. There are no facilities for the reprocessing or permanent disposal of SNF currently in operation in the U.S., nor has the NRC licensed any such facilities. STPNOC currently stores all SNF generated by its nuclear generating facilities in on-site storage pools.  Since STPNOC's SNF storage pools do not have sufficient storage capacity for the life of the units, STPNOC is proceeding to construct dry cask storage capability on-site. STPNOC plans to continue to assert claims against the U.S. DOE for damages relating to the U.S. DOE's failure to accept SNF and HLW.

Under the federal Low-Level Radioactive Waste Policy Act of 1980, as amended, the state of Texas is required to provide, either on its own or jointly with other states in a compact, for the disposal of all low-level radioactive waste generated within the state.  STP's warehouse capacity is adequate for on-site storage until a site in Andrews County, Texas becomes fully operational.

Water

Clean Water Act—The Company is required under the CWA to comply with intake and discharge requirements, requirements for technological controls and operating practices.  As with air quality regulations, federal and state water regulations have become more stringent and imposed new requirements.

Once Through Cooling Regulation— In August 2014, EPA finalized the regulation regarding the use of water for once through cooling at existing facilities to address impingement and entrainment concerns.  NRG anticipates that more stringent requirements will be incorporated into some of its water discharge permits over the next several years as NPDES permits are renewed.

Effluent Limitations Guidelines— In November 2015, the EPA revised the Effluent Limitations Guidelines for Steam Electric Generating Facilities, which will impose more stringent requirements (as individual permits are renewed) for wastewater streams from flue gas desulfurization, fly ash, bottom ash, and flue gas mercury control.  The Company estimates that it would cost approximately $200 million over the next eight years (the majority of the cost would be incurred after 2019) to comply with this rule at 11 coal-fired plants.  This regulation has been challenged and is subject to legal uncertainty.  The change in U.S. presidential administration increases the likelihood that the legal challenges will succeed. The Company decides to invest capital for environmental controls based on: the certainty of regulations; evaluation of different technologies; options to convert to gas; and the expected economic returns on the capital.  Over the next several years, the Company will decide whether to proceed with these investments at each of the plants as permits are renewed based on, among other things, the legal certainty of the regulation and market conditions at that time.










Regional Environmental Developments

East Region

New Source Review— The EPA and various states have been investigating compliance of electric generating facilities with the pre-construction permitting requirements of the CAA known as “new source review,” or NSR.  In 2007, Midwest Generation received an NOV from the EPA alleging that past work at Crawford, Fisk, Joliet, Powerton, Waukegan and Will County generating stations violated NSR and other regulations. These alleged violations are the subject of litigation described in Item 15 — Note 22,Commitments and Contingencies.In January 2009, GenOn received an NOV from the EPA alleging that past work at Keystone, Portland and Shawville generating stations violated regulations regarding NSR.  In June 2011, GenOn received an NOV from the EPA alleging that past work at Avon Lake and Niles generating stations violated NSR.  In December 2007, the NJDEP filed suit alleging that NSR violations occurred at the Portland generating station, which suit was resolved pursuant to a July 2013 Consent Decree.  Additionally, in April 2013, the Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection issued four NOVs alleging that past work at oil-fired combustion turbines at the Torrington Terminal, Franklin, Branford and Middletown generating stations violated regulations regarding NSR.

Burton Island Old Ash Landfill— In January 2006, NRG's Indian River Power LLC was notified that it may be a potentially responsible party with respect to Burton Island Old Ash Landfill, a historic captive landfill located at the Indian River facility.  On October 1, 2007, NRG signed an agreement with DNREC to investigate the site through the Voluntary Clean-up Program, or the VCP.  On February 4, 2008, DNREC issued findings that no further action was required in relation to surface water and that a previously planned shoreline stabilization project would satisfactorily address shoreline erosion.  The landfill itself required a Remedial Investigation and Feasibility Study to determine the type and scope of any additional required work.  DNREC approved the Feasibility Study in December 2012.  In January 2013, DNREC proposed a remediation plan based on the Feasibility Study.  The remediation plan was approved in October 2013.  In December 2015, DNREC approved the Company's remediation design and the Company's Long Term Stewardship Plan. The cost of completing the work required by the approved remediation plan is consistent with amounts budgeted in early 2016 and on track for completion in 2017.  The estimated cost to comply with the Long-Term Stewardship Plan was added to the liability in December 2016.

In addition to the VCP, on May 29, 2008, DNREC requested that NRG's Indian River Power LLC participate in the development and performance of a Natural Resource Damage Assessment at the Burton Island Old Ash Landfill.  NRG is currently working with DNREC and other trustees to close out the assessment process.

RGGI —The Company operates generating units in Connecticut, Delaware, Maryland, Massachusetts, and New York that are subject to RGGI, which is a regional cap and trade system. In 2013, each of these states finalized a rule that reduced and will continue to reduce the number of allowances through 2020. The nine RGGI states are re-evaluating the program and may alter the rules to further reduce the number of allowances. The revisions being currently contemplated could adversely impact NRG's results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

Massachusetts Global Warming Solutions Act Proposed Regulation—In May 2016, the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court held that Massachusetts DEP had not complied with the 2008 Global Warming Solutions Act, which requires establishing limits for sources of GHGs. The Court held that participation in RGGI was not sufficient.  In December 2016, the Massachusetts DEP proposed a regulation that would limit GHG emissions from large electric generating facilities located in Massachusetts.  A final regulation is expected by August 2017.  If promulgated in its current form, the regulation may limit the operations of affected facilities.

Gulf Coast Region

Texas Regional Haze— In January 2016, the EPA promulgated a final rule that requires 15 coal-fired units (at eight plants in Texas) to reduce their SO2rates at various times over the next five years if the rule survives legal challenges.  This Regional Haze rule was promulgated under the portion of the CAA that seeks to improve visibility at national parks.  Eight of these 15 units already have scrubbers and seven do not.  NRG owns two of the affected units, Limestone units 1 and 2, which already have scrubbers.  The rule requires that the Limestone units reduce their SO2emission rates by 2019.  In July 2016, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit stayed the rule pending resolution of the legal challenges. On December 2, 2016, the EPA filed a motion in the Fifth Circuit for partial voluntary remand and partial lifting of the stay, but did not request vacatur of the final rule.














Illinois Union Insurance Company Litigation— On October 2, 2015, the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Louisiana issued an order granting LaGen’s motion for summary judgment on its claims for declaratory judgment and breach of contract against ILU for its failure to indemnify LaGen for the costs LaGen paid pursuant to the consent decree that resolved the NSR lawsuit which was brought by the U.S. EPA and LA DEQ against LaGen related to Big Cajun II. The court entered judgment in favor of LaGen for approximately $27 million. In addition, the court ruled that LaGen is entitled to approximately $7 million for future consent decree costs as they are incurred. On October 14, 2015, ILU filed a motion to stay execution of the judgment, which was granted on October 19, 2015. Also, on October 14, 2015, ILU filed a notice to appeal the judgment. On January 14, 2016, the U.S. District Court granted LaGen's motion for attorney's fees of approximately $2 million for the indemnity phase of the litigation. On January 29, 2016, ILU filed an appeal brief with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. The Court of Appeals issued a decision on August 4, 2016 which vacated the summary judgment ruling and remanded the case to the U.S. District Court. The remanded case has been set for trial on May 8, 2017.

Environmental Capital Expenditures

NRG estimates that environmental capital expenditures from 2017 through 2021 required to comply with environmental laws will be approximately $134 million which includes $61 million for GenOn and $42 million for Midwest Generation.  These costs are primarily associated with the cost of complying with anticipated ELG requirements.

Customers

NRG sells to a wide variety of customers. No individual customer accounted for 10% or more of NRG's total revenue in 2016. The Company owns and operates power plants to generate and sell power to wholesale customers such as utilities and other intermediaries. The Company also directly sells to end-use customers in the residential, commercial and industrial sectors.  NRG also receives significant revenues from PJM in its capacity as the regional transmission organization for the PJM footprint.

Employees

As ofDecember 31, 2016, NRG and its consolidated subsidiaries, including GenOn and NRG Yield, Inc., had 8,763, employees, approximately30%of whom were covered by U.S. bargaining agreements.  During2016, the Company did not experience any labor stoppages or labor disputes at any of its facilities.

Available Information

NRG's annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act are available free of charge through the Company's website,www.nrg.com, as soon as reasonably practicable after they are electronically filed with, or furnished to, the SEC.  The Company also routinely posts press releases, presentations, webcasts, and other information regarding the Company on the Company's website.












Item 1A — Risk Factors Related to NRG Energy, Inc.

Risks Related to the Operation of NRG's Business

There is substantial doubt about GenOn's ability continue as a going concern.  GenOn’s inability to continue as a going concern could have a material impact on the Company.



As disclosed in Item 15 - Note 1,Nature of Business,and Note 12,Debt and Capital Leases,to this Form 10-K, as of December 31, 2016, $691 million of GenOn's Senior Notes outstanding, excluding $8 million of associated premiums, are current within the GenOn consolidated balance sheet and are due on June 15, 2017.  GenOn's future profitability continues to be adversely affected by (i) a sustained decline in natural gas prices and its resulting effect on wholesale power prices and capacity prices, and (ii) the inability of GenOn Mid-Atlantic and REMA to make distributions of cash and certain other restricted payments to GenOn.  Based on current projections, GenOn is not expected to have sufficient liquidity exclusive of cash subject to the restrictions under the GenOn Mid-Atlantic and REMA operating leases to repay the GenOn Senior Notes due in June 2017.  As a result, there is substantial doubt about GenOn's ability to continue as a going concern.  As a result of the substantial doubt about GenOn’s ability to continue as a going concern, along with additional factors, there is substantial doubt about certain of GenOn’s subsidiaries’ ability to continue as a going concern.

As of December 31, 2016, GenOn has consolidated cash and cash equivalents of $1.0 billion, of which $471 million and $100 million is held by GenOn Mid-Atlantic and REMA, respectively.  Under their respective operating leases, GenOn Mid-Atlantic and REMA are not permitted to make any distributions and other restricted payments unless: (a) they satisfy the fixed charge coverage ratio for the most recently ended period for four fiscal quarters; (b) they are projected to satisfy the fixed charge coverage ratio for each of the two following periods of four fiscal quarters, commencing with the fiscal quarter in which such payment is proposed to be made; and (c) no significant lease default or event of default has occurred and is continuing.  Additionally, GenOn Mid-Atlantic and REMA must be in compliance with the requirement to provide credit support to the owner lessors securing their obligations to pay scheduled rent under their respective leases.  As a result, GenOn Mid-Atlantic has not been able to make distributions of cash and certain other restricted payments since the quarter ended March 31, 2014 which was the last quarterly period for which GenOn Mid-Atlantic satisfied the conditions under its operating agreement.  REMA has not satisfied the conditions under its operating agreement to make distributions of cash and certain other restricted payments since GenOn was acquired by NRG in December 2012.

The Company, GenOn's parent company, has no obligation to provide any financial support to GenOn other than under the secured intercompany revolving credit agreement between the Company and GenOn and NRG Americas. As of December 31, 2016, $228 million was available to be used by GenOn under the $500 million revolving credit agreement. As controlled group members, ERISA requires that NRG and GenOn are jointly and severally liable for the NRG Pension Plan for Bargained Employees and the NRG Pension Plan, including the pension liabilities associated with GenOn employees.



GenOn is currently considering all options available to it, including negotiations with creditors, refinancing the GenOn Senior Notes, potential sales of certain generating assets as well as the possibility for a need to file for protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.  During 2016, GenOn appointed two independent directors, retained advisors and established a separate audit committee as part of this process.

The Company cannot assure you that GenOn’s inability to continue as a going concern will not have a material impact on the Company's statement of operations, cash flows and financial position including, among other things, if GenOn were to file for bankruptcy protection.



As of December 31, 2016, GenOn represents 15.6% of the Company's consolidated total assets, 16.9% of the Company's consolidated total liabilities and contributed $94 million to the Company's consolidated cash from operations in 2016.














NRG's financial performance may be impacted by price fluctuations in the wholesale power and natural gas, coal and oil markets and other market factors that are beyond the Company's control.

Market prices for power, capacity, ancillary services, natural gas, coal and oil are unpredictable and tend to fluctuate substantially. Unlike most other commodities, electric power can only be stored on a very limited basis and generally must be produced concurrently with its use. As a result, power prices are subject to significant volatility due to supply and demand imbalances, especially in the day-ahead and spot markets. Long- and short-term power prices may also fluctuate substantially due to other factors outside of the Company's control, including:

•changes in generation capacity in the Company’s markets, including the addition of new supplies of power as a result of the development of new plants, expansion of existing plants, the continued operation of uneconomic power plants due to state subsidies, or additional transmission capacity;

•environmental regulations and legislation;

•electric supply disruptions, including plant outages and transmission disruptions;

•changes in power transmission infrastructure;

•fuel transportation capacity constraints or inefficiencies;

•weather conditions, including extreme weather conditions and seasonal fluctuations, including the effects of climate change;

•changes in commodity prices and the supply of commodities, including but not limited to natural gas, coal and oil;

•changes in the demand for power or in patterns of power usage, including the potential development of demand-side management tools and practices, distributed generation, and more efficient end-use technologies;

•development of new fuels, new technologies and new forms of competition for the production of power;

•fuel price volatility;

•economic and political conditions;

•regulations and actions of the ISOs and RTOs;

•federal and state power regulations and legislation;

•changes in law, including judicial decisions;

•changes in prices related to RECs; and

•changes in capacity prices and capacity markets.

Such factors and the associated fluctuations in power prices have affected the Company's wholesale power operating results in the past and will continue to do so in the future.

Many of NRG's power generation facilities operate, wholly or partially, without long-term power sale agreements.

Many of NRG's facilities operate as "merchant" facilities without long-term power sales agreements for some or all of their generating capacity and output and therefore are exposed to market fluctuations. Without the benefit of long-term power sales agreements for these assets, NRG cannot be sure that it will be able to sell any or all of the power generated by these facilities at commercially attractive rates or that these facilities will be able to operate profitably. This could lead to future impairments of the Company's property, plant and equipment or to the closing of certain of its facilities, resulting in economic losses and liabilities, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.

NRG's costs, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be adversely impacted by disruption of its fuel supplies.

NRG relies on natural gas, coal and oil to fuel a majority of its power generation facilities. Delivery of these fuels to the facilities is dependent upon the continuing financial viability of contractual counterparties as well as upon the infrastructure (including rail lines, rail cars, barge facilities, roadways, riverways and natural gas pipelines) available to serve each generation facility. As a result, the Company is subject to the risks of disruptions or curtailments in the production of power at its generation facilities if no fuel is available at any price or if a counterparty fails to perform or if there is a disruption in the fuel delivery infrastructure.










NRG has sold forward a substantial portion of its coal and nuclear power in order to lock in long-term prices that it deemed to be favorable at the time it entered into the forward power sales contracts. In order to hedge its obligations under these forward power sales contracts, the Company has entered into long-term and short-term contracts for the purchase and delivery of fuel. Many of the forward power sales contracts do not allow the Company to pass through changes in fuel costs or discharge the power sale obligations in the case of a disruption in fuel supply due to force majeure events or the default of a fuel supplier or transporter. Disruptions in the Company's fuel supplies may therefore require it to find alternative fuel sources at higher costs, to find other sources of power to deliver to counterparties at a higher cost, or to pay damages to counterparties for failure to deliver power as contracted. Any such event could have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial performance.

NRG also buys significant quantities of fuel on a short-term or spot market basis. Prices for all of the Company's fuels fluctuate, sometimes rising or falling significantly over a relatively short period of time. The price NRG can obtain for the sale of energy may not rise at the same rate, or may not rise at all, to match a rise in fuel or delivery costs. This may have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial performance. Changes in market prices for natural gas, coal and oil may result from the following:

•weather conditions;

•seasonality;

•demand for energy commodities and general economic conditions;

•disruption or other constraints or inefficiencies of electricity, gas or coal transmission or transportation;

•additional generating capacity;

•availability and levels of storage and inventory for fuel stocks;

•natural gas, crude oil, refined products and coal production levels;

•changes in market liquidity;

•federal, state and foreign governmental regulation and legislation; and

•the creditworthiness and liquidity and willingness of fuel suppliers/transporters to do business with the Company.

NRG's plant operating characteristics and equipment, particularly at its coal-fired plants, often dictate the specific fuel quality to be combusted. The availability and price of specific fuel qualities may vary due to supplier financial or operational disruptions, transportation disruptions and force majeure. At times, coal of specific quality may not be available at any price, or the Company may not be able to transport such coal to its facilities on a timely basis. In this case, the Company may not be able to run the coal facility even if it would be profitable. Operating a coal facility with different quality coal can lead to emission or operating problems. If the Company had sold forward the power from such a coal facility, it could be required to supply or purchase power from alternate sources, perhaps at a loss. This could have a material adverse impact on the financial results of specific plants and on the Company's results of operations.

Changes in the price of coal and natural gas could cause the Company to hold excess coal inventories and incur contract termination costs.

Low natural gas prices can cause natural gas to be the more cost-competitive fuel compared to coal for generating electricity. Because the Company enters into guaranteed supply contracts to provide for the amount of coal needed to operate its base load coal-fired generating facilities, the Company may experience periods where it holds excess amounts of coal if fuel pricing results in the Company reducing or idling coal-fired generating facilities. In addition, the Company may incur costs to terminate supply contracts for coal in excess of its generating requirements.










Volatile power supply costs and demand for power could adversely affect the financial performance of NRG's retail businesses.

Although NRG is the primary provider of its retail businesses' wholesale electricity supply requirements, the retail businesses purchase a significant portion of their supply requirements from third parties. As a result, financial performance depends on the ability to obtain adequate supplies of electric generation from third parties at prices below the prices it charges its customers. Consequently, the Company's earnings and cash flows could be adversely affected in any period in which the retail businesses' wholesale electricity supply costs rise at a greater rate than the rates it charges to customers. The price of wholesale electricity supply purchases associated with the retail businesses' energy commitments can be different than that reflected in the rates charged to customers due to, among other factors:

•varying supply procurement contracts used and the timing of entering into related contracts;

•subsequent changes in the overall price of natural gas;

•daily, monthly or seasonal fluctuations in the price of natural gas relative to the 12-month forward prices;

•transmission constraints and the Company's ability to move power to its customers; and

•changes in market heat rate (i.e., the relationship between power and natural gas prices).

The retail businesses' earnings and cash flows could also be adversely affected in any period in which its customers' actual usage of electricity significantly varies from the forecasted usage, which could occur due to, among other factors, weather events, competition and economic conditions.

There may be periods when NRG will not be able to meet its commitments under forward sale obligations at a reasonable cost or at all.

A substantial portion of the output from NRG's coal and nuclear facilities has been sold forward under fixed price power sales contracts through 2017 and the Company also sells forward the output from its intermediate and peaking facilities when it deems it commercially advantageous to do so. The Company also sells fixed price gas as a proxy for power. Because the obligations under most of these agreements are not contingent on a unit being available to generate power, NRG is generally required to deliver power to the buyer, even in the event of a plant outage, fuel supply disruption or a reduction in the available capacity of the unit. To the extent that the Company does not have sufficient lower cost capacity to meet its commitments under its forward sale obligations, the Company would be required to supply replacement power either by running its other, higher cost power plants or by obtaining power from third-party sources at market prices that could substantially exceed the contract price. If NRG fails to deliver the contracted power, it would be required to pay the difference between the market price at the delivery point and the contract price, and the amount of such payments could be substantial.

In the Gulf Coast region, NRG has long-term contracts with rural cooperatives that require it to serve all of the cooperatives' requirements at prices for energy that generally reflect the cost of coal-fired generation.  On December 19, 2013, the Entergy region joined the MISO RTO, which employs a two settlement market in which NRG submits bids for energy to cover its load obligations and submits offers to sell energy from its resources.  Given the “full requirements” obligation contained in the cooperative contracts, and the possibility of unplanned forced outages of its generation, NRG may be exposed to locational market prices as a net buyer of energy for certain periods, which could have a negative impact on NRG's financial returns from its Gulf Coast region.

NRG's trading operations and use of hedging agreements could result in financial losses that negatively impact its results of operations.

The Company typically enters into hedging agreements, including contracts to purchase or sell commodities at future dates and at fixed prices, in order to manage the commodity price risks inherent in its power generation operations. These activities, although intended to mitigate price volatility, expose the Company to other risks. When the Company sells power forward, it gives up the opportunity to sell power at higher prices in the future, which not only may result in lost opportunity costs but also may require the Company to post significant amounts of cash collateral or other credit support to its counterparties. The Company also relies on counterparty performance under its hedging agreements and is exposed to the credit quality of its counterparties under those agreements. Further, if the values of the financial contracts change in a manner that the Company does not anticipate, or if a counterparty fails to perform under a contract, it could harm the Company's business, operating results or financial position.

NRG does not typically hedge the entire exposure of its operations against commodity price volatility. To the extent it does not hedge against commodity price volatility, the Company's results of operations and financial position may be improved or diminished based upon movement in commodity prices.










NRG may engage in trading activities, including the trading of power, fuel and emissions allowances that are not directly related to the operation of the Company's generation facilities or the management of related risks. These trading activities take place in volatile markets and some of these trades could be characterized as speculative. The Company would expect to settle these trades financially rather than through the production of power or the delivery of fuel. This trading activity may expose the Company to the risk of significant financial losses which could have a material adverse effect on its business and financial condition.

NRG may not have sufficient liquidity to hedge market risks effectively.

The Company is exposed to market risks through its power marketing business, which involves the sale of energy, capacity and related products and the purchase and sale of fuel, transmission services and emission allowances. These market risks include, among other risks, volatility arising from location and timing differences that may be associated with buying and transporting fuel, converting fuel into energy and delivering energy to a buyer.

NRG undertakes these marketing activities through agreements with various counterparties. Many of the Company's agreements with counterparties include provisions that require the Company to provide guarantees, offset of netting arrangements, letters of credit, a first lien on assets and/or cash collateral to protect the counterparties against the risk of the Company's default or insolvency. The amount of such credit support that must be provided typically is based on the difference between the price of the commodity in a given contract and the market price of the commodity. Significant movements in market prices can result in the Company being required to provide cash collateral and letters of credit in very large amounts. The effectiveness of the Company's strategy may be dependent on the amount of collateral available to enter into or maintain these contracts, and liquidity requirements may be greater than the Company anticipates or will be able to meet. Without a sufficient amount of working capital to post as collateral in support of performance guarantees or as a cash margin, the Company may not be able to manage price volatility effectively or to implement its strategy. An increase in the amount of letters of credit or cash collateral required to be provided to the Company's counterparties may negatively affect the Company's liquidity and financial condition.

Further, if any of NRG's facilities experience unplanned outages, the Company may be required to procure replacement power at spot market prices in order to fulfill contractual commitments. Without adequate liquidity to meet margin and collateral requirements, the Company may be exposed to significant losses, may miss significant opportunities, and may have increased exposure to the volatility of spot markets.

The accounting for NRG's hedging activities may increase the volatility in the Company's quarterly and annual financial results.

NRG engages in commodity-related marketing and price-risk management activities in order to financially hedge its exposure to market risk with respect to electricity sales from its generation assets, fuel utilized by those assets and emission allowances.

NRG generally attempts to balance its fixed-price physical and financial purchases and sales commitments in terms of contract volumes and the timing of performance and delivery obligations through the use of financial and physical derivative contracts. These derivatives are accounted for in accordance with the FASB ASC 815,Derivatives and Hedging,or ASC 815, which requires the Company to record all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value with changes in the fair value resulting from fluctuations in the underlying commodity prices immediately recognized in earnings, unless the derivative qualifies for cash flow hedge accounting treatment. Whether a derivative qualifies for cash flow hedge accounting treatment depends upon it meeting specific criteria used to determine if the cash flow hedge is and will remain appropriate for the term of the derivative. All economic hedges may not necessarily qualify for cash flow hedge accounting treatment. As a result, the Company's quarterly and annual results are subject to significant fluctuations caused by changes in market prices.

Competition in wholesale power markets may have a material adverse effect on NRG's results of operations, cash flows and the market value of its assets.

NRG has numerous competitors in all aspects of its business, and additional competitors may enter the industry. Because many of the Company's facilities are old, newer plants owned by the Company's competitors are often more efficient than NRG's aging plants, which may put some of the Company's plants at a competitive disadvantage to the extent the Company's competitors are able to consume the same or less fuel as the Company's plants consume. Over time, the Company's plants may be squeezed out of their markets or may be unable to compete with these more efficient plants.

In NRG's power marketing and commercial operations, NRG competes on the basis of its relative skills, financial position and access to capital with other providers of electric energy in the procurement of fuel and transportation services, and the sale of capacity, energy and related products. In order to compete successfully, the Company seeks to aggregate fuel supplies at competitive prices from different sources and locations and to efficiently utilize transportation services from third-party pipelines, railways and other fuel transporters and transmission services from electric utilities.










Other companies with which NRG competes may have greater liquidity, greater access to credit and other financial resources, lower cost structures, more effective risk management policies and procedures, greater ability to incur losses, longer-standing relationships with customers, greater potential for profitability from ancillary services or greater flexibility in the timing of their sale of generation capacity and ancillary services than NRG does.

NRG's competitors may be able to respond more quickly to new laws or regulations or emerging technologies, or to devote greater resources to the construction, expansion or refurbishment of their power generation facilities than NRG can. In addition, current and potential competitors may make strategic acquisitions or establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties. Accordingly, it is possible that new competitors or alliances among current and new competitors may emerge and rapidly gain significant market share. There can be no assurance that NRG will be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors, and any failure to do so would have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow.

Operation of power generation facilities involves significant risks and hazards customary to the power industry that could have a material adverse effect on NRG's revenues and results of operations, and NRG may not have adequate insurance to cover these risks and hazards.

Maintenance, expansion and refurbishment of power generation facilities involve significant risks that could result in unplanned power outages or reduced output and could have a material adverse effect on NRG's results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.

Many of NRG's facilities are old and require periodic upgrading, improvement, maintenance and repair. Any unexpected failure, including failure associated with breakdowns, forced outages or any unanticipated capital expenditures could result in reduced profitability.

NRG cannot be certain of the level of capital expenditures that will be required due to changing environmental and safety laws (including changes in the interpretation or enforcement thereof), needed facility repairs and unexpected events (such as natural disasters or terrorist attacks). The unexpected requirement of large capital expenditures could have a material adverse effect on the Company's liquidity and financial condition.

If NRG significantly modifies a unit, the Company may be required to install the best available control technology or to achieve the lowest achievable emission rates as such terms are defined under the new source review provisions of the CAA, which would likely result in substantial additional capital expenditures.










The Company may incur additional costs or delays in the development, construction and operation of new plants, improvements to existing plants, or the implementation of environmental control equipment at existing plants and may not be able to recover their investment or complete the project.

The Company is developing or constructing new generation facilities, improving its existing facilities and adding environmental controls to its existing facilities. The development, construction, expansion, modification and refurbishment of power generation facilities involve many risks, including:

•inability to obtain sufficient funding on reasonable terms and/or necessary government financial incentives;

•delays in obtaining necessary permits and licenses;

•inability to sell down interests in a project or develop successful partnering relationships;

•environmental remediation of soil or groundwater at contaminated sites;

•interruptions to dispatch at the Company's facilities;

•supply interruptions;

•work stoppages;

•labor disputes;

•weather interferences;

•unforeseen engineering, environmental and geological problems, including those related to climate change;

•unanticipated cost overruns;

•exchange rate risks; and

•failure of contracting parties to perform under contracts, including EPC contractors.

Any of these risks could cause NRG's financial returns on new investments to be lower than expected or could cause the Company to operate below expected capacity or availability levels, which could result in lost revenues, increased expenses, higher maintenance costs and penalties. Insurance is maintained to protect against these risks, warranties are generally obtained for limited periods relating to the construction of each project and its equipment in varying degrees, and contractors and equipment suppliers are obligated to meet certain performance levels. The insurance, warranties or performance guarantees, however, may not be adequate to cover increased expenses. As a result, a project may cost more than projected and may be unable to fund principal and interest payments under its construction financing obligations, if any. A default under such a financing obligation could result in the Company losing its interest in a power generation facility.

Furthermore, where the Company has partnering relationships with a third party, the Company is subject to the viability and performance of the third party.  The Company's inability to find a replacement contracting party, particularly an EPC contractor, where the original contracting party has failed to perform, could result in the abandonment of the development and/or construction of such project, while the Company could remain obligated on other agreements associated with the project, including PPAs.

If the Company is unable to complete the development or construction of a facility or environmental control, or decides to delay, downsize, or cancel such project, it may not be able to recover its investment in that facility or environmental control.  Furthermore, if construction projects are not completed according to specification, the Company may incur liabilities and suffer reduced plant efficiency, higher operating costs and reduced net income.

NRG and its subsidiaries have guaranteed the performance of third parties, which may result in substantial costs in the event of non-performance.

NRG and its subsidiaries have issued certain guarantees of the performance of others, which obligate NRG and its subsidiaries to perform in the event that the third parties do not perform. In the event of non-performance by the third parties, NRG could incur substantial cost to fulfill their obligations under these guarantees. Such performance guarantees could have a material impact on the operating results, financial condition, or cash flows of the Company.










The Company's development programs are subject to financing and public policy risks that could adversely impact NRG's financial performance or result in the abandonment of such development projects.

While NRG currently intends to develop and finance its more capital intensive projects on a non-recourse or limited recourse basis through separate project financed entities and intends to seek additional investments in most of these projects from third parties, NRG anticipates that it will need to make significant equity investments in these projects. NRG may also decide to develop and finance some of the projects, such as smaller gas-fired and renewable projects, using corporate financial resources rather than non-recourse debt, which could subject NRG to significant capital expenditure requirements and to risks inherent in the development and construction of new generation facilities. In addition to providing some or all of the equity required to develop and build the proposed projects, NRG's ability to finance these projects on a non-recourse basis is contingent upon a number of factors, including the terms of the EPC contracts, construction costs, PPAs and fuel procurement contracts, capital markets conditions, the availability of tax credits and other government incentives for certain new technologies. To the extent NRG is not able to obtain non-recourse financing for any project or should credit rating agencies attribute a material amount of the project finance debt to NRG's credit, the financing of the development projects could have a negative impact on the credit ratings of NRG.

NRG may also choose to undertake the repowering, refurbishment or upgrade of current facilities based on the Company's assessment that such activity will provide adequate financial returns. Such projects often require several years of development and capital expenditures before commencement of commercial operations, and key assumptions underpinning a decision to make such an investment may prove incorrect, including assumptions regarding construction costs, timing, available financing and future fuel and power prices.

Furthermore, the viability of the Company's renewable development projects are contingent on public policy mechanisms including production and investment tax credits, cash grants, loan guarantees, accelerated depreciation tax benefits, renewable portfolio standards, or RPS, and carbon-related mandates or controls. These mechanisms have been implemented at the state and federal levels to support the development of renewable generation, demand-side and smart grid, and other clean infrastructure technologies. The availability and continuation of public policy support mechanisms will drive a significant part of the economics and viability of the Company's development program and expansion into clean energy investments.

The Company’s renewables business has a pipeline of projects across the utility scale and distributed generation markets, including both organically developed projects and projects acquired from third-parties.  If a number of the projects fail to proceed to construction or are not completed, the Company’s business, financial condition or operating results could be materially adversely affected.



The development process is long and includes many steps such as project siting, financing, construction, permitting, government approvals and the negotiation of project development agreements.  There can be no assurance that the projects in the Company’s renewables project pipeline will be completed on schedule or within budget, generate revenues, receive the necessary financing for construction, among other risks. As the Company develops its renewables project pipeline, some of the projects in the pipeline may not be completed or proceed to construction as a result of various factors. These factors may include changes in applicable laws and regulations, including government incentives, environmental concerns regarding a project or changes in the economics related to a project, including the ability to finance a particular project. If a number of projects are not completed, the Company’s business, financial condition or operating results could be materially adversely affected.



Supplier and/or customer concentration at certain of NRG's facilities may expose the Company to significant financial credit or performance risks.

NRG often relies on a single contracted supplier or a small number of suppliers for the provision of fuel, transportation of fuel and other services required for the operation of certain of its facilities. If these suppliers cannot perform, the Company utilizes the marketplace to provide these services. There can be no assurance that the marketplace can provide these services as, when and where required or at comparable prices.

At times, NRG relies on a single customer or a few customers to purchase all or a significant portion of a facility's output, in some cases under long-term agreements that account for a substantial percentage of the anticipated revenue from a given facility. The Company has also hedged a portion of its exposure to power price fluctuations through forward fixed price power sales and natural gas price swap agreements. Counterparties to these agreements may breach or may be unable to perform their obligations. NRG may not be able to enter into replacement agreements on terms as favorable as its existing agreements, or at all. If the Company was unable to enter into replacement PPAs, the Company would sell its plants' power at market prices. If the Company is unable to enter into replacement fuel or fuel transportation purchase agreements, NRG would seek to purchase the Company's fuel requirements at market prices, exposing the Company to market price volatility and the risk that fuel and transportation may not be available during certain periods at any price.










The failure of any supplier or customer to fulfill its contractual obligations to NRG could have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial results. Consequently, the financial performance of the Company's facilities is dependent on the credit quality of, and continued performance by, suppliers and customers.

The Company's retail businesses may lose a significant number of retail customers due to competitive marketing activity by other retail electricity providers which could adversely affect the financial performance of the Company's retail businesses.

The Company's retail businesses face competition for customers.  Competitors may offer different products, lower prices, and other incentives, which may attract customers away from NRG's retail businesses.  In some retail electricity markets, the principal competitor may be the incumbent utility.  The incumbent utility has the advantage of long-standing relationships with its customers and strong brand recognition.  Furthermore, NRG's retail businesses may face competition from a number of other energy service providers, other energy industry participants, or nationally branded providers of consumer products and services, who may develop businesses that will compete with NRG and its retail businesses.

NRG relies on power transmission facilities that it does not own or control and that are subject to transmission constraints within a number of the Company's core regions. If these facilities fail to provide NRG with adequate transmission capacity, the Company may be restricted in its ability to deliver wholesale electric power to its customers and the Company may either incur additional costs or forego revenues. Conversely, improvements to certain transmission systems could also reduce revenues.

NRG depends on transmission facilities owned and operated by others to deliver the wholesale power it sells from the Company's power generation plants to its customers. If transmission is disrupted, or if the transmission capacity infrastructure is inadequate, NRG's ability to sell and deliver wholesale power may be adversely impacted. If a region's power transmission infrastructure is inadequate, the Company's recovery of wholesale costs and profits may be limited. If restrictive transmission price regulation is imposed, the transmission companies may not have sufficient incentive to invest in expansion of transmission infrastructure. The Company also cannot predict whether transmission facilities will be expanded in specific markets to accommodate competitive access to those markets.

In addition, in certain of the markets in which NRG operates, energy transmission congestion may occur and the Company may be deemed responsible for congestion costs if it schedules delivery of power between congestion zones during times when congestion occurs between the zones. If NRG were liable for such congestion costs, the Company's financial results could be adversely affected.

The Company has a significant amount of generation located in load pockets, making that generation valuable, particularly with respect to maintaining the reliability of the transmission grid. Expansion of transmission systems to reduce or eliminate these load pockets could negatively impact the value or profitability of the Company's existing facilities in these areas.

The Company’s use and enjoyment of real property rights for its projects may be adversely affected by the rights of lienholders and leaseholders that are superior to those of the grantors of those real property rights to the Company.



Solar and wind projects generally are, and are likely to be, located on land occupied by the project pursuant to long-term easements and leases. The ownership interests in the land subject to these easements and leases may be subject to mortgages securing loans or other liens (such as tax liens) and other easement and lease rights of third parties (such as leases of oil or mineral rights) that were created prior to the project’s easements and leases. As a result, the project’s rights under these easements or leases may be subject, and subordinate, to the rights of those third parties. The Company performs title searches and obtains title insurance to protect itself against these risks. Such measures may, however, be inadequate to protect the Company against all risk of loss of its rights to use the land on which the renewable projects are located, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition and results of operations.



One of the Company's subsidiaries is a publicly traded corporation, NRG Yield, Inc., which may involve a greater exposure to legal liability than the Company's historic business operations.

One of the Company's subsidiaries is NRG Yield, Inc., a publicly traded corporation. NRG's controlling voting interest in NRG Yield, Inc. and the position of certain of its executive officers that are serving on the Board of Directors of NRG Yield, Inc. or as executive officers may increase the possibility of claims of breach of fiduciary duties including claims of conflicts of interest related to NRG Yield, Inc. Any liability resulting from such claims could have a material adverse effect on NRG's future business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.










Because NRG owns less than a majority of the ownership interests of some of its project investments, the Company cannot exercise complete control over their operations.

NRG has limited control over the operation of some project investments and joint ventures because the Company's investments are in projects where it beneficially owns less than a majority of the ownership interests. NRG seeks to exert a degree of influence with respect to the management and operation of projects in which it owns less than a majority of the ownership interests by negotiating to obtain positions on management committees or to receive certain limited governance rights, such as rights to veto significant actions. However, the Company may not always succeed in such negotiations. NRG may be dependent on its co-venturers to operate such projects. The Company's co-venturers may not have the level of experience, technical expertise, human resources management and other attributes necessary to operate these projects optimally. The approval of co-venturers also may be required for NRG to receive distributions of funds from projects or to transfer the Company's interest in projects.

NRG may be unable to integrate the operations of acquired entities in the manner expected.

NRG enters into acquisitions that result in various benefits, including, among other things, cost savings and operating efficiencies. Achieving the anticipated benefits of these acquisitions depends on whether the businesses can be integrated into NRG in an efficient and effective manner. The integration process could take longer than anticipated and could result in the loss of valuable employees, the disruption of NRG's businesses, processes and systems or inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures, practices, policies and compensation arrangements, any of which could adversely affect the Company's ability to achieve the anticipated benefits of the acquisitions. NRG may have difficulty addressing possible differences in corporate cultures and management philosophies. Failure to achieve these anticipated benefits could result in increased costs or decreases in the amount of expected revenues and could adversely affect NRG's future business, financial condition, operating results and prospects.

Future acquisition activities may have materially adverse effects.

NRG may seek to acquire additional companies or assets in the Company's industry or which complement the Company's industry. The acquisition of companies and assets is subject to substantial risks, including the failure to identify material problems during due diligence, the risk of over-paying for assets, the ability to retain customers and the inability to arrange financing for an acquisition as may be required or desired. Further, the integration and consolidation of acquisitions requires substantial human, financial and other resources and, ultimately, the Company's acquisitions may not be successfully integrated. There can be no assurances that any future acquisitions will perform as expected or that the returns from such acquisitions will support the indebtedness incurred to acquire them or the capital expenditures needed to develop them.

NRG's business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely impacted by strikes or work stoppages by its unionized employees or inability to replace employees as they retire.

As ofDecember 31, 2016, approximately30%of NRG's employees at its U.S. generation plants were covered by collective bargaining agreements. In the event that the Company's union employees strike, participate in a work stoppage or slowdown or engage in other forms of labor strife or disruption, NRG would be responsible for procuring replacement labor or the Company could experience reduced power generation or outages. Although NRG's ability to procure such labor is uncertain, contingency staffing planning is completed as part of each respective contract negotiations.  Strikes, work stoppages or the inability to negotiate future collective bargaining agreements on favorable terms could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, a number of the Company's employees at NRG's plants are close to retirement. The Company's inability to replace retiring workers could create potential knowledge and expertise gaps as such workers retire.

Changes in technology may impair the value of NRG's power plants.

Research and development activities are ongoing to provide alternative and more efficient technologies to produce power, including "clean" coal and coal gasification, wind, photovoltaic (solar) cells, energy storage, and improvements in traditional technologies and equipment, such as more efficient gas turbines. Advances in these or other technologies could reduce the costs of power production to a level below what the Company has currently forecasted, which could adversely affect its cash flows, results of operations or competitive position.










Risks that are beyond NRG's control, including but not limited to acts of terrorism or related acts of war, natural disaster, hostile cyber intrusions or other catastrophic events could  have a material adverse effect on NRG's financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

NRG's generation facilities and the facilities of third parties on which they rely may be targets of terrorist activities, as well as events occurring in response to or in connection with them, that could cause environmental repercussions and/or result in full or partial disruption of the facilities ability to generate, transmit, transport or distribute electricity or natural gas. Strategic targets, such as energy-related facilities, may be at greater risk of future terrorist activities than other domestic targets. Hostile cyber intrusions, including those targeting information systems as well as electronic control systems used at the generating plants and for the distribution systems, could severely disrupt business operations and result in loss of service to customers, as well as significant expense to repair security breaches or system damage. Any such environmental repercussions or disruption could result in a significant decrease in revenues or significant reconstruction or remediation costs, beyond what could be recovered through insurance policies which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, significant weather events or terrorist actions could damage or shut down the power transmission and distribution facilities upon which the Company's retail businesses are dependent. Power supply may be sold at a loss if these events cause a significant loss of retail customer load.

The operation of NRG’s businesses is subject to cyber-based security and integrity risk.

Numerous functions affecting the efficient operation of NRG’s businesses are dependent on the secure and reliable storage, processing and communication of electronic data and the use of sophisticated computer hardware and software systems. The operation of NRG’s generation plants, including STP, and of NRG's energy and fuel trading businesses are reliant on cyber-based technologies and, therefore, subject to the risk that such systems could be the target of disruptive actions, particularly through cyber-attack or cyber intrusion, including by computer hackers, foreign governments and cyber terrorists, or otherwise be compromised by unintentional events. As a result, operations could be interrupted, property could be damaged and sensitive customer information could be lost or stolen, causing NRG to incur significant losses of revenues, other substantial liabilities and damages, costs to replace or repair damaged equipment and damage to NRG's reputation. In addition, NRG may experience increased capital and operating costs to implement increased security for its cyber systems and plants.

The Company's retail businesses are subject to the risk that sensitive customer data may be compromised, which could result in an adverse impact to its reputation and/or the results of operations of the Company's retail businesses.

The Company's retail businesses require access to sensitive customer data in the ordinary course of business.  Examples of sensitive customer data are names, addresses, account information, historical electricity usage, expected patterns of use, payment history, credit bureau data, credit and debit card account numbers, driver's license numbers, social security numbers and bank account information.  NRG's retail businesses may need to provide sensitive customer data to vendors and service providers, who require access to this information in order to provide services, such as call center operations, to NRG's retail businesses.  If a significant breach occurred, the reputation of NRG and its retail businesses may be adversely affected, customer confidence may be diminished, or NRG and its retail businesses may be subject to legal claims, any of which may contribute to the loss of customers and have a negative impact on the business and/or results of operations.

Risks Related to Governmental Regulation and Laws

NRG's business is subject to substantial governmental regulation and may be adversely affected by legislative or regulatory changes, as well as liability under, or any future inability to comply with, existing or future regulations or requirements.

NRG's business is subject to extensive U.S. federal, state and local laws and foreign laws. Compliance with the requirements under these legal and regulatory regimes may cause the Company to incur significant additional costs, and failure to comply with such requirements could result in the shutdown of a non-complying facility, the imposition of liens, fines, and/or civil or criminal liability.










Substantially all of the Company's generation assets are also subject to the reliability standards promulgated by the designated Electric Reliability Organization (currently NERC) and approved by FERC.  If NRG fails to comply with the mandatory reliability standards, NRG could be subject to sanctions, including substantial monetary penalties and increased compliance obligations. NRG is also affected by legislative and regulatory changes, as well as changes to market design, market rules, tariffs, cost allocations, and bidding rules that occur in the existing ISOs. The ISOs that oversee most of the wholesale power markets impose, and in the future may continue to impose, mitigation, including price limitations, offer caps, non-performance penalties and other mechanisms to address some of the volatility and the potential exercise of market power in these markets. These types of price limitations and other regulatory mechanisms may have a material adverse effect on the profitability of NRG's generation facilities that sell energy and capacity into the wholesale power markets.



NRG’s business may be affected by state interference in the competitive wholesale marketplace.

NRG’s legacy generation and competitive retail businesses rely on a competitive wholesale marketplace.  The competitive wholesale marketplace may be undermined by out-of-market subsidies provided by states or state entities, including bailouts of uneconomic nuclear plants, imports of power from Canada, renewable mandates or subsidies, as well as out-of-market payments to new generators.  These out-of-market subsidies to existing or new generation undermine the competitive wholesale marketplace, which can lead to premature retirement of existing facilities, including those owned by the Company.  If these measures continue, capacity and energy prices may be suppressed, and the Company may not be successful in its efforts to insulate the competitive market from this interference.












Government regulations providing incentives for renewable generation could change at any time and such changes may adversely impact NRG's business, revenues, margins, results of operations and cash flows.

The Company's growth strategy depends in part on government policies that support renewable generation and enhance the economic viability of owning renewable electric generation assets.  Renewable generation assets currently benefit from various federal, state and local governmental incentives such as ITCs, PTCs, cash grants in lieu of ITCs, loan guarantees, RPS programs, modified accelerated cost-recovery system of depreciation and bonus depreciation. For example, in December 2015, the U.S. Congress enacted an extension of the 30% solar ITC so that projects which began construction in 2016 through 2019 will continue to qualify for the 30% ITC.  Projects beginning construction in 2020 and 2021 will be eligible for the ITC at the rates of 26% and 22%, respectively.  The same legislation also extended the 10-year wind PTC for wind projects which began construction in 2016 through 2019.  Wind projects which begin construction in the years 2017, 2018 and 2019 are eligible for PTCs at 80%, 60% and 40% of the statutory rate per kWh, respectively.

Many states have adopted RPS programs mandating that a specified percentage of electricity sales come from eligible sources of renewable energy.  However, the regulations that govern the RPS programs, including pricing incentives for renewable energy, or reasonableness guidelines for pricing that increase valuation compared to conventional power (such as a projected value for carbon reduction or consideration of avoided integration costs), may change.  If the RPS requirements are reduced or eliminated, it could lead to fewer future power contracts or lead to lower prices for the sale of power in future power contracts, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's future growth prospects.

Such material adverse effects may result from decreased revenues, reduced economic returns on certain project company investments, increased financing costs, and/or difficulty obtaining financing. Furthermore, the ARRA included incentives to encourage investment in the renewable energy sector, such as cash grants in lieu of ITCs, bonus depreciation and expansion of the U.S. DOE loan guarantee program. It is uncertain what loan guarantees may be made by the U.S. DOE loan guarantee program in the future. In addition, the cash grant in lieu of ITCs program only applies to facilities that commenced construction prior to December 31, 2011, which commencement date may be determined in accordance with the safe harbor if more than 5% of the total cost of the eligible property was paid or incurred by December 31, 2011.

If the Company is unable to utilize various federal, state and local government incentives to acquire additional renewable assets in the future, or the terms of such incentives are revised in a manner that is less favorable to the Company, it may suffer a material adverse effect on the business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

The integration of the Capacity Performance product into the PJM market and the Pay-for-Performance mechanism in ISO-NE could lead to substantial changes in capacity income and non-performance penalties, which could have a material adverse effect on NRG’s results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.



Both ISO-NE and PJM operate a pay-for-performance model where capacity payments are modified based on real-time generator performance.  Capacity market prices are sensitive to design parameters, as well as additions of new capacity.  NRG may experience substantial changes in capacity income and non-performance penalties, which could have a material adverse effect on NRG’s results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.



Certain of NRG's long-term bilateral contracts result from state-mandated procurements and could be declared invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction.



A significant portion of NRG’s revenues are derived from long-term bilateral contracts with utilities that are regulated by their respective states, and have been entered into pursuant to certain state programs.  Certain long-term contracts that other companies have with state-regulated utilities have been challenged in federal court and have been declared unconstitutional on the grounds that the rate for energy and capacity established by the contracts impermissibly conflicts with the rate for energy and capacity established by FERC pursuant to the FPA. If certain of the Company's state-mandated agreements with utilities are ever held to be invalid, NRG may be unable to replace such contracts, which could have a material adverse effect on NRG's business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.












NRG's ownership interest in a nuclear power facility subjects the Company to regulations, costs and liabilities uniquely associated with these types of facilities.

Under the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, or AEA, ownership and operation of STP, of which NRG indirectly owns a 44% interest, is subject to regulation by the NRC.  Such regulation includes licensing, inspection, enforcement, testing, evaluation and modification of all aspects of nuclear reactor power plant design and operation, environmental and safety performance, technical and financial qualifications, decommissioning funding assurance and transfer and foreign ownership restrictions.  The current facility operating licenses for STP expire on August 20, 2027 (Unit 1) and December 15, 2028 (Unit 2).  STP has applied for the renewal of such licenses for a period of 20 years beyond the expirations of the current licenses. STP Unit 1 was operating with a single-cycle license amendment issued on December 11, 2015 after a control rod was determined to be inoperable following a scheduled refueling and maintenance outage. The approved license amendment to support STP Unit 1 operation with the inoperable control rod and the associated control rod drive shaft removed was granted by the NRC on December 21, 2016.

There are unique risks to owning and operating a nuclear power facility.  These include liabilities related to the handling, treatment, storage, disposal, transport, release and use of radioactive materials, particularly with respect to spent nuclear fuel, and uncertainties regarding the ultimate, and potential exposure to, technical and financial risks associated with modifying or decommissioning a nuclear facility.  The NRC could require the shutdown of the plant for safety reasons or refuse to permit restart of the unit after unplanned or planned outages.  New or amended NRC safety and regulatory requirements may give rise to additional operation and maintenance costs and capital expenditures.  Additionally, aging equipment may require more capital expenditures to keep each of these nuclear power plants operating efficiently.  This equipment is also likely to require periodic upgrading and improvement.  Any unexpected failure, including failure associated with breakdowns, forced outages, or any unanticipated capital expenditures, could result in reduced profitability.  STP will be obligated to continue storing spent nuclear fuel if the U.S. DOE continues to fail to meet its contractual obligations to STP made pursuant to the U.S. Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 to accept and dispose of STP's spent nuclear fuel.  See also Item 1

—



Regulatory Matters — Nuclear Operations - Decommissioning Trusts

and Item 1

— Environmental Matters — Federal Environmental Initiatives — Nuclear Waste

for further discussion.  Costs associated with these risks could be substantial and could have a material adverse effect on NRG's results of operations, financial condition or cash flow to the extent not covered by the Decommissioning Trusts or recovered from ratepayers.  In addition, to the extent that all or a part of STP is required by the NRC to permanently or temporarily shut down or modify its operations, or is otherwise subject to a forced outage, NRG may incur additional costs to the extent it is obligated to provide power from more expensive alternative sources — either NRG's own plants, third party generators or the ERCOT — to cover the Company's then existing forward sale obligations.  Such shutdown or modification could also lead to substantial costs related to the storage and disposal of radioactive materials and spent nuclear fuel.

While STP maintains property and liability insurance for losses related to nuclear operations, there may be limitations on the amounts and types of insurance commercially available.  See also Item 15—Note 22,Commitments and Contingencies,Nuclear Insurance.  An accident at STP or another nuclear facility could have a material adverse effect on NRG's financial condition, its operational results, or liquidity as losses may exceed the insurance coverage available and/or may result in the obligation to pay retrospective premium obligations.

NRG is subject to environmental laws that impose extensive and increasingly stringent requirements on the Company's ongoing operations, as well as potentially substantial liabilities arising out of environmental contamination. These environmental requirements and liabilities could adversely impact NRG's results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

NRG is subject to the environmental laws of foreign and U.S., federal, state and local authorities.  The Company must comply with numerous environmental laws and obtain numerous governmental permits and approvals to build and operate the Company's plants.  Should NRG fail to comply with any environmental requirements that apply to its operations, the Company could be subject to administrative, civil and/or criminal liability and fines, and regulatory agencies could take other actions seeking to curtail the Company's operations.  In addition, when new requirements take effect or when existing environmental requirements are revised, reinterpreted or subject to changing enforcement policies, NRG's business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected.

Federal and state environmental laws generally have become more stringent although this trend could change with respect to federal laws under the new U.S. presidential administration.










NRG's businesses are subject to physical, market and economic risks relating to potential effects of climate change.



Climate change may produce changes in weather or other environmental conditions, including temperature or precipitation levels, and thus may impact consumer demand for electricity. In addition, the potential physical effects of climate change, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, floods and other climatic events, could disrupt NRG's operations and cause it to incur significant costs in preparing for or responding to these effects. These or other meteorological changes could lead to increased operating costs, capital expenses or power purchase costs. Climate change could also affect the availability of a secure and economical supply of water in some locations, which is essential for the continued operation of NRG's generation plants.

GHG regulation could increase the cost of electricity, particularly power generated by fossil fuels, and such increases could have a depressive effect on regional economies. Reduced economic and consumer activity in NRG's service areas — both generally and specific to certain industries and consumers accustomed to previously lower cost power — could reduce demand for the power NRG generates and markets. Also, demand for NRG's energy-related services could be similarly reduced by consumers’ preferences or market factors favoring energy efficiency, low-carbon power sources or reduced electricity usage.

Policies at the national, regional and state levels to regulate GHG emissions, as well as climate change, could adversely impact NRG's results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

NRG's GHG emissions for2016can be found in Item 1,Business — Environmental Matters.On October 23, 2015, the EPA promulgated the final GHG emissions rules for new and existing fossil-fuel-fired electric generating units.  The impact of these newly promulgated rules and further legislation or regulation of GHGs on the Company's financial performance will depend on a number of factors, including the actions of the new U.S. presidential administration, the outcome of the legal challenges to promulgated regulations, and the extent to which NRG will be entitled to receive CO2emissions credits without having to purchase them in an auction or on the open market.

The Company operates generating units in Connecticut, Delaware, Maryland, Massachusetts, and New York that are subject to RGGI, which is a regional cap and trade system. In 2013, each of these states finalized a rule that reduced and will continue to reduce the number of allowances through 2020.  The nine RGGI states are re-evaluating the program and may alter the rules to further reduce the number of allowances. The revisions being currently contemplated could adversely impact NRG's results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

California has a CO2cap and trade program for electric generating units greater than 25 MW. The impact on the Company depends on the cost of the allowances and the ability to pass these costs through to customers.

On October 26, 2015, the EPA promulgated a rule that reduces the ozone NAAQS to 0.070 ppm.  If it survives legal challenges, this more stringent NAAQS will obligate the states to develop plans to reduce NOx(an ozone precursor), which could affect some of the Company's units.

Hazards customary to the power production industry include the potential for unusual weather conditions, which could affect fuel pricing and availability, the Company's route to market or access to customers, i.e., transmission and distribution lines, or critical plant assets. To the extent that climate change contributes to the frequency or intensity of weather-related events, NRG's operations and planning process could be affected.

NRG's retail businesses are subject to changing state rules and regulations that could have a material impact on the profitability of its business lines.

The competitiveness of NRG's retail businesses is partially dependent on state regulatory policies that establish the structure, rules, terms and conditions on which services are offered to retail customers.  These state policies, which can include controls on the retail rates NRG's retail businesses can charge, the imposition of additional costs on sales, restrictions on the Company's ability to obtain new customers through various marketing channels and disclosure requirements, which can affect the competitiveness of NRG's retail businesses.  Additionally, state or federal imposition of net metering or RPS programs can make it more or less expensive for retail customers to supplement or replace their reliance on grid power.  NRG's retail businesses have limited ability to influence development of these policies, and its business model may be more or less effective, depending on changes to the regulatory environment.










The Company's international operations are exposed to political and economic risks, commercial instability and events beyond the Company's control in the countries in which it operates, which risks may negatively impact the Company's business.

The Company's international operations are dependent upon products manufactured, purchased and sold in the U.S. and internationally, including in countries with political and economic instability.  In some cases, these countries have greater political and economic volatility and greater vulnerability to infrastructure and labor disruptions than in NRG's other markets.  The Company's business could be negatively impacted by adverse fluctuations in freight costs, limitations on shipping and receiving capacity, and other disruptions in the transportation and shipping infrastructure at important geographic points of exit and entry for the Company's products. Operating and seeking to expand business in a number of different regions and countries exposes the Company to a number of risks, including:

•multiple and potentially conflicting laws, regulations and policies that are subject to change;

•imposition of currency restrictions on repatriation of earnings or other restraints;

•imposition of burdensome tariffs or quotas;

•national and international conflict, including terrorist acts; and

•political and economic instability or civil unrest that may severely disrupt economic activity in affected countries.

The occurrence of one or more of these events may negatively impact the Company's business, results of operations and financial condition.

The Company may potentially be affected by emerging technologies that may over time affect change in capacity markets and the energy industry overall with the inclusion of distributed generation and clean technology.

Some technologies like, distributed renewable energy technologies, broad consumer adoption of electric vehicles and energy storage devices could affect the price of energy.  These distributed technologies may affect the financial viability of utility counterparties and could have significant impacts on wholesale market prices.

Risks Related to Economic and Financial Market Conditions

NRG's level of indebtedness could adversely affect its ability to raise additional capital to fund its operations or return capital to stockholders. It could also expose it to the risk of increased interest rates and limit its ability to react to changes in the economy or its industry.

NRG's substantial debt could have negative consequences, including:

•increasing NRG's vulnerability to general economic and industry conditions;

•requiring a substantial portion of NRG's cash flow from operations to be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on its indebtedness, therefore reducing NRG's ability to pay dividends to holders of its preferred or common stock or to use its cash flow to fund its operations, capital expenditures and future business opportunities;

•limiting NRG's ability to enter into long-term power sales or fuel purchases which require credit support;

•exposing NRG to the risk of increased interest rates because certain of its borrowings, including borrowings under its senior secured credit facility are at variable rates of interest;

•limiting NRG's ability to obtain additional financing for working capital including collateral postings, capital expenditures, debt service requirements, acquisitions and general corporate or other purposes; and

•limiting NRG's ability to adjust to changing market conditions and placing it at a competitive disadvantage compared to its competitors who have less debt.

The indentures for NRG's notes and senior secured credit facility contain financial and other restrictive covenants that may limit the Company's ability to return capital to stockholders or otherwise engage in activities that may be in its long-term best interests.  Furthermore, financial and other restrictive covenants contained in any project level subsidiary debt may limit the ability of NRG to receive distributions from such subsidiary. NRG's failure to comply with those covenants could result in an event of default which, if not cured or waived, could result in the acceleration of all of the Company's indebtedness.










In addition, NRG's ability to arrange financing, either at the corporate level, a non-recourse project-level subsidiary or otherwise, and the costs of such capital, are dependent on numerous factors, including:

•general economic and capital market conditions;

•credit availability from banks and other financial institutions;

•investor confidence in NRG, its partners and the regional wholesale power markets;

•NRG's financial performance and the financial performance of its subsidiaries;

•NRG's level of indebtedness and compliance with covenants in debt agreements;

•maintenance of acceptable credit ratings;

•cash flow; and

•provisions of tax and securities laws that may impact raising capital.

NRG may not be successful in obtaining additional capital for these or other reasons. The failure to obtain additional capital from time to time may have a material adverse effect on its business and operations.

Adverse economic conditions could adversely affect NRG’s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

Adverse economic conditions and declines in wholesale energy prices, partially resulting from adverse economic conditions, may impact NRG’s earnings. The breadth and depth of negative economic conditions may have a wide-ranging impact on the U.S. business environment, including NRG’s businesses. In addition, adverse economic conditions also reduce the demand for energy commodities. Reduced demand from negative economic conditions continues to impact the key domestic wholesale energy markets NRG serves. The combination of lower demand for power and increased supply of natural gas has put downward price pressure on wholesale energy markets in general, further impacting NRG’s energy marketing results. In general, economic and commodity market conditions will continue to impact NRG’s unhedged future energy margins, liquidity, earnings growth and overall financial condition. In addition, adverse economic conditions, declines in wholesale energy prices, reduced demand for power and other factors may negatively impact the trading price of NRG’s common stock and impact forecasted cash flows, which may require NRG to evaluate its goodwill and other long-lived assets for impairment. Any such impairment could have a material impact on NRG’s financial statements.

Goodwill and/or other intangible assets not subject to amortization that NRG has recorded in connection with its acquisitions are subject to mandatory annual impairment evaluations and as a result, the Company could be required to write off some or all of this goodwill and other intangible assets, which may adversely affect the Company's financial condition and results of operations.

In accordance with ASC 350,Intangibles — Goodwill and Other,or ASC 350, goodwill is not amortized but is reviewed annually or more frequently for impairment and other intangibles are also reviewed at least annually or more frequently, if certain conditions exist, and may be amortized. Any reduction in or impairment of the value of goodwill or other intangible assets will result in a charge against earnings which could materially adversely affect NRG's reported results of operations and financial position in future periods.

A valuation allowance may be required for NRG's deferred tax assets.

A valuation allowance may need to be recorded against the net deferred tax assets, which are predominantly related to NRG Yield, Inc., that the Company estimates as more likely than not to be unrealizable, based on available evidence including cumulative and forecasted pretax book earnings at the time the estimate is made.  A valuation allowance related to deferred tax assets can be affected by changes to tax laws, statutory tax rates and future taxable income levels. In the event that the Company determines that it would not be able to realize all or a portion of its net deferred tax assets in the future, the Company would reduce such amounts accordingly through a charge to income tax expense in the period in which that determination was made, which could have a material adverse impact on the Company's financial condition and results of operations.










The Company has made investments, and may continue to make investments, in new business initiatives predominantly focused on consumer products and in markets that may not be successful, may not achieve the intended financial results or may result in product liability and reputational risk that could adversely affect the Company.

NRG continues to pursue growth in its existing businesses and markets and further diversification across the competitive energy value chain. NRG is continuing to pursue investment opportunities in renewables, consumer products and distributed generation.  Such initiatives may involve significant risks and uncertainties, including distraction of management from current operations, inadequate return on capital, and unidentified issues not discovered in the diligence performed prior to launching an initiative or entering a market.



As part of these initiatives, the Company may be liable to customers for any damage caused to customers’ homes, facilities, belongings or property during the installation of Company products and systems, such as residential solar systems and mass market back-up generators. In addition, shortages of skilled labor for Company projects could significantly delay a project or otherwise increase its costs.  The products that the Company sells or manufactures may expose the Company to product liability claims relating to personal injury, death, or environmental or property damage, and may require product recalls or other actions. Although the Company maintains liability insurance, the Company cannot be certain that its coverage will be adequate for liabilities actually incurred or that insurance will continue to be available to the Company on economically reasonable terms, or at all.  Further, any product liability claim or damage caused by the Company could significantly impair the Company’s brand and reputation, which may result in a failure to maintain customers and achieve the Company’s desired growth initiatives in these new businesses.

(a)Inter-segment sales and net derivative gains and losses included in operating revenues.





Energy revenue consists of revenues received from third parties as well as from the Company's retail businesses, for sales of electricity in the day-ahead and real-time markets, as well as bilateral sales.  It also includes energy sold through long-term PPAs for renewable facilities.  In addition, energy revenue includes revenues from the settlement of financial instruments and net realized trading revenues.

Capacity revenue consists of revenues received from a third party at either the market or negotiated contract rates for making installed generation capacity available in order to satisfy system integrity and reliability requirements.  Capacity revenue also includes revenues from the settlement of financial instruments.  In addition, capacity revenue includes revenues received under tolling arrangements, which entitle third parties to dispatch NRG's facilities and assume title to the electrical generation produced from that facility.

Retail revenue, representing operating revenues of NRG's retail businesses, consists of revenues from retail sales to residential, small business, commercial, industrial and governmental/institutional customers, revenues from the sale of excess supply into various markets, primarily in Texas, as well as product sales.

Mark-to-market for economic hedging activities includes asset-backed hedges that have not been designated as cash flow hedges and ineffectiveness on cash flow hedges.



Contract amortization revenue consists of the amortization of the intangible assets for net in-market C&I contracts established in connection with the acquisitions of Reliant Energy and Green Mountain Energy, as well as acquired power contracts, gas derivative instruments, and certain power sales agreements assumed at Fresh Start and Texas Genco purchase accounting dates related to the sale of electric capacity and energy in future periods.  These amounts are amortized into revenue over the term of the underlying contracts based on actual generation or contracted volumes.

Other revenues include revenues generated by the Thermal Business consisting of revenues received from the sale of steam, hot and chilled water generally produced at a central district energy plant and sold to commercial, governmental and residential buildings for space heating, domestic hot water heating and air conditioning.  It also includes the sale of high-pressure steam produced and delivered to industrial customers that is used as part of an industrial process.  Other revenues also consists of operations and maintenance fees, or O&M fees, construction management services, or CMA fees, sale of natural gas and emission allowances, and revenues from ancillary services. O&M fees consist of revenues received from providing certain unconsolidated affiliates with services under long-term operating agreements.  CMA fees are earned where NRG provides certain management and oversight of construction projects pursuant to negotiated agreements such as for the GenConn, Cedar Bayou 4 and certain solar construction projects.  Ancillary services are comprised of the sale of energy-related products associated with the generation of electrical energy such as spinning reserves, reactive power and other similar products.  Other revenues also include unrealized trading activities.
















Item 7 — Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

The discussion and analysis below has been organized as follows:

•Executive Summary, including the business environment in which NRG operates, a discussion of regulation, weather, competition and other factors that affect the business, and significant events that are important to understanding the results of operations and financial condition;

•Results of operations, including an explanation of significant differences between the periods in the specific line items of NRG's Consolidated Statements of Operations;

•Financial condition addressing credit ratings, liquidity position, sources and uses of cash, capital resources and requirements, commitments, and off-balance sheet arrangements; and

•Critical accounting policies which are most important to both the portrayal of the Company's financial condition and results of operations, and which require management's most difficult, subjective or complex judgment.

As you read this discussion and analysis, refer to NRG's Consolidated Statements of Operations to this Form 10-K, which presents the results of the Company's operations for the years endedDecember 31, 2016,2015, and2014, and also refer to Item 1 to this Form 10-K for more detailed discussion about the Company's business.

Executive Summary

NRG Energy, Inc., or NRG or the Company, is a leading integrated power company built on the strength of the nation's largest and most diverse competitive electric generation portfolio and leading retail electricity platform.  NRG aims to create a sustainable energy future by producing, selling and delivering electricity and related products and services in major competitive power markets in the U.S. in a manner that delivers value to all of NRG's stakeholders. The Company owns and operates approximately47,000 MWof generation; engages in the trading of wholesale energy, capacity and related products; transacts in and trades fuel and transportation services; and directly sells energy, services, and innovative, sustainable products and services to retail customers under the names “NRG”, "Reliant" and other retail brand names owned by NRG.

Business Environment

The industry dynamics and external influences affecting the Company and its businesses, and the power generation and retail energy industry in general in2016and for the future medium term include:

Capacity Markets— Capacity markets are a major source of revenue for the Company.  Centralized capacity markets exist in ISO-NE, MISO, NYISO and PJM. Bilateral markets exist in CAISO and MISO.  These auctions are either an annual market held three years ahead of the delivery period as in the case of PJM and ISO-NE, or six months to one month ahead as in the case of NYISO.  Many variables affect the prices derived in these auctions.  These variables include the load forecast, the target reserve margin, rules surrounding demand response, capacity performance penalties, capacity imports and exports from the region, new generation entrants, slope of the demand curve, generation retirements, the cost of retrofitting old generation to meet new environmental rules, expected profitability of the plant itself in the energy market and various other auction rules.  In theory, a high capacity price should be an indication that the ISO doesn't have sufficient generation capacity against its needed reserve margin and new construction should enter the market.  Similarly, a low capacity price suggests the market is over-built and units should retire.  The Company has seen many swings in the pricing for capacity markets and the rules in many of the markets are undergoing significant changes, as discussed in thisManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.

Commodities Markets— The price of natural gas plays an important role in setting the price of electricity in many of the regions where NRG operates power plants.  Natural gas prices are driven by variables including demand from the industrial, residential, and electric sectors, productivity across natural gas supply basins, costs of natural gas production, changes in pipeline infrastructure, and the financial and hedging profile of natural gas consumers and producers.  In 2016, average natural gas prices at Henry Hub were 7.5% lower than 2015.










If long-term gas prices further decrease or remain depressed, the Company is likely to encounter lower realized energy prices, leading to lower energy revenues as higher priced hedge contracts mature and are replaced by contracts with lower gas and power prices.  NRG's retail gross margins have historically improved as natural gas prices decline and are likely to partially offset the impact of declining gas prices on conventional wholesale power generation.  To further mitigate this impact, NRG may increase its percentage of coal and nuclear capacity sold forward using a variety of hedging instruments, as described under the heading "Energy-Related Commodities" in Item 15 —Note 5,Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities,to the Consolidated Financial Statements.  The Company also mitigates declines in long-term gas prices through its increased investment in renewable power generation supported by PPAs.

Natural gas prices are a primary driver of coal demand.  The low priced commodity environment has stressed coal equities, leading coal suppliers to file for bankruptcy protection, launch debt exchanges, rationalize assets, and cut production.  If multiple parties withdraw from the market, liquidity could be challenged in the short term.  Inventory overhang will be utilized to offset production losses.  Coal prices are typically affected by the price of natural gas.

Electricity Prices— The price of electricity is a key determinant of the profitability of the Company.  Many variables such as the price of different fuels, weather, load growth and unit availability all coalesce to impact the final price for electricity and the Company's profitability. The following table summarizes average on-peak power prices for each of the major markets in which NRG operates for the years endedDecember 31, 2016,2015, and2014.  For the year endedDecember 31, 2016as compared to the same period in2015, and for the year endedDecember 31, 2015as compared to the same period in2014the average on-peak power prices decreased primarily due to the decrease in natural gas prices.

Though the average on peak power prices have decreased on average by15%for the year endedDecember 31, 2016as compared to the same period in2015, and decreased on average by33%for the year endedDecember 31, 2015as compared to the same period in2014, average realized prices by region for the Company have generally decreased at a slower rate year-over-year due to the Company's multi-year hedging program and the success of the Company's commercial operations team in optimizing the value of the Company's assets on a daily basis.












Environmental Regulatory Landscape— The MATS rule, finalized in 2012, is the primary regulatory force behind the decision to retrofit, repower or retire uncontrolled coal fired power plants. In June 2015, the U.S. Supreme Court held that the EPA unreasonably refused to consider costs when it determined to regulate HAPs emitted by electric generating units. The U.S. Supreme Court did not vacate the MATS rule but rather remanded it to the D.C. Circuit for further proceedings.  In December 2015, the D.C. Circuit remanded the MATS rule to the EPA without vacatur. On April 25, 2016, the EPA released a supplemental finding that the benefits of this regulation outweigh the costs to address the U.S. Supreme Court's ruling that the EPA had not properly considered costs. This finding has been challenged in the D.C. Circuit. A number of regulations on GHGs, ambient air quality, coal combustion byproducts and water use with the potential for increased capital costs or operational impacts have been finalized and are under review by the courts. The design, timing and stringency of these regulations and the legal outcomes will affect the framework for the retrofit or retirement of existing fossil plants and deployment of new, cleaner technologies in the next decade. See Item 1— Business,Environmental Matters, for further discussion.

Public Policy Support and Government Financial Incentives for Clean Infrastructure Development— Policy mechanisms including production and investment tax credits, cash grants, loan guarantees, accelerated depreciation tax benefits, RPS, and carbon trading plans have been implemented at the state and federal levels to support the development of renewable generation, demand-side and smart grid, and other clean infrastructure technologies.  The availability and continuation of public policy support mechanisms will drive a significant part of the economics of the Company's development program.  In December 2015, the U.S. Congress enacted an extension of the 30% solar ITC so that projects which began construction in 2016 through 2019 will continue to qualify for the 30% ITC.  Projects beginning construction in 2020 and 2021 will be eligible for the ITC at the rates of 26% and 22% respectively.  The same legislation also extended the 10 year wind PTC for wind projects which began construction in years 2016 through 2019.  Wind projects which begin construction in the years 2017, 2018 and 2019 are eligible for PTC at 80%, 60% and 40% of the statutory rate per kilowatt hour respectively.

Weather— Weather conditions in the regions of the U.S. in which NRG does business influence the Company's financial results.  Weather conditions can affect the supply and demand for electricity and fuels.  Weather may also impact the availability of the Company's generating assets.  Changes in energy supply and demand may impact the price of these energy commodities in both the spot and forward markets, which may affect the Company's results in any given period. Typically, demand for and the price of electricity is higher in the summer and the winter seasons, when temperatures are more extreme. The demand for and price of natural gas is also generally higher in the winter.  However, all regions of the U.S. typically do not experience extreme weather conditions at the same time, thus NRG is typically not exposed to the effects of extreme weather in all parts of its business at once.

Wind and Solar Resource Availability— The availability of the wind and solar resources affects the financial performance of the wind and solar facilities, which may impact the Company’s overall financial performance. Due to the variable nature of the wind and solar resources, the Company cannot predict the availability of the wind and solar resources and the potential variances from expected performance levels from quarter to quarter. To the extent the wind and solar resources are not available at expected levels, it could have a negative impact on the Company’s financial performance for such periods.

CapitalMarket Conditions— The Company and its peer group, along with the broader energy sector, have recently experienced volatile conditions in the capital markets, including debt and equity markets, due to continued depressed commodity markets. These conditions, if they persist, may make it difficult for the Company, including GenOn and NRG Yield, Inc., to satisfy debt obligations which mature over the next few years at a reasonable cost. Further, NRG Yield, Inc.’s growth strategy depends on its ability to identify and acquire additional conventional and renewable facilities from the Company and unaffiliated third parties.  A prolonged disruption in the equity capital market conditions could make it difficult for NRG Yield, Inc. to obtain the necessary financing to successfully acquire projects, which could impact a source of the Company’s liquidity.

Other Factors— A number of other factors significantly influence the level and volatility of prices for energy commodities and related derivative products for NRG's business.  These factors include:

•seasonal, daily and hourly changes in demand;

•extreme peak demands;

•available supply resources;

•transportation and transmission availability and reliability within and between regions;

•location of NRG's generating facilities relative to the location of its load-serving opportunities;

•procedures used to maintain the integrity of the physical electricity system during extreme conditions; and

•changes in the nature and extent of federal and state regulations.










These factors can affect energy commodity and derivative prices in different ways and to different degrees.  These effects may vary throughout the country as a result of regional differences in:

•weather conditions;

•market liquidity;

•capability and reliability of the physical electricity and gas systems;

•local transportation systems; and

•the nature and extent of electricity deregulation.

•Impairment losses— During 2016, the Company recorded impairment losses of $918 million related to various facilities, as well as goodwill for its Texas reporting units, as discussed in more detail in Item 15—Note 10,Asset ImpairmentsandNote 11,Goodwill and Other Intangibles, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

•Impairment losses on investments— During 2016, the Company recorded impairment losses of $268 million related to various investments as discussed in more detail in Item 15—Note 10,Asset Impairmentsto the Consolidated Financial Statements.

•Transfers of Assets under Common Control—On September 1, 2016, the Company sold its remaining 51.05% interest in CVSR Holdco LLC, which indirectly owns the CVSR solar facility, to NRG Yield, Inc. for total cash consideration of $78.5 million, plus an immaterial working capital adjustment. NRG Yield, Inc. also assumed additional debt of $496 million, which represents 51.05% of the CVSR project level debt and 51.05% of the notes issued under the CVSR Holdco Financing Agreement.  In connection with the retrospective adjustment of prior periods, the Company now consolidates CVSR and100%of its debt, consisting of$771 millionof project level debt and$200 millionof notes issued under the CVSR Holdco Financing Agreement as of September 1, 2016.

•Fleet Optimization— The Company completed four coal-to-gas projects at the Big Cajun II, Joliet, Shawville and New Castle Generating Stations. Collectively, the modified units can generate more than 2,780 MW. Given the anticipated reductions in carbon emissions resulting from these modifications, combined with the expected operating profiles for the units, the four plants are expected to reduce their combined carbon footprint by more than 80%.

•Petra Nova Project Completion— The Company announced that its Petra Nova Carbon Capture Project, or the Petra Nova Project, reached commercial operation in the fourth quarter of 2016. The Petra Nova Project is a commercial-scale carbon capture system that captures CO2in the processed flue gas from an existing unit at the WA Parish power plant in Fort Bend County, southwest of Houston.

•Cottonwood Flooding— During March 2016, NRG's Cottonwood generating station was damaged by record flooding of the nearby Sabine River.  The generating station was returned to service in the third quarter of 2016.  The Company expects the restoration costs to be reimbursed through insurance recoveries. Through December 31, 2016, the Company has expensed $2 million and collected $27.5 million of insurance proceeds from property damage and $10 million of insurance proceeds from business interruption insurance.  The Company is continuing to work with insurers on further property and business interruption insurance recovery.  The Company does not anticipate recognizing additional expenses related to restoration costs.










Operational Matters

Sherwin Bankruptcy

The Company's Gregory cogeneration plant provided steam, processed water and a small percentage of its electrical generation to the Corpus Christi Sherwin Alumina plant pursuant to an Energy Service Agreement, or ESA. On January 11, 2016, Sherwin Alumina Company, or Sherwin, filed a voluntary petition with the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Texas for relief under Title 11 of the United States Code. Sherwin agreed to pay all owed pre-petition amounts and, post-petition, Sherwin performed its obligations under the ESA through September 2016 when it shut down its operations. On September 28, 2016, Sherwin filed a motion with the Bankruptcy Court to reject the ESA, which includes Gregory's lease, effective September 29, 2016. Gregory objected to the rejection and is asserting its right to remain on its leasehold. The Company is currently evaluating potential options for the Gregory cogeneration plant.

Gross Margin

The Company calculates gross margin in order to evaluate operating performance as operating revenues less cost of sales, which includes cost of fuel, other costs of sales, contract and emission credit amortization and mark-to-market for economic hedging activities.

Economic Gross Margin

In addition to gross margin, the Company evaluates its operating performance using the measure of economic gross margin, which is not a GAAP measure and may not be comparable to other companies’ presentations or deemed more useful than the GAAP information provided elsewhere in this report.  Economic gross margin should be viewed as a supplement to and not a substitute for the Company's presentation of gross margin, which is the most directly comparable GAAP measure.  Economic gross margin is not intended to represent gross margin.  The Company believes that economic gross margin is useful to investors as it is a key operational measure reviewed by the Company's chief operating decision maker.  Economic gross margin is defined as the sum of energy revenue, capacity revenue and other revenue, less cost of fuels and other cost of sales.

Economic gross margin does not include mark-to-market gains or losses on economic hedging activities, contract amortization, emission credit amortization, or other operating costs.

(a) Represents the elimination of the intercompany activity between Retail and Generation.

Mark-to-market results consist of unrealized gains and losses on contacts that are yet to be settled.  The settlement of these transactions is reflected in the same revenue or cost caption as the items being hedged.

The reversals of acquired gain or loss positions were valued based upon the forward prices on the acquisition date.

For the year endedDecember 31, 2016, the$865 millionloss in operating revenues from economic hedge positions was driven primarily by the reversal of previously recognized unrealized gains on contracts that settled during the period, a decrease in value of open positions as a result of increases in gas prices, in addition to the reversal of acquired contracts.  The$580 milliongain in operating costs and expenses from economic hedge positions was driven primarily by the reversal of previously recognized unrealized losses on contracts that settled during the period and an increase in the value of open positions as a result of increases in coal and gas prices partially offset by the reversal of acquired contracts.  As discussed in Item 15 — Note 5,Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the reversal of previously recognized gains and losses on settled positions related to economic hedges included in operating revenues and operating costs and expenses during the year ended December 31, 2016 include any gains or losses associated with positions that were closed out and financially settled with certain counterparties that would have otherwise been realized in future periods.

(Loss)/Gain on Debt Extinguishment

A loss on debt extinguishment of$142 millionwas recorded for the year endedDecember 31, 2016, primarily driven by the repurchase of NRG senior notes at a price above par value and the write-off of the unamortized debt issuance costs related to the replacement of the 2018 Term Loan Facility with the new 2023 Term Loan Facility.

A gain on debt extinguishment of$75 millionwas recorded for the year endedDecember 31, 2015, primarily driven by the repurchase of NRG senior notes due 2023 and 2024, GenOn senior notes due 2020 and GenOn Americas Generation senior notes due 2021 and 2031 at a price below par value, combined with the write-off of unamortized premium.

Interest Expense

NRG's interest expense decreased by$67 millionfor the year endedDecember 31, 2016, compared to the same period in2015, due to the following:

Gross Margin

The Company calculates gross margin in order to evaluate operating performance as operating revenues less cost of sales, which includes cost of fuel, other costs of sales, contract and emission credit amortization and mark-to-market for economic hedging activities.

Economic Gross Margin

In addition to gross margin, the Company evaluates its operating performance using the measure of economic gross margin, which is not a GAAP measure and may not be comparable to other companies’ presentations or deemed more useful than the GAAP information provided elsewhere in this report.  Economic gross margin should be viewed as a supplement to and not a substitute for the Company's presentation of gross margin, which is the most directly comparable GAAP measure.  Economic gross margin is not intended to represent gross margin.  The Company believes that economic gross margin is useful to investors as it is a key operational measure reviewed by the Company's chief operating decision maker.  Economic gross margin is defined as the sum of energy revenue, capacity revenue and other revenue, less cost of fuels and other cost of sales.

Economic gross margin does not include mark-to-market gains or losses on economic hedging activities, contract amortization, emission credit amortization, or other operating costs.

The tables below present the composition and reconciliation of gross margin and economic gross margin which reflects the Company's current view of reporting segments for the years endedDecember 31, 2015and2014:

Renewables gross margin increased$43 millionand economic gross margin increased$50 millionfor the year endedDecember 31, 2015, compared to the same period in2014, primarily driven by the EME acquisition in April 2014 and improved performance at the Ivanpah solar plant, as it continued toward full production capabilities.

NRG Yield gross margin and economic gross margin

NRG Yield gross margin increased$143 millionand economic gross margin increased$172 millionfor the year endedDecember 31, 2015, compared to the same period in2014, primarily related to the acquisition of the Alta Wind Assets in August 2014 as well as the acquisition of the January 2015 Drop Down Assets and the November 2015 Drop Down Assets from NRG, the majority of which were acquired by NRG from EME in April 2014.

Mark-to-market results consist of unrealized gains and losses on contracts that are not yet settled. The settlement of these transactions is reflected in the same revenue or cost caption as the items being hedged.

The reversals of acquired gain or loss positions were valued based upon the forward prices on the acquisition date.

For the year endedDecember 31, 2015, the$244 millionloss in operating revenues from economic hedge positions was driven primarily by the reversal of previously recognized unrealized gains on contracts that settled during the period and the reversal of acquired contracts largely offset by an increase in value of open positions as a result of decreases in ERCOT and PJM electricity prices. The$128 millionloss in operating costs and expenses from economic hedge positions was driven primarily by a decrease in the value of open positions as a result of decreases in ERCOT electricity and coal prices and the reversal of acquired contracts, largely offset by the reversal of previously recognized unrealized losses on contracts that settled during the period.

In accordance with ASC 815, the following table represents the results of the Company's financial and physical trading of energy commodities for the years endedDecember 31, 2015and2014. The realized and unrealized financial and physical trading results are included in operating revenues.

Acquisition-related Transaction and Integration Costs

NRG incurred transaction and integration costs of$10 millionfor the year endedDecember 31, 2015, compared to$84 millionfor the same period in2014. The reduction in transaction and integration costs is due primarily to the substantial completion of integration activities for the acquisition of Alta Wind, Dominion and EME in 2014.

Development Costs

NRG incurred development costs of$146 millionfor the year endedDecember 31, 2015, compared to$88 millionfor the same period in2014. This increase in development costs is due to increased development activities, primarily for Renewables and NRG EVgo.

Gain/(Loss) on Debt Extinguishment

A gain on debt extinguishment of$75 millionwas recorded for the year endedDecember 31, 2015, primarily driven by the repurchase of NRG senior notes due 2023 and 2024, GenOn senior notes due 2020 and GenOn Americas Generation senior notes due 2021 and 2031 at a price below par value, combined with the write-off of unamortized premium.

In the fourth quarter of 2014, a loss of$95 millionwas recorded primarily due to the redemption premiums from the redemption of the 2019 Senior Notes. These gains/losses also included the write-off of previously deferred financing costs.

Interest Expense

NRG's interest expense increased by$9 millionfor the year endedDecember 31, 2015, compared to the same period in2014, due to the following:

Income Tax Expense

For the year endedDecember 31, 2015, NRG recorded an income tax expense of$1,342 millionon a pre-tax loss of$5,094 million.

The effective tax rate was(26.3)%and2.2%for the years endedDecember 31, 2015and2014, respectively.

For the year endedDecember 31, 2015, NRG's overall effective tax rate was different than the statutory rate of 35% primarily due to recording of a valuation allowance on the federal and certain state net deferred tax assets that may not be realizable under a “more likely than not” measurement. In addition, a portion of the book goodwill impairment is classified as a permanent reversal impacting the effective tax rate.

The effective income tax rate may vary from period to period depending on, among other factors, the geographic and business mix of earnings and losses and changes in valuation allowances in accordance with ASC 740. These factors and others, including the Company's history of pre-tax earnings and losses, are taken into account in assessing the ability to realize deferred tax assets.

Net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests

Net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests was$54 millionfor the year endedDecember 31, 2015, compared to$2 millionfor the year endedDecember 31, 2014.  For the years endedDecember 31, 2015and2014, the net losses attributable to noncontrolling interests primarily reflect losses allocated to tax equity investors using the hypothetical liquidation at book value, or HLBV, method, offset in part by NRG Yield, Inc.'s share of net income for the period.







Liquidity and Capital Resources

Liquidity Position

As ofDecember 31, 2016and2015, NRG's liquidity, excluding collateral funds deposited by counterparties, was approximately $3.6 billion and $3.3 billion, respectively, comprised of the following:

(b)GenOn has the ability to draw on letters of credit associated with their intercompany revolving credit agreement with NRG.  As of December 31, 2016, $272 million of letters of credit were outstanding under this agreement for GenOn. Of this amount, $199 million were issued on behalf of GenOn Americas Generation, which includes $128 million issued on behalf of GenOn Mid-Atlantic.

(c)See Restricted Payments Tests, described below.



For the year endedDecember 31, 2016, total liquidity, excluding collateral funds deposited by counterparties, increased by $331 million.  Changes in cash and cash equivalent balances are further discussed hereinafter under the headingCash Flow Discussion.  Cash and cash equivalents atDecember 31, 2016were predominantly held in money market funds invested in treasury securities, treasury repurchase agreements or government agency debt.

Management believes that the Company's liquidity position and cash flows from operations will be adequate to finance operating and maintenance capital expenditures, to fund dividends to NRG's common stockholders, and other liquidity commitments with exception of commitments related to GenOn as further described below.  Management continues to regularly monitor the Company's ability to finance the needs of its operating, financing and investing activity within the dictates of prudent balance sheet management.

Restricted Payments Tests

Of the $2.0 billion of cash and cash equivalents of the Company as of

December 31, 2016

, $471 million and $100 million were held by GenOn Mid-Atlantic and REMA, respectively.  The ability of certain of GenOn’s and GenOn Americas Generation’s subsidiaries to pay dividends and make distributions is restricted under the terms of certain agreements, including the GenOn Mid-Atlantic and REMA operating leases.  Under their respective operating leases, GenOn Mid-Atlantic and REMA are not permitted to make any distributions and other restricted payments unless:  (a) they satisfy the fixed charge coverage ratio for the most recently ended period of four fiscal quarters; (b) they are projected to satisfy the fixed charge coverage ratio for each of the two following periods of four fiscal quarters, commencing with the fiscal quarter in which such payment is proposed to be made; and (c) no significant lease default or event of default has occurred and is continuing.  In addition, prior to making a dividend or other restricted payment, GenOn Mid-Atlantic and REMA must be in compliance with the requirement to provide credit support to the owner lessors securing their obligations to pay scheduled rent under their respective leases. Based on GenOn Mid-Atlantic’s and REMA’s most recent calculations of these tests, GenOn Mid-Atlantic and REMA did not satisfy the restricted payments tests.  As a result, as of

December 31, 2016

, GenOn Mid-Atlantic and REMA could not make distributions of cash and certain other restricted payments.  Each of GenOn Mid-Atlantic and REMA may recalculate its fixed charge coverage ratios from time to time and, subject to compliance with the restricted payments test described above, make dividends or other restricted payments.

To the extent GenOn Mid-Atlantic or REMA are able to pay dividends to GenOn, the GenOn Senior Notes due 2018 and 2020 and the related indentures restrict the ability of GenOn to incur additional liens and make certain restricted payments, including dividends.  In the event of a default or if restricted payment tests are not satisfied, GenOn would not be able to distribute cash to its parent, NRG.  AtDecember 31, 2016, GenOn did not meet the consolidated debt ratio component of the restricted payments test.












GenOn Liquidity

As disclosed in Item 15 - Note 1,Nature of Business, and Note 12,Debt and Capital Leases, to the Consolidated Financial Statements, $691 million of GenOn's Senior Notes, excluding $8 million of associated premiums, are current within the GenOn consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2016 and are due on June 15, 2017.  GenOn's future profitability continues to be adversely affected by (i) a sustained decline in natural gas prices and its resulting effect on wholesale power prices and capacity prices, and (ii) the inability of GenOn Mid-Atlantic and REMA to make distributions of cash and certain other restricted payments to GenOn.  Based on current projections, GenOn is not expected to have sufficient liquidity to repay the Senior Notes due in June 2017.  As a result of these factors, there is substantial doubt about GenOn's ability to continue as a going concern. As a result of the substantial doubt about GenOn’s ability to continue as a going concern, along with additional factors, there is substantial doubt about certain of GenOn’s subsidiaries’ ability to continue as a going concern.

The Company, GenOn's parent company, has no obligation to provide any financial support to GenOn other than under the secured intercompany revolving credit agreement between the Company and GenOn and NRG Americas. As of December 31, 2016, $228 million was available to be used by GenOn under the $500 million revolving credit agreement. As controlled group members, ERISA requires that NRG and GenOn are jointly and severally liable for the NRG Pension Plan for Bargained Employees and the NRG Pension Plan, including the pension liabilities associated with GenOn employees.

GenOn is currently considering all options available to it, including negotiations with creditors, refinancing the GenOn Senior Notes, potential sales of certain generating assets as well as the possibility for a need to file for protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.  During 2016, GenOn appointed two independent directors, retained advisors and established a separate audit committee as part of this process. Any resolution may have a material impact on the Company's statement of operations, cash flows and financial position.



As of December 31, 2016, GenOn represents 15.6% of the Company's consolidated total assets, 16.9% of the Company's consolidated total liabilities and contributed $94 million to the Company's consolidated cash from operations in 2016.



Credit Ratings

On March 3, 2016 and March 21, 2016, respectively, S&P and Moody's reaffirmed the corporate credit ratings on NRG Energy, Inc.

On October 7, 2016, GenOn's corporate credit rating was lowered by Moody's from Caa2 to Caa3 and its probability of default rating was lowered from Caa2-PD to Caa3-PD. In addition, Moody's also lowered the ratings of REMA and GenOn Mid-Atlantic's pass through certificates to Caa1 from B2. This is an update from March 21, 2016, at which time GenOn's corporate credit rating was lowered from B3 to Caa2. At that time, Moody's also lowered the issue level ratings on the GenOn senior notes from B3 to Caa2 and the GenOn America's Generation senior notes from Caa1 to Caa2.

On August 15, 2016, S&P lowered its corporate credit ratings on NRG Yield, Inc. and the NRG Yield Operating 2024 Senior Notes to BB from BB+. The ratings outlook is stable.

On January 10, 2017, GenOn's corporate credit rating was further lowered by S&P to CCC- from CCC.  The ratings outlook for GenOn, GenOn Americas Generation, GenOn Mid-Atlantic and REMA is negative.

Uses of Liquidity

The Company's requirements for liquidity and capital resources, other than for operating its facilities, can generally be categorized by the following: (i) commercial operations activities; (ii) debt service obligations, as described more fully in Item 15 —Note 12,Debt and Capital Leases, to the Consolidated Financial Statements; (iii) capital expenditures, including repowering and renewable development, and environmental; and (iv) allocations in connection with acquisition opportunities, debt repayments, return of capital and dividend payments to stockholders, as described in Item 15 —Note 15,Capital Structure, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Commercial Operations

2016 Utility-Scale Solar and Wind Acquisition

On November 2, 2016, the Company acquired equity interests in a tax equity portfolio from SunEdison, located in Utah, comprised of530MW of mechanically-complete solar assets, of which NRG’s net interest based on cash to be distributed is265MW, for upfront cash consideration of$111 million.  In connection with the acquisition, the Company assumed non-recourse debt of $222 million.  The Company also borrowed additional amounts of$65 millionduring the fourth quarter of 2016, as described inNote 12,Debt and Capital Leases, which effectively reduced the Company's use of liquidity related to the acquisition. The Company does not have a controlling interest in the tax equity portfolio and, accordingly, its interest is recorded as an equity method investment. The purchase price was preliminarily allocated to the equity method investment balance of approximately$328 million, current assets of$5 millionand the assumed non-recourse debt of$222 million. The assets reached commercial operations during the fourth quarter of 2016 and have 20-year PPAs with PacificCorp.

The Company acquired a110MW portfolio of construction-ready and 71 MW of development solar assets in Hawaii from SunEdison for upfront cash consideration of$2 millionon October 3, 2016 and a154MW construction-ready solar project in Texas for upfront cash consideration of$11 millionon November 9, 2016.

In addition to the total$124 millionin upfront cash consideration paid for the above three acquisitions, the Company expects to make an estimated$59 millionin additional payments contingent upon future development milestones.

On October 3, 2016, the Company acquired a29MW portfolio of mechanically-complete and construction-ready distributed generation solar assets from SunEdison for cash consideration of approximately$67 millionexcluding post-closing adjustments  which reduced the purchase price by$5 million.  Subsequent to the acquisition, the Company sold the majority of these assets into a tax-equity financed portfolio within the DGPV Holdco partnership between NRG and NRG Yield, Inc., and expects to sell the remaining assets into a similar portfolio in 2017. The purchase price was preliminarily allocated to $47 million in construction in progress and $15 million in intangibles.

GenOn Mid-Atlantic Prepaid Letter of Credit

On January 27, 2017, GenOn Mid-Atlantic entered into an agreement with Natixis under which Natixis will procure payment and credit support for the payment of certain lease payments owed pursuant to the GenOn Mid-Atlantic operating leases for Morgantown and Dickerson.  GenOn Mid-Atlantic made a payment of $130 million plus fees of $1 million as consideration for Natixis applying for the issuance of, and obtaining, letters of credit from Natixis, New York Branch, the LC Provider, to support the lease payments.  Natixis is solely responsible for (i) obtaining letters of credit from the LC Provider, (ii) causing the letters of credit to be issued to the lessors to support the lease payments on behalf of GenOn Mid-Atlantic, (iii) making lease payments and (iv) satisfying any reimbursement obligations payable to the LC Provider.

NOLs, Deferred Tax Assets and Uncertain Tax Position Implications, under ASC 740

As ofDecember 31, 2016, the Company had domestic pre-tax book loss of$886 millionand foreign pre-tax book income of$11 million.  For the year endedDecember 31, 2016, the Company utilized carryforward NOLs of $507 million to fully offset current year taxable income.  As ofDecember 31, 2016, the Company has cumulative domestic federal NOL carryforwards of$3.4 billionwhich will begin expiring in 2026 and cumulative state NOL carryforwards of$4.9 billionfor financial statement purposes.  In addition, NRG has cumulative foreign NOL carryforwards of$196 million, which do not have an expiration date.  As a result of the Company's tax position, and based on current forecasts, the Company anticipates income tax payments, primarily due to state and local jurisdictions, of up to $35 million in 2017.

In addition to these amounts, the Company has$34 millionof tax effected uncertain tax benefits for which the Company has recorded a non-current tax liability of$37 millionuntil such final resolution with the related taxing authority. The$37 millionnon-current tax liability for uncertain tax benefits is from positions taken on various state returns, including accrued interest.

The Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal income tax examinations for years prior to 2015.  With few exceptions, state and local income tax examinations are no longer open for years before 2010.





Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

Obligations under Certain Guarantee Contracts

NRG and certain of its subsidiaries enter into guarantee arrangements in the normal course of business to facilitate commercial transactions with third parties. These arrangements include financial and performance guarantees, stand-by letters of credit, debt guarantees, surety bonds and indemnifications. See also Item 15 —Note 26,Guarantees,to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion.

Retained or Contingent Interests

NRG does not have any material retained or contingent interests in assets transferred to an unconsolidated entity.

Obligations Arising Out of a Variable Interest in an Unconsolidated Entity

Variable interest in Equity investments— As ofDecember 31, 2016, NRG has several investments with an ownership interest percentage of 50% or less in energy and energy-related entities that are accounted for under the equity method of accounting. Several of these investments are variable interest entities for which NRG is not the primary beneficiary.

NRG's pro-rata share of non-recourse debt held by unconsolidated affiliates was approximately$633 millionas ofDecember 31, 2016.  This indebtedness may restrict the ability of these subsidiaries to issue dividends or distributions to NRG. See also Item 15 —Note 16,Investments Accounted for by the Equity Method and Variable Interest Entities,to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion.










Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments

NRG has a variety of contractual obligations and other commercial commitments that represent prospective cash requirements in addition to the Company's capital expenditure programs. The following tables summarize NRG's contractual obligations and contingent obligations for guarantees. See also Item 15 —Note 12,Debt and Capital Leases,Note 22,Commitments and Contingencies, andNote 26,Guarantees, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion.

Fair Value of Derivative Instruments

NRG may enter into power purchase and sales contracts, fuel purchase contracts and other energy-related financial instruments to mitigate variability in earnings due to fluctuations in spot market prices and to hedge fuel requirements at generation facilities or retail load obligations. In addition, in order to mitigate interest rate risk associated with the issuance of the Company's variable rate and fixed rate debt, NRG enters into interest rate swap agreements.

NRG's trading activities are subject to limits in accordance with the Company's Risk Management Policy. These contracts are recognized on the balance sheet at fair value and changes in the fair value of these derivative financial instruments are recognized in earnings.

The tables below disclose the activities that include both exchange and non-exchange traded contracts accounted for at fair value in accordance with ASC 820,Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures, or ASC 820. Specifically, these tables disaggregate realized and unrealized changes in fair value; disaggregate estimated fair values atDecember 31, 2016, based on their level within the fair value hierarchy defined in ASC 820; and indicate the maturities of contracts atDecember 31, 2016.  For a full discussion of the Company's valuation methodology of its contracts, seeDerivative Fair Value Measurementsin Item 15 —Note 4,Fair Value of Financial Instruments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

The Company has elected to disclose derivative assets and liabilities on a trade-by-trade basis and does not offset amounts at the counterparty master agreement level. Also, collateral received or posted on the Company's derivative assets or liabilities are recorded on a separate line item on the balance sheet. Consequently, the magnitude of the changes in individual current and non-current derivative assets or liabilities is higher than the underlying credit and market risk of the Company's portfolio. As discussed in Item 7A— Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk, Commodity Price Risk, NRG measures the sensitivity of the Company's portfolio to potential changes in market prices using VaR, a statistical model which attempts to predict risk of loss based on market price and volatility. NRG's risk management policy places a limit on one-day holding period VaR, which limits the Company's net open position.  As the Company's trade-by-trade derivative accounting results in a gross-up of the Company's derivative assets and liabilities, the net derivative assets and liability position is a better indicator of NRG's hedging activity.  As ofDecember 31, 2016, NRG's net derivative liability was$127 million, a decrease to total fair value of$133 millionas compared toDecember 31, 2015.  This decrease was primarily driven by the roll-off of trades that settled during the period partially offset by gains in fair value.

Based on a sensitivity analysis using simplified assumptions, the impact of a $0.50 per MMBtu increase in natural gas prices across the term of the derivative contracts would result in a decrease of approximately$30 millionin the net value of derivatives as ofDecember 31, 2016.

The impact of a $0.50 per MMBtu decrease in natural gas prices across the term of the derivative contracts would result in an increase of approximately$15 millionin the net value of derivatives as ofDecember 31, 2016.












Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

NRG's discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations are based upon the Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements and related disclosures in compliance with GAAP requires the application of appropriate technical accounting rules and guidance as well as the use of estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. The application of these policies involves judgments regarding future events, including the likelihood of success of particular projects, legal and regulatory challenges, and the fair value of certain assets and liabilities. These judgments, in and of themselves, could materially affect the financial statements and disclosures based on varying assumptions, which may be appropriate to use. In addition, the financial and operating environment may also have a significant effect, not only on the operation of the business, but on the results reported through the application of accounting measures used in preparing the financial statements and related disclosures, even if the nature of the accounting policies have not changed.

On an ongoing basis, NRG evaluates these estimates, utilizing historic experience, consultation with experts and other methods the Company considers reasonable. In any event, actual results may differ substantially from the Company's estimates. Any effects on the Company's business, financial position or results of operations resulting from revisions to these estimates are recorded in the period in which the information that gives rise to the revision becomes known.

NRG's significant accounting policies are summarized in Item 15 —Note 2,Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to the consolidated financial statements. The Company identifies its most critical accounting policies as those that are the most pervasive and important to the portrayal of the Company's financial position and results of operations, and that require the most difficult, subjective and/or complex judgments by management regarding estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain.

Derivative Instruments

The Company follows the guidance of ASC 815 to account for derivative instruments. ASC 815 requires the Company to mark-to-market all derivative instruments on the balance sheet and recognize changes in the fair value of non-hedge derivative instruments immediately in earnings.  In certain cases, NRG may apply hedge accounting to the Company's derivative instruments. The criteria used to determine if hedge accounting treatment is appropriate are: (i) the designation of the hedge to an underlying exposure; (ii) whether the overall risk is being reduced; and (iii) if there is a correlation between the changes in fair value of the derivative instrument and the underlying hedged item.  Changes in the fair value of derivatives instruments accounted for as hedges are either recognized in earnings as an offset to the changes in the fair value of the related hedged item, or deferred and recorded as a component of OCI and subsequently recognized in earnings when the hedged transactions occur.

For purposes of measuring the fair value of derivative instruments, NRG uses quoted exchange prices and broker quotes.  When external prices are not available, NRG uses internal models to determine the fair value.  These internal models include assumptions of the future prices of energy commodities based on the specific market in which the energy commodity is being purchased or sold, using externally available forward market pricing curves for all periods possible under the pricing model.  In order to qualify the derivative instruments for hedged transactions, NRG estimates the forecasted generation and forecasted borrowings for interest rate swaps occurring within a specified time period. Judgments related to the probability of forecasted generation occurring are based on available baseload capacity, internal forecasts of sales and generation, and historical physical delivery on similar contracts.  Judgments related to the probability of forecasted borrowings are based on the estimated timing of project construction, which can vary based on various factors.  The probability that hedged forecasted generation and forecasted borrowings will occur by the end of a specified time period could change the results of operations by requiring amounts currently classified in OCI to be reclassified into earnings, creating increased variability in the Company's earnings.  These estimations are considered to be critical accounting estimates.

Certain derivative instruments that meet the criteria for derivative accounting treatment also qualify for a scope exception to derivative accounting, as they are considered to be NPNS.  The availability of this exception is based upon the assumption that NRG has the ability and it is probable to deliver or take delivery of the underlying item.  These assumptions are based on available baseload capacity, internal forecasts of sales and generation and historical physical delivery on contracts.  Derivatives that are considered to be NPNS are exempt from derivative accounting treatment and are accounted for under accrual accounting.  If it is determined that a transaction designated as NPNS no longer meets the scope exception due to changes in estimates, the related contract would be recorded on the balance sheet at fair value combined with the immediate recognition through earnings.

Income Taxes and Valuation Allowance for Deferred Tax Assets

As ofDecember 31, 2016, NRG had a valuation allowance of$3.9 billion.  This amount is comprised of domestic federal net deferred tax assets of approximately$3.4 billion, domestic state net deferred tax assets of$534 million, foreign net operating loss carryforwards of$63 million, and foreign capital loss carryforwards of approximately$1 million.  The Company believes it is more likely than not that the results of future operations will not generate sufficient taxable income which includes the future reversal of existing taxable temporary differences to realize deferred tax assets, requiring a valuation allowance to be recorded.

NRG continues to be under audit for multiple years by taxing authorities in other jurisdictions.  Considerable judgment is required to determine the tax treatment of a particular item that involves interpretations of complex tax laws.  NRG is subject to examination by taxing authorities for income tax returns filed in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and various state and foreign jurisdictions including operations located in Australia.

The Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal income tax examinations for years prior to 2015.  With few exceptions, state and local income tax examinations are no longer open for years before 2010.












Evaluation of Assets for Impairment and Other-Than-Temporary Decline in Value

In accordance with ASC 360,Property, Plant, and Equipment, or ASC 360, NRG evaluates property, plant and equipment and certain intangible assets for impairment whenever indicators of impairment exist. Examples of such indicators or events are:

•Significant decrease in the market price of a long-lived asset;

•Significant adverse change in the manner an asset is being used or its physical condition;

•Adverse business climate;

•Accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected for the construction or acquisition of an asset;

•Current period loss combined with a history of losses or the projection of future losses; and

•Change in the Company's intent about an asset from an intent to hold to a greater than 50% likelihood that an asset will be sold or disposed of before the end of its previously estimated useful life.

Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of the assets to the future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset, through considering project specific assumptions for long-term power pool prices, escalated future project operating costs and expected plant operations. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets by factoring in the probability weighting of different courses of action available to the Company. Generally, fair value will be determined using valuation techniques such as the present value of expected future cash flows. NRG uses its best estimates in making these evaluations and considers various factors, including forward price curves for energy, fuel costs and operating costs. However, actual future market prices and project costs could vary from the assumptions used in the Company's estimates, and the impact of such variations could be material.

The following long-lived asset impairments were recorded during 2016, as further described in Item 15 —Note 10,Asset Impairments, to the consolidated financial statements:

•During the second quarter of 2016, the Company identified triggering events for the Mandalay and Ormond Beach facilities and performed impairment tests.  Based on the results of the impairment tests, the Company determined that the carrying amount of these assets was higher than the estimated future net cash flows expected to be generated by the respective assets and that the Mandalay and Ormond Beach assets were impaired.  The fair value of the Mandalay and Ormond Beach operating units was determined using the income approach which utilizes estimates of discounted future cash flows, and include key inputs such as forecasted contract prices, forecasted operating expenses and discount rates. The Company recorded an impairment loss of $16 million and $43 million for Mandalay and Ormond Beach, respectively.

•During the second quarter of 2016, the Company also recorded impairment losses of $17 million to record the Rockford generating station at its sale price.










•During the fourth quarter of 2016, the Company identified triggering events for the following facilities:

◦Wind Facilities- In connection with the preparation of the annual budget, it was noted that the cash flows for the Elbow Creek and Goat Wind projects, located in Texas, and the Forward project, located in Pennsylvania, were below the carrying value of the related assets, primarily driven by declining merchant power prices in post-contract periods, and the assets were considered impaired.  The fair value of the facilities was determined using an income approach by applying a discounted cash flow methodology to the long-term budgets for each respective plant.  The income approach utilized estimates of discounted future cash flows and includes key inputs such as forecasted power prices, operations and maintenance expense, and discount rates.  The Company recorded impairment losses of $117 million, $60 million and $6 million for Elbow Creek, Goat Wind and Forward, respectively.

◦Long Beach- The Company determined that it would retire its Long Beach generation station by the end of 2017, as it was not awarded a PPA in the recent SCE capacity auction and the current PPA will expire on July 31, 2017.  The fair value was determined using an income approach and the Company recorded an impairment loss of $36 million to reduce the carrying amount of the facility to the value of the underlying land.

◦Ormond Beach- In connection with the preparation of the annual budget, the Company concluded that the declining prices for resource adequacy contracts in the area in which Ormond Beach operates further reduced expected cash flows for the facility and considered this to be an indicator of impairment.  The cash flows associated with Ormond Beach were less than the carrying amount and the Company determined the facility was impaired.  The fair value was determined using an income approach, which utilizes estimates of discounted future cash flows and include key inputs such as forecasted contract prices, forecasted operating expenses and discount rates. The Company recorded an impairment loss of $28 million to reduce the carrying amount to fair value.

◦Keystone and Conemaugh Leased Interests- In connection with the preparation of the annual budget, the Company noted that the cash flows for the leased interests in Keystone and Conemaugh were below the carrying amount of the assets, primarily driven by a reduction in long-term energy and capacity prices in PJM and maintenance costs , and the assets were impaired.  The fair value of the interests in Keystone and Conemaugh were determined using the income approach, which utilizes estimates of future discounted cash flows and include key inputs such as forecasted power, capacity and fuel prices, forecasted operating expenses, contractual lease payments, and discount rates.  The Company recorded impairment losses of $97 million and $10 million for Conemaugh and Keystone, respectively.

◦Pittsburg- The Company determined that it would need to retire the Pittsburg facility earlier than anticipated as it did not receive a resource adequacy contract for 2017. The Company considered this to be a triggering event, and tested the asset for impairment.  The fair value of the facility was determined using an income approach and the Company recorded an impairment loss of $20 million to reduce the carrying amount to the value of the underlying land.

Other Impairments- During 2016, the Company recorded other impairment losses of $131 million, which included $23 million in excess SO2allowances,$23 millionfor intangible assets,$19 millionin previously purchased solar panels, $18 million in deferred marketing expenses, and $48 million of other impairment losses.












NRG is also required to evaluate its equity method and cost method investments to determine whether or not they are impaired in accordance with ASC 323,Investments - Equity Method and Joint Ventures, or ASC 323.  The standard for determining whether an impairment must be recorded under ASC 323 is whether a decline in the value is considered an other-than-temporary decline in value.  The evaluation and measurement of impairments under ASC 323 involves the same uncertainties as described for long-lived assets that the Company owns directly and accounts for in accordance with ASC 360.  Similarly, the estimates that NRG makes with respect to its equity and cost-method investments are subjective, and the impact of variations in these estimates could be material.  Additionally, if the projects in which the Company holds these investments recognize an impairment under the provisions of ASC 360, NRG would record its proportionate share of that impairment loss and would evaluate its investment for an other-than-temporary decline in value under ASC 323.  During the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company recorded impairment losses on its equity method and cost method investments of$268 milliondue to other-than-temporary declines in value, including the following:

•During the first quarter of 2016, management changed its plans with respect to its future capital commitments driven in part by the continued decline in oil prices. As a result, the Company reviewed its 50% interest in Petra Nova Parish Holdings for impairment utilizing the other-than-temporary impairment model. In determining fair value, the Company utilized an income approach and considered project specific assumptions for the future project cash flows. The carrying amount of the Company's equity method investment exceeded the fair value of the investment and the Company concluded that the decline is considered to be other-than-temporary.  As a result, the Company measured the impairment loss as the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value of the investment and recorded an impairment loss of $140 million.

•During the fourth quarter of 2016, the Company offered several projects to NRG Yield Operating LLC including its interest in Community Wind North.  The offer price was below its current carrying amount and this decline in fair value was determined to be other-than-temporary.  Accordingly, the Company recorded an impairment loss of $36 million to reduce its carrying amount to fair value. In addition, in connection with the preparation of the annual budget, the Company noted that it could not budget for its interest in the Sherbino wind facility beyond 2018 due to its debt maturity date and the anticipated difficulty in refinancing the debt that would mature in 2018.  Accordingly, the Company determined that an other-than-temporary impairment existed and recorded an impairment loss on its investment in Sherbino of $70 million.

•During 2016, the Company recorded $22 million of impairment losses for other investments.

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

AtDecember 31, 2016, NRG reported goodwill of$662 million, consisting of $276 million associated with the acquisition of EME, $341 million for retail business acquisitions, and $45 million associated with other business acquisitions.  The Company also recorded intangible assets, measured primarily based on significant inputs that are not observable in the market and thus represent a Level 3 measurement as defined in ASC 820.  See Item 15 —Note 3,Business Acquisitions and Dispositions, andNote 11,Goodwill and Other Intangibles, to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion.

The Company performed step zero of the goodwill impairment test, performing its qualitative assessment of macroeconomic, industry and market events and circumstances, and the overall financial performance of the NRG Business Solutions (NRG Curtailment Solutions) and Retail Mass reporting unit.  The Company determined it was not more likely than not that the fair value of the goodwill attributed to these reporting units were less than their carrying amount and accordingly, no impairment existed for the year ended December 31, 2016.










The Company performed step one of the two-step impairment test for the reporting units in the following table.  The Company determined the fair value of these reporting units using primarily an income approach.  Under the income approach, the Company estimated the fair value of the reporting units' invested capital exceeds its carrying value and, as such, the Company concluded that goodwill associated with the reporting units in the following table is not impaired as of December 31, 2016:

Reporting Unit (Segment)% Fair Value Over Carrying ValueBETM (Generation, formerly Corporate)169%Midwest Generation (Generation)105Texas Non-Commodity (excluding Goal Zero) (Retail, formerly Retail Mass)286Solar Power Partners (Renewables)132Goal Zero (Retail, formerly Retail Mass)123

The Company also performed step one of the two-step impairment test for its Texas reporting unit.  The Company determined the fair value of the Texas reporting unit primarily using an income approach.  The fair value of the reporting unit was determined to be less than its carrying amount and, accordingly, the Company performed step two of the two-step impairment test. The results of this impairment test are detailed below and in Item 15 -Note 10,Asset Impairments, to the consolidated financial statements.

The Company believes the methodology and assumptions used in the valuation are consistent with the views of market participants.  Significant inputs to the determination of fair value were as follows:

•The Company applied a discounted cash flow methodology to the long-term budgets for all of the plants in the region. The significant assumptions used to derive the long-term budgets used in the income approach are affected by the following key inputs:

◦The Company's views of power and fuel prices consider market prices for the first five-year period and the Company's fundamental view for the longer term, which reflect the Company's long-term view of the price of natural gas.  The Company's fundamental view for the longer term reflects the implied power price and heat rate that would support new build of a combined cycle gas plant in the Texas region. The price of natural gas plays an important role in setting the price of electricity in many of the regions where NRG operates power plants.  Hedging is included to the extent of contracts already in place;

◦The Company's estimate of generation, fuel costs, capital expenditure requirements and the existing and anticipated impact of environmental regulations;

◦The Company's fundamental view for the longer term, cash flows for the plants in the region were included in the fair value calculation through the end of each plants' estimated useful life; and

◦Projected generation and resulting energy gross margin in the long-term budgets is based on an hourly dispatch that simulates dispatch of each unit into the power market.  The dispatch simulation is based on power prices, fuel prices, and the physical and economic characteristics of each plant.

•The additional significant assumptions used in overall valuation of the Texas reporting unit were as follows:

◦The discount rate applied to internally developed cash flow projections for the Texas reporting unit represents the weighted average cost of capital consistent with the risk inherent in future cash flows and based upon an assumed capital structure, cost of long-term debt and cost of equity consistent with comparable companies in the integrated utility industry.

◦The intangible value to Texas for synergies it provides to NRG’s retail businesses. The estimates of annual collateral cost savings resulting from utilizing the Company's wholesale generation assets to provide supply to retail represent the cost of collateral that would otherwise need to be held in reserve to support potential postings to third parties in the case of a significant price move.  This is calculated from a combination of the volume the Company would otherwise need to buy from these third parties, based on historical volumes, and historical price movements calibrated to an appropriate probability. The estimates of annual supply cost savings are based on historical volumes of retail purchases from Texas, an average bid-ask spread based on broker quotes and the assumption that Texas will realize half of the benefits associated with this savings.










Under step one, if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, goodwill of the reporting unit is not considered impaired.  Under the income approach described above, the Company estimated that the fair value of Texas' invested capital was43%below its carrying value as ofDecember 31, 2016and concluded that step two was required.  Step two requires an allocation of fair value to the individual asset and liabilities using a hypothetical purchase price allocation in order to determine the implied fair value of goodwill. If the implied fair value of goodwill is less than the carrying amount, an impairment loss is recorded.  Under the step two analysis it was determined that the carrying amount of the goodwill exceeded its fair value by the remaining$337 millionand an impairment loss of this amount was recorded.

The Company’s Midwest Generation reporting unit receives a significant portion of its revenues from the capacity markets in PJM and the results of each annual auction can have a significant impact on Midwest Generation’s future performance.  Accordingly, if Midwest Generation’s future revenues are significantly reduced as a result of the 2017 annual auction, the Company may consider that to be a triggering event and may be required to evaluate the Midwest Generation goodwill of $165 million for impairment.  The Company may also be required to evaluate the property, plant and equipment for the Midwest Generation facilities for impairment. Depending on the results, it is possible that one of both of the assets could be impaired.

Fair value determinations require considerable judgment and are sensitive to changes in underlying assumptions and factors.  As a result, there can be no assurance that the estimates and assumptions made for purposes of the annual goodwill impairment test will prove to be accurate predictions of the future.

Contingencies

NRG records reserves for estimated losses from contingencies when information available indicates that a loss is probable and the amount of the loss, or range of loss, can be reasonably estimated. Gain contingencies are not recorded until management determines it is certain that the future event will become or does become a reality.  Such determinations are subject to interpretations of current facts and circumstances, forecasts of future events, and estimates of the financial impacts of such events.  NRG describes in detail its contingencies in Item 15 —Note 22,Commitments and Contingencies,to the consolidated financial statements.

Recent Accounting Developments

See Item 15 —Note 2,Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of recent accounting developments.












Item 7A — Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

NRG is exposed to several market risks in the Company's normal business activities.  Market risk is the potential loss that may result from market changes associated with the Company's merchant power generation or with an existing or forecasted financial or commodity transaction.  The types of market risks the Company is exposed to are commodity price risk, interest rate risk, liquidity risk, credit risk and currency exchange risk.  In order to manage, these risks the Company uses various fixed-price forward purchase and sales contracts, futures and option contracts traded on NYMEX, and swaps and options traded in the over-the-counter financial markets to:

•Manage and hedge fixed-price purchase and sales commitments;

•Manage and hedge exposure to variable rate debt obligations;

•Reduce exposure to the volatility of cash market prices, and

•Hedge fuel requirements for the Company's generating facilities.

Commodity Price Risk

Commodity price risks result from exposures to changes in spot prices, forward prices, volatilities, and correlations between various commodities, such as natural gas, electricity, coal, oil, and emissions credits.  NRG manages the commodity price risk of the Company's merchant generation operations and load serving obligations by entering into various derivative or non-derivative instruments to hedge the variability in future cash flows from forecasted sales and purchases of electricity and fuel.  These instruments include forwards, futures, swaps, and option contracts traded on various exchanges, such as NYMEX and ICE, as well as over-the-counter markets.  The portion of forecasted transactions hedged may vary based upon management's assessment of market, weather, operation and other factors.

While some of the contracts the Company uses to manage risk represent commodities or instruments for which prices are available from external sources, other commodities and certain contracts are not actively traded and are valued using other pricing sources and modeling techniques to determine expected future market prices, contract quantities, or both.  NRG uses the Company's best estimates to determine the fair value of those derivative contracts.  However, it is likely that future market prices could vary from those used in recording mark-to-market derivative instrument valuation and such variations could be material.

NRG measures the risk of the Company's portfolio using several analytical methods, including sensitivity tests, scenario tests, stress tests, position reports, and VaR.  NRG uses a Monte Carlo simulation based VaR model to estimate the potential loss in the fair value of the Company's energy assets and liabilities, which includes generation assets, load obligations, and bilateral physical and financial transactions.  The key assumptions for the Company's VaR model include: (i) lognormal distribution of prices; (ii) one-day holding period; (iii)  95% confidence interval; (iv) rolling 36-month forward looking period; and (v) market implied volatilities and historical price correlations.

As ofDecember 31, 2016, the VaR for NRG's commodity portfolio, including generation assets, load obligations and bilateral physical and financial transactions calculated using the VaR model was$41 million.

The following table summarizes average, maximum and minimum VaR for NRG for the years endedDecember 31, 2016and2015:

(In millions)20162015VaR as of December 31,$41$54For the year ended December 31,Average$53$42Maximum7255Minimum3230

Due to the inherent limitations of statistical measures such as VaR, the evolving nature of the competitive markets for electricity and related derivatives, and the seasonality of changes in market prices, the VaR calculation may not capture the full extent of commodity price exposure.  As a result, actual changes in the fair value of mark-to-market energy assets and liabilities could differ from the calculated VaR, and such changes could have a material impact on the Company's financial results.

In order to provide additional information, the Company also uses VaR to estimate the potential loss of derivative financial instruments that are subject to mark-to-market accounting.  These derivative instruments include transactions that were entered into for both asset management and trading purposes.  The VaR for the derivative financial instruments calculated using the diversified VaR model for the entire term of these instruments entered into for both asset management and trading was$65 millionas of December 31, 2016, primarily driven by asset-backed transactions.










Interest Rate Risk

NRG is exposed to fluctuations in interest rates through the Company's issuance of fixed rate and variable rate debt.  Exposures to interest rate fluctuations may be mitigated by entering into derivative instruments known as interest rate swaps, caps, collars and put or call options.  These contracts reduce exposure to interest rate volatility and result in primarily fixed rate debt obligations when taking into account the combination of the variable rate debt and the interest rate derivative instrument.  NRG's risk management policies allow the Company to reduce interest rate exposure from variable rate debt obligations.

In addition to those discussed above, the Company's project subsidiaries enter into interest rate swaps, intended to hedge the risks associated with interest rates on non-recourse project level debt.  See Item 15 —Note 12,Debt and Capital Leases, to the Consolidated Financial Statements, for more information about interest rate swaps of the Company's project subsidiaries.

If all of the above swaps had been discontinued onDecember 31, 2016, the Company would have owed the counterparties$46 million.  Based on the investment grade rating of the counterparties, NRG believes its exposure to credit risk due to nonperformance by counterparties to its hedge contracts to be insignificant.

NRG has both long and short-term debt instruments that subject the Company to the risk of loss associated with movements in market interest rates.  As ofDecember 31, 2016, a 1% change in interest rates would result in a$13 millionchange in interest expense on a rolling twelve month basis.

As ofDecember 31, 2016, the Company's debt fair value was $18.6 billion and carrying value was $19.4 billion.  NRG estimates that a 1% decrease in market interest rates would have increased the fair value of the Company's long-term debt by$1.5 billion.

Liquidity Risk

Liquidity risk arises from the general funding needs of the Company's activities and in the management of the Company's assets and liabilities.  The Company is currently exposed to additional collateral posting if natural gas prices decline primarily due to the long natural gas equivalent position at various exchanges used to hedge NRG's retail supply load obligations.

Based on a sensitivity analysis for power and gas positions under marginable contracts, a $0.50 per MMBtu change in natural gas prices across the term of the marginable contracts would cause a change in margin collateral posted of approximately$192 millionas ofDecember 31, 2016, and a 1.00 MMBtu/MWh change in heat rates for heat rate positions would result in a change in margin collateral posted of approximately$243 millionas ofDecember 31, 2016.  This analysis uses simplified assumptions and is calculated based on portfolio composition and margin-related contract provisions as ofDecember 31, 2016.

Counterparty Credit Risk

Credit risk relates to the risk of loss resulting from non-performance or non-payment by counterparties pursuant to the terms of their contractual obligations.  The Company monitors and manages credit risk through credit policies that include: (i) an established credit approval process; (ii) a daily monitoring of counterparties' credit limits; (iii) the use of credit mitigation measures such as margin, collateral, prepayment arrangements, or volumetric limits; (iv) the use of payment netting agreements; and (v) the use of master netting agreements that allow for the netting of positive and negative exposures of various contracts associated with a single counterparty.  Risks surrounding counterparty performance and credit could ultimately impact the amount and timing of expected cash flows.  The Company seeks to mitigate counterparty risk by having a diversified portfolio of counterparties.  The Company also has credit protection within various agreements to call on additional collateral support if and when necessary.  Cash margin is collected and held at the Company to cover the credit risk of the counterparty until positions settle.










As ofDecember 31, 2016, aggregate counterparty credit exposure to a significant portion of the Company's counterparties totaled$231 million, of which the Company held collateral (cash and letters of credit) against those positions of$2 millionresulting in a net exposure of$229 million.  Approximately95%of the Company's exposure before collateral is expected to roll off by the end of2018.  The following table highlights the net counterparty credit exposure by industry sector and by counterparty credit quality. Net counterparty credit exposure is defined as the aggregate net asset position for NRG with counterparties where netting is permitted under the enabling agreement and includes all cash flow, mark-to-market, NPNS, and non-derivative transactions.  As ofDecember 31, 2016, the aggregate credit exposure is shown net of collateral held, and includes amounts net of receivables or payables.

CategoryNet Exposure(a) (b)(% of Total)Utilities, energy merchants, marketers and other100%Total100%CategoryNet Exposure(a) (b)(% of Total)Investment grade67%Non-Investment grade/Non-Rated33Total100%

(a)Counterparty credit exposure excludes uranium and coal transportation contracts because of the unavailability of market prices.

(b)The figures in the tables above exclude potential counterparty credit exposure related to RTOs, ISOs, registered commodity exchanges and certain long term contracts.



The Company has credit exposure to certain wholesale counterparties, each of which represent more than 10% of the total net exposure discussed above and the aggregate credit exposure to such counterparties was$80 millionas of December 31, 2016.  Changes in hedge positions and market prices will affect credit exposure and counterparty concentration.  Given the credit quality, diversification and term of the exposure in the portfolio, the Company does not anticipate a material impact on its financial position or results of operations from nonperformance by any counterparty.

RTOs and ISOs

The Company participates in the organized markets of CAISO, ERCOT, ISO-NE, MISO, NYISO and PJM, known as RTOs or ISOs. Trading in these markets is approved by FERC, or in the case of ERCOT, approved by the PUCT and include credit policies that, under certain circumstances, require that losses arising from the default of one member on spot market transactions be shared by the remaining participants. As a result, the counterparty credit risk to these markets is limited to NRG’s applicable share of the overall market and are excluded from the above exposures.



Exchange Traded Transactions

The Company enters into commodity transactions on registered exchanges, notably ICE and NYMEX. These clearinghouses act as the counterparty and  transactions are subject to extensive collateral and margining requirements. As a result, these commodity transactions have limited counterparty credit risk.










Long Term Contracts

Counterparty credit exposure described above excludes credit risk exposure under certain long term contracts, including California tolling agreements, Gulf Coast load obligations, and wind and solar PPAs.  As external sources or observable market quotes are not available to estimate such exposure, the Company values these contracts based on various techniques including but not limited to internal models based on a fundamental analysis of the market and extrapolation of observable market data with similar characteristics.  Based on these valuation techniques, as ofDecember 31, 2016, aggregate credit risk exposure managed by NRG to these counterparties was approximately$4.1 billion, of which$2.6 billionrelated to assets of NRG Yield, Inc., for the next five years.  This amount excludes potential credit exposures for projects with long term PPAs that have not reached commercial operations.  The majority of these power contracts are with utilities or public power entities with strong credit quality and public utility commission or other regulatory support.  However, such regulated utility counterparties can be impacted by changes in government regulations, which NRG is unable to predict.

Retail Customer Credit Risk

NRG is exposed to retail credit risk through its retail electricity providers, which serve C&I customers and the Mass market. Retail credit risk results in losses when a customer fails to pay for services rendered.  The losses could be incurred from nonpayment of customer accounts receivable and any in-the-money forward value.  NRG manages retail credit risk through the use of established credit policies that include monitoring of the portfolio, and the use of credit mitigation measures such as deposits or prepayment arrangements.

As ofDecember 31, 2016, the Company's retail customer credit exposure to C&I and Mass customers was diversified across many customers and various industries, as well as government entities. The Company is also subject to risk with respect to its residential solar customers. The Company's bad debt expense resulting from credit risk was$48 million,$64 million, and$64 millionfor the years ending December 31,2016,2015and2014, respectively.  Current economic conditions may affect the Company's customers' ability to pay bills in a timely manner, which could increase customer delinquencies and may lead to an increase in bad debt expense.

Credit Risk Related Contingent Features

Certain of the Company's hedging agreements contain provisions that require the Company to post additional collateral if the counterparty determines that there has been deterioration in credit quality, generally termed "adequate assurance" under the agreements, or require the Company to post additional collateral if there were a one notch downgrade in the Company's credit rating.  The collateral required for contracts that have adequate assurance clauses that are in a net liability position as ofDecember 31, 2016was$36 million.  The collateral required for contracts with credit rating contingent features that are in a net liability position as ofDecember 31, 2016was$56 million.  The Company is also a party to certain marginable agreements under which it has a net liability position but the counterparty has not called for the collateral due, which is approximately$14 millionas ofDecember 31, 2016.

Currency Exchange Risk

NRG's foreign earnings and investments may be subject to foreign currency exchange risk, which NRG generally does not hedge.  As these earnings and investments are not material to NRG's consolidated results, the Company's foreign currency exposure is limited.

Item 9A — Controls and Procedures

Conclusion Regarding the Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls and Procedures and Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Under the supervision and with the participation of NRG's management, including its principal executive officer, principal financial officer and principal accounting officer, NRG conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of its disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act. Based on this evaluation, the Company's principal executive officer, principal financial officer and principal accounting officer concluded that the disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Management's report on the Company's internal control over financial reporting and the report of the Company's independent registered public accounting firm are incorporated under the caption "Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting" and under the caption "Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year endedDecember 31, 2016.

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting

There were no changes in NRG’s internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred in the fourth quarter of2016that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, NRG’s internal control over financial reporting.

Inherent Limitations over Internal Controls

NRG's internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of consolidated financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP. The Company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that:

1.Pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the Company's assets;

2.Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and that the Company's receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of its management and directors; and

3.Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company's assets that could have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements.

Internal control over financial reporting cannot provide absolute assurance of achieving financial reporting objectives because of its inherent limitations, including the possibility of human error and circumvention by collusion or overriding of controls. Accordingly, even an effective internal control system may not prevent or detect material misstatements on a timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

The Company's management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f). Under the supervision and with the participation of the Company's management, including its principal executive officer, principal financial officer and principal accounting officer, the Company conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting based on the framework inInternal Control — Integrated Framework (2013)issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on the Company's evaluation under the framework inInternal Control — Integrated Framework (2013), the Company's management concluded that its internal control over financial reporting was effective as ofDecember 31, 2016.

The effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as ofDecember 31, 2016has been audited by KPMG LLP, the Company's independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in its report which is included in this Annual Report on Form 10‑K.

On July 28, 2010, the NRG LTIP was amended to increase the number of shares available for issuance to 22,000,000.  The ESPP was approved by the Company's stockholders on May 8, 2014.  As of December 31, 2016, there were667,819shares reserved from the Company's treasury shares for the ESPP.

(2)Consists of shares issuable under the NRG GenOn LTIP.  On December 14, 2012, in connection with the Merger, NRG assumed the GenOn Energy, Inc. 2010 Omnibus Incentive Plan and changed the name to the NRG 2010 Stock Plan for GenOn Employees, or the NRG GenOn LTIP.  While the GenOn Energy, Inc. 2010 Omnibus Incentive Plan was previously approved by stockholders of RRI Energy, Inc. before it became GenOn, the plan is listed as “not approved” because the NRG GenOn LTIP was not subject to separate line item approval by NRG's stockholders when the Merger (which included the assumption of this plan) was approved.  NRG intends to make subsequent grants under the NRG GenOn LTIP.  As part of the Merger, NRG also assumed the GenOn Energy, Inc. 2002 Long-Term Incentive Plan, the GenOn Energy, Inc. 2002 Stock Plan, and the Mirant Corporation 2005 Omnibus Incentive Compensation Plan.  NRG has no intention of making any grants or awards of its own equity securities under these plans.  The number of securities to be issued upon the exercise of outstanding awards under these plans is240,596at a weighted-average exercise price of$36.72.   See Item 15—Note 20,Stock-Based Compensation, to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of the NRG GenOn LTIP.

(3)Consists of7,487,058shares of common stock under NRG's LTIP,960,904shares of common stock under the NRG GenOn LTIP, and667,819shares of treasury stock reserved for issuance under the ESPP.  In the first quarter of 2017,282,530shares were issued to employees' accounts from the treasury stock reserve for the ESPP.










Both the NRG LTIP and the NRG GenOn LTIP provide for grants of stock options, restricted stock, market stock units, performance stock units, deferred stock units and dividend equivalent rights.  NRG's directors, officers and employees, as well as other individuals performing services for, or to whom an offer of employment has been extended by the Company, are eligible to receive grants under the NRG LTIP and the NRG GenOn LTIP.  However, participants eligible for the NRG LTIP at the time of the Merger are not eligible to receive grants under the NRG GenOn LTIP.  The purpose of the NRG LTIP and the NRG GenOn LTIP is to promote the Company's long-term growth and profitability by providing these individuals with incentives to maximize stockholder value and otherwise contribute to the Company's success and to enable the Company to attract, retain and reward the best available persons for positions of responsibility.  The Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors administers the NRG LTIP and the NRG GenOn LTIP.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM





The Board of Directors and Stockholders

NRG Energy, Inc.:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of NRG Energy, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive (loss)/income, cash flows, and stockholders’ equity for each of the years in the three‑year period ended December 31, 2016. In connection with our audits of the consolidated financial statements, we also have audited financial statement schedule “Schedule II. Valuation and Qualifying Accounts.” These consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of NRG Energy, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the three‑year period ended December 31, 2016, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, present fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), NRG Energy, Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016, based on criteria established inInternal Control - Integrated Framework (2013)issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO), and our report dated February 28, 2017 expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.

As disclosed in Note 12,Debt and Capital Leases, to the consolidated financial statements, as of December 31, 2016, $691 million of senior notes issued by GenOn Energy, Inc. (GenOn), a consolidated subsidiary, are classified as current within the consolidated balance sheet and are due on June 15, 2017. GenOn’s future profitability continues to be adversely affected by (i) a sustained decline in natural gas prices and its resulting effect on wholesale power prices and capacity prices, and (ii) the inability of certain of its subsidiaries to make distributions of cash and certain other restricted payments to GenOn. Based on current projections, GenOn is not expected to have sufficient liquidity exclusive of cash subject to the restrictions under certain of its subsidiaries’ operating leases to satisfy the senior notes due in June 2017. As a result of these factors, there is no assurance GenOn will continue as a going concern. GenOn and its consolidated subsidiaries represents total assets constituting 16 percent and 17 percent in 2016 and 2015 and total revenues constituting 15 percent, 16 percent and 19 percent in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, of the related consolidated totals.

NRG ENERGY, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS



Note 1—Nature of Business

General

NRG Energy, Inc., or NRG or the Company, is a leading integrated power company built on the strength of the nation's largest and most diverse competitive electric generation portfolio and leading retail electricity platform.  NRG aims to create a sustainable energy future by producing, selling and delivering electricity and related products and services in major competitive power markets in the U.S. in a manner that delivers value to all of NRG's stakeholders. The Company owns and operates approximately47,000MW of generation; engages in the trading of wholesale energy, capacity and related products; transacts in and trades fuel and transportation services; and directly sells energy, services, and innovative, sustainable products and services to retail customers under the names “NRG”, "Reliant" and other retail brand names owned by NRG.

Generation consists of the Company’s wholesale operations, commercial operations, EPC operations, energy services and other critical related functions.  NRG has traditionally referred to this business as its wholesale power generation business.  In addition to the traditional functions from NRG’s wholesale power generation business, Generation also includes NRG’s business solutions, which include demand response, commodity sales, energy efficiency and energy management services, and NRG’s conventional distributed generation business, consisting of reliability, combined heat and power, thermal and district heating and cooling and large-scale distributed generation.

Retail is a consumer facing business that includes the Company’s residential retail and C&I business. Products and services range from retail energy, portable solar and battery products home services, and a variety of bundled products which combine energy with protection products, energy efficiency and renewable energy solutions as well as other distributed and reliability products.

Renewables operates the Company’s existing renewables business, including operation of the NRG Yield renewable assets. Renewables is also one of the largest solar and wind power developers and owner-operators in the U.S., having developed, constructed and financed a full range of solutions for utilities, schools, municipalities and commercial market segments.

GenOn Liquidity and Ability to Continue as a Going Concern

As disclosed in Note 12,Debt and Capital Leases,$691 millionof GenOn's Senior Notes excluding$8 millionof associated premiums, are current within the GenOn consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2016 and are due on June 15, 2017.  GenOn's future profitability continues to be adversely affected by (i) a sustained decline in natural gas prices and its resulting effect on wholesale power prices and capacity prices, and (ii) the inability of GenOn Mid-Atlantic and REMA to make distributions of cash and certain other restricted payments to GenOn.  Based on current projections, GenOn is not expected to have sufficient liquidity to repay the GenOn Senior Notes due in June 2017.  As a result of these factors, there is substantial doubt about GenOn's ability to continue as a going concern. As a result of the substantial doubt about GenOn’s ability to continue as a going concern, along with additional factors, there is substantial doubt about certain of GenOn’s subsidiaries’ ability to continue as a going concern.

As of December 31, 2016, GenOn has cash and cash equivalents of$1.0 billion, of which$471 millionand$100 millionis held by GenOn Mid-Atlantic and REMA, respectively.  Under their respective operating leases, GenOn Mid-Atlantic and REMA are not permitted to make any distributions and other restricted payments unless: (a) they satisfy the fixed charge coverage ratio for the most recently ended period for four fiscal quarters; (b) they are projected to satisfy the fixed charge coverage ratio for each of the two following periods of four fiscal quarters, commencing with the fiscal quarter in which such payment is proposed to be made; and (c) no significant lease default or event of default has occurred and is continuing.  Additionally, GenOn Mid-Atlantic and REMA must be in compliance with the requirement to provide credit support to the owner lessors securing their obligations to pay scheduled rent under their respective leases.  As a result, GenOn Mid-Atlantic has not been able to make distributions of cash and certain other restricted payments since the quarter ended March 31, 2014 which was the last quarterly period for which GenOn Mid-Atlantic satisfied the conditions under its operating agreement.  REMA has not satisfied the conditions under its operating agreement to make distributions of cash and certain other restricted payments since 2009.

NRG, GenOn's parent company, has no obligation to provide any financial support to GenOn other than under the secured intercompany revolving credit agreement between NRG and GenOn and NRG Americas.  As of December 31, 2016,$228 millionwas available to be used by GenOn under the$500 millionrevolving credit agreement. As controlled group members, ERISA requires that NRG and GenOn are jointly and severally liable for the NRG Pension Plan for Bargained Employees and the NRG Pension Plan, including the pension liabilities associated with GenOn employees.

GenOn is currently considering all options available to it, including negotiations with creditors, refinancing the GenOn Senior Notes, potential sales of certain generating assets as well as the possibility for a need to file for protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.  During 2016, GenOn appointed two independent directors, retained advisors and established a separate audit committee as part of this process. Any resolution may have a material impact on the Company's statement of operations, cash flows and financial position.

As of December 31, 2016, GenOn represents15.6%of the Company's consolidated total assets,16.9%of the Company's consolidated total liabilities and contributed$94 millionto the Company's consolidated cash from operations in 2016.



NRG Yield, Inc. Ownership

In 2013, the Company formed NRG Yield, Inc. to own and operate a portfolio of contracted generation assets and thermal infrastructure assets that have historically been owned and/or operated by NRG and its subsidiaries.  In 2013 and 2014, NRG Yield, Inc. issued Class A common stock to its public shareholders and utilized the proceeds to acquire a controlling interest in NRG Yield LLC, through its ownership of Class A units.  At that time, the Company owned the Class B common stock of NRG Yield, Inc. and the Class B units of NRG Yield LLC.  On May 14, 2015, NRG Yield, Inc. completed a stock split in connection with which each outstanding share of Class A common stock was split into one share of Class A common stock and one share of Class C common stock, and each outstanding share of Class B common stock was split into one share of Class B common stock and one share of Class D common stock. A similar split was effected at NRG Yield LLC with respect to its member units. The Company consolidates NRG Yield, Inc. for financial reporting purposes as it maintains a controlling voting interest, and presents the public ownership of the Class A and Class C common stock as noncontrolling interest. The Company receives distributions from NRG Yield LLC, through its ownership of Class B and Class D units.

The following table represents the structure of NRG Yield, Inc. as ofDecember 31, 2016:
















Note 2—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Basis of Presentation and Principles of Consolidation

The Company's consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with GAAP.  The ASC, established by the FASB, is the source of authoritative GAAP to be applied by nongovernmental entities.  In addition, the rules and interpretative releases of the SEC under authority of federal securities laws are also sources of authoritative GAAP for SEC registrants.

The consolidated financial statements include NRG's accounts and operations and those of its subsidiaries in which the Company has a controlling interest. All significant intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation.  The usual condition for a controlling financial interest is ownership of a majority of the voting interests of an entity.  However, a controlling financial interest may also exist through arrangements that do not involve controlling voting interests.  As such, NRG applies the guidance of ASC 810,Consolidations,or ASC 810, to determine when an entity that is insufficiently capitalized or not controlled through its voting interests, referred to as a VIE, should be consolidated.

Segment Reporting

The Company's businesses are segregated as follows: Generation (previously named Generation/Business), which includes generation, international and BETM (previously part of Corporate); Retail which includes Mass customers (previously Retail Mass), and Business Solutions, which includes C&I customers and other distributed and reliability products (previously in the Generation segment); Renewables (previously named NRG Renew), which includes solar and wind assets, excluding those in NRG Yield; NRG Yield; and corporate activities. The Company's corporate segment include residential solar (previously part of NRG Home) and electric vehicle services. During 2016, the Company began reporting the results of its residential solar business in its corporate segment and its international business in its Generation segment. The Company's segment structure and its allocation of corporate expenses were updated to reflect how management makes financial decisions and allocates resources. The Company has recast data from prior periods to reflect this change in reportable segments to conform to the current year presentation.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents include highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less at the time of purchase.

Funds Deposited by Counterparties

Funds deposited by counterparties consist of cash held by the Company as a result of collateral posting obligations from its counterparties.  Some amounts are segregated into separate accounts that are not contractually restricted but, based on the Company's intention, are not available for the payment of general corporate obligations.  Depending on market fluctuations and the settlement of the underlying contracts, the Company will refund this collateral to the hedge counterparties pursuant to the terms and conditions of the underlying trades.  Since collateral requirements fluctuate daily and the Company cannot predict if any collateral will be held for more thantwelvemonths, the funds deposited by counterparties are classified as a current asset on the Company's balance sheet, with an offsetting liability for this cash collateral received within current liabilities.  Changes in funds deposited by counterparties are closely associated with the Company's operating activities and are classified as an operating activity in the Company's consolidated statements of cash flows.

Restricted Cash

Restricted cash consists primarily of funds held to satisfy the requirements of certain debt agreements and funds held within the Company's projects that are restricted in their use. Of these funds, as of December 31, 2016, approximately$53 millionis designated for current debt service payments,$51 millionis designated to fund operating expenses, and$58 millionis designated to fund distributions, with the remaining$284 millionrestricted for reserves including debt service, performance obligations and other reserves, as well as capital expenditures.










Trade Receivables and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts

Trade receivables are reported in the balance sheet at outstanding principal adjusted for any write-offs and the allowance for doubtful accounts.  For its retail business, the Company accrues an allowance for doubtful accounts based on estimates of uncollectible revenues by analyzing counterparty credit ratings (for commercial and industrial customers), historical collections, accounts receivable aging and other factors.  The retail business writes-off accounts receivable balances against the allowance for doubtful accounts when it determines a receivable is uncollectible.  In addition, the Company considers a reserve for doubtful accounts based on the credit worthiness of the customers and continually reviews and adjusts for current economic trends that might impact the level of future credit losses. The reserve represents management's best estimate of uncollectible amounts. As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, the allowance for doubtful accounts was$30 millionand$21 million, respectively.

Inventory

Inventory is valued at the lower of weighted average cost or market, and consists principally of fuel oil, coal and raw materials used to generate electricity or steam.  The Company removes these inventories as they are used in the production of electricity or steam.  Spare parts inventory is valued at weighted average cost.  The Company removes these inventories when they are used for repairs, maintenance or capital projects.  The Company expects to recover the fuel oil, coal, raw materials, and spare parts costs in the ordinary course of business.   Finished goods inventory is valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value with cost being determined on a first-in first-out basis.  The Company removes these inventories as they are sold to customers. Sales of inventory are classified as an operating activity in the consolidated statements of cash flows.

Property, Plant and Equipment

Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost or, in the case of business acquisitions, fair value; however, impairment adjustments are recorded whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying values may not be recoverable.  SeeNote 3,Business Acquisitions and Dispositions,for more information on acquired property, plant and equipment. NRG also classifies nuclear fuel related to the Company's44%ownership interest in STP as part of the Company's property, plant, and equipment.  Significant additions or improvements extending asset lives are capitalized as incurred, while repairs and maintenance that do not improve or extend the life of the respective asset are charged to expense as incurred.  Depreciation, other than nuclear fuel, is computed using the straight-line method, while nuclear fuel is amortized based on units of production over the estimated useful lives.  Certain assets and their related accumulated depreciation amounts are adjusted for asset retirements and disposals with the resulting gain or loss included in cost of operations in the consolidated statements of operations.

Asset Impairments

Long-lived assets that are held and used are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate carrying values may not be recoverable.  Such reviews are performed in accordance with ASC 360.  An impairment loss is indicated if the total future estimated undiscounted cash flows expected from an asset are less than its carrying value.  An impairment charge is measured by the difference between an asset's carrying amount and fair value with the difference recorded in operating costs and expenses in the consolidated statements of operations.  Fair values are determined by a variety of valuation methods, including third-party appraisals, sales prices of similar assets, and present value techniques.

Investments accounted for by the equity method are reviewed for impairment in accordance with ASC 323,Investments-Equity Method and Joint Ventures, or ASC 323, which requires that a loss in value of an investment that is an other-than-temporary decline should be recognized.  The Company identifies and measures losses in the value of equity method investments based upon a comparison of fair value to carrying value.

For further discussion of these matters, refer toNote 10,Asset Impairments.

Development Costs and Capitalized Interest

Development costs include project development costs, which are expensed in the preliminary stages of a project and capitalized when the project is deemed to be commercially viable.  Commercial viability is determined by one or a series of actions including, among others, Board of Director approval pursuant to a formal project plan that subjects the Company to significant future obligations that can only be discharged by the use of a Company asset. When a project is available for operations, capitalized interest, and capitalized project development costs are reclassified to property, plant and equipment and depreciated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the project's related assets.  Capitalized costs are charged to expense if a project is abandoned or management otherwise determines the costs to be unrecoverable.

Interest incurred on funds borrowed to finance capital projects is capitalized until the project under construction is ready for its intended use.  The amount of interest capitalized for the years endedDecember 31, 2016,2015, and2014, was$43 million,$30 million, and$29 million, respectively.










Debt Issuance Costs

Debt issuance costs are capitalized and amortized as interest expense on a basis which approximates the effective interest method over the term of the related debt.  Debt issuance costs are presented as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of the related debt.

Intangible Assets

Intangible assets represent contractual rights held by the Company.  The Company recognizes specifically identifiable intangible assets including customer contracts, customer relationships, energy supply contracts, marketing partnerships, power purchase agreements, trade names, emission allowances, and fuel contracts when specific rights and contracts are acquired.  In addition, the Company also established values for emission allowances and power contracts upon adoption of Fresh Start reporting.  These intangible assets are amortized based on expected volumes, expected delivery, expected discounted future net cash flows, straight line or units of production basis.  As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, the Company had accumulated amortization related to its intangible assets of$1.8 billionand$1.5 billion, respectively.

Intangible assets determined to have indefinite lives are not amortized, but rather are tested for impairment at least annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that such acquired intangible assets have been determined to have finite lives and should now be amortized over their useful lives.  NRG hadnointangible assets with indefinite lives recorded as ofDecember 31, 2016.

Emission allowances held-for-sale, which are included in other non-current assets on the Company's consolidated balance sheet, are not amortized; they are carried at the lower of cost or fair value and reviewed for impairment in accordance with ASC 360.

Goodwill

In accordance with ASC 350, the Company recognizes goodwill for the excess cost of an acquired entity over the net value assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed.  NRG performs goodwill impairment tests annually, during the fourth quarter, and when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.

The Company first assesses qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the two-step goodwill impairment test.  The more-likely-than-not threshold is defined as having a likelihood of more than 50 percent.

In the absence of sufficient qualitative factors, goodwill impairment is determined using a two-step process:

Step one —Identify potential impairment by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit to the book value, including goodwill.  If the fair value exceeds book value, goodwill of the reporting unit is not considered impaired.  If the book value exceeds fair value, proceed to step two.Step two —Compare the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill to the book value of the reporting unit goodwill.  If the book value of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value, an impairment charge is recognized for the excess.

For further discussion of goodwill and goodwill impairment losses recognized during 2016 and 2015, refer toNote 11,Goodwill and Other Intangibles.

Income Taxes

The Company accounts for income taxes using the liability method in accordance with ASC 740, which requires that the Company use the asset and liability method of accounting for deferred income taxes and provide deferred income taxes for all significant temporary differences.

The Company has two categories of income tax expense or benefit — current and deferred, as follows:

•Current income tax expense or benefit consists solely of current taxes payable less applicable tax credits, and

•Deferred income tax expense or benefit is the change in the net deferred income tax asset or liability, excluding amounts charged or credited to accumulated other comprehensive income.










The Company reports some of its revenues and expenses differently for financial statement purposes than for income tax return purposes, resulting in temporary and permanent differences between the Company's financial statements and income tax returns.  The tax effects of such temporary differences are recorded as either deferred income tax assets or deferred income tax liabilities in the Company's consolidated balance sheets.  The Company measures its deferred income tax assets and deferred income tax liabilities using income tax rates that are currently in effect. The Company believes it is more likely than not that the results of future operations will generate sufficient taxable income which includes the future reversal of existing taxable temporary differences to realize deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowances. In arriving at this conclusion to utilize projections of future profit before tax in its estimate of future taxable income, the Company considered the profit before tax generated in recent years.  A valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the Company's net deferred tax assets to an amount that is more-likely-than-not to be realized.

The Company reduces its current income tax expense in the consolidated statement of operations for any investment tax credits, or ITCs, that are not convertible into cash grants, as well as other tax credits, in the period the tax credit is generated.  ITCs that are convertible into cash grants, as well as the deferred income tax benefit generated by the difference in the financial statement and tax basis of the related assets, are recorded as a reduction to the carrying value of the underlying property and subsequently amortized to earnings on a straight-line basis over the useful life of each underlying property.

The Company accounts for uncertain tax positions in accordance with ASC 740, which applies to all tax positions related to income taxes.  Under ASC 740, tax benefits are recognized when it is more-likely-than-not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination by the authorities.  The benefit recognized from a position that has surpassed the more-likely-than-not threshold is the largest amount of benefit that is more than50%likely to be realized upon settlement.  The Company recognizes interest and penalties accrued related to uncertain tax benefits as a component of income tax expense.

In accordance with ASC 805 and as discussed further inNote 19,Income Taxes, changes to existing net deferred tax assets or valuation allowances or changes to uncertain tax benefits, are recorded to income tax expense.

Revenue Recognition

Energy— Both physical and financial transactions are entered into to optimize the financial performance of the Company's generating facilities.  Electric energy revenue is recognized upon transmission to the customer.  Physical transactions, or the sale of generated electricity to meet supply and demand, are recorded on a gross basis in the Company's consolidated statements of operations. Financial transactions, or the buying and selling of energy for trading purposes, are recorded net within operating revenues in the consolidated statements of operations in accordance with ASC 815.

Capacity— Capacity revenues are recognized when contractually earned, and consist of revenues billed to a third party at either the market or a negotiated contract price for making installed generation capacity available in order to satisfy system integrity and reliability requirements.

Sale of Emission Allowances— The Company records its bank of emission allowances as part of intangible assets. From time to time, management may authorize the transfer of emission allowances in excess of usage from the Company's emission bank to intangible assets held-for-sale for trading purposes.  The Company records the sale of emission allowances on a net basis within operating revenue in the Company's consolidated statements of operations.

Contract Amortization— Assets and liabilities recognized from power sales agreements assumed at Fresh Start and through acquisitions related to the sale of electric capacity and energy in future periods for which the fair value has been determined to be significantly less (more) than market are amortized to revenue over the term of each underlying contract based on actual generation and/or contracted volumes.

Retail revenues— Gross revenues for energy sales and services to retail customers are recognized upon delivery under the accrual method.  Energy sales and services that have been delivered but not billed by period end are estimated.  Gross revenues also includes energy revenues from resales of purchased power, which were$154 million,$165 millionand$387 millionfor the years endedDecember 31, 2016,2015, and2014, respectively.  These revenues represent the sale of excess supply to third parties in the market.

Accrued unbilled revenues are based on estimates of customer usage since the date of the last meter reading provided by the independent system operators or electric distribution companies.  Volume estimates are based on daily forecasted volumes and estimated customer usage by class.  Unbilled revenues are calculated by multiplying these volume estimates by the applicable rate by customer class.  Estimated amounts are adjusted when actual usage is known and billed. The Company recorded receivables for unbilled revenues of$321 million,$309 millionand$341 millionas ofDecember 31, 2016,2015, and2014, respectively, for retail energy sales and services.










Consumer product revenues are recognized when title and risk of loss pass to the retailer, distributor, or end-customer and when all of the following have occurred: a firm sales agreement is in place, delivery has occurred, pricing is fixed and determinable, and collection is reasonably assured. Revenue is recognized as the net amount expected to be received after deducting estimated amounts for product returns, discounts, and allowances based on historical return rates and reasonable judgment.

Lessor Accounting

Certain of the Company’s revenues are obtained through PPAs or other contractual agreements.  Many of these agreements are accounted for as operating leases under ASC 840Leases.

Certain of these leases have no minimum lease payments and all of the rent is recorded as contingent rent on an actual basis when the electricity is delivered.  Judgment is required by management in determining the economic life of each generating facility, in evaluating whether certain lease provisions constitute minimum payments or represent contingent rent and other factors in determining whether a contract contains a lease and whether the lease is an operating lease or capital lease.  Contingent rental income recognized in the years endedDecember 31, 2016,2015, and2014was$936 million,$777 million, and$544 million, respectively.

Gross Receipts and Sales Taxes

In connection with its retail business, the Company records gross receipts taxes on a gross basis in revenues and cost of operations in its consolidated statements of operations.  During the years endedDecember 31, 2016,2015, and2014, the Company's revenues and cost of operations included gross receipts taxes of$102 million,$110 million, and$108 million, respectively.  Additionally, the retail business records sales taxes collected from its taxable customers and remitted to the various governmental entities on a net basis; thus, there is no impact on the Company's consolidated statement of operations.

Cost of Energy for Retail Operations

The cost of energy for electricity sales and services to retail customers is included in cost of operations and is based on estimated supply volumes for the applicable reporting period. A portion of the cost of energy ($90 million,$85 millionand$86 millionas ofDecember 31, 2016,2015, and2014, respectively) was accrued and consisted of estimated transmission and distribution charges not yet billed by the transmission and distribution utilities. In estimating supply volumes, the Company considers the effects of historical customer volumes, weather factors and usage by customer class.  Transmission and distribution delivery fees are estimated using the same method used for electricity sales and services to retail customers.  In addition, ISO fees are estimated based on historical trends, estimated supply volumes and initial ERCOT ISO settlements. Volume estimates are then multiplied by the supply rate and recorded as cost of operations in the applicable reporting period.

Derivative Financial Instruments

The Company accounts for derivative financial instruments under ASC 815, which requires the Company to record all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value unless they qualify for a NPNS exception. Changes in the fair value of non-hedge derivatives are immediately recognized in earnings. Changes in the fair value of derivatives accounted for as hedges, if elected for hedge accounting, are either:

•Recognized in earnings as an offset to the changes in the fair value of the related hedged assets, liabilities and firm commitments; or

•Deferred and recorded as a component of accumulated OCI until the hedged transactions occur and are recognized in earnings.

The Company's primary derivative instruments are power purchase or sales contracts, fuels purchase contracts, other energy related commodities, and interest rate instruments used to mitigate variability in earnings due to fluctuations in market prices and interest rates.  On an ongoing basis, the Company assesses the effectiveness of all derivatives that are designated as hedges for accounting purposes in order to determine that each derivative continues to be highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of hedged items. Internal analyses that measure the statistical correlation between the derivative and the associated hedged item determine the effectiveness of such a contract designated as a hedge.  If it is determined that the derivative instrument is not highly effective as a hedge, hedge accounting will be discontinued prospectively.  In this case, the gain or loss previously deferred in accumulated OCI would be frozen until the underlying hedged instrument is delivered unless the transactions being hedged are no longer probable of occurring in which case the amount in OCI would be immediately reclassified into earnings. If the derivative instrument is terminated, the effective portion of this derivative deferred in accumulated OCI will be frozen until the underlying hedged item is delivered.










Revenues and expenses on contracts that qualify for the NPNS exception are recognized when the underlying physical transaction is delivered.  While these contracts are considered derivative financial instruments under ASC 815, they are not recorded at fair value, but on an accrual basis of accounting.  If it is determined that a transaction designated as NPNS no longer meets the scope exception, the fair value of the related contract is recorded on the balance sheet and immediately recognized through earnings.

NRG's trading activities are subject to limits in accordance with the Company's Risk Management Policy.  These contracts are recognized on the balance sheet at fair value and changes in the fair value of these derivative financial instruments are recognized in earnings.

Foreign Currency Translation and Transaction Gains and Losses

The local currencies are generally the functional currency of NRG's foreign operations.  Foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities are translated at end-of-period rates of exchange. Revenues, expenses, and cash flows are translated at the weighted-average rates of exchange for the period.  The resulting currency translation adjustments are not included in the Company's consolidated statements of operations for the period, but are accumulated and reported as a separate component of stockholders' equity until sale or complete or substantially complete liquidation of the net investment in the foreign entity takes place.  Foreign currency transaction gains or losses are reported within other income/(expense) in the Company's consolidated statements of operations.  For the years endedDecember 31, 2016,2015, and2014, amounts recognized as foreign currency transaction gains (losses) were immaterial.  The Company's cumulative translation adjustment balances as ofDecember 31, 2016,2015, and2014were$(11) million,$(10) millionand$1 million, respectively.

Concentrations of Credit Risk

Financial instruments which potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of trust funds, accounts receivable, notes receivable, derivatives, and investments in debt securities.  Trust funds are held in accounts managed by experienced investment advisors.  Certain accounts receivable, notes receivable, and derivative instruments are concentrated within entities engaged in the energy industry.  These industry concentrations may impact the Company's overall exposure to credit risk, either positively or negatively, in that the customers may be similarly affected by changes in economic, industry or other conditions.  Receivables and other contractual arrangements are subject to collateral requirements under the terms of enabling agreements.  However, the Company believes that the credit risk posed by industry concentration is offset by the diversification and creditworthiness of its customer base.  SeeNote 4,Fair Value of Financial Instruments,for a further discussion of derivative concentrations.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments

The carrying amount of cash and cash equivalents, funds deposited by counterparties, receivables, accounts payable, and accrued liabilities approximate fair value because of the short-term maturity of these instruments.  SeeNote 4,Fair Value of Financial Instruments,for a further discussion of fair value of financial instruments.

Asset Retirement Obligations

The Company accounts for AROs in accordance with ASC 410-20,Asset Retirement Obligations,or ASC 410-20.  Retirement obligations associated with long-lived assets included within the scope of ASC 410-20 are those for which a legal obligation exists under enacted laws, statutes, and written or oral contracts, including obligations arising under the doctrine of promissory estoppel, and for which the timing and/or method of settlement may be conditional on a future event. ASC 410-20 requires an entity to recognize the fair value of a liability for an ARO in the period in which it is incurred and a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made.

Upon initial recognition of a liability for an ARO, the Company capitalizes the asset retirement cost by increasing the carrying amount of the related long-lived asset by the same amount.  Over time, the liability is accreted to its future value, while the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset.  SeeNote 13,Asset Retirement Obligations,for a further discussion of AROs.










Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits

The Company offers pension benefits through a defined benefit pension plan.  In addition, the Company provides postretirement health and welfare benefits for certain groups of employees. The Company accounts for pension and other postretirement benefits in accordance with ASC 715,Compensation — Retirement Benefits.The Company recognizes the funded status of the Company's defined benefit plans in the statement of financial position and records an offset for gains and losses as well as all prior service costs that have not been included as part of the Company's net periodic benefit cost to other comprehensive income.  The determination of the Company's obligation and expenses for pension benefits is dependent on the selection of certain assumptions.  These assumptions determined by management include the discount rate, the expected rate of return on plan assets and the rate of future compensation increases. The Company's actuarial consultants determine assumptions for such items as retirement age.  The assumptions used may differ materially from actual results, which may result in a significant impact to the amount of pension obligation or expense recorded by the Company.

The Company measures the fair value of its pension assets in accordance with ASC 820,Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures,or ASC 820.

Stock-Based Compensation

The Company accounts for its stock-based compensation in accordance with ASC 718,Compensation — Stock Compensation,or ASC 718.The fair value of the Company's non-qualified stock options and market stock units are estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model and the Monte Carlo valuation model, respectively.  NRG uses the Company's common stock price on the date of grant as the fair value of the Company's restricted stock units and deferred stock units.  Forfeiture rates are estimated based on an analysis of the Company's historical forfeitures, employment turnover, and expected future behavior.  The Company recognizes compensation expense for both graded and cliff vesting awards on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period for the entire award.

Investments Accounted for by the Equity Method

The Company has investments in various domestic energy projects, as well as one Australian project.  The equity method of accounting is applied to such investments in affiliates, which include joint ventures and partnerships, because the ownership structure prevents the Company from exercising a controlling influence over the operating and financial policies of the projects.  Under this method, equity in pre-tax income or losses of domestic partnerships and, generally, in the net income or losses of its Australian project, are reflected as equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates. For certain investments that relate to tax equity arrangements, equity earnings are allocated using the hypothetical liquidation at book value, or HLBV, method which is described below. Distributions from equity method investments that represent earnings on the Company's investment are included within cash flows from operating activities and distributions from equity method investments that represent a return of the Company's investment are included within cash flows from investing activities.

Tax Equity Arrangements












Redeemable Noncontrolling Interest

To the extent that the third-party has the right to redeem their interests for cash or other assets, the Company has included the noncontrolling interest attributable to the third party as a component of temporary equity in the mezzanine section of the consolidated balance sheet. The following table reflects the changes in the Company's redeemable noncontrolling interest balance for the years endedDecember 31, 2016,2015, and2014.

Sale-Leaseback Arrangements

NRG is party to sale-leaseback arrangements that provide for the sale of certain assets to a third party and simultaneous leaseback to the Company.  In accordance with ASC 840-40,Sale-Leaseback Transactions, if the seller-lessee retains, through the leaseback, substantially all of the benefits and risks incident to the ownership of the property sold, the sale-leaseback transaction is accounted for as a financing arrangement.  An example of this type of continuing involvement would include an option to repurchase the assets or the buyer-lessor having the option to sell the assets back to the Company.  This provision is included in most of the Company’s sale-leaseback arrangements.  As such, the Company accounts for these arrangements as financings.

Under the financing method, the Company does not recognize as income any of the sale proceeds received from the lessor that contractually constitutes payment to acquire the assets subject to these arrangements.  Instead, the sale proceeds received are accounted for as financing obligations and leaseback payments made by the Company are allocated between interest expense and as a reduction to the financing obligation.  Interest on the financing obligation is calculated using the Company’s incremental borrowing rate at the inception of the arrangement on the outstanding financing obligation.  Judgment is required to determine the appropriate borrowing rate for the arrangement and in determining any gain or loss on the transaction that would be recorded either at the end of or over the lease term.

Marketing and Advertising Costs

The Company expenses its marketing and advertising costs as incurred and which are included within selling, general and administrative expenses.  Marketing and advertising expenses for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014 were$247 million,$307 million, and$208 million, respectively.  The costs of tangible assets used in advertising campaigns are recorded as fixed assets or deferred advertising costs and amortized as advertising costs over the shorter of the useful life of the asset or the advertising campaign.  The Company has several long-term sponsorship arrangements.  Payments related to these arrangements are deferred and expensed over the term of the arrangement.  Advertising expenses for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 were$53 million,$135 million, and$87 million, respectively.

Business Combinations

The Company accounts for its business combinations in accordance with ASC 805,Business Combinations,or ASC 805. ASC 805 requires an acquirer to recognize and measure in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree at fair value at the acquisition date.  It also recognizes and measures the goodwill acquired or a gain from a bargain purchase in the business combination and determines what information to disclose to enable users of an entity's financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination.  In addition, transaction costs are expensed as incurred.










Use of Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.  Actual results could differ from these estimates.

In recording transactions and balances resulting from business operations, the Company uses estimates based on the best information available. Estimates are used for such items as plant depreciable lives, tax provisions, uncollectible accounts, actuarially determined benefit costs, the valuation of energy commodity contracts, environmental liabilities, legal costs incurred in connection with recorded loss contingencies, and assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business combinations, among others.  In addition, estimates are used to test long-lived assets and goodwill for impairment and to determine the fair value of impaired assets.  As better information becomes available or actual amounts are determinable, the recorded estimates are revised.  Consequently, operating results can be affected by revisions to prior accounting estimates.

Reclassifications

Certain prior-year amounts have been reclassified for comparative purposes. The reclassifications did not affect results from operations, net assets or cash flows.

Recent Accounting Developments

ASU 2017-04- In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-04,Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (Topic 350), Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment, or ASU No. 2017-04.  The amendments of ASU No. 2017-04 aim at simplifying the subsequent measurement of goodwill.  As a result, ASU No. 2017-04 eliminates Step 2 from the goodwill impairment test which previously required an entity to determine the fair value at the impairment testing date of the assets and liabilities following the procedures which would be required in determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed under a business combination.  Under ASU No. 2017-04, an entity shall perform its goodwill impairment test by comparing the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying amount and recognize an impairment charge for the amount the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value.  The amendments of ASU No. 2017-04 are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019, and interim periods within those annual periods.  Early adoption is permitted for interim or annual goodwill impairment tests performed on testing dates after January 1, 2017 and the adoption should be applied prospectively.

ASU 2016-18— In November 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-18,Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230), Restricted Cash, or ASU No. 2016-18. The amendments of ASU No. 2016-18 were issued to address the diversity in classification and presentation of changes in restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents on the statement of cash flows which is currently not addressed under Topic 230. The amendments of ASU No. 2016-18 would require an entity to include amounts generally described as restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents with cash and cash equivalents when reconciling the beginning of period and end of period total amounts on the statement of cash flows. The amendments of ASU No. 2016-18 are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those annual periods.  Early adoption is permitted and the adoption of ASU No. 2016-18 should be applied retrospectively.  The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the standard on the Company’s statement of cash flows.

ASU 2016-16— In October 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-16,Income Taxes (Topic 740), Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory, or ASU No. 2016-16.  The amendments of ASU No. 2016-16 were issued to improve the accounting for the income tax consequences of intra-entity transfers of assets other than inventory.  Current GAAP prohibits the recognition of current and deferred income taxes for an intra-entity asset transfer until the asset has been sold to an outside party which has resulted in diversity in practice and increased complexity within financial reporting.  The amendments of ASU No. 2016-16 would require an entity to recognize the income tax consequences of an intra-entity transfer of an asset other than inventory when the transfer occurs and do not require new disclosure requirements.  The amendments of ASU No. 2016-16 are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those annual periods.  Early adoption is permitted and the adoption of ASU No. 2016-16 should be applied on a modified retrospective basis through a cumulative-effect adjustment directly to retained earnings as of the beginning of the period of adoption.  The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the standard on the Company’s results of operations, cash flows and financial position.










ASU 2016-15— In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15,Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230), Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments, or ASU No. 2016-15.  The amendments of ASU No. 2016-15 were issued to address eight specific cash flow issues for which stakeholders have indicated to the FASB that a diversity in practice existed in how entities were presenting and classifying these items in the statement of cash flows.  The issues addressed by ASU No. 2016-15 include but are not limited to the classification of debt prepayment and debt extinguishment costs, payments made for contingent consideration for a business combination, proceeds from the settlement of insurance proceeds, distributions received from equity method investees and separately identifiable cash flows and the application of the predominance principle.  The amendments of ASU No. 2016-15 are effective for public entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017 and interim periods in those fiscal years.  Early adoption is permitted, including adoption in an interim fiscal period with all amendments adopted in the same period.  The adoption of ASU No. 2016-15 is required to be applied retrospectively.  The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the standard on the Company's statement of cash flows.

ASU 2016-09— In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09,Compensation - Stock Compensation(Topic 718), or ASU No. 2016-09.  The amendments of ASU No. 2016-09 were issued as part of the FASB's Simplification Initiative focused on improving areas of GAAP for which cost and complexity may be reduced while maintaining or improving the usefulness of information disclosed within the financial statements.  The amendments focused on simplification specifically with regard to share-based payment transactions, including income tax consequences, classification of awards as equity or liabilities and classification on the statement of cash flows.  The guidance in ASU No. 2016-09 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods.  The Company adopted this standard effective January 1, 2017.  The adoption of this standard will not have a material impact on the Company's results of operations, cash flows and financial position.

ASU 2016-01— In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-01,Financial Instruments - Overall(Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities, or ASU No. 2016-01. The amendments of ASU No. 2016-01 eliminate available-for-sale classification of equity investments and require that equity investments (except those accounted for under the equity method of accounting, or those that result in consolidation of the investee) to be generally measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income.  Further, the amendments require that financial assets and financial liabilities to be presented separately in the notes to the financial statements, grouped by measurement category and form of financial asset.  The guidance in ASU No. 2016-01 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those annual periods. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the standard on the Company's results of operations, cash flows and financial position.

ASU 2015-16— In September 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-16,Business Combinations(Topic 805): Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement-Period Adjustments, or ASU No. 2015-16.  The amendments of ASU No. 2015-16 require that an acquirer recognize measurement period adjustments to the provisional amounts recognized in a business combination in the reporting period during which the adjustments are determined.  Additionally, the amendments of ASU No. 2015-16 require the acquirer to record in the same period's financial statements the effect on earnings of changes in depreciation, amortization or other income effects, if any, as a result of the measurement period adjustment, calculated as if the accounting had been completed at the acquisition date as well as disclosing either on the face of the income statement or in the notes the portion of the amount recorded in current period earnings that would have been recorded in previous reporting periods.  The guidance in ASU No. 2015-16 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015, and interim periods within those fiscal years.  The amendments should be applied prospectively.  The Company adopted ASU No. 2015-16 for the year ended December 31, 2016, and the adoption did not have a material impact on the Company's results of operations, cash flows and financial position.

ASU 2014-15— In August 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-15,Presentation of Financial Statements - Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40): Disclosures of Uncertainties about an Entity's Ability to Continue as a Going Concern, which requires management to evaluate whether there are conditions and events that raise substantial doubt about an entity's ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the financial statements are available to be issued. The Company adopted this ASU effective January 1, 2016.

Note 3—Business Acquisitions and Dispositions

The Company has completed the following business acquisitions and dispositions that are material to the Company's financial statements:

Acquisitions

2016 Utility-Scale Solar and Wind Acquisition

On November 2, 2016, the Company acquired equity interests in a tax equity portfolio from SunEdison, located in Utah, comprised of530MW of mechanically-complete solar assets, of which NRG’s net interest based on cash to be distributed is265MW, for upfront cash consideration of$111 million.  In connection with the acquisition, the Company assumed non-recourse debt of$222 million.  The Company also borrowed additional amounts of$65 millionduring the fourth quarter of 2016, as described inNote 12,Debt and Capital Leases, which effectively reduced the Company's use of liquidity related to the acquisition. The Company does not have a controlling interest in the tax equity portfolio and, accordingly, its interest is recorded as an equity method investment. The purchase price was preliminarily allocated to the equity method investment balance of approximately$328 million, current assets of$5 millionand the assumed non-recourse debt of$222 million. The assets reached commercial operations during the fourth quarter of 2016 and have 20-year PPAs with PacificCorp.

The Company acquired a110MW portfolio of construction-ready and71MW of development solar assets in Hawaii from SunEdison for upfront cash consideration of$2 millionon October 3, 2016 and a154MW construction-ready solar project in Texas for upfront cash consideration of$11 millionon November 9, 2016.

In addition to the total$124 millionin upfront cash consideration paid for the above acquisitions, the Company expects to make an estimated$59 millionin additional payments contingent upon future development milestones.

2016 Solar Distributed Generation Acquisition

On October 3, 2016, the Company acquired a29MW portfolio of mechanically-complete and construction-ready distributed generation solar assets from SunEdison for cash consideration of approximately$67 millionexcluding post-closing adjustments which reduced the purchase price by$5 million.  Subsequent to the acquisition, the Company sold the majority of these assets into a tax-equity financed portfolio within the DGPV Holdco partnership between NRG and NRG Yield, Inc., and expects to sell the remaining assets into a similar portfolio in 2017. The purchase price was preliminarily allocated to$47 millionin construction in progress and$15 millionin intangible assets.

2015 Acquisition of Desert Sunlight

On June 29, 2015, NRG Yield, Inc., through its subsidiary NRG Yield Operating LLC, acquired25%of the membership interest in Desert Sunlight Investment Holdings, LLC, which owns two solar photovoltaic facilities that total550MW located in Desert Center, California from EFS Desert Sun, LLC, an affiliate of GE Energy Financial Services, for a purchase price of$285 million.  The Company accounts for its25%investment as an equity method investment.

2014 Acquisition of Alta Wind

On August 12, 2014, NRG Yield, Inc., through its subsidiary NRG Yield Operating LLC, or Yield Operating, completed the acquisition of100%of the membership interests of Alta Wind Asset Management Holdings, LLC, Alta Wind Company, LLC, Alta Wind X Holding Company, LLC, and Alta Wind XI Holding Company, LLC, which collectively own seven wind facilities that total947MW located in Tehachapi, California and a portfolio of land leases, or the Alta Wind Assets.  Power generated by the Alta Wind facility is sold to Southern California Edison under long-term power purchase agreements with21 yearsof remaining contract life for Alta I-V. The Alta X and XI power purchase agreements began in January 2016 with terms of22 yearsand sold energy and renewable energy credits on a merchant basis during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014.

The purchase price of the Alta Wind Assets was$923 million, which was comprised of a purchase price of$870 millionand$53 millionpaid for working capital balances.  In order to fund the purchase price of the acquisition, NRG Yield, Inc. issued12,075,000shares of its Class A common stock on July 29, 2014 for net proceeds of$630 million.  In addition, on August 5, 2014, Yield Operating issued$500 millionin aggregate principal amount at par of5.375%senior notes due August 2024.  Interest on the notes is payable semi-annually on February 15 and August 15 of each year, and commenced on February 15, 2015.  The notes are senior unsecured obligations of Yield Operating and are guaranteed by NRG Yield LLC, Yield Operating’s parent company, and by certain of Yield Operating’s wholly owned subsidiaries.

The acquisition was recorded as a business combination under ASC 805, with identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed provisionally recorded at their estimated fair values on the acquisition date.  The accounting for the business combination was completed as of August 11, 2015, at which point the fair values became final.  The following table summarizes the provisional amounts recognized for assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of December 31, 2014, as well as adjustments made through August 11, 2015, when the allocation became final.

2014 Acquisition of Dominion's Competitive Electric Retail Business

On March 31, 2014, the Company acquired the competitive retail electricity business of Dominion Resources, Inc., or Dominion.  The acquisition of Dominion's competitive retail electricity business increased NRG’s retail portfolio by approximately

540,000

customers in the aggregate by the end of 2014.  The acquisition supports NRG's ongoing efforts to expand the Company's retail footprint in the Northeast and to grow its retail position in Texas.  The Company paid approximately

$192 million

as cash consideration for the acquisition, including

$165 million

of purchase price and

$27 million

$64 million

to customer relationships,

$9 million

to trade names,

$14 million

to current assets,

$21 million

to derivative assets,

$47 million

to current and non-current liabilities, and goodwill of

$91 million

of which

$8 million

is deductible for U.S. income tax purposes in future periods. The consideration and assets include amounts paid for customer relationships in the Northeast that were accounted for as an asset acquisition. The factors that resulted in goodwill arising from the acquisition include the revenues associated with new customers in new regions and through the synergies associated with combining a new retail business with the Company's existing retail and generation assets.  The accounting for the Dominion acquisition was completed as of March 30, 2015, at which point the provisional fair values became final with no material changes.

2014 Acquisition of EME

On April 1, 2014, the Company acquired substantially all of the assets of EME.  EME, through its subsidiaries and affiliates, owned or leased and operated a portfolio of approximately8,000MW consisting of wind energy facilities and coal- and gas-fired generating facilities.  The Company paid an aggregate purchase price of$3.5 billion, which was funded through the issuance of12,671,977shares of NRG common stock on April 1, 2014, the issuance of$700 millionin newly-issued corporate debt, as described inNote 12,Debt and Capital Leases,and cash on hand.  The Company also assumed non-recourse debt of approximately$1.2 billion.

In connection with the transaction, NRG agreed to certain conditions with the parties to the Powerton and Joliet, or POJO, sale-leaseback transaction subject to which an NRG subsidiary assumed the POJO leveraged leases and NRG guaranteed the remaining payments under each lease, which total$405 millionthrough 2034.

On April 30, 2014, subsequent to the acquisition, the Company acquired the remaining50%ownership of Mission Del Sol LLC, which owns the Sunrise facility, a586MW natural gas facility in Fellows, California, from Chevron Power Holdings Inc. increasing the Company's ownership interest to100%in exchange for the Company's50%interest in six cogeneration facilities, previously co-owned with Chevron Power Holdings Inc.










The acquisition was recorded as a business combination under ASC 805, with identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed provisionally recorded at their estimated fair values on the acquisition date.  The accounting for the EME acquisition was completed as of March 31, 2015, at which point the fair values became final.  The following table summarizes the provisional amounts recognized for assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of December 31, 2014, as well as adjustments made through March 31, 2015, when the allocation became final.  Measurement period adjustments primarily reflect the tax impact of the acquisition date fair values and final estimates for asset retirement obligations.  The purchase price of$3.5 billionwas allocated as follows:

This transaction resulted in a gain on sale of$74 million.

2016 Disposition of Majority Interest in EVgo

On June 17, 2016, the Company completed the sale of a majority interest in its EVgo business to Vision Ridge Partners for total consideration of approximately

$39 million

, including

$17 million

in cash received, which is net of

$2.5 million

in working capital adjustments,

$15 million

contributed as capital to the EVgo business and

$7 million

of future contributions by Vision Ridge Partners, all of which were determined based on forecasted cash requirements to operate the business in future periods.  In addition, the Company has future earnout potential of up to

$70 million

based on future profitability targets. NRG retained its original financial obligation of

$102.5 million

under its agreement with the CPUC whereby EVgo will build at least


public fast charging Freedom Station sites and perform the associated work to prepare

10,000

commercial and multi-family parking spaces for electric vehicle charging in California. NRG has contracted with EVgo to continue to build the remaining required Freedom Stations and commercial and multi-family parking spaces for electric vehicle charging required under this obligation and EVgo will be directly reimbursed by NRG for the costs. As a result of the sale, the Company recorded a loss on sale of

$78 million

during the second quarter of 2016, which reflects the loss on the sale of the equity interest of

$27 million

and the accrual of NRG's remaining obligation under its agreement with the CPUC of

$56 million

, of which

$47 million

remains as of December 31, 2016.  At December 31, 2016, the Company's remaining

2016 Rockford Disposition

On May 12, 2016, the Company entered into an agreement with RA Generation, LLC to sell100%of its interests in the Rockford I and Rockford II generating stations, or Rockford, for cash consideration of$55 million, subject to adjustments for working capital and the results of the PJM 2019/2020 base residual auction.  Rockford is a450MW natural gas facility located in Rockford, Illinois.  The transaction triggered an indicator of impairment as the sales price was less than the carrying amount of the assets and as a result, the assets were considered to be impaired.  The Company measured the impairment loss as the difference between the carrying amount of the assets and the agreed-upon sales price.  The Company recorded an impairment loss of$17 millionduring the quarter ended June 30, 2016 to reduce the carrying amount of the assets held for sale to the fair market value.  On July 12, 2016, the Company completed the sale of Rockford for cash proceeds of$56 million, including$1 millionin adjustments for the PJM base residual auction results.  For further discussion on this impairment, refer toNote 10,Asset Impairments.

Note 4—Fair Value of Financial Instruments

For cash and cash equivalents, funds deposited by counterparties, accounts and other receivables, accounts payable, restricted cash, and cash collateral posted and received in support of energy risk management activities, the carrying amount approximates fair value because of the short-term maturity of those instruments and are classified as Level 1 within the fair value hierarchy.

The estimated carrying values and fair values of the Company's recorded financial instruments not carried at fair market value are as follows:

As of December 31,20162015Carrying AmountFair ValueCarrying AmountFair Value(In millions)AssetsNotes receivable(a)$34$34$73$73LiabilitiesLong-term debt, including current portion(b)$19,406$18,566$19,620$18,263

(a)  Includes the current portion of notes receivable which is recorded in prepayments and other current assets on the Company's consolidated balance sheets.

(b)  Excludes deferred financing costs, which are recorded as a reduction to long-term debt on the Company's consolidated balance sheets.

The fair value of the Company's publicly-traded long-term debt is based on quoted market prices and is classified as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy.  The fair value of debt securities, non-publicly traded long-term debt, and certain notes receivable of the Company are based on expected future cash flows discounted at market interest rates or current interest rates for similar instruments with equivalent credit quality and are classified as Level 3 within the fair value hierarchy. The following table presents the level within the fair value hierarchy for long-term debt, including current portion as of December 31, 2016 and 2015:

As of December 31, 2016As of December 31, 2015Level 2Level 3Level 2Level 3(In millions)Long-term debt, including current portion$11,055$7,511$11,028$7,235



Fair Value Accounting under ASC 820

ASC 820 establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three levels as follows:

•Level 1 — quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Company has the ability to access as of the measurement date. NRG's financial assets and liabilities utilizing Level 1 inputs include active exchange-traded securities, energy derivatives, and trust fund investments.

•Level 2 — inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are directly observable for the asset or liability or indirectly observable through corroboration with observable market data. NRG's financial assets and liabilities utilizing Level 2 inputs include fixed income securities, exchange-based derivatives, and over the counter derivatives such as swaps, options and forward contracts.

•Level 3 — unobservable inputs for the asset or liability only used when there is little, if any, market activity for the asset or liability at the measurement date. NRG's financial assets and liabilities utilizing Level 3 inputs include infrequently-traded, non-exchange-based derivatives and commingled investment funds, and are measured using present value pricing models.

In accordance with ASC 820, the Company determines the level in the fair value hierarchy within which each fair value measurement in its entirety falls, based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety.










Recurring Fair Value Measurements

Debt securities, equity securities, and trust fund investments, which are comprised of various U.S. debt and equity securities, and derivative assets and liabilities, are carried at fair market value.

Realized and unrealized gains and losses included in earnings that are related to the energy derivatives are recorded in operating revenues and cost of operations.

Non-derivative fair value measurements

NRG's investments in debt securities are classified as Level 3 and consist of non-traded debt instruments that are valued based on third-party market value assessments.

The trust fund investments are held primarily to satisfy NRG's nuclear decommissioning obligations.  These trust fund investments hold debt and equity securities directly and equity securities indirectly through commingled funds.  The fair values of equity securities held directly by the trust funds are based on quoted prices in active markets and are categorized in Level 1.  In addition, U.S. government and federal agency obligations are categorized as Level 1 because they trade in a highly liquid and transparent market.  The fair values of corporate debt securities are based on evaluated prices that reflect observable market information, such as actual trade information of similar securities, adjusted for observable differences and are categorized in Level 2.  Certain equity securities, classified as commingled funds, are analogous to mutual funds, are maintained by investment companies, and hold certain investments in accordance with a stated set of fund objectives.  The fair value of the equity securities classified as commingled funds are based on net asset values per fund share (the unit of account), derived from the quoted prices in active markets of the underlying equity securities.  However, because the shares in the commingled funds are not publicly quoted, not traded in an active market and are subject to certain restrictions regarding their purchase and sale, the commingled funds are categorized in Level 3.  See alsoNote 6,Nuclear Decommissioning Trust Fund.










Derivative fair value measurements

7%

of derivative assets and

12%

of derivative liabilities.  The fair value of each contract is discounted using a risk free interest rate.  In addition, the Company applies a credit reserve to reflect credit risk, which for interest rate swaps is calculated utilizing the bilateral method based on published default probabilities.  For commodities, to the extent that NRG's net exposure under a specific master agreement is an asset, the Company uses the counterparty's default swap rate.  If the exposure under a specific master agreement is a liability, the Company uses NRG's default swap rate.  For interest rate swaps and commodities, the credit reserve is added to the discounted fair value to reflect the exit price that a market participant would be willing to receive to assume NRG's liabilities or that a market participant would be willing to pay for NRG's assets.  As of

December 31, 2016

, the credit reserve resulted in an

$11 million

decrease in fair value in operating revenue and cost of operations.  As of December 31, 2015 the credit reserve resulted in a

$5 million

increase in fair value which is composed of a

$2 million

gain in OCI and a

$3 million

gain in operating revenue and cost of operations.

The fair values in each category reflect the level of forward prices and volatility factors as ofDecember 31, 2016, and may change as a result of changes in these factors. Management uses its best estimates to determine the fair value of commodity and derivative contracts NRG holds and sells. These estimates consider various factors including closing exchange and over-the-counter price quotations, time value, volatility factors and credit exposure. It is possible, however, that future market prices could vary from those used in recording assets and liabilities from energy marketing and trading activities and such variations could be material.

NRG's significant positions classified as Level 3 include physical and financial power and physical coal executed in illiquid markets as well as financial transmission rights, or FTRs. The significant unobservable inputs used in developing fair value include illiquid power and coal location pricing which is derived as a basis to liquid locations. The basis spread is based on observable market data when available or derived from historic prices and forward market prices from similar observable markets when not available. For FTRs, NRG uses the most recent auction prices to derive the fair value.

The following tables quantify the significant unobservable inputs used in developing the fair value of the Company's Level 3 positions as ofDecember 31, 2016and 2015:

Under the guidance of ASC 815, entities may choose to offset cash collateral posted or received against the fair value of derivative positions executed with the same counterparties under the same master netting agreements.  The Company has chosen not to offset positions as defined in ASC 815.  As ofDecember 31, 2016, the Company recorded$203 millionof cash collateral posted and$2 millionof cash collateral received on its balance sheet.

Concentration of Credit Risk

In addition to the credit risk discussion as disclosed inNote 2,Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, the following item is a discussion of the concentration of credit risk for the Company's financial instruments. Credit risk relates to the risk of loss resulting from non-performance or non-payment by counterparties pursuant to the terms of their contractual obligations.  The Company monitors and manages credit risk through credit policies that include: (i) an established credit approval process; (ii) a daily monitoring of counterparties' credit limits; (iii) the use of credit mitigation measures such as margin, collateral, prepayment arrangements, or volumetric limits; (iv) the use of payment netting agreements; and (v) the use of master netting agreements that allow for the netting of positive and negative exposures of various contracts associated with a single counterparty. Risks surrounding counterparty performance and credit could ultimately impact the amount and timing of expected cash flows. The Company seeks to mitigate counterparty risk by having a diversified portfolio of counterparties. The Company also has credit protection within various agreements to call on additional collateral support if and when necessary. Cash margin is collected and held at the Company to cover the credit risk of the counterparty until positions settle.










Counterparty Credit Risk

As ofDecember 31, 2016, counterparty credit exposure, excluding credit exposure from RTOs, ISOs, and registered commodity exchanges and certain long-term agreements, was$231 millionand NRG held collateral (cash and letters of credit) against those positions of$2 million, resulting in a net exposure of$229 million.  Approximately95%of the Company's exposure before collateral is expected to roll off by the end of2018. Counterparty credit exposure is valued through observable market quotes and discounted at a risk free interest rate.  The following tables highlight net counterparty credit exposure by industry sector and by counterparty credit quality.  Net counterparty credit exposure is defined as the aggregate net asset position for NRG with counterparties where netting is permitted under the enabling agreement and includes all cash flow, mark-to-market and NPNS, and non-derivative transactions.  The exposure is shown net of collateral held, and includes amounts net of receivables or payables.

(a)Counterparty credit exposure excludes uranium and coal transportation contracts because of the unavailability of market prices.

(b)The figures in the tables above exclude potential counterparty credit exposure related to RTOs, ISOs, registered commodity exchanges and certain long term contracts.

NRG has counterparty credit risk exposure to certain counterparties, each of which represent more than10%of total net exposure discussed above.  The aggregate of such counterparties' exposure was$80 millionas of December 31, 2016.  Changes in hedge positions and market prices will affect credit exposure and counterparty concentration. Given the credit quality, diversification and term of the exposure in the portfolio, NRG does not anticipate a material impact on the Company's financial position or results of operations from nonperformance by any of NRG's counterparties.

RTOs and ISOs

The Company participates in the organized markets of CAISO, ERCOT, ISO-NE, MISO, NYISO and PJM, known as RTOs or ISOs. Trading in these markets is approved by FERC, or in the case of ERCOT, approved by the PUCT and includes credit policies that, under certain circumstances, require that losses arising from the default of one member on spot market transactions be shared by the remaining participants. As a result, the counterparty credit risk to these markets is limited to NRG’s share of overall market and are excluded from the above exposures.

Exchange Traded Transactions

The Company enters into commodity transactions on registered exchanges, notably ICE and NYMEX. These clearinghouses act as the counterparty and transactions are subject to extensive collateral and margining requirements. As a result, these commodity transactions have limited counterparty credit risk.

Long Term Contracts

Counterparty credit exposure described above excludes credit risk exposure under certain long term agreements, including California tolling agreements, Gulf Coast load obligations, wind and solar PPAs.  As external sources or observable market quotes are not available to estimate such exposure, the Company values these contracts based on various techniques including, but not limited to, internal models based on a fundamental analysis of the market and extrapolation of observable market data with similar characteristics.  Based on these valuation techniques, as ofDecember 31, 2016, aggregate credit risk exposure managed by NRG to these counterparties was approximately$4.1 billion, including$2.6 billionrelated to assets of NRG Yield, Inc., for the nextfiveyears.  This amount excludes potential credit exposures for projects with long term PPAs that have not reached commercial operations.  The majority of these power contracts are with utilities or public power entities with strong credit quality and public utility commission or other regulatory support.  However, such regulated utility counterparties can be impacted by changes in government regulations, which NRG is unable to predict.










Retail Customer Credit Risk

The Company is exposed to retail credit risk through the Company's retail electricity providers, which serve C&I customers and the Mass market. Retail credit risk results in losses when a customer fails to pay for services rendered. The losses may result from both nonpayment of customer accounts receivable and the loss of in-the-money forward value. The Company manages retail credit risk through the use of established credit policies that include monitoring of the portfolio and the use of credit mitigation measures such as deposits or prepayment arrangements.

As ofDecember 31, 2016, the Company's retail customer credit exposure to C&I and Mass customers was diversified across many customers and various industries, as well as government entities. The Company is also subject to risk with respect to its residential solar customers. The Company's bad debt expense was$48 million,$64 million, and$64 millionfor the years ending December 31,2016,2015, and2014, respectively.  Current economic conditions may affect the Company's customers' ability to pay bills in a timely manner, which could increase customer delinquencies and may lead to an increase in bad debt expense.



Note 5—Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities

ASC 815 requires the Company to recognize all derivative instruments on the balance sheet as either assets or liabilities and to measure them at fair value each reporting period unless they qualify for a NPNS exception.  The Company may elect to designate certain derivatives as cash flow hedges, if certain conditions are met, and defer the effective portion of the change in fair value of the derivatives to accumulated OCI, until the hedged transactions occur and are recognized in earnings.  The ineffective portion of a cash flow hedge is immediately recognized in earnings.

For derivatives designated as hedges of the fair value of assets or liabilities, the changes in fair value of both the derivative and the hedged transaction are recorded in current earnings.

For derivatives that are not designated as cash flow hedges or do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment, the changes in the fair value will be immediately recognized in earnings.  Certain derivative instruments may qualify for the NPNS exception and are therefore exempt from fair value accounting treatment.  ASC 815 applies to NRG's energy related commodity contracts, interest rate swaps, and equity contracts.

As the Company engages principally in the trading and marketing of its generation assets and retail businesses, some of NRG's commercial activities qualify for hedge accounting.  In order for the generation assets to qualify, the physical generation and sale of electricity should be highly probable at inception of the trade and throughout the period it is held, as is the case with the Company's baseload plants.  For this reason, many trades in support of NRG's baseload units normally qualify for NPNS or cash flow hedge accounting treatment, and trades in support of NRG's peaking units' asset optimization will generally not qualify for hedge accounting treatment, with any changes in fair value likely to be reflected on a mark-to-market basis in the statement of operations.  Most of the retail load contracts either qualify for the NPNS exception or fail to meet the criteria for a derivative and the majority of the retail supply and fuels supply contracts are recorded under mark-to-market accounting.  All of NRG's hedging and trading activities are subject to limits within the Company's Risk Management Policy.

Energy-Related Commodities

To manage the commodity price risk associated with the Company's competitive supply activities and the price risk associated with wholesale power sales from the Company's electric generation facilities and retail power sales from NRG's retail businesses, NRG enters into a variety of derivative and non-derivative hedging instruments, utilizing the following:

•Forward contracts, which commit NRG to purchase or sell energy commodities or purchase fuels in the future;

•Futures contracts, which are exchange-traded standardized commitments to purchase or sell a commodity or financial instrument;

•Swap agreements, which require payments to or from counterparties based upon the differential between two prices for a predetermined contractual, or notional, quantity;

•Option contracts, which convey to the option holder the right but not the obligation to purchase or sell a commodity;

•Extendable swaps, which include a combination of swaps and options executed simultaneously for different periods.  This combination of instruments allows NRG to sell out-year volatility through call options in exchange for natural gas swaps with fixed prices in excess of the market price for natural gas at that time.  The above-market swap combined with its later-year call option are priced in aggregate at market at the trade's inception; and

•Weather and hurricane derivative products used to mitigate a portion of retail's lost revenue due to weather.










The objectives for entering into derivative contracts designated as hedges include:

•Fixing the price for a portion of anticipated future electricity sales that provides an acceptable return on the Company's electric generation operations;

•Fixing the price of a portion of anticipated fuel purchases for the operation of the Company's power plants; and

•Fixing the price of a portion of anticipated power purchases for the Company's retail sales.

NRG's trading and hedging activities are subject to limits within the Company's Risk Management Policy. These contracts are recognized on the balance sheet at fair value and changes in the fair value of these derivative financial instruments are recognized in earnings.

As ofDecember 31, 2016, NRG's derivative assets and liabilities consisted primarily of the following:

•Forward and financial contracts for the purchase/sale of electricity and related products economically hedging NRG's generation assets' forecasted output or NRG's retail load obligations through 2031;

•Forward and financial contracts for the purchase of fuel commodities relating to the forecasted usage of NRG's generation assets through 2018; and

•Other energy derivatives instruments extending through 2024.

Also, as ofDecember 31, 2016, NRG had other energy-related contracts that did not meet the definition of a derivative instrument or qualified for the NPNS exception and were therefore exempt from fair value accounting treatment as follows:

•Load-following forward electric sale contracts extending through 2026;

•Power tolling contracts through 2039;

•Coal purchase contracts through 2021;

•Power transmission contracts through 2025;

•Natural gas transportation contracts and storage agreements through 2030; and

•Coal transportation contracts through 2029.

Interest Rate Swaps

NRG is exposed to changes in interest rates through the Company's issuance of variable rate debt. In order to manage the Company's interest rate risk, NRG enters into interest rate swap agreements.  As ofDecember 31, 2016, NRG had interest rate derivative instruments on recourse debt extending through 2021 and non-recourse debt extending through 2036, the majority of which are designated as cash flow hedges.

Volumetric Underlying Derivative Transactions

The following table summarizes the net notional volume buy/(sell) of NRG's open derivative transactions broken out by commodity, excluding those derivatives that qualified for the NPNS exception as ofDecember 31, 2016and2015. Option contracts are reflected using delta volume.   Delta volume equals the notional volume of an option adjusted for the probability that the option will be in-the-money at its expiration date.

The decrease in the natural gas position was primarily the result of the settlement of generation hedge positions and retail hedge positions.  The increase in the interest rate position was primarily the result of entering into new interest rate swaps to hedge the Term Loan Facility, as described inNote 12,Debt and Capital Leases.

Amounts reclassified from accumulated OCI into income and amounts recognized in income from the ineffective portion of cash flow hedges are recorded to operating revenue for commodity contracts and interest expense for interest rate contracts.



Accounting guidelines require a high degree of correlation between the derivative and the hedged item throughout the period in order to qualify as a cash flow hedge.  As of December 31, 2016, the Company's regression analysis for Viento Funding II interest rate swaps, while positively correlated, did not meet the required threshold for cash flow hedge accounting. As a result, the Company de-designated the Viento Funding II cash flow hedges as of December 31, 2016, and will prospectively mark these derivatives to market through the income statement.



Impact of Derivative Instruments on the Statement of Operations

Unrealized gains and losses associated with changes in the fair value of derivative instruments not accounted for as cash flow hedges and ineffectiveness of hedge derivatives are reflected in current period earnings.

The following table summarizes the pre-tax effects of economic hedges that have not been designated as cash flow hedges, ineffectiveness on cash flow hedges, and trading activity on the Company's statement of operations. The effect of commodity hedges is included within operating revenues and cost of operations and the effect of interest rate hedges is included in interest expense.

The reversal of gain or loss positions acquired as part of acquisitions were valued based upon the forward prices on the acquisition dates.  The roll-off amounts were offset by realized gains or losses at the settled prices and are reflected in revenue or cost of operations during the same period.

For the year endedDecember 31, 2016, the$20 milliongain from economic hedge positions was primarily the result of an increase in the value of forward purchases of natural gas due to an increase in natural gas prices.










During 2016, the Company closed out and financially settled certain open positions with counterparties.  The closure and financial settlements with these counterparties were necessary to manage the increase in collateral posting requirements following rating agency downgrades for GenOn and to reduce expected collateral costs associated with exchange cleared hedge transactions.  GenOn realized approximately$38 milliondue to the closure and financial settlement of all open positions with one of GenOn's counterparties during the second quarter of 2016, for which$18 million,$19 millionand$1 millionwould have been realized during the remainder of 2016, 2017 and 2018, respectively. During the third quarter of 2016, GenOn realized$98 milliondue to the closure and financial settlement of certain positions with an additional counterparty for which$82 million,$13 millionand$3 millionwould have otherwise been realized in 2017, 2018, and 2019, respectively. GenOn has entered into additional transactions with NRG Power Marketing LLC and an external counterparty in order to re-hedge the positions settled with certain counterparties.

For the year endedDecember 31, 2015, the$9 milliongain from economic hedge positions was primarily the result of an increase in the value of forward sales of electricity due to a decrease in power prices.

For the year endedDecember 31, 2014, the$361 milliongain from economic hedge positions was primarily the result of an increase in the value of forward sales of natural gas due to a decrease in natural gas prices.

During 2014, NRG had interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges on the Dandan solar project.  The notional amount on the swaps exceeded the actual debt draws on the project.  As such, the Company discontinued cash flow hedge accounting for these contracts and$6 millionof losses previously deferred in OCI was recognized in the statement of operations for the year endedDecember 31, 2014.

Credit Risk Related Contingent Features

Certain of the Company's hedging agreements contain provisions that require the Company to post additional collateral if the counterparty determines that there has been deterioration in credit quality, generally termed "adequate assurance" under the agreements, or require the Company to post additional collateral if there were a one notch downgrade in the Company's credit rating.   The collateral required for contracts that have adequate assurance clauses that are in net liability positions as ofDecember 31, 2016was$36 million.  The collateral required for contracts with credit rating contingent features that are in a net liability position as ofDecember 31, 2016was$56 million.  The Company is also a party to certain marginable agreements under which it has a net liability position, but the counterparty has not called for the collateral due, which was approximately$14 millionas ofDecember 31, 2016.

SeeNote 4,Fair Value of Financial Instruments,for discussion regarding concentration of credit risk.



Note 6—Nuclear Decommissioning Trust Fund

NRG's Nuclear Decommissioning Trust Fund assets, which are for the decommissioning of STP, are comprised of securities classified as available-for-sale and recorded at fair value based on actively quoted market prices. Although NRG is responsible for managing the decommissioning of its44%interest in STP, the predecessor utilities that owned STP are authorized by the PUCT to collect decommissioning funds from their ratepayers to cover decommissioning costs on behalf of NRG. NRC requirements determine the decommissioning cost estimate which is the minimum required level of funding. In the event that funds from the ratepayers that accumulate in the nuclear decommissioning trust are ultimately determined to be inadequate to decommission the STP facilities, the utilities will be required to collect through rates charged to rate payers all additional amounts, with no obligation from NRG, provided that NRG has complied with PUCT rules and regulations regarding decommissioning trusts. Following completion of the decommissioning, if surplus funds remain in the decommissioning trusts, any excess will be refunded to the respective ratepayers of the utilities.

NRG accounts for the Nuclear Decommissioning Trust Fund in accordance with ASC 980,Regulated Operations, or ASC 980, because the Company's nuclear decommissioning activities are subject to approval by the PUCT, with regulated rates that are designed to recover all decommissioning costs and that can be charged to and collected from the ratepayers per PUCT mandate. Since the Company is in compliance with PUCT rules and regulations regarding decommissioning trusts and the cost of decommissioning is the responsibility of the Texas ratepayers, not NRG, all realized and unrealized gains or losses (including other-than-temporary impairments) related to the Nuclear Decommissioning Trust Fund are recorded to the Nuclear Decommissioning Trust liability and are not included in net income or accumulated other comprehensive income, consistent with regulatory treatment.










The following table summarizes the aggregate fair values and unrealized gains and losses (including other-than-temporary impairments) for the securities held in the trust funds, as well as information about the contractual maturities of those securities.

The Company decreased accumulated depreciation and facilities and equipment within total property, plant and equipment by approximately$1 billion, respectively, to adjust amounts previously presented as of December 31, 2015.  This adjustment had no impact on net assets at December 31, 2015. Accordingly, the Company does not consider the adjustment to be material to the consolidated balance sheet. Consolidated operating income and net income for the year ended December 31, 2016 were not impacted by the adjustment.

The Company recorded long-lived asset impairments during the years endedDecember 31, 2016and2015, as further described inNote 10,Asset Impairments.





Note 10—Asset Impairments

2016 Impairment Losses



Rockford—As described inNote 3,Business Acquisitions and Dispositions, on May 12, 2016, the Company entered into an agreement with RA Generation, LLC to sell100%of its interests in the Rockford generating stations for cash consideration of$55 million.  The transaction triggered an indicator of impairment as the sale price was less than the carrying amount of the assets, and, as a result, the assets were considered to be impaired.  The Company measured the impairment loss as the difference between the carrying amount of the assets and the agreed-upon sale price.  The Company recorded an impairment loss of$17 millionduring the year ended December 31, 2016, to reduce the carrying amount of the assets held for sale to the fair market value.












Mandalay and Ormond Beach

—



On May 26

,

$16 million

and

$43 million

for Mandalay and Ormond Beach, respectively, during the second quarter of 2016.





In addition, during the fourth quarter of 2016 the declining prices for resource adequacy contracts available in the reliability sub-area which Ormond Beach operates in further reduced anticipated cash flows to be generated from Ormond Beach through its anticipated retirement in 2020.  This was considered to be an indicator of impairment and as a result, the Company performed an impairment test for the Ormond Beach assets. The Company determined that the carrying amount of these assets was higher than the estimated future net cash flows expected to be generated by the assets and that the Ormond Beach assets were impaired.  The fair value of the Ormond Beach operating unit was determined using the income approach which utilizes estimates of discounted future cash flows, which were Level 3 fair value measurements and include key inputs such as forecasted contract prices, forecasted operating expenses and discount rates.  During the fourth quarter of 2016, the Company recorded an additional impairment loss of$28 millionfor Ormond Beach.



Wind Facilities— During the fourth quarter of 2016, as the Company updated its estimated future cash flows in connection with the preparation of its annual budget, the Company determined that the cash flows for the Elbow Creek and Goat Wind projects, located in Texas and the Forward project, located in Pennsylvania were below the carrying value of the related assets, primarily driven by the declining merchant power prices in post-contract periods, and the assets were considered impaired. The fair values of the facilities were determined using an income approach by applying a discounted cash flow methodology to the long-term budgets for each respective plant.  The income approach utilized estimates of discounted future cash flows, which were Level 3 fair value measurements and include key inputs, such as forecasted power prices, operations and maintenance expense and discount rates.  The Company measured the impairment loss as the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value of the assets and recorded impairment losses of$117 million,$60 millionand$6 millionfor Elbow Creek, Goat Wind and Forward, respectively.

Long Beach—During the fourth quarter of 2016, the Company determined that by the end of 2017 it would retire its Long Beach generation station located in Long Beach, California.  The generating station was not awarded a PPA, in the SCE's capacity auction during the fourth quarter of 2016 and the current PPA will expire on July 31, 2017.  The Company considered this to be an indicator of impairment and performed an impairment test.  The Company measured the impairment loss as the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value of the assets and recorded an impairment loss of$36 million.

Keystone and Conemaugh Leased Interests—During the fourth quarter of 2016, the Company revised its estimated future cash flows in connection with the preparation of its annual budget.  The Company noted the cash flows for the leased interests in Keystone and Conemaugh were below the carrying value of the related assets, primarily driven by a reduction in long-term energy and capacity prices in PJM, and the assets were impaired.  The fair value of the interests in Keystone and Conemaugh were determined using the income approach which utilizes estimates of discounted future cash flows, which were Level 3 fair value measurements and include key inputs such as forecasted power, capacity and fuel prices, forecasted operating expenses, contractual lease payments and discount rates. The Company recorded impairment losses of$97 millionand$10 millionfor Conemaugh and Keystone respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2016.

Pittsburg— During the fourth quarter of 2016, the Company determined that it would need to retire the Pittsburg facility earlier than anticipated as it did not receive a resource adequacy contract for 2017.  The Company considered this to be a triggering event and tested the assets for impairment.  The fair value of the facility was determined using an income approach and the Company recorded an impairment loss of$20 millionto reduce the carrying amount to the value of the underlying land.










Other Impairments— During 2016, the Company recorded other impairment losses of$153 million, which included$23 millionin excess SO2allowances,$23 millionfor other intangible assets,$19 millionin previously purchased solar panels,$18 millionin deferred marketing expenses,$22 millionin other investments and$48 millionof other impairment losses.



Petra Nova Parish Holdings—During the first quarter of 2016, management changed its plans with respect to its future capital commitments driven in part by the continued decline in oil prices. As a result, the Company reviewed its50%interest in Petra Nova Parish Holdings for impairment utilizing the other-than-temporary impairment model. In determining fair value, the Company utilized an income approach and considered project specific assumptions for the future project cash flows.  The carrying amount of the Company's equity method investment exceeded the fair value of the investment and the Company concluded that the decline is considered to be other-than-temporary.  As a result, the Company measured the impairment loss as the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value of the investment and recorded an impairment loss of$140 million.



Community Wind North and Sherbino—During the fourth quarter of 2016, the Company offered several projects to NRG Yield including its interest in Community Wind North.  The offer price was below its current carrying amount and this decline in fair value was determined to be other-than-temporary.  Accordingly, the Company recorded an impairment loss of$36 millionto reduce its carrying amount to fair value.  In addition, in connection with the preparation of the annual budget, the Company noted that due to the anticipated difficulty in refinancing Sherbino’s debt that will mature in 2018, the project’s fair value had decreased significantly below its carrying amount and this decline was determined to be other-than-temporary.  Accordingly, the Company determined that an other-than-temporary impairment existed and recorded an impairment loss on its investment in Sherbino of$70 million.



2015 Impairment Losses



Seward—As described inNote 3,Business Acquisitions and Dispositions, on November 24, 2015, the Company entered into an agreement with Robindale Energy Services, Inc. to sell Seward for cash consideration of$75 million.  The transaction triggered an impairment indicator as the sale price was less than the carrying amount of the assets, and, as a result, the assets were considered to be impaired.  The Company measured the impairment loss as the difference between the carrying amount of the assets and the agreed-upon sale price.  The Company recorded an impairment loss of$134 millionfor the year ended December 31, 2015, to reduce the carrying amount of the assets held for sale to the fair market value.



Limestone and W.A. Parish—During the fourth quarter of 2015, as the Company updated its estimates of future cash flows in connection with the preparation of its annual budget, it was noted that the cash flows for the Limestone and W.A. Parish coal-fired facilities located in Texas were lower than the carrying amount, primarily driven by declining power prices as the cost of commodities continues to decline and the assets were impaired.  The fair value of the Limestone and W.A. Parish plants was determined using an income approach by applying a discounted cash flow methodology to the long-term budgets for each respective plant.  The income approach utilized estimates of discounted future cash flows, which were Level 3 fair value measurements, and include key inputs such as forecasted power prices, fuel costs and emissions credit expense, forecasted operating and capital expenditures and discount rates. The Company measured the impairment loss as the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value of the assets and recognized impairment losses of$1,514 millionand$1,295 millionrelated to Limestone and W.A. Parish, respectively.



Huntley—On August 25, 2015, the Company filed a notice with the NYSPSC of its intent to retire Huntley's operating units on March 1, 2016.  The Company considered this to be an indicator of impairment and performed an impairment test for these assets under ASC 360,Property, Plant and Equipment. On October 14, 2015, the Company filed a cost-of-service filing at FERC in anticipation that the Huntley operating units would be needed for reliability purposes, proposing a reliability must run service agreement for a four-year period beginning on March 1, 2016.  On October 30, 2015, NYISO released the results of its reliability study, indicating that the Huntley operating units are not needed for bulk system reliability.  The Company considered the impact of the reliability study conducted and evaluated the estimated cash flows associated with the facility.  Accordingly, the Company determined that the carrying amount of the assets was higher than the estimated future net cash flows expected to be generated by the assets and that the assets were impaired. The fair value of the Huntley operating units was determined using the income approach. The income approach utilized estimates of discounted future cash flows, which were Level 3 fair value measurements, and include key inputs such as forecasted contract prices, forecasted operating expenses and discount rates. The Company recorded an impairment loss of$132 millionduring the year ended December 31, 2015.












Dunkirk—The Company signed a ten-year agreement in November 2014 with National Grid to add natural gas-burning capabilities at the Dunkirk facility.  On August 25, 2015, NRG announced that Dunkirk Unit 2 would be mothballed on January 1, 2016 at the expiration of its reliability support services agreement. The project to add natural gas-burning capabilities has been suspended, pending the outcome of litigation with respect to the gas addition contract and its validity.  On October 30, 2015, NYISO released the results of its reliability study, indicating that the Dunkirk facility is not needed for system reliability.  In connection with the planned mothball of the facility, the pending litigation and the latest reliability assessment completed by NYISO, the Company evaluated whether the related fixed assets were impaired. The Company determined that the carrying amount of the assets was higher than the estimated future net cash flows expected to be generated by the assets and that the assets were impaired. The fair value of the Dunkirk facility was determined using the income approach. The income approach utilized estimates of discounted future cash flows, which were Level 3 fair value measurements, and include key inputs such as forecasted contract prices, forecasted operating and capital expenditures and discount rates. The Company recorded an impairment loss of$160 millionduring the year ended December 31, 2015.



Gregory— During the fourth quarter of 2015, the Company determined that the carrying amount of the assets was higher than the estimated future net cash flows expected to be generated by the assets and that the assets were impaired.  The fair value of the Gregory facility was determined using the income approach, which utilized estimates of discounted future cash flows, which were Level 3 fair value measurements, and include key inputs such as forecasted prices, operating and capital expenditures and discount rates. The Company recorded an impairment loss of$176 millionduring the year ended December 31, 2015.



Solar Panels—During the fourth quarter of 2015, the Company recorded an impairment loss of$29 millionto reduce the carrying value of certain solar panels to their approximate fair value.

Investments—During the fourth quarter of 2015, the Company reviewed certain of its cost method and equity method investments and concluded that losses incurred by these investments were other-than-temporary.  These losses were primarily driven by the sustained decline in stock price of a publicly traded investment as well as change in financing structures of certain non-publicly traded investments. As a result, the Company recorded losses related to these investments of$56 million.



2014 Impairment Losses



Coolwater—During the fourth quarter of 2014, the Company determined that it would retire the636MW natural-gas fired Coolwater facility in Dagget, California.  The facility faced critical repairs on the cooling towers for units 3 and 4 and, during the fourth quarter of 2014, did not receive any awards in a near-term capacity auction and no interest in a bilateral capacity deal.  The Company considered this to be an indicator of impairment and performed an impairment test for these assets under ASC 360,Property, Plant and Equipment.  The carrying amount of the assets was higher than the future net cash flows expected to be generated by the assets and as a result, the assets are considered to be impaired.  The Company measured the impairment loss as the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value of the assets.  The Company retired the Coolwater facility effective January 1, 2015.  All remaining fixed assets of the station were written off resulting in an impairment loss of$22 millionrecorded during the fourth quarter of 2014.

Osceola—During the third quarter of 2014, the Company determined that it would mothball the463MW natural gas-fired Osceola facility, in Saint Cloud, Florida. The Company considered this to be an indicator of impairment and performed an impairment test for these assets under ASC 360,Property, Plant and Equipment.  The carrying amount of the assets was higher than the future net cash flows expected to be generated by the assets and as a result, the assets were considered to be impaired.  The Company measured the impairment loss as the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value of the assets. Due to the location of the facility, it was determined that the best indicator of fair value is the market value of the combustion turbines.

$1.7 billion

of goodwill was recognized as part of the Texas Genco acquisition in 2006 and

$1.4 billion

was written off in 2015.  The Company determined the fair value of the Texas reporting unit primarily using an income approach through which the Company applied a discounted cash flow methodology to the long-term budgets for all plants in the regions.  Significant inputs impacting the income approach include the Company's views of power and fuel prices for the first five-year period and the Company's view for the longer term, which were finalized in connection with the preparation of the fourth quarter financial statements, projected generation based on an hourly dispatch meant to simulate the dispatch of each unit into the power market which is impacted by power prices, fuel prices, and the physical and economic characteristics of each plant, intangible value to Texas for synergies it provides to NRG's retail businesses, and the discount rate applied to cash flow projections.  Under step one, the estimated fair value of the Texas invested capital was

43%

below its carrying value as of December 31, 2016, and the Company concluded step two was required.  Based on the results of step two of the impairment test, the Company determined the carrying amount of the reporting unit was higher than the fair value, and accordingly, the Company recognized an impairment loss of

Note 13—Asset Retirement Obligations

The Company's AROs are primarily related to the future dismantlement of equipment on leased property and environmental obligations related to nuclear decommissioning, ash disposal, site closures, and fuel storage facilities. In addition, the Company has also identified conditional AROs for asbestos removal and disposal, which are specific to certain power generation operations.

SeeNote 6,Nuclear Decommissioning Trust Fund,for a further discussion of the Company's nuclear decommissioning obligations.  Accretion for the nuclear decommissioning ARO and amortization of the related ARO asset are recorded to the Nuclear Decommissioning Trust Liability to the ratepayers and are not included in net income, consistent with regulatory treatment.

The following table represents the balance of ARO obligations as ofDecember 31, 2016and2015, along with the additions, reductions and accretion related to the Company's ARO obligations for the year endedDecember 31, 2016:

Note 14—Benefit Plans and Other Postretirement Benefits

NRG sponsors and operates defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans.  As part of the GenOn acquisition in 2012, NRG assumed GenOn's defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans, and GenOn's benefit plan obligations were recorded at fair value at the time of the acquisition.  NRG expects to contribute$36 millionto the Company's pension plans in2017.

NRG pension benefits are available to eligible non-union and union employees through various defined benefit pension plans.  These benefits are based on pay, service history and age at retirement.  Most pension benefits are provided through tax-qualified plans.  Certain executive pension benefits that cannot be provided by the tax-qualified plans are provided through unfunded non-tax-qualified plans.  NRG also provides postretirement health and welfare benefits for certain groups of employees.  Cost sharing provisions vary by the terms of any applicable collective bargaining agreements.

As part of the change in control associated with the GenOn acquisition, NRG decided to terminate/settle the nonqualified legacy GenOn Benefit Restoration Plan and Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan.  Final settlement payments totaling$12 millionwere paid to remaining participants during 2014. On December 31, 2014, NRG merged eight qualified pension plans into two separate qualified pension plans, the NRG Pension Plan for Bargained Employees and the NRG Pension Plan. The NRG Pension Plan for Bargained Employees, GenOn Mirant Bargaining Unit Pension Plan, GenOn First Energy Pension Plan, GenOn Duquesne Pension Plan, and GenOn REMA Pension Plan were merged into the NRG Pension Plan for Bargained Employees. The NRG Texas Retirement Plan, and GenOn Mirant Pension Plan were merged into the NRG Pension Plan for Non-Bargained Employees and renamed the NRG Pension Plan. These actions were conducted to simplify internal administration of the plans, reduce regulatory filings, and lower fees paid to outside vendors. The benefits provided to current participants in the Plans were not impacted. As controlled group members, ERISA requires that NRG and GenOn are jointly and severally liable for the NRG Pension Plan for Bargained Employees and the NRG Pension Plan, including pension liabilities associated with GenOn employees.

The Company's estimated unrecognized loss and unrecognized prior service cost for NRG's pension plan that will be amortized from accumulated OCI to net periodic cost over the next fiscal year is approximately$4 million. The Company's estimated unrecognized gain and unrecognized prior service credit for NRG's postretirement plan that will be amortized from accumulated OCI to net periodic cost over the next fiscal year is$1 millionand$8 million, respectively.

In accordance with ASC 820, the Company determines the level in the fair value hierarchy within which each fair value measurement in its entirety falls, based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety.  The fair value of the common/collective trusts is valued at fair value which is equal to the sum of the market value of all of the fund's underlying investments, and is categorized as Level 2.  Partnerships/joint ventures Level 2 investments consist primarily of a partnership which invests in emerging market equity securities.  There are no investments categorized as Level 3.

NRG uses December 31 of each respective year as the measurement date for the Company's pension and other postretirement benefit plans.  The Company sets the discount rate assumptions on an annual basis for each of NRG's defined benefit retirement plans as of December 31.  The discount rate assumptions represent the current rate at which the associated liabilities could be effectively settled at December 31.  The Company utilizes the Aon Hewitt AA Above Median, or AA-AM, yield curve to select the appropriate discount rate assumption for each retirement plan.  The AA-AM yield curve is a hypothetical AA yield curve represented by a series of annualized individual spot discount rates from6months to99years.  Each bond issue used to build this yield curve must be non-callable, and have an average rating of AA when averaging available Moody's Investor Services, Standard & Poor's and Fitch ratings.

NRG employs a total return investment approach, whereby a mix of equities and fixed income investments are used to maximize the long-term return of plan assets for a prudent level of risk.  Risk tolerance is established through careful consideration of plan liabilities, plan funded status, and corporate financial condition.  The Investment Committee reviews the asset mix periodically and as the plan assets increase in future years, the Investment Committee may examine other asset classes such as real estate or private equity.  NRG employs a building block approach to determining the long-term rate of return assumption for plan assets, with proper consideration given to diversification and rebalancing.  Historical markets are studied and long-term historical relationships between equities and fixed income are preserved, consistent with the widely accepted capital market principle that assets with higher volatility generate a greater return over the long run.  Current factors such as inflation and interest rates are evaluated before long-term capital market assumptions are determined.  Peer data and historical returns are reviewed to check for reasonableness and appropriateness.

In 2016, NRG changed the approach utilized to estimate the service cost and interest cost components of net periodic benefit cost for pension and postretirement benefit plans. Historically, the Company estimated these components by using a single weighted average discount rate derived from the yield curve used to measure the benefit obligation. The Company has elected to use a spot rate approach in the estimation of the components of benefit cost by applying specific spot rates along the yield curve to the relevant projected cash flows, as this provides a better estimate of service and interest costs. This election is considered a change in estimate and, accordingly, has been accounted for starting in 2016. This change does not affect the measurement of NRG's total benefit obligation.



The target allocations of NRG's pension plan assets were as follows for the year endedDecember 31, 2016:

U.S. equity27%Non-U.S. equity15%Global equity10%Emerging market equity3%U.S. fixed income45%

Plan assets are currently invested in a diversified blend of equity and fixed-income investments.  Furthermore, equity investments are diversified across U.S., non-U.S., global, and emerging market equities, as well as among growth, value, small and large capitalization stocks.










Investment risk and performance are monitored on an ongoing basis through quarterly portfolio reviews of each asset fund class to a related performance benchmark, if applicable, and annual pension liability measurements.  Performance benchmarks are composed of the following indices:

STP Defined Benefit Plans

NRG has a44%undivided ownership interest in STP, as discussed further inNote 27,Jointly Owned Plants.  STPNOC, which operates and maintains STP, provides its employees a defined benefit pension plan as well as postretirement health and welfare benefits.  Although NRG does not sponsor the STP plan, it reimburses STPNOC for44%of the contributions made towards its retirement plan obligations.  For the year endedDecember 31, 2016, NRG reimbursed STPNOC$7 milliontowards its defined benefit plans. For the year ended December 31, 2015, NRG reimbursed STPNOC$9 milliontowards its defined benefit plans. In2017, NRG expects to reimburse STPNOC$12 millionfor its contribution towards the plans.

Defined Contribution Plans

NRG's employees are also eligible to participate in defined contribution 401(k) plans.  Upon completion of the GenOn acquisition, NRG assumed GenOn's defined contribution 401(k) plans and amended the plan covering the majority of employees with NRG 401(k) plan features, effective January 1, 2013.  On July 5, 2013, the GenOn defined contribution 401(k) plans were merged into the NRG 401(k) plan.

Preferred Stock

2.822% Redeemable Preferred Stock

Preferred Stock

On December 23, 2014, NRG and the Credit Suisse Group amended and restated its250,000shares of3.625%Convertible Perpetual Preferred Stock, or3.625%Preferred Stock, which is treated as redeemable preferred stock, initially issued on August 11, 2005, to the Credit Suisse Group in a private placement.  The amendment resulted in a reduction of the rate from3.625%to2.822%and is hereby referred to as the2.822%Preferred Stock.  The transaction was accounted for as an extinguishment of the3.625%Preferred Stock and the issuance of new2.822%Preferred Stock.  The loss on extinguishment of the3.625%Preferred Stock of$42 millionrepresents the increase in redeemable preferred stock as the Company recorded the2.822%Preferred Stock at a fair value of$291 millionin connection with the amendment.  The loss on extinguishment of$42 millionas well as$5 millionin consent fees paid to Credit Suisse, were recorded as a dividend on the preferred shares.  This amount reduced net income to arrive at net income/(loss) available to NRG common stockholders in the calculation of earnings per share for the year ended December 31, 2014.

On May 24, 2016, NRG entered an agreement with Credit Suisse Group to     repurchase100%of the outstanding shares of its$344.5 million2.822%preferred stock.  On June 13, 2016, the Company completed the repurchase from Credit Suisse of100%of the outstanding shares at a price of$226 million. The transaction resulted in a gain on redemption of$78 million, measured as the difference between the fair value of the cash consideration paid upon redemption of$226 millionand the carrying value of the preferred stock at the time of the redemption of$304 million. This amount is reflected in net income/(loss) available to NRG common stockholders in the calculation of earnings per share.

As ofDecember 31, 2016, the outstanding principal balance of the term loan facility was$72 million, and is secured by substantially all of Sherbino's assets and membership interests.  During the fourth quarter of 2016, the Company recorded an other-than-temporary impairment loss equal to the full value of its investment in Sherbino  of$70 millionas further described inNote 10,Asset Impairments.

Other Equity Investments

Gladstone— Through a joint venture, NRG owns a37.5%interest in Gladstone, a1,613MW coal-fueled power generation facility in Queensland, Australia. The power generation facility is managed by the joint venture participants and the facility is operated by NRG. Operating expenses incurred in connection with the operation of the facility are funded by each of the participants in proportion to their ownership interests. Coal is sourced from local mines in Queensland. NRG and the joint venture participants receive their respective share of revenues directly from the off takers in proportion to the ownership interests in the joint venture. Power generated by the facility is primarily sold to an adjacent aluminum smelter, with excess power sold to the Queensland Government owned utility under long term supply contracts. NRG's investment in Gladstone was$132 millionas ofDecember 31, 2016.

Entities that are Consolidated

The Company has a controlling financial interest in certain entities which have been identified as VIEs under ASC 810.  These arrangements are primarily related to tax equity arrangements entered into with third-parties in order to finance the cost of solar energy systems under operating leases and wind facilities eligible for certain tax credits as further described inNote 2,Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.

Basic earnings/(loss) per common share is computed by dividing net income/(loss) less accumulated preferred stock dividends by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. Shares issued and treasury shares repurchased during the year are weighted for the portion of the year that they were outstanding. Diluted earnings/(loss) per share is computed in a manner consistent with that of basic earnings/(loss) per share while giving effect to all potentially dilutive common shares that were outstanding during the period.

Dilutive effect for equity compensation and other equity instruments— The outstanding non-qualified stock options, non-vested restricted stock units, and market stock units are not considered outstanding for purposes of computing basic earnings/(loss) per share. However, these instruments are included in the denominator for purposes of computing diluted earnings/(loss) per share under the treasury stock method.  The if-converted method was used to determine the dilutive effect of embedded derivatives in the Company's2.822%Preferred Stock for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014.  During 2016, the Company repurchased100%of the outstanding shares of its2.822%preferred stock.

The reconciliation of NRG's basic earnings/(loss) per share to diluted earnings/(loss) per share is shown in the following table:

Note 18—Segment Reporting

The Company's segment structure reflects how management currently makes financial decisions and allocates resources. During January 2017, the Company's businesses are segregated as follows: Generation, which includes generation, international and BETM (previously part of Corporate); Retail which includes Mass customers (previously Retail Mass), and Business Solutions, which includes C&I customers and other distributed and reliability products (previously in the Generation segment); Renewables, which includes solar and wind assets, excluding those in NRG Yield; NRG Yield; and corporate activities. The Company's corporate segment includes residential solar and electric vehicle services. Intersegment sales are accounted for at market.  The financial information for years endedDecember 31, 2016,2015, and2014have been recast to reflect these changes.

NRG Yield includes certain of the Company's contracted generation assets. On September 1, 2016 NRG Yield acquired the remaining51.05%interest in CVSR Holdco LLC, which indirectly owns the CVSR solar facility, from the Company. This acquisition was accounted for as transfers of entities under common control and accordingly, all historical periods have been recast to reflect this change.

NRG’s chief operating decision maker, its chief executive officer, evaluates the performance of its segments based on operational measures including adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or Adjusted EBITDA, free cash flow and capital for allocation, as well as net income/(loss) and net income/(loss) attributable to NRG Energy, Inc.

During the years endedDecember 31, 2016,2015and2014, the Company hadonecustomer in the East region within Generation which comprised more than10%of the Company's consolidated revenues.

For the year endedDecember 31, 2016, NRG's overall effective tax rate was different than the statutory rate of35%primarily due to the change in valuation allowance, the impact of non-taxable equity earnings and current state tax expense, partially offset by the generation of PTCs from various wind facilities.



For the year endedDecember 31, 2015, NRG's overall effective tax rate was different than the statutory rate of35%primarily due to recording of a valuation allowance on the federal and certain state net deferred tax assets that may not be realizable under a “more likely than not” measurement. In addition, a portion of the book goodwill impairment is classified as a permanent reversal impacting the effective tax rate.










For the year endedDecember 31, 2014, NRG's overall effective tax rate was different than the statutory rate of35%primarily due to the generation of PTCs generated from various wind facilities including assets acquired in the EME transaction, and a benefit resulting from the recognition of uncertain tax benefits, partially offset by state and local income taxes including a change in the effective state rate.

The temporary differences, which gave rise to the Company's deferred tax assets and liabilities consisted of the following:

Deferred tax assets and valuation allowance

Net deferred tax balance— As ofDecember 31, 2016and2015, NRG recorded a net deferred tax asset of$4.3 billionand$3.7 billion, respectively. The Company believes the federal and certain state net deferred tax assets may not be realizable under a “more likely than not” measurement and as such, a valuation allowance has been recorded to reduce the asset accordingly. The Company assesses cumulative and forecasted pretax book earnings and the future reversal of existing taxable temporary differences.










Based on the Company's assessment of positive and negative evidence, including available tax planning strategies, NRG believes that it is more likely than not that a benefit will not be realized on$4.1 billionand$3.6 billionof tax assets as ofDecember 31, 2016, and2015, respectively, thus a valuation allowance has been recorded. The net deferred tax asset of$205 millionis predominantly due to the inclusion of NRG Yield Inc.'s net deferred tax asset consisting primarily of net operating losses.

NOL carryforwards— AtDecember 31, 2016, the Company had tax effected cumulative domestic NOLs consisting of carryforwards for federal income tax purposes of$1.2 billionand state of$223 million.  The Company estimates it will need to generate future taxable income to fully realize the net federal deferred tax asset before expiration commencing in 2026. In addition, NRG has cumulative foreign NOL carryforwards of$63 millionwith no expiration date.

Valuation allowance— As ofDecember 31, 2016, the Company's tax effected valuation allowance was$4.1 billion, consisting of domestic federal net deferred tax assets of approximately$3.6 billion, domestic state net deferred tax assets of$504 million, foreign net operating loss carryforwards of$63 millionand foreign capital loss carryforwards of approximately$1 million. Based upon the assessment of cumulative and forecasted pretax book earnings, and the future reversal of existing taxable temporary differences, it was determined that a valuation allowance was required to be recorded during the year.

Taxes Receivable and Payable

As ofDecember 31, 2016, NRG recorded a current tax payable of$8 millionthat represents a tax liability due for state income taxes.  NRG has a tax receivable of$29 million, comprised of,$10 milliondue from the New York State Empire Zone program, and$11 millionof refunds due from state income tax estimated payments and return filings for 2016 and 2015, respectively. The remaining balance of$8 millionrelates to federal cash grants applied for eligible solar energy projects, net of sequestration.

Uncertain tax benefits

NRG has identified uncertain tax benefits whose after-tax value is$34 millionfor which, as of December 31, 2016, and 2015, NRG has recorded a non-current tax liability of$37 millionand$35 million, respectively.  The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to uncertain tax benefits in income tax expense.  During the year endedDecember 31, 2016, the Company recognized an expense of$1 millionin interest.  As ofDecember 31, 2016and2015, NRG had cumulative interest and penalties related to these uncertain tax benefits of$4 millionand$3 million, respectively.



Tax jurisdictions— NRG is subject to examination by taxing authorities for income tax returns filed in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and various state and foreign jurisdictions including operations located in Australia.

The Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal income tax examinations for years prior to 2015.  With few exceptions, state and local income tax examinations are no longer open for years before 2010.

Restricted Stock Units

As ofDecember 31, 2016, RSUs granted under the Company's LTIPs typically havethree-year graded vesting schedules beginning on the grant date. Fair value of the RSUs is based on the closing price of NRG common stock on the date of grant.  The following table summarizes the Company's non-vested RSU awards and changes during the year:

The total fair value of RSUs vested during the years endedDecember 31, 2016,2015, and2014, was$11 million,$10 millionand$26 million, respectively.  The weighted average grant date fair value of RSUs granted during the years endedDecember 31, 2016,2015, and2014was$11.54,$27.31, and$29.90, respectively.

Deferred Stock Units

DSUs represent the right of a participant to be paid one share of NRG common stock at the end of a deferral period established under the terms of the award. DSUs granted under the Company's LTIPs are fully vested at the date of issuance. Fair value of the DSUs, which is based on the closing price of NRG common stock on the date of grant, is recorded as compensation expense in the period of grant.

The aggregate intrinsic values for DSUs outstanding as ofDecember 31, 2016,2015, and2014were approximately$6 million,$5 million, and$10 millionrespectively.  The aggregate intrinsic values for DSUs converted to common stock for the years endedDecember 31, 2016,2015, and2014were$1 million,less than a million, and$1 million, respectively.  The weighted average grant date fair value of DSUs granted during the years endedDecember 31, 2016,2015, and2014was$16.85,$25.14and$35.63, respectively.

Market Stock Units

MSUs are restricted grants where the quantity of shares increases and decreases alongside the Company's Total Shareholder Return, or TSR.  Each MSU represents the potential to receive NRG common stock after the completion of the performance period, typically three years of service from the date of grant. The number of shares of NRG common stock to be paid (if any) as of the vesting date for each MSU will depend on the TSR. The number of shares of common stock to be paid as of the vesting date for each MSU is equal to: (i) three quarters of one share of common stock if the TSR has decreased by no more than 25% over the performance period; (ii) one share of common stock, if there is no change in TSR over the performance period; and (iii) two shares of common stock if the TSR increases 100% or more over the performance period.  If there is more than a 25% reduction in TSR over the performance period, no common stock will be paid. If the TSR is between 75% and 100% over the performance period,  shares awarded are interpolated.  The value of the common stock on the date of grant is based on the closing price of NRG common stock on the date of grant.

The following table summarizes the Company's non-vested MSU awards and changes during the year:

The weighted average grant date fair value of MSUs granted during the years endedDecember 31, 2016,2015and2014, was$14.73,$26.68and$31.90, respectively.

The fair value of MSUs is estimated on the date of grant using a Monte Carlo simulation model and expensed over the service period, which equals the vesting period.  Significant assumptions used in the fair value model with respect to the Company's MSUs are summarized below:

Lignite Contract with Texas Westmoreland Coal Co.

The Company's Limestone facility utilizes a blend of coal including lignite obtained from the Jewett mine, a surface mine adjacent to the Limestone facility, under a long-term contract with Texas Westmoreland Coal Co., or TWCC.  The contract is a cost-plus arrangement with certain performance incentives and penalties.  On August 18, 2016, NRG gave notice to TWCC terminating the active mining of lignite under the contract, effective on December 31, 2016.

Under the contract, TWCC continues to be responsible for reclamation activities. NRG is responsible for reclamation costs and has recorded an adequate ARO liability. The Railroad Commission of Texas has imposed a bond obligation of$95.5 millionon TWCC for the reclamation of the mine.  Pursuant to the contract with TWCC, NRG supports this obligation through surety bonds.  Additionally, NRG is obligated to provide additional performance assurance if required by the Railroad Commission of Texas.

First Lien Structure

NRG has granted first liens to certain counterparties on a substantial portion of the Company's assets, excluding assets acquired in the GenOn and EME (including Midwest Generation) acquisitions, assets held by NRG Yield, Inc. and NRG's assets that have project-level financing, to reduce the amount of cash collateral and letters of credit that it would otherwise be required to post from time to time to support its obligations under out-of-the-money hedge agreements for forward sales of power or MWh equivalents.  The Company's lien counterparties may have a claim on NRG's assets to the extent market prices exceed the hedged price.  As ofDecember 31, 2016, hedges under the first lien wereout-of-the-moneyfor NRG on a counterparty aggregate basis.

Nuclear Insurance

STP maintains required insurance coverage for liability claims arising from nuclear incidents pursuant to the Price-Anderson Act.  Effective January 1, 2017, the current liability limit per incident is

$13.44 billion

, subject to change to account for the effects of inflation and the number of licensed reactors.  An inflation adjustment must be made at least once every five years with the next due no later than September 10, 2018.   Under the Price-Anderson Act, owners of nuclear power plants in the U.S. are required to purchase primary insurance limits of

$450 million

for each operating site.  In addition, the Price-Anderson Act requires an additional layer of protection through mandatory participation in a retrospective rating plan for power reactors resulting in an additional

$13 billion

in funds available for public liability claims.  The current maximum assessment per incident, per reactor, is approximately

$127 million

, taking into account a

5%

adjustment for administrative fees, payable at approximately

$19 million

per year, per reactor.  NRG would be responsible for

44%

of the maximum assessment, or

$8 million

per year, per reactor, and a maximum of

$112 million

per incident.  In addition, the U.S. Congress retains the ability to impose additional financial requirements on the nuclear industry to pay liability claims that exceed

$13 billion

for a single incident.  The liabilities of the co-owners of STP with respect to the retrospective premium assessments for nuclear liability insurance are joint and several.










STP purchases insurance for property damage and site decontamination cleanup costs from Nuclear Electric Insurance Limited, or NEIL, an industry mutual insurance company, of which STP is a member.  STP has purchased

$2.75 billion

in limits for nuclear events and

$1.5 billion

in limits for non-nuclear events, the maximum available from NEIL.  The upper

$1.25 billion

in limits (excess of the first

$1.5 billion

in limits) is a single limit blanket policy shared with two Diablo Canyon nuclear reactors, which have no affiliation with the Company.  This shared limit is not subject to automatic reinstatement in the event of a loss.  The NEIL policy covers both nuclear and non-nuclear property damage events, and a NEIL companion policy provides Accidental Outage coverage for the co-owners of STP's lost revenue following a property damage event, at a weekly indemnity limit of

$2.52 million

per unit up to a maximum of

$274.4 million

nuclear and

$183.5 million

non-nuclear, and is subject to an eight-week waiting period.  NRG also purchases an Accidental Outage policy from NEIL, which provides protection for lost revenue due to an insurable event.  This coverage allows for reimbursement up to

$1.98 million

per week per unit up to a maximum of

$215.6 million

nuclear and

$144 million

non-nuclear, and is subject to an eight-week waiting period.  Under the terms of the NEIL policies, member companies may be assessed up to

ten

times their annual premium if the NEIL Board of Directors determines their surplus has been depleted due to the payment of property losses at any of the licensed reactors in a single policy year.  NEIL requires that its members maintain an investment grade credit rating or insure their annual retrospective obligation by providing a financial guarantee, letter of credit, deposit premium, or an insurance policy.  NRG has purchased an insurance policy from NEIL to guarantee the Company's obligation; however this insurance will only respond to retrospective premium adjustments assessed within

twenty-four

months after the policy term, whereas NEIL's Board of Directors can make such an adjustment up to


years after the policy expires.

Ivanpah Energy Production Guarantee



The Company's PPAs with PG&E with respect to the Ivanpah plant contain provisions for contract quantity and guaranteed energy production, which require that Ivanpah units 1 and 3 deliver to PG&E no less than the guaranteed energy production amount specified in the PPAs in any period of twenty-four consecutive months, or performance measurement period, during the term of the PPAs. In January 2017, the Company and PG&E executed amendments to the PPAs that provide, among other things, the ability to cure any failure to meet the guaranteed energy production amounts through performance and liquidated damage provisions. On February 2, 2017, PG&E filed a request with the CPUC to approve the amendments.  Pending final and nonappealable CPUC approval, PG&E agreed to refrain from declaring any event of default with respect to any failure to deliver the guaranteed energy production amounts.

Contingencies

The Company's material legal proceedings are described below.  The Company believes that it has valid defenses to these legal proceedings and intends to defend them vigorously.  NRG records reserves for estimated losses from contingencies when information available indicates that a loss is probable and the amount of the loss, or range of loss, can be reasonably estimated.  As applicable, the Company has established an adequate reserve for the matters discussed below. In addition, legal costs are expensed as incurred.  Management has assessed each of the following matters based on current information and made a judgment concerning its potential outcome, considering the nature of the claim, the amount and nature of damages sought, and the probability of success.  Unless specified below, the Company is unable to predict the outcome of these legal proceedings or reasonably estimate the scope or amount of any associated costs and potential liabilities.  As additional information becomes available, management adjusts its assessment and estimates of such contingencies accordingly.  Because litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties and unfavorable rulings or developments, it is possible that the ultimate resolution of the Company's liabilities and contingencies could be at amounts that are different from its currently recorded reserves and that such difference could be material.

In addition to the legal proceedings noted below, NRG and its subsidiaries are party to other litigation or legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business.  In management's opinion, the disposition of these ordinary course matters will not materially adversely affect NRG's consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.

Midwest Generation Asbestos Liabilities— The Company, through its subsidiary, Midwest Generation, may be subject to potential asbestos liabilities as a result of its acquisition of EME.  The Company is currently analyzing the scope of potential liability as it may relate to Midwest Generation. The Company believes that it has established an adequate reserve for these cases.










Actions Pursued by MC Asset Recovery



Natural Gas Litigation



—



In September 2012, the State of Nevada Supreme Court, which was handling the remaining case, affirmed dismissal by the Eighth Judicial District Court for Clark County, Nevada of all plaintiffs' claims against GenOn.  In February 2013, the plaintiffs in the Nevada case filed a petition for a writ of certiorari to the U.S. Supreme Court.  In June 2013, the Supreme Court denied the petition for a writ of certiorari, thereby ending one of the five lawsuits.

Energy Plus Holdings—On August 7, 2012, Energy Plus Holdings received a subpoena from the NYAG which generally sought information and business records related to Energy Plus Holdings' sales, marketing and business practices.  Energy Plus Holdings provided documents and information to the NYAG.  On June 22, 2015, the NYAG issued another subpoena seeking additional information. Energy Plus Holdings provided responsive documents to this second subpoena. The Company does not expect the resolution of this matter to have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial position, results of operation, or cash flows.

Maryland Department of the Environment v. GenOn Chalk Point and GenOn Mid-Atlantic— On January 25, 2013, Food & Water Watch, the Patuxent Riverkeeper and the Potomac Riverkeeper (together, the Citizens Group) sent GenOn Mid-Atlantic a letter alleging that the Chalk Point, Dickerson and Morgantown generating facilities were violating the terms of the three National Pollution Discharge Elimination System permits by discharging nitrogen and phosphorous in excess of the limits in each permit.  On March 21, 2013, the MDE sent GenOn Mid-Atlantic a similar letter with respect to the Chalk Point and Dickerson generating facilities, threatening to sue within 60 days if the generating facilities were not brought into compliance.  On June 11, 2013, the Maryland Attorney General on behalf of the MDE filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland alleging violations of the CWA and Maryland environmental laws related to water.

In August 2016, the court approved a consent decree to settle the matter. The consent decree requires: (1) improving the wastewater treatment systems at the Chalk Point and Dickerson facilities which was completed in October 2016; (2) completing supplemental environmental projects worth$1 million; and (3) paying a civil penalty of$1 million. The Company has improved the wastewater treatment systems at the Chalk Point and Dickerson facilities and paid the civil penalty of$1 million.










Midwest Generation New Source Review Litigation



— In August 2009, the EPA and the Illinois Attorney General, or the Government Plaintiffs, filed a complaint, or the Governments’ Complaint, in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois alleging violations of CAA PSD requirements by Midwest Generation arising from maintenance, repair or replacement projects at six Illinois coal-fired electric generating stations performed by Midwest Generation or ComEd, a prior owner of the stations, including alleged failures to obtain PSD construction permits and to comply with BACT requirements.   The Government Plaintiffs also alleged violations of opacity and PM standards at the Midwest Generation plants.  Finally, the Government Plaintiffs alleged that Midwest Generation violated certain operating permit requirements under Title V of the CAA allegedly arising from such claimed PSD, opacity and PM emission violations.  In addition to seeking penalties of up to

$37,500

per violation, per day, the complaint seeks an injunction ordering Midwest Generation to install controls sufficient to meet BACT emission rates at the units subject to the complaint and other remedies, which could go well beyond the requirements of the CPS.  Several environmental groups intervened as plaintiffs in this litigation and filed a complaint, or the Intervenors’ Complaint, which alleged opacity, PM and related Title V violations.  Midwest Generation filed a motion to dismiss nine of the ten PSD counts in the Governments’ Complaint, and to dismiss the tenth PSD count to the extent the Governments’ Complaint sought civil penalties for that count.  The trial court granted the motion in March 2010.

Following the trial court ruling, the Government Plaintiffs appealed the trial court’s dismissals of their PSD claims, including the dismissal of nine of the ten PSD claims against Midwest Generation and of the PSD claims against the other defendants.  Those PSD claim dismissals were affirmed by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit in July 2013.  In addition, in 2012, all but one of the environmental groups that had intervened in the case dismissed their claims without prejudice.  As a result, only one environmental group remains a plaintiff intervenor in the case.  The Company does not expect the resolution of this matter to have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

Potomac River Environmental Investigation— In March 2013, NRG Potomac River LLC received notice that the District of Columbia Department of Environment (now renamed the Department of Energy and Environment, or DOEE) was investigating potential discharges to the Potomac River originating from the Potomac River Generating facility site, a site where the generation facility is no longer in operation. In connection with that investigation, DOEE served a civil subpoena on NRG Potomac River LLC requesting information related to the site and potential discharges occurring from the site.  NRG Potomac River LLC provided various responsive materials.  In January 2016, DOEE advised NRG Potomac River LLC that DOEE believed various environmental violations had occurred as a result of discharges DOEE believes occurred to the Potomac River from the Potomac River Generating facility site and as a result of associated failures to accurately or sufficiently report such discharges.  DOEE has indicated it believes that penalties are appropriate in light of the violations.  NRG is currently reviewing the information provided by DOEE.

Telephone Consumer Protection Act Purported Class Actions—Three purported class action lawsuits have been filed against NRG Residential Solar Solutions, LLC — one in California and two in New Jersey.  The plaintiffs generally allege misrepresentation by the call agents and violations of the TCPA, claiming that the defendants engaged in a telemarketing campaign placing unsolicited calls to individuals on the “Do Not Call List.” The plaintiffs seek statutory damages of up to$1,500per plaintiff, actual damages and equitable relief. On July 8, 2016, NRG filed a Rule 11 Motion seeking dismissal of NRG from the California case. The Rule 11 Motion was denied on August 16, 2016. Class certification hearings are scheduled on June 5, 2017 and June 19, 2017 in the New Jersey and California cases respectively.










California Department of Water Resources and San Diego Gas & Electric Company v. Sunrise Power Company LLC

— On January 29, 2016, CDWR and SDG&E filed a lawsuit against Sunrise Power Company, along with NRG and Chevron Power Corporation.  In June 2001, CDWR and Sunrise entered into a 10-year PPA under which Sunrise would construct and operate a generating facility and provide power to CDWR.  At the time the PPA was entered into, Sunrise had a transportation services agreement, or TSA, to purchase natural gas from Kern River through April 30, 2018.  In August 2003, CDWR entered into an agreement with Sunrise and Kern River in which CDWR accepted assignment of the TSA through the term of the PPA.  After the PPA expired, Kern River demanded that any reassignment be to a party which met certain creditworthiness standards which Sunrise did not.  As such, the plaintiffs have brought this lawsuit against the defendants alleging breach of contract, breach of covenant of good faith and fair dealing and improper distributions.  Plaintiffs generally claim damages of

$1.2 million

per month for the remaining


months of the TSA.  On April 20, 2016, the defendants filed demurrers in response to the plaintiffs' complaint.  The demurrers were granted on June 14, 2016; however, the plaintiffs were allowed to file amended complaints on July 1, 2016. On July 27, 2016, defendants filed demurrers to the amended complaints. On November 18, 2016, the court sustained the demurrers and allowed plaintiffs another opportunity to file a second amended lawsuit which they did on January 13, 2017.



Braun v. NRG Yield, Inc.— On April 19, 2016, plaintiffs filed a putative class action lawsuit against NRG Yield, Inc., the current and former members of its board of directors individually, and other parties in California Superior Court in Kern County, CA.  Plaintiffs allege various violations of the Securities Act due to the defendants’ alleged failure to disclose material facts related to low wind production prior to the NRG Yield, Inc.'s June 22, 2015 Class C common stock offering.  Plaintiffs seek compensatory damages, rescission, attorney’s fees and costs.  On August 3, 2016, the court approved a stipulation entered into by the parties.  The stipulation provided that the plaintiffs would file an amended complaint by August 19, 2016, which they did on August 18, 2016.  The Defendants filed demurrers and a motion challenging jurisdiction on October 18, 2016. On February 24, 2017, the court approved the parties' stipulation which provides the plaintiffs' opposition is due on June 15, 2017 and defendants' reply is due on August 14, 2017.



Ahmed v. NRG Energy, Inc. and the NRG Yield Board of Directors— On September 15, 2016, plaintiffs filed a putative class action lawsuit against NRG Energy, Inc., the directors of NRG Yield, Inc., and other parties in the Delaware Chancery Court.  The complaint alleges that the defendants breached their respective fiduciary duties with regard to the recapitalization of NRG Yield, Inc. common stock in 2015.  The plaintiffs generally seek economic damages, attorney’s fees and injunctive relief.  The defendants filed a motion to dismiss the lawsuit on December 21, 2016. Plaintiffs filed their objection to the motion to dismiss on February 15, 2017. Oral argument is scheduled for June 20, 2017.



GenOn Noteholders' Lawsuit—On December 13, 2016, certain indenture trustees for an ad hoc group of holders, or the Noteholders, of the GenOn Energy, Inc.7.875%Senior Notes due 2017,9.500%Notes due 2018, and9.875%Notes due 2020, and the GenOn Americas Generation, LLC8.50%Senior Notes due 2021 and9.125%Senior Notes due 2031, or collectively, the GenOn Notes, along with certain of the Noteholders, filed a complaint in the Superior Court of the State of Delaware against NRG and GenOn alleging certain claims related to a services agreement between NRG and GenOn. Plaintiffs generally seek recovery of all monies paid under the services agreement and any other damages that the court deems appropriate. On February 3, 2017, the court entered an order approving a Standstill Agreement whereby the parties agreed to suspend all deadlines in the case until March 1, 2017.  This agreement may be extended by mutual agreement of the parties.





Note 23—Regulatory Matters

NRG operates in a highly regulated industry and is subject to regulation by various federal and state agencies.  As such, NRG is affected by regulatory developments at both the federal and state levels and in the regions in which NRG operates.  In addition, NRG is subject to the market rules, procedures, and protocols of the various ISO and RTO markets in which NRG participates.  These power markets are subject to ongoing legislative and regulatory changes that may impact NRG's wholesale and retail businesses.

In addition to the regulatory proceedings noted below, NRG and its subsidiaries are parties to other regulatory proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business or have other regulatory exposure.  In management's opinion, the disposition of these ordinary course matters will not materially adversely affect NRG's consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.










National

Zero-Emission Credits for Nuclear Plants—Pursuant to legislation in Illinois,the Illinois Power Agency, or IPA, is to procure contracts for ZECs.  The IPA is to procure ZECs through a process that would take into account environmental benefits, including the preservation of zero emission facilities.  In New York, on August 1, 2016, the NYSPSC issued its Clean Energy Standard, or CES, which provided for ZECs which would provide more than$7.6 billionover12 yearsin out-of-market subsidy payments to certain selected nuclear generating units in the state.  Other states located in organized markets may also be considering the implementation of ZECs.  These ZECs are out-of-market subsidies that threaten to artificially suppress market prices and interferer with the wholesale power market.



Current Administration and Changeover at FERC— FERC is currently without a quorum and cannot issue orders in contested proceedings until a new Commissioner is appointed.  FERC’s day-to-day work can continue through authority that has been delegated to FERC Staff.  With a new administration and three vacant positions at FERC, NRG’s business may be affected because its generation fleet is subject to changes in FERC regulatory policy.



East Region

Montgomery County Station Power Tax—On December 20, 2013, NRG received a letter from Montgomery County, Maryland requesting payment of an energy tax for the consumption of station power at the Dickerson Facility over the previous three years.  Montgomery County seeks payment in the amount of$22 million, which includes tax, interest and penalties.  NRG disputed the applicability of the tax.  On December 11, 2015, the Maryland Tax Court reversed Montgomery County's assessment.  Montgomery County filed an appeal, and on February 2, 2017, the Montgomery County Circuit Court affirmed the decision of the tax court. On February 17, 2017, Montgomery County filed an appeal to the Court of Special Appeals of Maryland.

Retail

MISO SECA— Green Mountain Energy previously provided competitive retail energy supply in the MISO region during the period of January 1, 2002, to December 31, 2005.  By order dated November 18, 2004, FERC eliminated certain regional through-and-out transmission rates charged by transmission owners in MISO and PJM.  In order to temporarily compensate the transmission owners for lost revenues, FERC ordered MISO, PJM and their respective transmission owners to eliminate seams charges and in the meantime, as a temporary measure, allowed them to recover transition charges known as SECA charges.  The tariff amendments filed by MISO and the MISO transmission owners allocated certain SECA charges to various zones and sub-zones within MISO, including a sub-zone called the Green Mountain Energy Company Sub-zone.  During several years of extensive litigation before FERC, several transmission owners sought to recover SECA charges from Green Mountain Energy.  Green Mountain Energy denied responsibility for any SECA charges and did not pay any asserted SECA charges.

On May 21, 2010, FERC issuedtwoorders, including its Order on Initial Decision, in which FERC determined that approximately$22 millionplus interest of SECA charges were owed not by Green Mountain Energy but rather by BP Energy — one of Green Mountain Energy's suppliers during the period at issue.  On August 19, 2010, the transmission owners and MISO made compliance filings in accordance with FERC's Orders allocating SECA charges to a BP Energy Sub-zone, and making no allocation to a Green Mountain Energy Sub-zone.  On September 16, 2015, FERC issued an order conditionally accepting those compliance filings, and setting for hearing and settlement proceedings issues related to service to certain Michigan customers during 2002 and 2003.

On September 30, 2011, FERC issued orders denying all requests for rehearing and again determined that SECA charges were not owed by Green Mountain Energy.  Numerous parties, including BP Energy, sought judicial review of FERC's orders, and Green Mountain Energy was granted intervenor status in the consolidated appeals.  Most appellants subsequently settled with the transmission owners and withdrew their appeals, including BP Energy, which agreed to pay approximately$24 millionto thethreetransmission owners signing the agreement, with another$1 millionoffered to the remaining PJM transmission owners, should they choose to join the settlement; all chose to do so.  FERC approved the settlement, and BP Energy moved to dismiss its appeals; its motions to dismiss were granted by the Court. Subsequently, all remaining appeals either settled or were rejected by the Court.

West Region

Carlsbad Energy Center— On May 21, 2015, the CPUC approved the Carlsbad Energy Center PPTA for a nominally rated500MW five unit natural gas peaking plant. On December 7, 2015, three parties filed two petitions for a writ of review with the California Court of Appeal appealing the CPUC's decision. On November 30, 2016, the California Court of Appeals issued a decision affirming the CPUC's approval of the PPTA.  The period in which to seek review of that decision in the California Supreme Court has passed, and the CPUC’s decision is now final.










California Station Power—As the result of unfavorable final and non-appealable litigation, the Company has accrued a liability associated with its power plants’ consumption of station power in California, after August 30, 2010.  The majority of the liability is associated with the Company's Encina, El Segundo, and Long Beach facilities.  The Company has established an appropriate reserve and is awaiting final billing decisions from SCE.





Note 24—Environmental Matters

NRG is subject to a wide range of environmental laws in the development, construction, ownership and operation of projects. These laws generally require that governmental permits and approvals be obtained before construction and during operation of power plants. NRG is also subject to laws regarding the protection of wildlife, including migratory birds, eagles and threatened and endangered species. The electric generation industry is facing new requirements regarding GHGs, combustion byproducts, water discharge and use, and threatened and endangered species have been put in place in recent years. In general, future laws are expected to require the addition of emissions controls or other environmental controls or to impose certain restrictions on the operations of the Company's facilities, which could have a material effect on the Company's consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. Federal and state environmental laws generally have become more stringent over time, although this trend could change in the near term with respect to federal laws under the new U.S. presidential administration.

In February 2012, the EPA promulgated standards (the MATS rule) to control emissions of HAPs from coal and oil-fired electric generating units. The rule established limits for mercury, non-mercury metals, certain organics and acid gases, which had to be met beginning in April 2015 (with some units getting a 1-year extension). In June 2015, the U.S. Supreme Court issued a decision in the case of Michigan v. EPA, and held that the EPA unreasonably refused to consider costs when it determined that it was "appropriate and necessary" to regulate HAPs emitted by electric generating units. The U.S. Supreme Court did not vacate the MATS rule but rather remanded it to the D.C. Circuit for further proceedings. In December 2015, the D.C. Circuit remanded the MATS rule to the EPA without vacatur. On April 25, 2016, the EPA released a supplemental finding that the benefits of this regulation outweigh the costs to address the U.S. Supreme Court's ruling that the EPA had not properly considered costs. This finding has been challenged in the D.C. Circuit. While NRG cannot predict the final outcome of this rulemaking, NRG believes that because it has already invested in pollution controls and cleaner technologies, the fleet is well-positioned to comply with the MATS rule.

Water

In August 2014, the EPA finalized the regulation regarding the use of water for once through cooling at existing facilities to address impingement and entrainment concerns. NRG anticipates that more stringent requirements will be incorporated into some of its water discharge permits over the next several years as NPDES permits are renewed.

Byproducts, Wastes, Hazardous Materials and Contamination

In April 2015, the EPA finalized the rule regulating byproducts of coal combustion (e.g., ash and gypsum) as solid wastes under the RCRA. The Company has evaluated the impact of the new rule on the Company's consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows and has accrued its environmental and asset retirement obligations under the rule based on current estimates as of December 31, 2016.










East Region

New Source Review—The EPA and various states are investigating compliance of electric generating facilities with the pre-construction permitting requirements of the CAA known as “new source review,” or NSR.  In 2007, Midwest Generation received an NOV from the EPA alleging that past work at Crawford, Fisk, Joliet, Powerton, Waukegan and Will County generating stations violated NSR and other regulations.  These alleged violations are the subject of the litigation described in Item 15 — Note 22,Commitments and Contingencies.In January 2009, GenOn received an NOV from the EPA alleging that past work at Keystone, Portland and Shawville generating stations violated regulations regarding NSR.  In June 2011, GenOn received an NOV from the EPA alleging that past work at Avon Lake and Niles generating stations violated NSR.  In December 2007, the NJDEP filed suit alleging that NSR violations occurred at the Portland generating station, which suit was resolved pursuant to a July 2013 consent decree.  Additionally, in April 2013, the Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection issued four NOVs alleging that past work at oil-fired combustion turbines at the Torrington Terminal, Franklin, Branford and Middletown generation stations violated regulations regarding NSR.

Burton Island Old Ash Landfill— In January 2006, NRG's Indian River Power LLC was notified that it may be a potentially responsible party with respect to Burton Island Old Ash Landfill, a historic captive landfill located at the Indian River facility.  On October 1, 2007, NRG signed an agreement with DNREC to investigate the site through the Voluntary Clean-up Program, or the VCP.  On February 4, 2008, DNREC issued findings that no further action was required in relation to surface water and that a previously planned shoreline stabilization project would satisfactorily address shoreline erosion.  The landfill itself required a Remedial Investigation and Feasibility Study to determine the type and scope of any additional required work.  DNREC approved the Feasibility Study in December 2012.  In January 2013, DNREC proposed a remediation plan based on the Feasibility Study.  The remediation plan was approved in October 2013.  In December 2015, DNREC approved the Company's remediation design and the Company's Long Term Stewardship Plan. The cost of completing the work required by the approved remediation plan is consistent with amounts budgeted in early 2016 and on track for completion in 2017.  The estimated cost to comply with the Long-Term Stewardship Plan was added to the liability in December 2016.

In addition to the VCP, on May 29, 2008, DNREC requested that NRG's Indian River Power LLC participate in the development and performance of a Natural Resource Damage Assessment at the Burton Island Old Ash Landfill.  NRG is currently working with DNREC and other trustees to close out the assessment process.

For further discussion of these matters, refer toNote 22,Commitments and Contingencies.

Note 26—Guarantees

NRG and its subsidiaries enter into various contracts that include indemnification and guarantee provisions as a routine part of the Company's business activities. Examples of these contracts include asset purchases and sale agreements, commodity sale and purchase agreements, retail contracts, joint venture agreements, EPC agreements, operation and maintenance agreements, service agreements, settlement agreements, and other types of contractual agreements with vendors and other third parties, as well as affiliates.  These contracts generally indemnify the counterparty for tax, environmental liability, litigation and other matters, as well as breaches of representations, warranties and covenants set forth in these agreements. The Company is obligated with respect to customer deposits associated with the Company's retail businesses.  NRG has also assumed guarantees for some non-qualified benefits of existing retirees resulting from the acquisition of GenOn.  In some cases, NRG's maximum potential liability cannot be estimated, since the underlying agreements contain no limits on potential liability.

In accordance with ASC 460,Guarantees, or ASC 460, NRG has estimated that the current fair value for issuing these guarantees was$2.2 millionas ofDecember 31, 2016and the liability in this amount is included in the Company's non-current liabilities.

The following table summarizes the maximum potential exposures that can be estimated for NRG's guarantees, indemnities, and other contingent liabilities by maturity:

By Remaining Maturity at December 31,2016GuaranteesUnder1 Year1-3 Years3-5 YearsOver5 YearsTotal2015 Total(In millions)Letters of credit and surety bonds$2,122$80$—$15$2,217$1,899Asset sales guarantee obligations—420—257677257Other guarantees——5731736722Total guarantees$2,122$500$5$1,003$3,630$2,878

Letters of credit and surety bonds— As ofDecember 31, 2016, NRG and its consolidated subsidiaries were contingently obligated for a total of$2.2 billionunder letters of credit and surety bonds.  Most of these letters of credit and surety bonds are issued in support of the Company's obligations to perform under commodity agreements and obligations associated with future closure and maintenance of ash sites, as well as for financing or other arrangements.  A majority of these letters of credit and surety bonds expire withinoneyear of issuance, and it is typical for the Company to renew them on similar terms.

The material indemnities, within the scope of ASC 460, are as follows:

Asset sales— The purchase and sale agreements which govern NRG's asset or share investments and divestitures customarily contain guarantees and indemnifications of the transaction to third parties.  The contracts indemnify the parties for liabilities incurred as a result of a breach of a representation or warranty by the indemnifying party, or as a result of a change in tax laws.  These obligations generally have a discrete term and are intended to protect the parties against risks that are difficult to predict or estimate at the time of the transaction.  In several cases, the contract limits the liability of the indemnifier. NRG has no reason to believe that the Company currently has any material liability relating to such routine indemnification obligations.

Other guarantees— NRG has issued other guarantees of obligations including payments under certain agreements with respect to certain of its unconsolidated subsidiaries, payment or performance by fuel providers and payment or reimbursement of credit support and deposits. The Company does not believe that it will be required to perform under these guarantees.

Other indemnities— Other indemnifications NRG has provided cover operational, tax, litigation and breaches of representations, warranties and covenants.  NRG has also indemnified, on a routine basis in the ordinary course of business, consultants or other vendors who have provided services to the Company.  NRG's maximum potential exposure under these indemnifications can range from a specified dollar amount to an indeterminate amount, depending on the nature of the transaction.  Total maximum potential exposure under these indemnifications is not estimable due to uncertainty as to whether claims will be made or how they will be resolved.  NRG does not have any reason to believe that the Company will be required to make any material payments under these indemnity provisions.

Because many of the guarantees and indemnities NRG issues to third parties and affiliates do not limit the amount or duration of its obligations to perform under them, there exists a risk that the Company may have obligations in excess of the amounts described above.  For those guarantees and indemnities that do not limit the Company's liability exposure, it may not be able to estimate what the Company's liability would be, until a claim is made for payment or performance, due to the contingent nature of these contracts.












Note 27—Jointly Owned Plants

Certain NRG subsidiaries own undivided interests in jointly-owned plants, as described below.  These plants are maintained and operated pursuant to their joint ownership participation and operating agreements.  NRG is responsible for its subsidiaries' share of operating costs and direct expenses and includes its proportionate share of the facilities and related revenues and direct expenses in these jointly-owned plants in the corresponding balance sheet and income statement captions of the Company's consolidated financial statements.

The following table summarizes NRG's proportionate ownership interest in the Company's jointly-owned facilities:
