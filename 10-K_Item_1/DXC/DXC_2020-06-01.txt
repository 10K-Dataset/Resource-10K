See Note19- "Segment and Geographic Information" for additional information related to our reportable segments, including the disclosure of segment revenues, segment profit and financial information by geographic area.



Sales and Marketing



We market and sell our services to customers through our direct sales force, operating out of sales offices around the world. Our customers include commercial businesses of many sizes and in many industries and public sector enterprises. No individual customer exceeded 10% of our consolidated revenues for fiscal 2020, 2019 or 2018.



Seasonality



General economic conditions have an impact on our business and financial results. The markets in which we sell our products, services and solutions occasionally experience weak economic conditions that may negatively affect sales. We also experience some seasonal trends in the sale of our services. For example, contract awards are often tied to the timing of our customers' fiscal year-ends, and we also experience seasonality related to our own fiscal year-end selling activities.





Competition



The IT and professional services markets in which we compete are highly competitive and are not dominated by a single company or a small number of companies. A substantial number of companies offer services that overlap and are competitive with those we offer. In addition, the increased importance of offshore labor centers has brought several foreign-based firms into competition with us.



Our competitors include:



•large multinational enterprises that offer some or all of the services and solutions that we do;

•smaller companies that offer focused services and solutions similar to those that we offer;

•offshore service providers in lower-cost locations, particularly in India, that sell directly to end-users;

•solution or service providers that compete with us in a specific industry segment or service area; and

•in-house functions of corporations that use their own resources, rather than engage an outside IT services provider.










The principal methods of competition in the markets for our solutions and services include:



•vision and strategic advisory ability;

•digital services capabilities;

•performance and reliability;

•responsiveness to client needs;

•competitive pricing of services;

•technical and industry expertise;

•reputation and experience;

•quality of solutions and services; and

•financial stability and strong corporate governance.



Our ability to obtain new business and retain existing business is dependent upon the following:



•technology, industry and systems know-how with an independent perspective on the best client solutions across software, hardware, and service providers;

•ability to offer improved strategic frameworks and technical solutions;

•investments in our digital services and solutions;

•focus on responsiveness to customer needs, quality of services and competitive prices;

•successful management of our relationships with leading strategic and solution partners in hardware, networking, cloud, applications and software;

•project management experience and capabilities;

•end-to-end spectrum of IT and professional services we provide; and

•financial stability and strong corporate governance.












Intellectual Property



We rely on a combination of trade secrets, patents, copyrights, and trademarks, as well as contractual protections, to protect our business interests. While our technical services and products are not generally dependent upon patent protection, we do selectively seek patent protection for certain inventions likely to be incorporated into products and services or where obtaining such proprietary rights will improve our competitive position.



As our patent portfolio has been built over time, the remaining terms of the individual patents across the patent portfolio vary. We believe that our patents and patent applications are important for maintaining the competitive differentiation of our solutions and services and enhancing our freedom of action to sell solutions and services in markets in which we choose to participate. No single patent is in itself essential to our company as a whole or to any business segment.



Additionally, we own or have rights to various trademarks, logos, service marks, and trade names that are used in the operation of our business. We also own or have the rights to copyrights that protect the content of our products and other proprietary materials.



In addition to developing our intellectual property portfolio, we license intellectual property rights from third parties as we deem appropriate. We have also granted and plan to continue to grant licenses to others under our intellectual property rights when we consider these arrangements to be in our interest. These license arrangements include a number of cross-licenses with third parties.





Environmental Regulation



Our operations are subject to regulation under various federal, state, local, and foreign laws concerning the environment, including laws addressing the discharge of pollutants into the air and water, the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes and the clean-up of contaminated sites. Environmental costs and accruals are presently not material to our operations, cash flows or financial position, and we do not currently anticipate material capital expenditures for environmental control facilities. However, we could incur substantial costs, including clean-up costs, fines and civil or criminal sanctions and third-party damage or personal injury claims, if we were to violate or become liable under environmental laws, or if new environmental legislation is passed which impacts our business.





Employees



As ofMarch 31, 2020, we employed approximately138,000employees and had offices and operations in approximately70countries.
