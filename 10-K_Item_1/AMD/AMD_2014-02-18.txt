Our Industry

Semiconductors are components used in a variety of electronic products and systems. An integrated circuit, or IC, is a semiconductor device that consists of many interconnected transistors on a single
chip. Since the invention of the transistor in 1948, improvements in IC process and design technologies have led to the development of smaller, more complex and more reliable ICs at a lower cost per function.

Computing Solutions

The x86
Microprocessor Market

Central Processing Unit (CPU)

A microprocessor is an IC that serves as the CPU of a computer. It generally consists of hundreds of millions of transistors that process
data and control other devices in the system, acting as the brain of the computer. The performance of a microprocessor is a critical factor impacting the performance of a computer and numerous other electronic systems. The principal elements used to
measure CPU performance are work-per-cycle (or how many instructions are executed per cycle), clock speed (representing the rate at which a CPU’s internal logic operates, measured in units of gigahertz, or billions of cycles per second) and
power consumption. Other factors impacting microprocessor performance include the number of cores in a microprocessor, the bit rating of the microprocessor, memory size and data access speed.

Developments in circuit design and manufacturing process technologies have resulted in significant advances in microprocessor
performance. Currently, microprocessors are designed to process 32 bits or 64 bits of information at one time. The bit rating of a microprocessor generally denotes the largest size of numerical data that a microprocessor can handle. Microprocessors
with 64-bit processing capabilities enable systems to have greater performance by allowing software applications and operating systems to access more memory.

Moreover, as businesses and consumers require greater performance from their computer systems due to the growth of digital data and increasingly sophisticated software applications, semiconductor
companies are designing and developing multi-core microprocessors, where multiple processor cores are placed on a single die or in a single processor. Multi-core microprocessors offer enhanced overall system performance and efficiency because
computing tasks can be spread across two or more processing cores each of which can execute a task at full speed. Multiple processor cores packaged together can increase performance of a computer system without greatly increasing the total amount of
power consumed and the total amount of heat emitted. This type of “symmetrical multiprocessing” is effective in multi-tasking environments where multiple cores can enable operating systems to prioritize and manage tasks from multiple
software applications simultaneously and also for “multi-threaded” software applications where multiple cores can process different parts of the software program, or “threads,” simultaneously thereby enhancing performance of the
application. Businesses and consumers also require computer systems with improved power management technology, which allows them to reduce the power consumption of their computer systems thereby reducing the total cost of ownership.







Accelerated Processing Unit (APU)

While general purpose computer architectures based on the x86 architecture are sufficient for many customers, we believe that an
architecture that optimizes the use of a CPU and GPU for a given workload can provide a substantial improvement in user experience, performance and energy efficiency. As the volume of digital media increases, we believe end users can benefit from an
accelerated computing architecture. An accelerated computing architecture enables “offloading” of selected tasks, thereby optimizing the use of multiple computational units such as the CPU and GPU, depending on the application or workload.
For example, serial workloads are better suited for CPUs, while highly parallel tasks may be better performed by a GPU. Our AMD APU combines our CPU and GPU onto a single piece of silicon. We believe that high performance computing workloads,
workloads that are visual in nature and even traditional applications such as photo and video editing or other multi-media applications can benefit from our accelerated computing architecture.

Microprocessor Products

We currently design, develop and sell microprocessor products for desktop PCs, notebooks, tablets, hybrids, servers and embedded products. Our microprocessors and chipsets are incorporated into computing
platforms that also include GPUs and core software to enable and advance the computing components. A platform is a collection of technologies that are designed to work together to provide a more complete computing solution. We believe that
integrated, balanced platforms consisting of microprocessors, chipsets and GPUs that work together at the system level bring end users improved system stability, increased performance and enhanced power efficiency. Furthermore, by combining all of
these elements onto a single piece of silicon as an APU or an SOC, we believe system performance and power efficiency is further improved. An SOC is a type of IC with a CPU, GPU and other components, such as a memory controller and peripheral
management, comprising a complete computing system on a single chip. In addition to the enhancements at the end-user level, we believe our customers also benefit from an all-AMD platform, as we are able to provide them with a single point of contact
for the key platform components and enable them to bring the platforms to market faster in a variety of client and server system form factors.

Our CPUs and APUs are currently manufactured primarily using 65 nanometer (nm), 45nm, 40nm, 32nm and 28nm process technologies. We currently base our microprocessors and chipsets on the x86 instruction
set architecture and AMD’s Direct Connect Architecture, which connects an on-chip memory controller and input/output, or I/O, channels directly to one or more microprocessor cores. We typically integrate two or more processor cores onto a
single die, and each core has its own dedicated cache, which is memory that is located on the semiconductor die, permitting quicker access to frequently used data and instructions. Some of our microprocessors have additional levels of cache such as
L2, or second-level cache, and L3, or third-level cache, to enable faster data access and higher performance.

Energy efficiency and power consumption continue to be key design principles for our products. We focus on continually improving power management technology, or “performance-per-watt.” To that
end, we offer CPUs, APUs and chipsets with features that we have designed to reduce system-level energy consumption, with multiple low power states which utilize lower clock speeds and voltages that reduce processor power consumption during both
active and idle times. We design our CPUs and APUs to be compatible with operating system software such as the
Microsoft®Windows®family of operating systems,
Linux®, NetWare®, Solaris and UNIX.

Our AMD family of APUs
represents a new approach to processor design and software development, delivering serial, parallel and visual compute capabilities for high definition (HD) video, 3D and data-intensive workloads in the APU. APUs combine high-performance serial and
parallel processing cores with other special-purpose hardware accelerators. We design our APUs for improved visual computing, security, performance-per-watt and smaller device form factors. Having the CPU and GPU on the same chip reduces the system
power and bill-of-materials, speeds the flow of data between the CPU and GPU through shared memory and allows the GPU to function as both a graphics engine and an application accelerator in highly efficient computing platforms.







Building on the integration of our CPU and GPU onto a single piece of silicon, we are
focused on evolving our accelerated computing architecture so that software programmers develop applications to more fully utilize the full serial and parallel compute capabilities of our APUs. Heterogeneous Systems Architecture (HSA) describes an
industry standard that is an overarching design for having combinations of CPU and GPU processor cores operate as a unified engine. We are a founding member of the HSA Foundation, a non-profit organization established to define and promote this open
standards-based approach to heterogeneous computing.

Desktop.Our APUs for desktop PC
platforms consist primarily of the AMD A-Series and AMD E-Series APUs. We also offer AMD FX CPUs for the enthusiast market. We designed the desktop AMD A-Series APU, codenamed “Trinity,” for mainstream desktop platforms, and it is
available primarily in quad- and dual-core versions with a variety of discrete-level graphics configurations. In June 2013, we announced the 2013 Elite A-Series APU, codenamed “Richland,” which offers improved performance and power
efficiency compared to prior AMD APUs. In January 2014, we began shipping the AMD A10-7850K and A10-7700K, codenamed “Kaveri,” for desktops. “Kaveri” is the world’s first APU to include HSA features, AMD TrueAudio
technology for improved fidelity and immersive audio, and performing gaming experience of AMD’s Mantle application programming interface, or API. Mantle allows game developers to more easily take advantage of the full capability of our graphic
core next architecture. The latest generation of AMD FX CPUs are based on the “Piledriver” x86 multi-core architecture, are designed for multitasking, high resolution gaming and HD media processing and come in eight-, six- and quad-core
versions.

Notebook, Tablet, Hybrid.Consumers continue to demand thinner and lighter
mobile platforms with better entertainment performance and longer battery life. In response to this demand, we continue to invest in designing and developing high performing and low power notebook platforms. Our notebook processors consist primarily
of performance AMD A-Series APUs, and AMD E-Series APUs. We designed the AMD A-Series APU, codenamed “Trinity,” for mainstream and ultrathin notebooks, and we designed our AMD E-Series APUs for mainstream notebooks. Our APUs for notebook
platforms combine discrete-level AMD Radeon™ graphics, dedicated HD video processing and multi-core CPU processors on a single die which are designed for maximum performance and power efficiency. In March 2013, we launched our next generation
2013 AMD Elite Performance A-Series APUs, codenamed “Richland,” designed to deliver innovative user experiences such as facial log-in and gesture recognition for premium ultrathin, traditional and performance notebooks. In May 2013, we
launched our next generation 2013 AMD Mainstream quad-core x86 SOC, codenamed “Kabini,” designed for entry-level and small-form factor touch notebooks, and the 2013 AMD Elite Mobility SOC, codenamed “Temash,” our first 28nm,
quad-core x86 SOC designed for small form-factor notebooks, tablets and hybrids 13 inches and below. We introduced the AMD Elite Quad-Core A4-1350 APU for tablets, hybrids and small-screen touch notebooks in September 2013.

Server.A server is a system that performs services for connected customers as part of a
client-server architecture. Servers are designed to run an application or applications often for extended periods of time with minimal human intervention. Examples of servers include web servers, e-mail servers and print servers. These
servers can run a variety of applications, including business intelligence, enterprise resource planning, customer relationship management and advanced scientific or engineering models to solve advanced computational problems in disciplines ranging
from financial modeling to weather forecasting to oil and gas exploration. Servers are also used in cloud computing, which is a computing model where data, applications and services are delivered over the internet or an intranet.

Our microprocessors for server platforms consist of our AMD Opteron™ 6000, 4000, 3000 CPU and X1150/X2150 APU series platform
processors. In addition, to offering microprocessors for servers, we offer dense server systems, designed to reduce power consumption and improve space efficiency for data centers. Our dense server products include the SeaMicro SM15000™ server,
as well as AMD’s SeaMicro Freedom™ Fabric Storage series of storage enclosures. Our fabric technology, the SeaMicro Freedom™ supercompute fabric, interconnects hundreds of card-sized motherboards and reduces the need for data
networking equipment and eliminates hundreds of cables, simplifying data center operations. We designed this fabric to reduce sever system







power consumption while providing lower latency and higher bandwidth interconnections. In May 2013, we launched our Opteron™ X Series processors, a new family of high density, low power
servers. Also in January 2014, we announced that we would sample AMD Opteron A-Series processor, codenamed “Seattle,” in the first quarter of 2014, our first 64-bit ARM-based server CPU using 28nm process technology.

Embedded Processor Products

Our embedded products address customer needs in PC-adjacent markets. Typically, our embedded products are used in applications that require high to moderate levels of performance, where key features
include low cost, mobility, low power and small form factor. High performance graphics are increasingly important in many embedded systems. Customers of our embedded products include vendors in industrial control and automation, digital signage,
point of sale/self-service kiosks, medical imaging, set-top box and casino gaming machines as well as enterprise class telecommunications, networking, security, storage systems and thin-clients, or computers that serve as an access device on a
network.

The embedded market has moved from developing proprietary, custom designs to leveraging the industry-standard x86
instruction set architecture as a way to reduce costs and speed time to market. Customer requirements for these systems include very low power for small enclosures and 24x7 operation, support for Linux, Windows and other operating systems and
high-performance for increasingly sophisticated applications. Other requirements include advanced specifications for industrial temperatures, shock, vibration and reliability.

Our embedded platforms include options from the AMD Embedded Geode™ LX family and AMD Opteron Processor family. In July 2013, we extended our embedded SOC product portfolio with the launch of a new
low power AMD G-Series SOC for fanless designs. A fanless design is one that, instead of using a fan for cooling, relies on other means, such as convection cooling, to transport heat away from certain components. In August 2013, we launched the AMD
Embedded R-Series high performance computing platform for high-end digital gaming and signage.

Chipset Market and Products

A chipset is the set of components that manages data flow between a processor or processors, memory and peripherals,
such as the keyboard, mouse, monitor, hard drive and CD or DVD drive. Chipsets perform essential logic functions, and balance the performance of the system and aid in removing bottlenecks. Chipsets often include graphics, audio, video and other
capabilities. All desktop PCs, notebooks and servers that are not powered by an SOC have a chipset. In many PCs, the chipset includes a GPU. A GPU within the chipset solution is commonly known as an integrated graphics processor (IGP), and such a
chipset may be called an IGP chipset. A discrete GPU is usually required in non-APU based systems that do not have an IGP. By not necessitating a discrete GPU, IGP chipsets can offer a lower cost solution and reduced power consumption and enable
smaller system form factors. With our APU architecture, the GPU is included in the APU. For systems that are not powered by an SOC, an AMD Controller Hub chip performs the input and output functions of the chipset. We believe that either the use of
an SOC or the combination of an APU and the AMD Controller Hub will eventually replace our market for IGP chipsets.

Our
portfolio of chipset products includes chipsets with and without IGPs for desktop PCs and servers, and AMD Controller Hub-based chipsets for our APUs. We offer AMD M880G and M780G chipsets for notebooks, and we offer AMD 9-Series, 8-Series,
7-Series Discrete and AMD 7-Series Integrated chipsets for desktop PCs. We also offer AMD 785E, SR5690, 780E and M690T chipsets for our embedded products.







Graphics and Visual Solutions

Graphics and Visual Solutions Market

A graphics and visual solution
can be in the form of an APU, GPU, IGP, SOC or a combination of a GPU with one of the other foregoing products working in tandem. The semiconductor graphics market addresses the need for visual or parallel processing in various computing and
entertainment platforms such as desktop PCs, notebooks, tablets and workstations.

APUs deliver visual and parallel processing
functionality for value and mainstream PCs, while discrete GPUs are specifically architected for higher performance graphics processing. A dedicated GPU and CPU (whether in an APU or as two separate pieces of silicon) work in tandem to increase
overall speed and performance of the system. Users of these graphics products value a rich visual experience to enable a more compelling and immersive experience. Moreover, for many consumers, the PC is evolving from a traditional data processing
and communications device to an entertainment platform. Visual realism and graphical display capabilities are key elements of product differentiation among various product platforms. This has led to the increasing creation and use of processing
intensive multimedia content for PCs and to manufacturers designing PCs for playing games, displaying photos and capturing TV and other multimedia content, viewing online videos, photo editing and managing digital content. In turn, the trend has
continued to contribute to the development of higher performance graphics solutions.

Heavy computational
workloads have traditionally been processed on a CPU, but we believe that the industry is shifting to a new computing paradigm that increasingly relies more on the GPU or a combination of GPU and CPU. AMD Accelerated Parallel Processing or GPGPU
(General Purpose GPU) refers to a set of advanced hardware and software technologies that enable AMD GPUs, working in concert with the computer system’s CPUs, to accelerate applications beyond traditional graphics and video processing by
allowing CPUs and GPUs to process information cooperatively. Heterogeneous computing, which refers to computer systems that use more than one kind of processor, enables PCs and servers to run computationally-intensive tasks more efficiently, which
we believe provides a superior application experience to the end user.

Graphics and Visual Solutions Products

Our customers generally use our graphics and visual solutions to increase the speed of rendering images and to improve image resolution
and color definition. We develop our products for use in desktop PCs, notebooks, tablets, professional workstations, servers and gaming consoles. In addition, our semi-custom products are tailored, high-performance customer-specific solutions based
on AMD’s CPU, GPU and APU technology. We work closely together with our customers to define solutions with a selectable level of GPU performance to precisely match the requirements of the device or application. Approaches range from
complex, full-custom SOCs to more modest adaptations and integrations of existing parts.

With each of
our graphics products, we have available drivers and supporting software packages that enable the effective use of these products under a variety of operating systems and applications. In addition, our recent generation graphics products have Linux®driver support.

Game Consoles.We have leveraged our core graphics and visual processing technologies developed for the PC market by providing graphic and visual solutions to
game console manufacturers. In this market,







semiconductor graphics suppliers work alongside game console manufacturers to enhance the visual experience for users of sophisticated video games. We leverage our core visual processing
technology into the game console market by licensing our graphic technology in game consoles such as the
Microsoft®Xbox 360™ and Nintendo Wii and Wii U. During the first quarter of 2013, Sony announced that it
would use a semi-custom APU based on our “Jaguar” central processing unit core and next-generation Radeon graphics in its Sony PlayStation®4 game console system. During the second quarter of 2013, Microsoft announced that the Xbox One, its next-generation gaming console, would feature an AMD semi-custom
SOC product. The PlayStation®4 and Xbox One were both launched in the fourth quarter of 2013, powered by AMD
semi-custom SOC products.

Discrete Desktop Graphics.We offer discrete graphic and
visual solutions for gaming, multimedia, editing photos and videos as well as other graphic-intensive applications. Our discrete GPUs for desktop PCs include the AMD Radeon™ HD 8000 series, AMD Radeon 7000 series, AMD Radeon HD 6000 series and
ATI Radeon HD 5000 series. In September 2013, we announced our AMD Radeon R7 and R9 series graphics cards designed for enthusiast gamers. Many models of our R7 graphic cards and all models of our R9 graphic card series support our Mantle and AMD
True Audio technology.

Discrete Notebook Graphics.When selecting a graphics solution,
key considerations for notebook manufacturers are graphics performance, visual experience, power efficiency, dedicated memory support and ease of design integration. Our discrete GPUs for notebooks include the AMD Radeon HD 7000M series, AMD Radeon
HD 6000M series and ATI Mobility Radeon HD 5000 series. In May 2013, we announced our AMD Radeon HD 8000M Series graphics processors, a discrete graphics processor series for performance gaming. In October 2013, we launched our AMD Radeon R7, R9 and
R5 M200 series mobile discrete graphics processors series based on our Graphics Core Next architecture for consumer GPUs.

Professional Graphics.Our AMD FirePro™ family of professional graphics products consists of 3D
and 2D multi-view graphics cards and GPUs that we designed for integration in mobile and desktop workstations, as well as business PCs. We designed our AMD FirePro 3D graphics cards for demanding applications such as those found in the computer
aided design (CAD) and digital content creation (DCC) markets, with drivers specifically tuned for maximum performance, stability and reliability across a wide range of software packages. We designed our AMD FirePro 2D graphics cards with dual and
quad display outputs for financial and corporate environments.

We also provide graphics and visual products for the server
market where we leverage our graphics and visual expertise and align our offerings to provide the stability, video quality and bus architectures desired by our customers. Through our AMD CrossFire™ Pro technology, we enable CAD and DCC
professionals to connect two identical AMD FirePro 3D graphics cards with a flex cable connection that can enhance performance of geometry-limited applications. In February 2013, we launched AMD FirePro™ R5000 remote workstation-class graphics
card, designed to power remote 3D-graphics workflows and full computing experiences over IP networks for data center environments. In March 2013, we launched AMD Radeon Sky series graphic cards designed to enable cloud gaming service companies to
stream PC and console-quality gaming experiences to various devices.

advertisements and marketing programs related to our products and third-party systems integrating our products, subject to meeting defined criteria.

Customers

Our microprocessor customers consist primarily of original
equipment manufacturers, or OEMs, original design manufacturers, or ODMs, system builders and independent distributors in both domestic and international markets. ODMs provide design and/or manufacturing services to branded and unbranded private
label resellers, OEMs and system builders. Our graphics products customers include the foregoing as well as add-in-board manufacturers, or AIBs.

Customers of our chipset products consist primarily of PC and server OEMs, often through ODMs or other contract manufacturers, who build the OEM motherboards, as well as desktop and server motherboard
manufacturers who incorporate chipsets into their channel motherboards.

Our sales and marketing teams work closely with our
customers to define product features, performance and timing of new products so that the products we are developing meet our customers’ needs. We also employ application engineers to assist our customers in designing, testing and qualifying
system designs that incorporate our products in order to assist in optimizing product compatibility. We believe that our commitment to customer service and design support improves our customers’ time-to-market and fosters relationships that
encourage customers to use the next generation of our products.

We work closely with our customers to create differentiated
products that leverage our CPU, GPU and APU technology. Customers pay us non-recurring engineering fees for design and development services and a purchase price for our semi-custom products.

Collectively, our top five customers accounted for approximately 54% of our net revenue during the year ended 2013. In 2013,
Hewlett-Packard Company, Microsoft Corporation and Sony Corporation each accounted for more than 10% of our consolidated net revenues. Sales to Hewlett-Packard consisted primarily of products from our Computing Solutions segment. Sales to Microsoft
and Sony consisted primarily of products from our







Graphics and Visual Solutions segment. Five customers, including Hewlett-Packard Company, accounted for approximately 58% of the net revenue attributable to our Computing Solutions segment. In
addition, five customers, including Hewlett-Packard, Microsoft and Sony, accounted for approximately 70% of the net revenue attributable to our Graphics and Visual Solutions segment. A loss of any of these customers could have a material adverse
effect on our business.

Original Equipment Manufacturers

We focus on three types of OEMs: multi-nationals, selected regional accounts and target market customers. Large multi-nationals and
regional accounts are our core OEM customers. Our OEM customers include numerous foreign and domestic manufacturers of servers and workstations, desktops, notebooks and PC motherboards.

Third-Party Distributors

Our authorized distributors resell to
sub-distributors and mid-sized and smaller OEMs and ODMs. Typically, distributors handle a wide variety of products, including those that compete with our products. Distributors typically maintain an inventory of our products. In most instances, our
agreements with distributors protect their inventory of our products against price reductions and provide return rights with respect to any product that we have removed from our price book that is not more than 12 months older than the manufacturing
code date. In addition, some agreements with our distributors may contain standard stock rotation provisions permitting limited levels of product returns.

AIB Manufacturers and System Integrators

We strive to establish and
broaden our relationships with AIB manufacturers. We offer component-level graphics and chipset products to AIB manufacturers who in turn build and sell board-level products using our technology to system integrators, or SIs, and to retail buyers.
Our agreements with AIBs protect their inventory of our products against price reductions. We also sell directly to our SI customers. SIs typically sell from positions of regional or product-based strength in the market. They usually operate on
short design cycles and can respond quickly with new technologies. SIs often use discrete graphics solutions as a means to differentiate their products and add value to their customers.

Competition

Generally, the IC industry is intensely competitive. Products
typically compete on product quality, power consumption (including battery life), reliability, speed, performance, size (or form factor), cost, selling price, adherence to industry standards (and the creation of open industry standards), software
and hardware compatibility and stability, brand recognition, timely product introductions and availability. Technological advances in the industry result in frequent product introductions, regular price reductions, short product life cycles and
increased product capabilities that may result in significant performance improvements. Our ability to compete depends on our ability to develop, introduce and sell new products or enhanced versions of existing products on a timely basis and at
competitive prices, while reducing our costs.

Competition in the Microprocessor Market

Intel Corporation has dominated the market for microprocessors for many years. Intel’s market share, margins and significant
financial resources enable it to market its products aggressively, to target our customers and our channel partners with special incentives and to discipline customers who do business with us. These aggressive activities have in the past and are
likely in the future to result in lower unit sales and a lower average selling price for our products and adversely affect our margins and profitability.







Intel exerts substantial influence over computer manufacturers and their channels of
distribution through various brand and other marketing programs. As a result of Intel’s dominant position in the microprocessor market, Intel has been able to control x86 microprocessor and computer system standards and benchmarks and to
dictate the type of products the microprocessor market requires of us. Intel also dominates the computer system platform, which includes core logic chipsets, graphics chips, motherboards and other components necessary to assemble a computer system.
OEMs that purchase microprocessors for computer systems are highly dependent on Intel, less innovative on their own and, to a large extent, are distributors of Intel technology. Additionally, Intel is able to drive de facto standards for x86
microprocessors that could cause us and other companies to have delayed access to such standards.

Intel has substantially
greater financial resources than we do and accordingly spends substantially greater amounts on marketing and research and development than we do. We expect Intel to maintain its dominant position and to continue to invest heavily in marketing,
research and development, new manufacturing facilities and other technology companies. To the extent Intel manufactures a significantly larger portion of its microprocessor products using more advanced process technologies, or introduces competitive
new products into the market before we do, we may be more vulnerable to Intel’s aggressive marketing and pricing strategies for microprocessor products. For example, Intel recently introduced microprocessors for low-cost notebooks, similar to
products that we offer for low-cost notebooks.

As long as Intel remains in this dominant position, we may be materially
adversely affected by Intel’s:



•business practices, including rebating and allocation strategies and pricing actions, designed to limit our market share and margins;



•product mix and introduction schedules;



•product bundling, marketing and merchandising strategies;



•exclusivity payments to its current and potential customers and channel partners;



•control over industry standards, PC manufacturers and other PC industry participants, including motherboard, memory, chipset and basic input/output
system, or BIOS, suppliers and software companies as well as the graphics interface for Intel platforms; and



•marketing and advertising expenditures in support of positioning the Intel brand over the brand of its OEM customers.

Intel’s dominant position in the microprocessor market, its introduction of competitive new products, its existing relationships
with top-tier OEMs and its aggressive marketing and pricing strategies could result in lower unit sales and a lower average selling price for our products, which could have a material adverse effect on us.

Other competitors include a variety of companies providing or developing ARM-based designs at relatively low cost and low power
processors for the computing market including netbooks, tablets and thin-client form factors, as well as dense servers, set-top boxes and gaming consoles. ARM Holdings designs and licenses its ARM architecture to third parties, including AMD, and
offers supporting software and services. Our ability to compete with companies who use ARM-based solutions depends on our ability to design energy-efficient, high-performing products at an attractive price point.

Competition in the Chipset Market

In the chipset market, our competitors include suppliers of integrated graphics chipsets. PC manufacturers use integrated chipsets because they cost less than traditional discrete GPUs while offering
acceptable graphics performance for most mainstream PC users. Intel also leverages its dominance in the microprocessor market to sell its integrated graphics chipsets. Intel manufactures and sells integrated graphics chipsets bundled with their
microprocessors and is a dominant competitor in this market.







Competition in the Graphics and Visual Solutions Market

In the graphics and visual solutions market, our competitors include suppliers of discrete graphics, embedded graphics processors and
IGPs. Intel manufactures and sells embedded graphics processors and IGP chipsets, and is a dominant competitor with respect to this portion of our business. The continued improvement of the quality of Intel’s integrated graphics, along with
higher unit shipments of our APUs, may drive computer manufacturers to reduce the number of systems they build paired with discrete graphics components, particularly for notebooks, because they may offer satisfactory graphics performance for most
mainstream PC users, at a lower cost. Intel could take actions that place our discrete GPUs and integrated chipsets at a competitive disadvantage such as giving one or more of our competitors in the graphics and visual solutions market, such as
Nvidia Corporation, preferential access to its proprietary graphics interface or other useful information.

Other than Intel,
our principal competitor in the graphics and visual solutions market is Nvidia. AMD and Nvidia are the two principal players offering discrete graphics solutions. Other competitors include a number of smaller companies, which may have greater
flexibility to address specific market needs, but less financial resources to do so, especially as we believe that the growing complexity of visual processors and the associated research and development costs represent an increasingly higher
barrier to entry in this market.

With respect to our game console products, we compete primarily against Nvidia. Other
competitors include Intel, ARM Holdings and Imagination Technology Group.

Research and Development

We focus our research and development activities on improving and enhancing product design. One main area of focus is on delivering the
next generation of products with greater system level integration of the CPU and GPU and transforming our products into SOCs, with, in each case, improved system performance and performance-per-watt characteristics. For example, we are focusing on
improving the battery life of our microprocessors and APU products for notebooks and tablets and the power efficiency of our microprocessors for servers. We are also focusing on delivering a range of low-power integrated platforms to serve key
markets, including commercial clients, mobile computing and gaming and media computing, as well as developing an HSA, which is designed for software developers to easily program APUs by combining scalar processing on the CPU with parallel processing
on the GPU, all while providing high bandwidth access to memory at low power. We believe that these integrated platforms will bring customers better time-to-market and increased performance and energy efficiency. We also work with industry leaders
on process technology, software and other functional intellectual property and we work with others in the industry, public foundations, universities and industry consortia to conduct early stage research and development.

Our research and development expenses for 2013, 2012 and 2011 were approximately $1.2 billion, $1.4 billion and $1.5 billion,
respectively. For more information, see “Part II, Item 7-Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” or MD&A.

We conduct product and system research and development activities for our products in the United States with additional design and
development engineering teams located in China, Canada, India, Singapore, Taiwan and Israel.







Manufacturing Arrangements and Assembly and Test Facilities

Third-Party Wafer Foundry Facilities

GLOBALFOUNDRIES, Inc.On March 2, 2009, we entered into a Wafer Supply Agreement (the WSA) with GLOBALFOUNDRIES, Inc. (GF). The WSA governs the terms by which we
purchase products manufactured by GF, a related party to us. Pursuant to the WSA, we are required to purchase all of our microprocessor and APU product requirements from GF with limited exceptions. If we acquire a third-party business that
manufactures microprocessor and APU products, we will have up to two years to transition the manufacture of such microprocessor and APU products to GF.

The WSA terminates no later than March 2, 2024. GF has agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts to assist us to transition the supply of products to another provider and to continue to fulfill
purchase orders for up to two years following the termination or expiration of the WSA. During the transition period, pricing for microprocessor and APU products will remain as set forth in the WSA, but our purchase commitments to GF will no longer
apply.

On April 2, 2011, we entered into a first amendment to the WSA. The primary effect of the first amendment was to
change the pricing methodology applicable to wafers delivered in 2011 for our microprocessors and APU products. The first amendment also modified our existing commitments regarding the production of certain GPU and chipset products at GF.

On March 4, 2012, we entered into a second amendment to the WSA. The primary effect of the second amendment was to
modify certain pricing and other terms of the WSA applicable to wafers for our microprocessor and APU products to be delivered by GF to us during 2012. Under the terms of the second amendment to the WSA, GF granted us rights to contract with another
wafer foundry supplier with respect to specified 28nm products for a specified period of time (the limited waiver of exclusivity). In consideration for the limited waiver of exclusivity, we recorded a charge of $703 million in the first quarter of
2012, consisting of a $425 million cash payment and a $278 million non-cash charge representing the transfer to GF of our remaining investment in GF at fair value.

On December 6, 2012, we entered into a third amendment to the WSA. Pursuant to the third amendment, we modified our wafer purchase commitments for the fourth quarter of 2012 made pursuant to the
second amendment to the WSA. In addition, we agreed to certain pricing and other terms of the WSA applicable to wafers for our microprocessor and APU products, to be delivered by GF to us from the fourth quarter of 2012 through December 31,
2013. Pursuant to the third amendment, GF agreed to waive a portion of our wafer purchase commitments for the fourth quarter of 2012. In consideration for this waiver, we agreed to pay GF a fee of $320 million. As a result, we recorded a lower of
cost or market charge of $273 million for the write-down of inventory to its market value in the fourth quarter of 2012. The cash impact of this $320 million fee was paid over several quarters, with $80 million paid on December 28, 2012, $40
million paid on April 1, 2013 and $200 million paid on December 31, 2013.

We are currently in the process of
negotiating a fourth amendment to the WSA, and we expect that our future purchases from GF will continue to be material.

GF
currently manufactures our microprocessors on 300 millimeter wafers in technologies ranging from 65nm to 28nm. Smaller process geometries can lead to gains in performance, lower power consumption and lower per unit manufacturing costs. We continue
to have our products manufactured on more advanced process technology because using more advanced process technology can contribute to lower product manufacturing costs and improve a product’s performance and power efficiency.

Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company.We also have foundry arrangements with Taiwan
Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) for the production of certain graphics processors and chipsets, embedded processors and APU products. We are in production in TSMC’s 300 millimeter fabrication facilities in technologies ranging from
65nm to 28nm.







Other Third-Party Manufacturers.We outsource
board-level graphics product manufacturing to third-party manufacturers. We also outsource board-level and system-level product manufacturing to third-party manufacturers for our SeaMicro dense server and storage products.

Assembly, Test, Mark and Packaging Facilities

We own and operate two assembly, test, mark and packaging facilities. Some wafers for our products are delivered from third-party foundries to our assembly, test, mark and packaging facilities. Our
assembly, test, mark and packaging facilities are described in the chart set forth below:



Facility LocationApproximateManufacturingArea SquareFootageActivityPenang, Malaysia150,000Assembly, Test, Mark & PackagingSuzhou, China100,000Assembly, Test, Mark & Packaging

The remaining wafers for our products are delivered from third-party foundries to our test, assembly and
packaging partners located in the Asia-Pacific region who package and test the final semiconductor products.

Intellectual Property and
Licensing

We rely on contracts and intellectual property rights to protect our products and technologies from unauthorized
third-party copying and use. Intellectual property rights include copyrights, patents, patent applications, trademarks, trade secrets and maskwork rights. As of December 28, 2013, we had approximately 4,650 patents in the United States and
approximately 1,700 patent applications pending in the United States. In certain cases, we have filed corresponding applications in foreign jurisdictions. We expect to file future patent applications in both the United States and abroad on
significant inventions, as we deem appropriate. We do not believe that any individual patent, or the expiration of any patent, is or would be material to our business.







Backlog

Sales are made primarily pursuant to purchase orders for current delivery or agreements covering purchases over a period of time. Some of these orders or agreements may be revised or canceled without
penalty. Generally, in light of current industry practice, we do not believe that such orders or agreements provide meaningful backlog figures or are necessarily indicative of actual sales for any succeeding period.

Seasonality

Our
operating results tend to vary seasonally. For example, historically, first quarter PC product sales are generally lower than fourth quarter sales. In addition, with respect to our semi-custom SOC products for game consoles, we expect sales patterns
to follow the seasonal trends of a consumer business with sales in the first half of the year being lower than sales in the second half of the year.

Employees

As of December 28, 2013, we had approximately 10,671
employees.

Environmental Regulations

Many aspects of our business operations and products are regulated by domestic and international environmental laws and regulations. These regulations include limitations on discharge of pollutants to
air, water, and soil; remediation requirements; product chemical content limitations; manufacturing chemical use and handling restrictions; pollution control requirements; waste minimization considerations; and requirements with respect to
treatment, transport, storage and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes. If we fail to comply with any applicable environmental regulations, we may be subject to fines, suspension of production, alteration of our manufacturing processes,
import/export restrictions, sales limitations and/or criminal and civil liabilities. Existing or future regulations could require us to procure expensive pollution abatement or remediation equipment, to modify product designs or to incur other
expenses to comply with environmental regulations. Any failure to adequately control the use, disposal, storage or discharge of hazardous substances could expose us to future liabilities that could have a material adverse effect on our business. We
believe we are in material compliance with applicable environmental requirements and do not expect those requirements to result in material expenditures in the foreseeable future.

Environmental laws are complex, change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time. For example, the European Union
(EU) and China are two among a growing number of jurisdictions that have enacted restrictions on the use of lead and other materials in electronic products. Other countries have also implemented similar restrictions. These regulations affect
semiconductor devices and packaging. As regulations restricting materials in electronic products continue to increase around the world, there is a risk that the cost, quality and manufacturing yields of products that are subject to these
restrictions, may be less favorable compared to products that are not subject to such restrictions, or that the transition to compliant products may produce sudden changes in demand, which may result in excess inventory.

Recent U.S. legislation requires disclosure and reporting requirements for companies who use “conflict” minerals that originate
from the Democratic Republic of Congo or adjoining countries. We will likely incur additional costs associated with complying with these requirements, such as costs related to determining the source of any conflict minerals used in our products,
auditing the process and reporting to our customers and the U.S. government. Also, since our supply chain is complex, we may face reputational challenges if we are unable to sufficiently verify the origins of the subject minerals. Moreover, we are
likely to encounter challenges to satisfy those customers who require that all of the components of our products are certified as “conflict free” and if we cannot satisfy these customers, they may choose a competitor’s products. In
January 2014, Intel announced that all of its microprocessor products are “conflict free.” Our first “conflict” minerals report covering the 2013 calendar year is due to the SEC by June 2, 2014.







A number of jurisdictions including the EU, Australia and China are developing or have
finalized market entry or public procurement regulations for computers and servers based on ENERGY STAR specifications as well as additional energy consumption limits. There is the potential for certain of our products being excluded from some of
these markets which could materially adversely affect us.

While we have budgeted for foreseeable associated expenditures, we
cannot assure you that future environmental legal requirements will not become more stringent or costly in the future. Therefore, we cannot assure you that our costs of complying with current and future environmental and health and safety laws, and
our liabilities arising from past and future releases of, or exposure to, hazardous substances will not have a material adverse effect on us. See also, “Item 3—Legal Proceedings—Environmental Matters,” below.
