ITEM 1.BUSINESS

GENERAL

The Company, founded in 1846, develops, manufactures and markets a broad range of household, personal care and specialty products. The
Company sells its consumer products under a variety of brands through a broad distribution platform that includes supermarkets, mass merchandisers, wholesale clubs, drugstores, convenience stores, home stores, dollar, pet and other specialty stores
and websites, all of which sell the products to consumers. The Company also sells specialty products to industrial customers and distributors.

The Company focuses its consumer products marketing efforts principally on its nine “power brands.” These well-recognized brand names include ARM & HAMMER (used in multiple product
categories such as baking soda, cat litter, carpet deodorization and laundry detergent), TROJAN condoms, lubricants and vibrators, OXICLEAN stain removers, cleaning solutions, laundry detergent and bleach alternatives, SPINBRUSH battery-operated
toothbrushes, FIRST RESPONSE home pregnancy and ovulation test kits, NAIR depilatories, ORAJEL oral analgesics and XTRA laundry detergent. The ninth “power brand” is the combination of the L’IL CRITTERS and VITAFUSION brand names for
the Company’s gummy vitamin dietary supplement business. The Company considers four of these brands to be “mega brands”: ARM & HAMMER, OXICLEAN, TROJAN and L’IL CRITTERS and VITAFUSION, and is giving greatest focus to
the growth of these brands.

The Company’s business is divided into three primary segments: Consumer Domestic, Consumer
International and Specialty Products Division (“SPD”). The Consumer Domestic segment includes the power brands and other household and personal care products such as SCRUB FREE, KABOOM and ORANGE GLO cleaning products, ANSWER home
pregnancy and ovulation test kits, ARRID antiperspirant and CLOSE-UP and AIM toothpastes. The Consumer International segment primarily sells a variety of personal care products, some of which use the same brands as the Company’s domestic
product lines, in international markets, including Canada, France, Australia, the United Kingdom, Mexico and Brazil. The SPD segment is the largest United States (“U.S.”) producer of sodium bicarbonate, which it sells together with other
specialty inorganic chemicals for a variety of industrial, institutional, medical and food applications. This segment also sells a range of animal nutrition and specialty cleaning products. In 2013, the Consumer Domestic, Consumer International and
SPD segments represented approximately 75%, 17% and 8%, respectively, of the Company’s net sales.

All domestic brand
“rankings” contained in this Annual Report are based on dollar share rankings from ACNielsen AOC (All Outlets Combined) for the 52 weeks ending December 21, 2013. Foreign brand “rankings” are derived from several sources.

FINANCIAL INFORMATION ABOUT SEGMENTS

As noted above, the Company’s business is organized into three reportable segments: Consumer Domestic, Consumer International and SPD. These segments are based on differences in the nature of
products and organizational and ownership structures. The businesses of these segments generally are not seasonal, although the Consumer Domestic and Consumer International segments are affected by sales of SPINBRUSH and ARM & HAMMER
battery-operated toothbrushes (which typically are higher during the fall, in advance of the holiday season), sales of NAIR depilatories and waxes (which typically are higher in the spring and summer months), and sales of VITAFUSION and L’IL
CRITTERS dietary supplements (which typically are slightly higher in the fourth quarter of each year, in advance of the cold and flu season and renewed commitments to health). Information concerning the net sales, operating income and identifiable
assets of each of the segments is set forth in Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report and in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” which is
Item 7 of this Annual Report.







CONSUMER PRODUCTS

Consumer Domestic

Principal Products

The Company’s founders first marketed baking soda in 1846 for use in home baking. Today, this product has a wide variety of uses in
the home, including as a refrigerator and freezer deodorizer, scratch-free cleaner and deodorizer for kitchen surfaces and cooking appliances, bath additive, dentifrice, cat litter deodorizer and swimming pool pH stabilizer. The Company specializes
in baking soda-based products, as well as other products which use the same raw materials or technology or are sold in the same markets. In addition, this segment includes other deodorizing and household cleaning products, as well as laundry and
personal care products. The following table sets forth the principal products of the Company’s Consumer Domestic segment.

Household Products

In 2013, household products constituted approximately 60% of the Company’s Domestic Consumer sales and approximately 45% of the
Company’s total sales.

The ARM & HAMMER trademark was adopted in 1867. ARM & HAMMER Baking Soda
remains the number one leading brand of baking soda in terms of consumer recognition of the brand name and reputation for quality and value. The deodorizing properties of baking soda have led to the development of several baking soda-based household
products. For example, the Company markets ARM & HAMMER FRIDGE FRESH, a refrigerator deodorizer equipped with a baking soda filter to help keep food tasting fresher, and ARM & HAMMER Carpet Deodorizer.

The Company’s laundry products also include fabric softener sheets that prevent static cling and soften and freshen clothes. The Company markets ARM & HAMMER FRESH’N SOFT fabric
softeners and offers a liquid fabric softener, NICE’N FLUFFY, at a slightly lower price enabling the Company to compete at several price points.

The Company also markets a line of cat litter products, including ARM & HAMMER SUPER SCOOP clumping cat litter and ARM & HAMMER ULTRA LAST, a longer lasting clumping cat litter. Other
products include ARM & HAMMER Multi-Cat cat litter, designed for households with more than one cat, ARM & HAMMER ESSENTIALS clumping cat litter, a corn-based scoopable litter made for consumers who prefer to use products made with
natural ingredients, and ARM & HAMMER Double Duty cat litter, which eliminates both urine and feces odors on contact. The Company markets its FELINE PINE cat litter in the natural litter segment, complementing the Company’s
ARM & HAMMER branded cat litter business and positioning the Company as a leading supplier of natural cat litter. In December 2013, the Company introduced a new line of clumping cat litter, ARM & HAMMER CLUMP & SEAL,
designed to help cat owners enjoy an odor-free home.

In addition, the Company markets a line of household cleaning products
including CLEAN SHOWER daily shower cleaner, and SCRUB FREE bathroom cleaners. The Company also markets KABOOM bathroom cleaners, ORANGE GLO household cleaning products and OXICLEAN Dishwashing Booster, which removes cloudy film and food particles
on glasses and dishes. In 2013, the Company introduced KABOOM no-drip foam, a spray product designed to eliminate bathroom mold and mildew. In 2014, the Company will launch KABOOM SHOWER GUARD, a daily shower cleaning product, and will extend its
OXICLEAN brand by launching its first-ever OXICLEAN automatic dishwasher dishwashing detergent.







Personal Care Products

The Company’s personal care business was founded on the unique strengths of its ARM & HAMMER trademark and baking soda
technology. The Company has expanded its personal care business through its acquisition of antiperspirants, oral care products, depilatories, reproductive health products, oral analgesics, nasal saline moisturizers and dietary supplements under a
variety of other leading brand names. In 2013, Personal Care Products constituted approximately 40% of the Company’s Consumer Domestic sales and approximately 30% of the Company’s total sales.

ARM & HAMMER Baking Soda, when used as a dentifrice, helps whiten and polish teeth, removes plaque and leaves the mouth feeling
fresh and clean. These properties led to the development of a complete line of sodiumbicarbonate-baseddentifrice products which are marketed and sold nationally primarily under the ARM & HAMMER
DENTAL CARE and ARM & HAMMER ADVANCE WHITE brand names, including a line of toothpaste for sensitive teeth under the ARM & HAMMER brand. In 2014, the Company will introduce ARM & HAMMER TRULY RADIANT toothpaste.

The Company also manufactures in the U.S. and markets in the U.S. (including Puerto Rico) and Canada CLOSE-UP, PEPSODENT and
AIM toothpastes, which are priced at a discount from the market leaders, and the MENTADENT brand of toothpaste and toothbrushes. In addition, the Company markets deodorant and antiperspirant products under the ARM & HAMMER and ARRID brand
names.

Condoms are recognized as highly reliable contraceptives as well as an effective means of reducing the risk of
sexually transmitted diseases. The Company’s TROJAN condom brand is the number one condom brand in the U.S., and has been in use for more than 90 years. The brand includes such products as ECSTASY, TROJAN EXTENDED PLEASURE, HER PLEASURE,
TWISTED PLEASURE, SHARED PLEASURE, MAGNUM and FIRE & ICE, TROJAN CHARGED, a condom with a sensate lubricant that has heating, cooling and tingling properties, and TROJAN Vibrations, a line of vibrating products. In 2013, the Company
launched a line of lubrication products under the TROJAN brand and TROJAN PURE ECSTASY condoms. In 2014, the Company will introduce line extensions into the TROJAN lubricant line and market two new condoms: TROJAN DOUBLE ECSTASY and TROJAN MAGNUM
ribbed. The Company will also introduce two new vibrating products under its TROJAN Vibrations line.

The Company markets
SPINBRUSH battery-operated toothbrushes in the U.S. (including Puerto Rico), the United Kingdom, Canada, France, China and Australia. In 2013, the SPINBRUSH battery-operated toothbrush was the number one leading brand of battery-operated
toothbrushes in the U.S. The Company also markets SPINBRUSH PROCLEAN toothbrushes, a two-speed version of the product, SPINBRUSH PROCLEAN Recharge, a rechargeable toothbrush offering up to one week of power brushes between charges, SPINBRUSH
PROCLEAN Sonic, a value high speed battery-operated toothbrush which competes with much more expensive “sonic” toothbrushes, and ARM & HAMMER TOOTH TUNES battery-operated toothbrushes, with proprietary technology that delivers
music while brushing. In 2013, the Company launched additional song offerings under its TOOTH TUNES brand, including songs by the band One Direction. In 2014, the Company will introduce a line of SPINBRUSH TRULY RADIANT toothbrushes.

The Company markets two lines of home pregnancy and ovulation test kits. Its FIRST RESPONSE brand of diagnostic kits includes a home
female fertility test. Its ANSWER home pregnancy and ovulation test kits compete in the value segment of the market. In 2014, the Company will launch an enhanced FIRST RESPONSE pregnancy test kit that can tell a woman that she is pregnant up to six
days before her expected period, with 99% accuracy from the day of her missed period.

The Company’s NAIR depilatory
brand is the number one selling depilatory brand in the U.S., with innovative products that address consumer needs for quick, complete and longer-lasting hair removal. The Company offers a full array of depilatory products for women, men and teens
under the NAIR brand name, including Cool Gel, SHOWER POWER, Roll-On, Milk N’Honey, and Brazilian Spa Clay products for both depilatory and wax. In 2013, the Company added to this line with its NAIR TOTAL CARE body and face trios.







In 2014, the Company will introduce four new NAIR hair-removal products: two products under the new NAIR Argan Oil line, NAIR FOR MEN SHOWER POWER and NAIR SPRAYS AWAY.

The Company markets ORAJEL oral analgesics, which includes products for adults as well as babies, including ORAJEL Cooling Cucumber
Teething Gel and BABY ORAJEL Tooth and Gum Cleanser. The ORAJEL teething and toothache line of products is the number one brand in the U.S. In 2013, the Company launched a single dose cold sore product under the ORAJEL brand. In 2014, the Company
will introduce several teething and toothache line extensions with licensed characters under the ORAJEL trademark.

The
Company markets and sells the L’IL CRITTERS children’s gummy vitamin dietary supplement line and the VITAFUSION adult gummy vitamin dietary supplement line, both number one leading brands in the gummy-form dietary supplement category. The
Company also markets and sells a line of gummy probiotics under the ACCUFLORA brand name, and private label gummy vitamins. In 2014, the Company will introduce two new lines of gummy vitamin dietary supplements: VITAFUSION MULTIVITES PLUS and
L’IL CRITTERS GUMMY VITES PLUS.

The Company markets the SIMPLY SALINE brand of nasal saline moisturizers in the U.S.,
complementing the Company’s STERIMAR brand nasal saline solution business in Europe and other parts of the world. The Company also markets BATISTE dry shampoo in the U.S.

Consumer International

The Consumer International segment markets a
variety of personal care products, household and over-the-counter products in international markets, including Canada, France, Australia, the United Kingdom, Mexico and Brazil.

Total Consumer International net sales represented approximately 17% of the Company’s consolidated net sales in 2013. Net sales of
the subsidiaries located in Canada, the United Kingdom, France and Australia accounted for 37%, 18%, 15% and 11%, respectively, of the Company’s 2013 international net sales in this segment. No other country in which the Company operates
accounts for more than 10% of its total international net sales, and no product line accounts for more than 15% of total international net sales.

Certain of the Company’s international product lines are similar to its domestic product lines. For example, the Company markets home pregnancy and ovulation test kits and oral care products in most
of its international markets, waxes and depilatory products in virtually all international locations, TROJAN condoms in Canada and Mexico and L’IL CRITTERS and VITAFUSION dietary supplements principally in Canada and Asia.

The Company has expanded distribution of ARM & HAMMER products internationally by marketing ARM & HAMMER laundry and
pet care products in Canada and ARM & HAMMER laundry care products in Mexico. The Company also markets SPINBRUSH battery-operated toothbrushes internationally, primarily in the United Kingdom, Canada, France, China and Australia, and
OXICLEAN products internationally, primarily in Mexico and Canada.

The Company sells PEARL DROPS dentifrice products in
Europe, Canada and Australia and STERIMAR nasal hygiene products in a number of markets in Europe, Mexico, Asia and Australia. The Company also sells BATISTE dry shampoo principally in the United Kingdom, and also in Australia, France, Brazil and
Mexico, the CURASH BABYCARE line of babycare products including wipes, creams and powders in Australia, and GRAVOL anti-nauseant and RUB-A535 topical analgesic in Canada.

COMPETITION FOR CONSUMER DOMESTIC AND CONSUMER INTERNATIONAL

The Company competes
in the household and personal care consumer product categories, which are highly innovative categories, characterized by a continuous flow of new products and line extensions, and require







significant advertising and promotion. The Company competes in these categories primarily on the basis of product innovation and performance, brand recognition, price, value and other consumer
benefits. Consumer products, particularly laundry and household cleaning products, as well as certain toothpaste products, are subject to significant price competition. As a result, the Company from time to time may need to reduce the prices for
some of its products to respond to competitive and customer pressures and to maintain market share.

Internationally, the
Company competes in similar competitive categories for most of its products.

The Company’s competitors include The
Procter & Gamble Company (“P&G”), The Sun Products Corporation, The Clorox Company, Colgate-Palmolive Company, S.C. Johnson & Son, Inc., Henkel AG & Co. KGaA, Reckitt Benckiser Group plc, Johnson &
Johnson, Ansell Limited, Pfizer Inc., Bayer AG, Alere Inc. (formerly known as Inverness Medical Innovations, Inc.), NBTY, Inc. and Pharmavite LLC. Many of these companies have greater financial resources than the Company and have the capacity to
outspend the Company if they attempt to gain market share.

Product introductions typically involve heavy marketing costs in
the year of launch, and the Company usually is not able to determine whether the new products and line extensions will be successful until a period of time has elapsed following the introduction of the new products or the extension of the product
line.

Because of the competitive environment facing retailers, the Company faces pricing pressure from customers,
particularly high-volume retailer store customers, who have increasingly sought to obtain pricing concessions or better trade terms. These concessions or terms could reduce the Company’s margins. Furthermore, if the Company is unable to
maintain price or trade terms acceptable to its customers, they could increase product purchases from competitors and reduce purchases from the Company, which would harm the Company’s sales and profitability.

DISTRIBUTION FOR CONSUMER DOMESTIC

Products in the Consumer Domestic segment are marketed throughout the U.S. primarily through a broad distribution platform that includes supermarkets, mass merchandisers, wholesale clubs, drugstores,
convenience stores, home stores, dollar, pet and other specialty stores, and websites, all of which sell the products to consumers. The Company employs a sales force based regionally throughout the U.S. that utilizes the services of independent food
brokers, who represent the Company’s products in the food, pet, dollar and club classes of trade. The Company’s products are stored in Company plants and third-party owned warehouses and are either delivered by independent trucking
companies or picked up by customers at the Company’s facilities.

DISTRIBUTION FOR CONSUMER INTERNATIONAL

Products in the Consumer International segment are marketed primarily through a broad distribution platform that includes supermarkets,
wholesale clubs, pharmacies and drugstores, convenience stores and discount stores. The Company’s Consumer International distribution network reflects capacity and cost considerations in the regions served. In Canada, Mexico and Australia,
finished goods are warehoused internally and shipped directly to customers through independent freight carriers. In the United Kingdom, domestic product distribution is subcontracted to professional distribution companies, while export product
distribution is handled internally and shipped from the Company’s warehouses. In France, distribution of consumer products to mass markets is handled internally while distribution of the Company’s over-the-counter products to pharmacies
and professional diagnostics to laboratories is handled by outside agencies. In Brazil and China, all product distribution is subcontracted to professional distribution companies.







Specialty Products Division

Principal Products

The Company’s SPD segment focuses on sales to
businesses and participates in three product areas: Specialty Chemicals, Animal Nutrition and Specialty Cleaners, and accounted for approximately 8% of the Company’s consolidated net sales in 2013. The following table sets forth the principal
products of the Company’s SPD segment.

(4)Megalac is a registered trademark of Volac International Limited.

(5)Distributed in North America by The ArmaKleen Company (“ArmaKleen”), a joint venture in which the Company holds a 50% ownership interest.

Specialty Chemicals

The Company’s specialty chemicals business primarily encompasses the manufacture, marketing and sale of sodium bicarbonate in a range of grades and granulations for use in industrial markets. In
industrial markets, sodium bicarbonate is used by other manufacturing companies as a leavening agent for commercial baked goods, as an antacid in pharmaceuticals, as a carbon dioxide release agent in fire extinguishers, as an alkaline agent in
swimming pool chemicals, and as a buffer in kidney dialysis.

The Company’s 99.8% owned Brazilian subsidiary, Quimica
Geral do Nordeste (“QGN”), is South America’s leading provider of sodium bicarbonate. The business markets sodium bicarbonate in Brazil.

The Company and Occidental Chemical Corporation are equal partners in a joint venture, Armand, which manufactures and markets potassium carbonate and potassium bicarbonate for sale in domestic and
international markets. The potassium-based products are used in a wide variety of applications, including agricultural products, specialty glass and ceramics, and potassium silicates. Armand also manufactures for the Company a potassium
carbonate-based animal feed additive for sale in the dairy industry, described below under “Animal Nutrition Products.”







The Company, FMC and TATA Chemicals (Soda Ash) Partners are equal partners in Natronx. The
Company’s investment is accounted for under the equity method. Natronx engages in the marketing and distribution of sodium-based, dry sorbents for air pollution control in electric utility and industrial boiler operations. The sorbents,
primarily sodium bicarbonate and trona, are used by coal-fired utilities to remove harmful pollutants, such as acid gases, in flue-gas treatment processes.

Animal Nutrition Products

A special grade of sodium bicarbonate, as well
as sodium sesquicarbonate, is sold to the animal feed market as a feed additive for use by the dairy industry as a buffer, or antacid, for dairy cattle. The Company also markets DCAD PLUS feed grade potassium carbonate, which is manufactured by
Armand as a feed additive into the animal feed market.

The Company markets MEGALAC rumen bypass fat, a nutritional supplement
made from natural oils, which enables cows to maintain energy levels during the period of high milk production, resulting in improved milk yields and minimized weight loss. The product and the trademark MEGALAC are licensed under a long-term license
agreement from a British company, Volac International Limited.

The Company also markets BIO-CHLOR and FERMENTEN, a range of
specialty feed ingredients for dairy cows, which improve rumen feed efficiency and help increase milk production.

Specialty Cleaners

The Company also provides a line of cleaning and deodorizing products for use in commercial and industrial applications such as office buildings, hotels, restaurants and other facilities.

The Company and Safety-Kleen Systems, Inc. (“Safety-Kleen”) are equal partners in a joint venture, ArmaKleen, which has built a
specialty cleaning products business based on the Company’s technology and Safety-Kleen’s sales and distribution organization. In North America, this joint venture distributes the Company’s proprietary product line of aqueous cleaners
along with the Company’s ARMEX blast media line, which is designed for the removal of a wide variety of surface coatings. The Company continues to pursue opportunities to build this industrial cleaning business using the Company’s
aqueous-based technology as well as the ARMEX blast media line of products.

COMPETITION FOR SPD

Competition within the specialty chemicals and animal nutrition product lines is intense. The specialty chemicals business operates in a
competitive environment influenced by capacity utilization, customers’ leverage and the impact of raw material and energy costs. Product introductions typically involve introductory costs in the year of launch, and the Company usually is not
able to determine whether new products and line extensions will be successful until a period of time has elapsed following the introduction of new products or the extension of the product lines. The Company’s key competitors are Solvay
Chemicals, Inc., FMC and Natural Soda, Inc.

DISTRIBUTION FOR SPD

SPD markets sodium bicarbonate and other chemicals to industrial and agricultural customers primarily throughout the U.S. and Canada. Distribution is accomplished through a dedicated sales force
supplemented by manufacturers’ representatives and the sales personnel of independent distributors throughout the country. The Company’s products in this segment are located in Company plants and public warehouses and are either delivered
by independent trucking companies or picked up by customers at the Company’s facilities.







RAW MATERIALS AND SOURCES OF SUPPLY

The Company manufactures sodium bicarbonate for both its consumer and specialty products businesses at its plants located at Green River,
Wyoming and Old Fort, Ohio. The primary source of soda ash, a basic raw material used by the Company in the production of sodium bicarbonate, is the mineral trona, which is found in abundance in southwestern Wyoming near the Company’s Green
River plant. The Company has adequate trona reserves under mineral leases to support the Company’s sodium bicarbonate requirements for the foreseeable future.

The Company is party to a partnership agreement with Tata Chemicals (Soda Ash) Partners, which mines and processes trona reserves in Wyoming. Through the partnership and related supply and services
agreements, the Company fulfills a substantial amount of its soda ash requirements, enabling the Company to achieve some of the economies of an integrated business capable of producing sodium bicarbonate and related products from the basic raw
material. The Company also has an agreement for the supply of soda ash from another company. The partnership agreement and other supply agreements between the Company and Tata Chemicals (Soda Ash) Partners are terminable upon two years notice by
either company. The Company believes that sufficient alternative sources of supply are available.

The Company believes that
ample sources of raw materials are available for all of its other major products. Detergent chemicals are used in a variety of the Company’s products and are available from a number of sources. Bottles, paper products and clay are available
from multiple suppliers, although the Company chooses to source most of these materials from single sources under long-term supply agreements in order to gain favorable pricing. The Company also uses a palm oil fraction (by-product) in its rumen
bypass fats products. Alternative sources of supply are available in case of disruption or termination of the supply agreements.

The cost of raw materials, including surfactants, diesel fuel and oil-based raw and packaging materials used primarily in the consumer businesses, continued to be high in 2013 relative to prior years.
However, while the market price of ethylene-based resin was at an all-time high in 2013, the Company’s cost for this material was mitigated as a result of the Company’s ability to contractually lock in pricing for the first nine months of
2013. Increases in the prices of certain raw materials could materially impact the Company’s costs and financial results if the Company is unable to pass such costs along in the form of price increases to its customers.

The Company utilizes the services of third party contract manufacturers around the world for certain products.

PATENTS AND TRADEMARKS

The Company’s trademarks appear in upper case letters throughout this Annual Report. The majority of the Company’s trademarks
are registered with either the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office or with the trademark offices of many foreign countries. The ARM & HAMMER trademark has been used by the Company since 1867, and is a valuable asset and important to the
successful operation of the Company’s business. The Company’s products are sold under many other valuable trademarks held by the Company, including TROJAN, NAIR, ORAJEL, FIRST RESPONSE, XTRA, OXICLEAN, SPINBRUSH, BATISTE, SIMPLY SALINE,
FELINE PINE, L’IL CRITTERS and VITAFUSION. The Company’s portfolio of trademarks represents substantial goodwill in the businesses using the trademarks.

U.S. patents are currently granted for a term of 20 years from the date the patent application is filed. Although the Company actively seeks and maintains a number of patents, no single patent is
considered significant to the business as a whole.

CUSTOMERS AND ORDER BACKLOG

In each of the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012, and 2011, net sales to the Company’s largest customer, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.
and its affiliates (“Wal-Mart”), were 24%, 24% and 23% respectively, of the







Company’s total consolidated net sales. The time between receipt of orders and shipment is generally short, and as a result, backlog is not significant. No other customer accounted for more
than 10% of consolidated net sales in the three year period.

RESEARCH & DEVELOPMENT

The Company conducts research and development activities primarily at its Princeton and Cranbury facilities in New Jersey. The Company
devotes significant resources and attention to product development, process technology and basic research to develop differentiated products with new and distinctive features and to provide increased convenience and value to its customers. To
increase its innovative capabilities, the Company engages outside contractors for general research and development in activities beyond its core areas of expertise. The Company spent $61.8 million, $54.8 million and $55.1 million on research and
development activities in 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively.

GOVERNMENT REGULATION

General

Some of the
Company’s products are subject to regulation by one or more U.S. agencies, including the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”), the Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”), the Federal Trade Commission
(“FTC”), the Consumer Product Safety Commission (“CPSC”) and foreign agencies.

FDA regulations govern a
variety of matters relating to the Company’s products, such as product development, manufacturing, premarket clearance or approval, advertising and distribution. The regulations adopted and standards imposed by the FDA and similar foreign
agencies evolve over time and can require the Company to make changes in its manufacturing processes and quality systems to remain in compliance. These agencies periodically inspect manufacturing and other facilities. If the Company fails to comply
with applicable regulations and standards, it may be subject to sanctions, including fines and penalties, the recall of products and cessation of manufacturing and/or distribution.

In addition, the Company sells products that are subject to regulation under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act and
the Toxic Substances Control Act, which are administered by the EPA. The Company also is subject to regulation by the FTC in connection with the content of its labeling, advertising, promotion, trade practices and other matters.

The CPSC administers the Poison Prevention Packaging Act, and has issued regulations requiring special child resistant packaging for
certain products, including pharmaceuticals, dietary supplements, and dietary substances, containing certain ingredients (e.g., iron).

The Company’s relationship with certain union employees may be overseen by the National Labor Relations Board. The Company’s activities also are regulated by various agencies of the states,
localities and foreign countries in which the Company sells its products.

Medical Device Clearance and Approval

To be commercially distributed in the U.S., a medical device must, unless exempt, receive clearance or approval from the FDA pursuant to
the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (“FDCA”). Lower risk devices are categorized as either class I or II devices. For class II devices, the manufacturer must generally submit a premarket notification requesting clearance for
commercial distribution known as a “510(k)” clearance. The Company’s condoms, home pregnancy and ovulation test kits are regulated as class II devices. Some low risk devices, including SPINBRUSH and ARM & HAMMER battery
powered toothbrushes, are in class I and are generally exempted from the 510(k) requirement. To obtain 510(k) clearance, a device must be determined to be substantially equivalent in intended use and in safety and effectiveness to a benchmark
device, or “predicate” that is already legally in commercial distribution. Any modification to a 510(k) cleared device that could significantly







affect its safety or effectiveness, or that would constitute a change in its intended use, generally requires a new 510(k) clearance. A manufacturer may determine that a new 510(k) clearance is
not required, but if the FDA disagrees, it may retroactively require a 510(k) clearance and may require the manufacturer to cease marketing or recall the modified device until 510(k) clearance is obtained.

Medical Device Postmarket Regulation

After a medical device is commercialized, numerous regulatory requirements apply, including:



•the quality system regulation, which imposes FDA current Good Manufacturing Practice (“cGMP”) requirements governing the methods used in, and
the facilities and controls used for, the design, manufacture, packaging, servicing, labeling, storage, installation, and distribution of all finished medical devices intended for human use;



•labeling regulations, including a prohibition on product promotion for unapproved or “off label” uses;



•the medical device reporting regulation requiring a manufacturer to report to the FDA if its device may have caused or contributed to a death or
serious injury or malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if it were to recur; and



•the reports of corrections and removals regulation, which requires a manufacturer to report recalls and field actions to the FDA if initiated to reduce
a risk to health posed by the device or to remedy a violation of the FDCA that may present a risk to health.

OTC
Pharmaceutical

The Company markets over-the-counter (“OTC”) pharmaceutical products, such as toothpaste,
antiperspirant, and oral analgesics products, that are also subject to FDA and foreign regulation. Under the U.S. OTC monograph system, selected OTC pharmaceutical products are generally recognized as safe and effective and do not require the
submission and approval of a new drug application. The FDA OTC monographs include well-known ingredients and specify requirements for permitted indications, required warnings and precautions, allowable combinations of ingredients and dosage levels.
Pharmaceutical products marketed under the OTC monograph system must conform to specific quality, formula and labeling requirements.

All facilities where OTC pharmaceutical products are manufactured, tested, packaged, stored or distributed must comply with cGMP regulations and/or regulations promulgated by competent authorities in the
countries where the facilities are located. All of the Company’s pharmaceutical products are manufactured, tested, packaged, stored and distributed according to cGMP regulations. The FDA performs periodic audits to ensure that the
Company’s facilities remain in compliance with all appropriate regulations. The failure of a facility to be in compliance may lead to a breach of representations made to customers or to regulatory action against the Company related to the
products made in that facility, such as seizure, injunction or recall. Serious product quality concerns could also result in governmental actions against the Company that, among other things, could result in the suspension of production or
distribution of the Company’s products, product seizures, loss of certain licenses or other governmental penalties, and could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition or operating results. The manufacturer,
packer, or distributor of an OTC pharmaceutical product marketed in the U.S. whose name appears on the label of such product is required to report serious adverse events associated with the use of the product.

The Company cannot predict whether new legislation regulating the Company’s activities will be enacted or what effect any
legislation would have on the Company’s business.







Dietary Supplements

The processing, formulation, safety, manufacturing, packaging, labeling, advertising, distribution, importing, selling, and storing of dietary supplements are subject to regulation by one or more federal
agencies, including the FDA, the FTC, the CPSC, the EPA, and by various agencies of the states and localities in which the Company’s products are sold. The FDCA governs the composition, safety, labeling, manufacturing and marketing of dietary
supplements.

Generally, dietary ingredients that were marketed in the U.S. prior to October 15, 1994 may be used in
dietary supplements without notifying the FDA. “New” dietary ingredients (i.e.,dietary ingredients that were not marketed in the U.S. before October 15, 1994) must be the subject of a new dietary ingredient notification
submitted to the FDA at least 75 days before the initial marketing unless the ingredient has been present in the food supply as an article used for food without being chemically altered. A new dietary ingredient notification must provide evidence of
a history of use or other evidence establishing that use of the dietary ingredient is reasonably expected to be safe. The FDA may determine that a new dietary ingredient notification does not provide an adequate basis to conclude that a dietary
ingredient is reasonably expected to be safe. Such a determination could effectively prevent the marketing of the dietary ingredient. On July 5, 2011, the FDA issued draft guidance governing notification of new dietary ingredients. The draft
guidance was issued for public comment and not for implementation. The guidance, if implemented, could effectively change the status of dietary ingredients that the industry has marketed as “old” dietary ingredients to “new”
dietary ingredients that may require submission of a new dietary ingredient notification.

The FDCA permits “statements
of nutritional support” to be included in labeling for dietary supplements without FDA pre-market approval. The FDA must be notified of those statements within 30 days of marketing. Among other things, the statements may describe the role
of a dietary ingredient intended to affect the structure or function of the body or characterize the documented mechanism of action by which a dietary ingredient maintains such structure or function, but may not expressly or implicitly represent
that a dietary supplement will diagnose, cure, mitigate, treat, or prevent a disease. A company that uses a statement of nutritional support in labeling must possess information substantiating that the statement is truthful and not misleading. If
the FDA determines that a particular statement of nutritional support is an unacceptable drug claim or an unauthorized version of a health claim, or if the FDA determines that a particular claim is not adequately supported by existing scientific
evidence or is otherwise false or misleading, the claim could not be used and any product bearing the claim could be subject to regulatory action.

The FDA’s cGMP regulations govern the manufacturing, packaging, labeling and holding operations of dietary supplement manufacturers. As with OTC products, the FDA performs periodic audits to ensure
that the Company’s dietary supplement facilities remain in compliance with all appropriate regulations. The failure of a facility to be in compliance may lead to a breach of representation made to customers or to regulatory action against the
Company related to the products made in that facility, seizure, injunction or recall. There remains considerable uncertainty with respect to the FDA’s interpretation of the cGMP regulations and their actual implementation in manufacturing
facilities. The failure of a manufacturing facility to comply with the cGMP regulations may render products manufactured in that facility adulterated, and subjects those products and the manufacturer to a variety of potential FDA enforcement
actions. In addition, under recent amendments to the FDCA, the manufacturing of dietary ingredients contained in dietary supplements will be subject to similar or even more burdensome requirements, which may increase the costs of dietary ingredients
and subject suppliers of such ingredients to more rigorous inspections and enforcement. The manufacturer, packer, or distributor of a dietary supplement marketed in the U.S. whose name appears on the label of the supplement is required to report
serious adverse events associated with the use of that supplement to FDA.

The FTC exercises jurisdiction over the advertising
of dietary supplements. The FTC considers whether a product’s advertising claims are accurate, truthful and not misleading pursuant to its authority under the Federal Trade Commission Act, or FTC Act. The FTC has instituted numerous enforcement
actions against dietary supplement companies for failure to adequately substantiate claims made in advertising or for the use of







otherwise false or misleading advertising claims. These enforcement actions have resulted in consent decrees and the payment of civil penalties and/or restitution by the companies involved. Such
actions can result in substantial financial penalties and significantly restrict the marketing of a dietary supplement.

Legislation may be introduced which, if passed, would impose substantial new regulatory requirements on dietary supplements. The effect
of additional domestic or international governmental legislation, regulations, or administrative orders, if and when promulgated, cannot be determined. New legislation or regulations may require the reformulation of certain products to meet new
standards, and require the recall or discontinuance of certain products not capable of reformulation.

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS

The Company’s operations are subject to federal, state, local and foreign laws, rules and regulations relating to
environmental and health and safety concerns including air emissions, wastewater discharges, and solid and hazardous waste management activities. The Company endeavors to take actions necessary to comply with such regulations. These steps include
periodic environmental audits of Company facilities. The audits, conducted by independent engineering firms with expertise in environmental compliance, include site visits at each location, as well as a review of documentary information, to
determine compliance with such federal, state, local and foreign laws, rules and regulations.

See Item 3, “Legal
Proceedings” in this Annual Report for information regarding an environmental proceeding relating to the Company’s Brazilian subsidiary.
