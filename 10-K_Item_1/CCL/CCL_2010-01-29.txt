A.General

Carnival
Corporation is incorporated in Panama, and Carnival plc is incorporated in England and Wales. Carnival Corporation and Carnival plc operate a dual listed company (“DLC”), whereby the businesses of Carnival Corporation and Carnival plc are
combined through a number of contracts and through provisions in Carnival Corporation’s Articles of Incorporation and By-Laws and Carnival plc’s Articles of Association.

Carnival Corporation and Carnival plc are both public companies, with separate stock exchange listings and their own shareholders. The two
companies operate as if they are a single economic enterprise, with a single executive management team and identical Boards of Directors, but each has retained its separate legal identity. See Note 3, “DLC Structure” to our Consolidated
Financial Statements in Exhibit 13 to this Form 10-K. Together with their consolidated subsidiaries Carnival Corporation and Carnival plc are referred to collectively in this Form 10-K as “Carnival Corporation & plc,”
“our,” “us,” and “we.”

We are the largest cruise company and one of the largest vacation
companies in the world. We have a portfolio of widely recognized cruise brands and are a leading provider of cruises to all major vacation destinations. See Part I, Item 1. Business. B. “Cruise Operations” for additional
information.

As of January 28, 2010, the summary by brand of our passenger capacity, the number of cruise ships we
operate, and the primary areas in which they are marketed is as follows:



Cruise BrandsPassengerCapacity (a)Number ofCruise ShipsPrimary MarketCarnival Cruise Lines54,48022North AmericaPrincess Cruises (“Princess”)37,58817North AmericaCosta Cruises (“Costa”) (b)28,42614EuropeHolland America Line21,37814North AmericaP&O Cruises (c)11,9986United Kingdom (“UK”)AIDA Cruises (“AIDA”)9,8626GermanyIbero Cruises (“Ibero”)5,0104Spain and BrazilP&O Cruises Australia4,7443Australia and New ZealandCunard Line (“Cunard”)4,6082UK and North AmericaOcean Village (d)1,5781UKThe Yachts of Seabourn (“Seabourn”)1,0744North America180,74693



(a)In accordance with cruise industry practice, passenger capacity is calculated based on two passengers per cabin even though some cabins can accommodate three or more
passengers.



(b)Includes the 1,488-passenger capacityCosta Europa, which will be operated by an unrelated entity under a bareboat charter agreement, commencing April 2010 and
expiring April 2020.



(c)Includes the 1,200-passenger capacityArtemis, which was sold in October 2009 to an unrelated entity and is being operated by P&O Cruises under a bareboat
charter agreement until April 2011.



(d)The Ocean Village brand is being phased-out with the planned transfer of its ship to P&O Cruises Australia in November 2010.

As of January 28, 2010, we had signed agreements with three shipyards providing for the construction of 13 additional cruise ships
scheduled to enter service between February 2010 and June 2012. These additions, net of the two withdrawals mentioned above, are expected to result in an increase in our passenger capacity of 27,754 lower berths. The impact of these net
additions is a 15.3% increase in passenger capacity as compared to our January 28, 2010 passenger capacity. It is possible that some of our other older ships may also be sold, chartered or retired during the next few years, thus reducing
the size of our fleet over this period. Alternatively, it is also possible that we could acquire more ships, thus increasing the size of our fleet over this period. See Part I, Item 1. Business. B. “Cruise Operations – Ship
Information” and Note 6, “Commitments” to our Consolidated Financial Statements in Exhibit 13 to this Form 10-K for additional information regarding our ship commitments.






In addition to our cruise operations, we own Holland America Princess Alaska Tours, the
leading cruise/tour operator in the state of Alaska and the Yukon Territory of Canada, which primarily complements our Alaska cruise operations. This tour operator currently owns and operates, among other things, 15 hotels or lodges, with 3,400
guest rooms, 390 motorcoaches and 20 domed rail cars.

Mission, Primary Financial Goal and Related Strategies

Our mission is to deliver exceptional vacation experiences through some of the world’s best-known cruise brands that
cater to a variety of different geographic regions and lifestyles, all at an outstanding value unrivalled on land or at sea. Our primary financial goal is to profitably grow our cruise business, while maintaining a strong balance sheet, which
enhances our financial flexibility. Our ability to generate significant operating cash flows has allowed us to internally fund the majority of our capital investment program.

To achieve our goals we build new and innovative ships and continue to invest in our existing ships to strengthen the leadership position of
each of our brands. Our newbuilding program is the primary platform for growth for our brands that are operating in established cruise markets. We currently have 13 cruise ships scheduled to enter service between February 2010 and June
2012, six of which will enter service in 2010. Our current intention is to have an average of two to three new cruise ships enter service annually in 2012 and beyond. Based on our current ship orders, our growth rate in North America,
which is the most developed cruise region, is 3%, compounded annually through 2012. However, the majority of our growth over the next three years will come from our European brands, which are in an earlier stage of market development, and are
expected to grow by 9%, compounded annually through 2012. As previously announced, we also intend to grow our presence in emerging growth markets, such as Australia and New Zealand, Asia and South America, by redeploying some of our existing
ships to these markets in order to develop an increasing awareness and appetite for cruising.

Our operating structure is
decentralized, with each of our major brands having its own headquarters and operating team, which we believe helps create an ownership culture that is an important driver of our performance. We believe this decentralized approach results in
delivering a product that is specifically tailored to identifiable geographic regions and lifestyles, which allows us to more effectively penetrate each market. Although we operate under this decentralized structure, we leverage our size to
obtain economies of scale and synergies, which reduces costs by consolidating our purchasing power and implementing common cost-containment initiatives, such as common reservation systems, coordinated media buying, tour business integration,
cross-selling, shared data centers and shared port facilities.

We believe the successful execution of these and other ongoing
strategies has enabled us to become one of the most profitable companies in the vacation industry, while maintaining the industry’s highest credit rating.

Health, Environment, Safety and Security Policy

We are committed
to:



•Protecting the health, safety and security of our guests, employees and all others working on our behalf, thereby promoting an organization that is
free of injuries, ill health and loss.

•Protecting the environment, including the marine environment in which our vessels sail and the communities in which we operate, minimizing adverse
environmental consequences and using resources efficiently.

•Fully complying with or exceeding all legal and statutory requirements related to health, environment, safety and security throughout our business
activities.

•Assigning health, environment, safety and security matters the same priority as other critical business matters.



B.Cruise Operations



I.Industry Background






Cruising offers a broad range of products to suit vacationing guests of many ages,
backgrounds and interests. Cruise brands can be broadly classified as offering contemporary, premium and luxury cruise experiences. The contemporary experience typically includes cruises on larger ships that last seven days or less, have a
more casual ambiance and are less expensive than premium or luxury cruises. The premium experience typically includes cruises on more intermediate-sized ships that last from seven to 14 days and appeal to the more experienced cruise guest who
is usually more affluent and older. Premium cruises emphasize quality, comfort, style, more destination-focused itineraries and the average pricing is normally higher than contemporary cruises. The luxury experience is usually characterized by
small vessel size, very high standards of accommodation and service, higher prices and exotic itineraries to ports which are inaccessible to larger ships. Notwithstanding these broad classifications, there generally is significant overlap and
competition among all cruise products.

We are a leading provider of cruise vacations in all the largest vacation markets in
the world, which are comprised of North America, Europe, Australia and New Zealand, Asia and South America. We have product offerings in each of the three classifications noted above. A description of the principal vacation areas where we
source substantially all of our guests and our brands that market primarily to these vacationers is discussed below.



II.North America

Approximately 63% of the cruise passengers in the world are sourced from North America, where cruising has developed into a mainstream alternative to land-based vacations. Approximately 10.3 million North American-sourced cruise
passengers took cruise vacations for two or more consecutive nights in 2008, and we estimate that approximately 10.4 million passengers cruised in 2009. This market has grown significantly in prior years and we expect that it will continue
to grow in the future as new capacity is introduced.

The weighted-average aggregate passenger capacity that has been or is
expected to be marketed by the total cruise industry and us in North America is as follows(a):



TotalCruise IndustryCarnivalCorporation & plcYear2009209,000106,0002010218,000109,0002011232,000113,0002012241,000116,000



(a)Our estimates of capacity do not include assumptions related to unannounced ship withdrawals due to factors such as the age of ships or changes in the location from
where ships’ guests are predominantly sourced and, accordingly, our estimates could indicate a higher percentage growth in North American capacity than will actually occur. These figures also include some ships that were, or are expected
to be, marketed in both North America and elsewhere during different times of the year.

The industry’s and
our net capacity serving North American-sourced cruise guests has increased at a compound annual growth rate of 2.5% and 4.8%, respectively, for the past three years. The industry’s and our compound annual net capacity growth rate is
currently expected to be 4.7% and 3.1%, respectively, for the next three years, based on the assumptions discussed above.






The locations visited by North American-sourced cruise guests in 2009 included the Caribbean
(including the Bahamas), Mexican Riviera, the Mediterranean, Alaska, Northern Europe, New England and Canada, Bermuda, Hawaii, the Panama Canal and other exotic locations, such as South and Central America, the South Pacific islands, Australia, the
Far East and India.

Carnival Cruise Lines, Princess, Holland America Line and Seabourn source their guests primarily from
North America. Costa and Cunard also source some of their guests from North America.

product enhancement initiative for its eightFantasyClass vessels. In 2009,Carnival SensationandCarnival Ecstasywere the latest ships to undergo these enhancements, which
include upgrades to all guest accommodations, a new water park, resort-style pool and the addition of an adults-only deck area.

The brand strives to reconnect guests to the fun in life. A Carnival Cruise Lines vacation offers award-winning dining, spectacular entertainment, spacious staterooms, innovative children’s
programming, revitalizing spa services and action-packed casinos. In 2009, Carnival Cruise Lines launched the Your Choice DiningSMprogram, further enhancing the onboard dining experience
with added flexibility and convenience. Carnival Cruise Lines sets the fun in motion and its “FUN FOR ALL. ALL FOR FUN.” brand promise captures the authentic spontaneous fun of the Carnival Cruise Lines experience. This
spirit, when combined with a culture that prides itself on innovation, positions the brand well to continue to grow and retain its standing as a cruise market leader.



Princess, whose brand name was made famous by theLove Boattelevision show, has been
providing cruises since 1965. Princess, the world’s third largest cruise line, operates a fleet of 17 modern ships. Princess offers over 125 unique itineraries to more than 330 destinations, with cruises generally from seven to 14
days, and two world cruises in 2010 of 104 and 107 days. Princess is a leading cruise line in international and exotic regions all over the world, including Alaska, Africa, Asia, Europe, South Pacific islands, Australia, and South
America. Some of Princess’ Caribbean cruise offerings feature a private island destination that Princess leases and operates, known as Princess Cays which is located on the island of Eleuthera in the Bahamas.

Princess is widely recognized among travel agents as an innovative, premium cruise line committed to helping its guests
Escape Completely®from their daily routine and responsibilities. Princess ships have a warm, welcoming
“comfortable elegance,” providing a relaxed, rejuvenating retreat from which to explore the world, befitting its mission to be The Consummate Host®to its guests.






The introduction ofRuby Princessin 2008 represented the ninth ship in the evolving
Grand Class series of vessels, featuring signatures such as “Movies Under the Stars” outdoor theaters showing first-run Hollywood hits on a 330 square foot outdoor poolside LED screen, the adults-only sanctuary retreat deck and the Piazza
atrium experience. While these innovations were launched on Grand Class vessels, Princess is now introducing these amenities throughout its fleet. At least 56% of each of these Grand Class ship’s staterooms have balconies, another
characteristic of Princess’ ships.



Holland America Line, with 136 years of cruising experience, operates a premium fleet of 14
ships, with one additional ship,Nieuw Amsterdamcontracted for delivery in 2010. Holland America Line cruises call at more than 320 destinations in more than 100 countries and territories on all seven continents. The majority of
Holland America Line’s cruises are from seven to 21 days. However there are several longer and more exotic cruises, such as the world cruise which lasts 114 days. Most sailings in the Caribbean visit Holland America Line’s
private island in the Bahamas, Half Moon Cay. Holland America’s fleet of mid-sized ships is designed for more intimate cruising. The spacious, classically-designed ships feature airy viewing lounges, wraparound teak decks and private,
roomy verandahs that offer guests the chance to experience wildlife and scenery.

As Holland America Line introduces new
guests to its premium brand, the brand also continues to enjoy one of the highest rates of repeat cruisers in the cruise industry. Its onboard experience is distinguished by warm, personalized service, a classic and elegant approach to interior
design and one of the most extensive collections of art and antiques at sea. The five areas identified as pillars of the Holland America guest experience are (1) spacious, elegant ships and accommodations, (2) sophisticated five-star
dining, (3) gracious, award-winning service, (4) extensive enrichment programs and activities and (5) compelling worldwide itineraries.

The Signature of Excellence®product enhancement initiative
announced over six years ago has evolved into an ongoing and comprehensive review of every aspect of the Holland America Line guests’ experience and represents a $525 million investment in the brand. Signature of Excellence®features and amenities include upgrades to all guest accommodations, such as new flat panel televisions and plush
Euro-top “Dream Beds,” resort-style pools with giant LED screens overlooking them, state-of-the-art onboard show kitchens, more enticing destinations, enhanced dining experiences, such as the popular casual Canaletto Restaurant, more
creative activities and even higher levels of service.

including Europe, Asia, the South Pacific islands, Australia and the Americas, with cruises generally from seven to 14 days, with some of longer length, including a 108 day world cruise. Seabourn currently operates three 208-guest yachts and
one 450-guest yacht and will continue its fleet expansion with two additional 450-guest yachts, one in 2010 and one in 2011,Seabourn SojournandSeabourn Quest, respectively. These larger yachts offer more categories of luxury
suites, more dining alternatives and an 11,400-square foot spa facility that is the largest on any ultra-luxury vessel. All the Seabourn yachts have a service ratio of nearly one staff member per guest, and the intimate, sociable atmosphere
that has been the hallmark of the Seabourn yachting lifestyle for over 21 years. During 2009 and 2010, the original three 208-guest yachts,Seabourn Pride,Seabourn SpiritandSeabourn Legend,are each scheduled for an
interior refurbishment of public areas to more closely match the recently deliveredSeabourn Odyssey.






III.Europe

We believe
that Europe is the largest single leisure travel vacation market in the world, but to date cruising in Europe has achieved a much lower level of market penetration than in North America, and represents a relatively small percentage of the European
vacation market. Approximately 4.4 million European-sourced passengers took cruise vacations for two or more consecutive nights in 2008 compared to approximately 10.3 million North American-sourced passengers. Additionally, we
estimate that about 4.9 million European-sourced passengers took a cruise in 2009, which was approximately the same size as the North American market in 1997. The number of European cruise passengers increased by a compound annual growth
rate of approximately 10.8% between 2003 and 2008. We believe that the European market represents a significant growth opportunity for us, and we plan to introduce a number of new ships into Europe over the next several years. In addition
to increasing our European revenues, these capacity increases should further benefit us by enabling us to achieve increasing economies of scale. Over 20,000 berths, or 66%, of our passenger capacity under construction has been designated for
our European brands. Our European brands represent 33% of our total capacity at November 30, 2009, and we expect them to increase to 37% of our total capacity by 2012, assuming no new acquisitions, transfers or withdrawals are announced
other than as previously discussed.

The weighted-average aggregate passenger capacity that has been or is expected to be
marketed by the total cruise industry and us in Europe is as follows(a):



YearTotalCruise IndustryCarnivalCorporation & plc2009139,00059,0002010154,00065,0002011159,00070,0002012164,00075,000



(a)Our estimates of European capacity are based on similar assumptions as discussed previously for our North American estimates.

The industry’s and our net capacity serving European-sourced cruise guests has increased at a compound annual growth rate of 12.0% and
13.6%, respectively, for the past three years. The industry’s and our compound annual net capacity growth rate is currently expected to be 5.8% and 8.9%, respectively, for the next three years.

The locations visited by European-sourced cruise guests in 2009 included the Mediterranean, the Caribbean, Bermuda, Northern Europe
(including Scandinavia and the Baltic), the Atlantic Isles (including the Canary Islands and Madeira), the Arabian Gulf and Indian Ocean, New England and Canada and other exotic locations around the world.



a.United Kingdom

The UK is one of the largest regions from which cruise passengers are sourced in Europe. Approximately 1.5 million UK passengers took cruises in 2008, and we estimate that a similar number also took cruises in 2009. Cruising
in the UK is an established alternative to land-based resort and sightseeing vacations. The number of UK cruise passengers increased by a compound annual growth rate of approximately 8.9% between 2003 and 2008. We believe that the UK has
growth potential for the cruise industry because the market penetration level is estimated at approximately 80% of North America’s market penetration level.

P&O Cruises sources substantially all of its guests from the UK. Cunard sources most of its guests from the UK, North America, Germany and Australia. Our North American brands and Costa also
source some guests from the UK. Our UK Ocean Village brand is being phased-out with the transfer of its ships to P&O Cruises Australia. The first ship was transferred in November 2009 and the second ship is planned to be transferred in
November 2010.








P&O Cruises, with over 170 years of cruising experience, is the largest cruise operator and
best known cruise brand in the UK, with six premium ships, and one additional ship,Azura,contracted for delivery in 2010.Artemiswill leave the fleet in April 2011, as it was sold in October 2009 and is currently being
chartered back.Artemiswill be replaced byAdonia, which is currently sailing asRoyal Princess. She will be the smallest ship in the fleet with a 710-passenger capacity, and will take over the small ship,
traditional, adult-only product offering. These ships cruise to over 205 destinations in 74 countries, with most cruises generally from seven to 16 days, but with some cruises lasting longer, including three world cruises ranging from 84 to 104
days. P&O Cruises offers cruises from Southampton, England to the Mediterranean, the Atlantic Isles, the Baltic, Scandinavia and the Norwegian Fjords for the majority of the year, and primarily operates Caribbean cruises and a choice of
world cruises during the fall and winter.

The recent P&O Cruises fleet expansion has enabled P&O Cruises to offer a
more modern style of cruising to its UK cruise guests and broaden its appeal, reaching younger guests with and without families, while retaining older and more traditional British guests.ArtemisandArcadiaare adult-only ships,
which generally appeal to an older demographic, while the rest of the fleet is well-suited towards families.

P&O
Cruises’ ships deliver a world of extraordinary experiences for guests by ensuring that they offer a high quality distinctly British experience, which is described by regular guests as “like coming home” every time they return for a
P&O Cruises holiday. The P&O Cruises ships are different from one another, which allows the British guest to tailor their holiday by selecting the ship that best reflects their holiday requirements. It also means that repeat
customers can enjoy different P&O Cruises ship experiences each time they sail.

VenturaandOceanaoffer a
more contemporary and innovative experience with a more informal atmosphere and range of alternative dining venues, from restaurants and buffets to grills and bistros. The elegant superlinersArcadia, AuroraandOrianaoffer a
stylish and classic cruise experience with their broad decks, traditional artwork and blend of formal and informal onboard experiences.Artemis,the smallest ship in the P&O Cruises fleet, offers a more traditional and intimate
experience, calling on ports not visited by larger vessels and fostering a real sense of camaraderie between her guests.



Cunard, which was launched in 1839 and has the Most Famous Ocean Liners In
The WorldSM, operates two premium/luxury ships that evoke a golden era of luxurious cruising with one additional ship,Queen Elizabeth, contracted for delivery in 2010. Cunard’s flagship,Queen
Mary 2, is the largest and grandest ocean liner in the world and operates the northern transatlantic crossing route as well as a world cruise, Mediterranean and Northern European voyages and a fall Caribbean program. Cunard’s newest
ship,Queen Victoria, is a marriage of heritage and innovation with a three tier grand lobby that offers a sense of the lavish lifestyle that its guests experience onboard.Queen Victoriawill embark on a world cruise prior to
sailing out of Southampton throughout the summer of 2010 on a series of Northern Europe and Mediterranean voyages followed by a fall Mediterranean program. Most of Cunard’s voyages range from seven to 14 days with two world cruises of 96
and 101 days.



b.Continental Europe

The main countries in continental Europe for sourcing cruise passengers are Germany, Italy, France and Spain. Together, these main countries generated approximately 2.4 million cruise passengers in 2008 and we estimate that
approximately 2.8 million passengers took a cruise in 2009. Cruising by passengers from these countries increased by a compound annual growth rate of approximately 11.7% between 2003 and 2008. We believe that continental Europe has
significant growth potential for the cruise industry because the market penetration level is estimated at approximately one-third of North America’s market penetration level. We intend to increase our penetration in continental Europe
primarily through Costa, AIDA and Ibero.








Costa is Italy’s and Europe’s #1 Cruise Line based on guests carried and ship
capacity, and boasts over 61 years of cruising history. Costa is one of the most recognized cruise brands marketed in Europe. In 2009 Costa took delivery of two new cruise ships and now operates 14 contemporary ships, with three additional
ships,Costa Deliziosa,Costa FavolosaandCosta Fascinosa,contracted for delivery, one in each of 2010, 2011 and 2012. This is the largest increase in passenger capacity currently on order by any cruise brand. With
these three new ship additions, net ofCosta Europaleaving the fleet in 2010, Costa’s existing capacity will grow by 24%.

Costa offers guests an international and multi-lingual ambiance with an Italian touch. Costa principally serves customers in Italy, France, Germany and Spain, but its 1.3 million guests in 2009 came from over 170
countries. The Costa brand offers a more traditional product catering to an older demographic in Germany and a higher-end contemporary product in Spain and thus segments these markets where we also own and operate the AIDA and Ibero brands.

The Costa ships call on 250 ports around the world, with 100 different itineraries, most from seven to 11
days. Costa’s ships operate in Europe from spring to fall. From fall 2009 to spring 2010 Costa repositioned three of its ships to the Caribbean, three of its ships to South America, two of its ships to the Arabian Gulf to be based in
Dubai, United Arab Emirates (“U.A.E.”), one of its ships to the Indian Ocean to be based from the Island of Mauritius, one ship offering 18-day winter cruises between Savona, Italy and Dubai, U.A.E. and maintains a year-round presence with
three of its ships in the Mediterranean. See Part I, Item 1. Business. B. “Cruise Operations – Asia” for additional discussion of Costa’s expanding operations in Asia.



AIDA, which began operating in 1996, sources substantially all of its guests from Germany,
Austria, and German-speaking Switzerland, and is the leader and most recognized cruise brand in the German cruise market. AIDA operates six contemporary ships, with three additional ships contracted for delivery, one in each of 2010, 2011 and
2012. With these three new ship additions, AIDA’s existing capacity will grow by 67%. AIDA’s current generation of vessels, includingAIDAdiva, AIDAbellaandAIDAluna,which AIDA took delivery of in 2007, 2008 and
2009, respectively, are innovative. For example, AIDA introduced the “Theatrium,” a completely new space concept that provides guests a central meeting space and an enhanced entertainment venue. For the next three newbuilds,
commencing with theAIDAbluin 2010, the spa concept has been further developed, including 30 spa suites and veranda cabins. Additional product innovations onAIDAbluwill be the Brauhaus, the first brewery on a cruise
ship.

AIDA’s product is especially tailored for the German-speaking market and offers an exceptionally relaxed, yet
active, cruising experience with an emphasis on lifestyle, choice, informality, friendliness and activity. Spa and fitness areas and a variety of dining options, ranging from informal, but excellent quality buffets, to grills and exclusive
restaurants, characterize the experience onboard the vessels.

AIDA offers its guests cruises generally from four to 14 days,
while calling on approximately 140 ports. During the summer, the AIDA ships sail in the Mediterranean, the North Sea, the Baltic Sea and Canada/New England, while itineraries for the winter include the Caribbean, Central America, the Western
Mediterranean, the Atlantic Isles, the Arabian Gulf and Trans-Suez Canal passages. In the fall of 2009, AIDA began offering Southeast Asia cruises, which visit Singapore, Thailand, Vietnam, India and other countries in this region.








In July 2009, we purchased the remaining 25% minority interest in Ibero, which is our
wholly-owned Spanish cruise line that began operations in 2003. Ibero currently operates three contemporary cruise ships and generally offers cruises of seven days.In November 2009, we transferred Carnival Cruise Lines’
1,440-passenger capacityHolidayto Ibero. The renamedGrand Holidayis currently undergoing a multi-million dollar refurbishment, which includes, among other things, the remodeling of guest accommodations and public areas and
enhancing the spa facilities, before her first sailing in May 2010. Substantially all of Ibero’s guests are sourced from Spain and Brazil. Ibero’s ships are especially tailored to the Spanish market, including Spanish-speaking
officers and crew as well as Mediterranean and Spanish-style food and entertainment. Ibero’s three ships in operation were repositioned to South America in November 2009 to operate Ibero cruises along the Brazilian coast through March
2010. Eight different itineraries are being offered from the homeports of Santos and Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. From March/May to October 2010, all of Ibero’s ships will offer seven-day Mediterranean and Northern European sailings from
Barcelona and Malaga, Spain; Venice, Italy; Athens, Greece; Istanbul, Turkey; Copenhagen, Denmark and Helsinki, Finland.



IV.Australia and New Zealand

Cruising in Australia and New Zealand continues to develop. We estimate that approximately 340,000 Australians and New Zealanders took cruise vacations in 2008 and we estimate that approximately 425,000 passengers cruised in
2009. Cruising by passengers from these countries increased by a compound annual growth rate of approximately 15.1% between 2003 and 2008. We serve this region primarily through the contemporary P&O Cruises Australia brand, which is
the leading cruise line in Australia and New Zealand. In addition, our premium brand Princess Cruises has a significant presence in the Australian market, thus allowing us to segment this market. We believe that the Australian and New
Zealand market has significant growth potential for the cruise industry because the market penetration level is estimated at approximately 44% of North America’s market penetration level.



P&O Cruises Australia, with over 75 years of cruising experience, caters specifically to
Australians and New Zealanders. P&O Cruises Australia is more than doubling its fleet capacity with the transfer of the two Ocean Village ships. The first ship was transferred in November 2009 and was renamedPacific
Jewel.Pacific Jewelhas just completed a multi-million dollar refurbishment and has more balconies than any contemporary ship deployed year-round from Australia, an on-deck high wire circus show and the “Salt Grill”
restaurant, a new dining concept developed with Australia’s first cruise celebrity chef, Luke Mangan. The second ship is planned to be transferred in November 2010 and will be renamedPacific Pearl.Pacific Pearlwill
also undertake a major refurbishment prior to her deployment in the Australian and New Zealand markets with an emphasis on tailoring the vessel for family cruising.

Its three contemporary ships,Pacific Dawn, Pacific JewelandPacific Sun,generally offer cruises from seven to 10 days. The ships are homeported from Sydney and Brisbane, Australia
and Auckland, New Zealand. In 2010, with the introduction of thePacific Jewel, P&O Cruises Australia will also start homeporting from Newcastle and Fremantle, Australia. These cruises enable guests to discover the islands of the
South Pacific from New Caledonia to Tahiti, as well as exploring Australia’s magnificent coast line, New Zealand and Asia.








Princess deploys bothSun PrincessandDawn Princessin the Australian market on
a year-round basis for cruises departing from the homeports of Fremantle, Melbourne and Sydney, Australia. Princess’ cruises visit the South Pacific islands, Australia, New Zealand and Asia; and generally range from 13 to 17 days, with one
world cruise of 104 days.



V.Asia

We began
sourcing passengers from China and the surrounding markets in 2006. In 2008, we carried approximately 19,000 Chinese guests on cruise vacations and in 2009 we carried 33,000 Chinese guests, a 74% increase. We source most of our Chinese
guests from the cities of Beijing and Shanghai and the province of Guangdong, which have a combined population of over 130 million. Tourism is one of the most rapidly growing sectors in the Chinese economy as Chinese discretionary income has
increased by a compound average growth rate of 10.4% over the last five years. More than 40 million Chinese tourists traveled abroad in 2007. This figure is forecast by us to increase to over 50 million by 2010. We believe
this market has significant cruise industry growth potential given its early stage of development, large population, easing of travel restrictions and expanding international tourist travel.

These ships are tailored to
the Chinese market, serving Chinese style food and beverages, offering mah-jongg tables in the casino and providing high-end well-known luxury brands in their retail shops. The Costa Asia product is unique, bringing a high European standard of
holiday cruising to Chinese and surrounding market guests in their own locality.



VI.South America

For
many years cruise vacations have been marketed in South America, principally to Brazilian and Argentinean-sourced passengers, although cruising as a vacation alternative remains in a relatively early stage of development in the region. Brazil
has a population of slightly under 200 million, and their discretionary incomes are expected to grow significantly in the future. Based on our internal estimates, approximately 380,000 Brazilians and Argentineans took a cruise vacation in
2008 and almost half of these guests sailed on a Carnival Corporation & plc brand, and we estimate 550,000 took a cruise vacation in 2009, which is approximately 5% of North America’s market penetration level. Accordingly, we
believe this region has significant cruise growth potential.






Cruises from South America typically occur during the Southern Hemisphere summer months of
November through March. For many years our presence was primarily through the Costa brand, which is operating three vessels in winter 2010 in this region, theCosta Concordia,Costa MagicaandCosta Victoria, totaling 7,608
lower berths. These ships depart from Santos and Rio de Janeiro, Brazil and Buenos Aires, Argentina; with itineraries that put the spotlight on discovering Northeast and Southern Brazil, Uruguay and Argentina. In addition, as previously
mentioned, Ibero has deployed three of its ships to Brazil from November 2009 to March 2010, offering eight different Brazilian coast itineraries from the homeports of Santos and Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.

(a)The expected service date is the month in which the ship is currently expected to begin its first revenue generating cruise. All of our ship construction contracts are
with the Fincantieri shipyards in Italy, except for AIDA’s which are with the Meyer Werft shipyard in Germany and Seabourn’s which are with the T. Mariotti shipyard in Italy.



VIII.Characteristics of the Cruise Vacation Industry



a.Exceptional Value Proposition

We believe that the cost to a guest for a cruise vacation represents an exceptional value in comparison to other comparable land-based vacations. This is especially true when considering that a
cruise provides its guests with transportation to various destinations, while also providing hotel accommodations, food and some entertainment for one all-inclusive, competitive price. In order to make cruising even more cost effective and more
easily accessible to our guests, we offer a number of drive-to-homeports, which reduces certain cruise guests’ overall vacation costs because the air transportation costs are eliminated.






b.Relatively Low Market Penetration Levels

Based on industry data, the 2008 annual penetration rate, computed based on the number of annual cruise passengers as a percentage of the total population, is 3.0% for North America, 2.4% in the UK, 0.9%
in continental Europe (continental Europe represents Germany, Italy, France, Spain and Portugal) and 1.3% for Australia and New Zealand. Only about 20% of the U.S. population, 9 to 10% of the UK population and 4 to 5% of the continental
European population have ever taken a cruise. In addition, Europeans have significantly more vacation days in a year than North Americans, which presents opportunities for increases in the European penetration levels as compared to the level in
North America.

Elsewhere in the world, such as Asia and South America, cruising is at an early stage of development and has
far lower penetration rates. However, there have been an increasing number of these relatively lower penetrated countries in the world where economic growth has fueled an increasing demand for vacations, including cruising.



c.Wide Appeal

Cruising appeals to a broad range of ages and income levels. The average age of a cruise guest in North America is 48 years old and we believe that it is a similar age for the rest of the world. However, cruising is designed to
provide something for every generation, from the youth clubs for four to five year olds to the elegance, style and sophistication of a bygone era provided to our more senior guests. Cruising also offers a very broad range of price points to
attract people from substantially all income levels. The range of pricing can vary from a three-day cruise from a local homeport in an inside state room on a contemporary line to a penthouse suite on a world cruise, on a premium or luxury line.



d.Positive Guest Demographics

The age of the U.S., Canadian and Western European populations is increasing, primarily as a result of the aging of the Baby-Boom generation and healthcare advancements. Therefore, between 2010 and 2020,
the number of people in the cruise industry’s primary age group of 45 years and older are expected to grow by 20 million, or 15%, in the U.S. and Canada, and 17 million, or 12%, in the major Western European countries. We believe
the cruise industry is well-positioned to take advantage of these favorable demographic trends impacting its major markets.



e.High Guest Satisfaction Rates

Cruise guests tend to rate their overall satisfaction with a cruise-based vacation higher than comparable land-based hotel and resort vacations. According to industry surveys, North American cruise guests
have a total satisfaction rating of 95%, with nearly 45% of cruise guests stating that they are extremely satisfied with the experience, which is defined in the surveys as the highest satisfaction rating of any vacation alternative they have
experienced. Based on our internal surveys our European cruise guests are very satisfied with their cruise vacations, which we believe is a very positive response to our European cruise offerings.



f.Favorable Supply Versus Demand Balance

Our current intention is to have an average of two to three new cruise ships enter service annually in 2012 and beyond, which is below our recent growth levels. In addition we believe that some of
our competitors will also be slowing down their future capacity growth, as evidenced by some recent cancellations of ship orders and the expiration of their options to purchase new ships. Moreover, due to the significant amount of capital
required to purchase a new cruise ship and the complexities surrounding their operation, the cruise industry has high barriers of entry. Based on the above factors, among others, we expect long-term cruise industry supply growth to slow, while
we expect demand to accelerate as global economies recover and emerging markets continue to develop. We believe this favorable supply versus demand balance will have positive impacts on our ability to profitably grow our business.






IX.Passengers, Capacity and Occupancy

Our cruise operations had worldwide cruise passengers, passenger capacity and occupancy as follows:



FiscalYearCruisePassengersPassengerCapacityOccupancy(a)20056,848,000136,960105.6%20067,008,000143,676106.0%20077,672,000158,352105.6%20088,183,000169,040105.7%20098,519,000180,746105.5%



(a)In accordance with cruise industry practice, occupancy is calculated using a denominator of two passengers per cabin even though some cabins can accommodate three or
more passengers. Percentages in excess of 100% indicate that on average more than two passengers occupied some cabins.

Our passenger capacity has grown from 136,960 berths at November 30, 2005 to 180,746 berths at November 30, 2009, primarily because of the deliveries of 18 new cruise ships during this four-year
period. See Part I, Item l. Business. B. “Cruise Operations – Ship Information” for additional information.

The occupancy level on our ships during each quarter indicated below was as follows:

X.Cruise Ship Construction and Cruise Port and Repair Facility Development and Operations

As of January 28, 2010, we had signed agreements with three shipyards providing for the construction of 13 additional cruise ships
scheduled to enter service between February 2010 and June 2012. These agreements cannot be cancelled by either party without cause, and such cancellation will subject the defaulting party to contractual liquidated damages. See Part I,
Item 1. Business. B. “Cruise Operations – Ship Information” and Note 6, “Commitments” to our Consolidated Financial Statements in Exhibit 13 to this Form 10-K for additional information regarding our ship commitments.

We are involved in the development of new or enhanced cruise port facilities. These facilities are expected to provide
our guests with an improved vacation experience. Our involvement is usually in cooperation with governmental entities and typically includes providing development and management expertise and financial commitments that are limited to long-term
port usage agreements. However, sometimes we provide direct financial support or develop the port infrastructure ourselves.

During 2009, we were in various stages of involvement with the development, enhancement and/or financing of government and privately-owned and operated cruise port facilities in Galveston, Texas; Miami, Florida; Marseilles, France; New York
City, New York; San Diego, California; San Juan, Puerto Rico; Southampton, England and St. Maarten, Netherlands Antilles. In addition, we currently operate or have interests in joint ventures that operate port facilities in Barcelona, Spain;
Civitavecchia, Italy; Cozumel, Mexico; Grand Turk, Turks and Caicos Islands; Hamburg, Germany; Juneau, Alaska; Long Beach, California; Naples, Italy; Roatán, Honduras and Savona, Italy.

We own a 40% interest in Grand Bahama Shipyard Ltd. (“GBSL”), which is the largest cruise ship dry-dock repair facility in the
world. Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. (“RCCL”), one of our cruise competitors, also owns a 40% interest and the Grand Bahama Port Authority owns 20%. We account for our investment using the equity method, and our total net
investment in and notes receivable from GBSL were $76 million at November 30, 2009. GBSL had an aggregate of $138 million of outstanding debt to RCCL and us and $5 million outstanding under a revolving credit facility at November 30,
2009. This repair facility, located in Freeport, Grand Bahama, has three dry-docks, which can accommodate ships up to 137,000 tons. During 2009, RCCL and our brands had an aggregate of 19 ships serviced at this facility. In addition,
unaffiliated cruise ships and other types of ships were worked on at this facility. GBSL generated total revenues of $125 million in 2009, the majority of which were derived from work on RCCL and our cruise ships.






XI.Cruise Pricing and Payment Terms

Each of our cruise brands publishes brochures with prices for the upcoming seasons. Brochure prices vary by cruise line, by category of cabin, by ship, by season and by itinerary. Brochure prices are
regularly discounted through early booking discount programs and other promotions. The cruise ticket price typically includes accommodations, most meals, some non-alcoholic beverages, and most onboard entertainment, such as the use of, or admission
to, a wide variety of activities and facilities, including a fully-equipped casino, nightclubs, theatrical shows, movies, parties, a disco, a jogging track, a health club, swimming pools, sun decks, whirlpools and saunas. Our brands’
payment terms generally require that a guest pay a deposit to confirm their reservation with the balance due before the departure date, although some of our European brands provide certain of their travel agents and tour operators with credit terms
even though these parties typically require the guest to pay for the entire cruise before sailing.

If our guests do not pay a
vacation protection premium for the ability to obtain a refund if they cancel their cruise within a pre-defined period before sailing, then they are subject to a cancellation fee, which we recognize in cruise passenger ticket revenues upon
cancellation. For those guests who pay a vacation protection premium for the ability to obtain a refund, they will receive all or a portion of their deposit back in accordance with the terms of the program, while we will recognize this premium in
other revenues.

Historically, our advance bookings have generally been taken from several months in advance of the departure
date for all contemporary brand sailings, to more than a year in advance for some of our luxury and European brand sailings. Generally, the longer the cruise itinerary the further in advance the bookings are made. This lead-time provides
us with more time to manage our prices in relation to demand for available cabins, with the goal of achieving higher overall net revenue yields (see “Key Performance Non-GAAP Financial Indicators” in our Management Discussion and Analysis
of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Exhibit 13 to this Form 10-K). In addition, some of our fares such as Carnival Cruise Lines’ Early Saver fares, Costa’s Pronto Price Savings fares and Holland America Line’s Early
Advantage and Mariner Savings fares are designed to encourage potential guests to book cruise reservations earlier. In addition, AIDA has a “JustAIDA” booking program that allows guests to make a reservation two to three months before
sailing, but the exact cruise ship and specific itinerary are not determined by AIDA until two weeks prior to sailing in order to help AIDA maximize their net revenue yields.

As a convenience to our guests, we offer to arrange air transportation to and from the port. When a guest elects to purchase air
transportation from us, both our revenues and expenses generally increase by approximately the same amount. Air transportation prices typically vary by gateway and destination. Over the last several years about 15% of our guests purchased air
transportation from us. We believe this relatively low percentage is partially a result of having embarkation points close to our guests’ homes and partially due to the wide availability of competitively priced air tickets sold by third
parties. In addition, for some of our European brands’ cruise itineraries we charter aircraft to facilitate our guests travel to distant locations.

In 2007, we introduced a fuel supplement across substantially all of our cruise brands, which resulted in an additional fee being charged to the guests on these brands, commencing for the most part with
cruises departing in early 2008. This temporary fuel supplement, which is included in cruise passenger ticket revenues, was introduced to partially offset a portion of the very high fuel costs we had been experiencing, and was usually charged on a
daily basis, with established total maximum amounts per passenger. As a result of fuel price declines in late 2008, substantially all of our brands no longer charge the fuel supplement. We reserve the right to reinstate our fuel supplements and
will continue to monitor our markets and review our position based upon the appropriate facts and circumstances.



XII.Onboard and Other Revenues

Onboard and other activities are provided either directly by us or by independent concessionaires, from which we receive either a percentage of their revenues or a fee. We earn onboard and other revenues from activities and services
not included in the cruise ticket price consisting of, but not limited to, bar and some beverage sales, shore excursions, casino gaming, gift shop sales, photo sales, spa services, internet services, cellular phone and telephone usage, art auctions,
bingo games and lottery tickets, enhanced dining experiences in alternative restaurants, onboard promotional advertising for merchants located at our ports of call, entertainment






arcades, 4D cinema, laundry services, Grand Prix simulators, libraries, ship tours, golf lessons, snorkel and bike equipment rentals, retail port facility rentals, training conference facilities
and video diaries.

Our casinos, which are operated directly by us, contain slot machines and a mix of gaming tables. The
casinos are only open when our ships are at sea in international waters or when otherwise specifically permitted by law.

Sales to our guests of shore excursions at each ship’s ports of call include, among other things, general sightseeing and adventure outings and local boat and beach parties, typically utilizing locally-owned operators. For the Holland
America Line, Princess and Carnival Cruise Lines ships sailing to destinations in Alaska, shore excursions are operated by Holland America Princess Alaska Tours, as well as locally-owned operators.

In conjunction with our cruise vacations, substantially all our cruise brands sell pre-and post-cruise land packages of one to four
nights. Vacation packages offered in conjunction with ships based in North America include nearby attractions or other vacation destinations, such as individual/multiple city tours of Boston, Massachusetts; New York City, New York; Seattle,
Washington; San Diego, California and Vancouver, British Columbia. Vacation packages offered in conjunction with ships based in Europe include stays in well-known European cities such as Athens, Greece; Barcelona, Spain; Copenhagen, Denmark; London,
England; Paris, France and Rome, Italy.

In conjunction with our Alaska cruise vacations, principally on our Holland America
Line, Princess and Carnival Cruise Lines ships, we sell pre-and post-cruise land packages, utilizing, to a large extent, our transportation and hotel assets, which revenues are included in our other segment.



XIII.Sales Relationships and Marketing Activities

We sell our cruises mainly through travel agents, including wholesalers and tour operators. Our individual cruise brands’ relationships with their travel agents are generally independent of each
of our other brands, except for certain brands sourcing UK and Australian guests as discussed below. These travel agent relationships are not exclusive and most travel agents also sell cruises and other vacations provided by our
competitors. We train and motivate travel agents to support our products with competitive sales and pricing policies and joint marketing programs. We also employ a wide variety of marketing techniques, including websites, seminars and
videos, to familiarize agents with our cruise brands and products. As with our brands’ travel agent relationships, each of our brands’ marketing programs are generally independent of each other. In each of our principal markets,
we have familiarized the travel agency community with our cruise brands and products.

Travel agents generally receive
standard commissions of 10%, plus the potential of additional commissions based on sales volume. During fiscal 2009, no controlled group of travel agencies accounted for 10% or more of our revenues.

We are a customer service-driven company and continue to invest in our service organization to assist travel agents and guests. We
believe that our support systems and infrastructure are among the strongest in the vacation industry. Our investment in customer service includes the development of employees and systems. We continually improve our systems within the
reservations and customer relationship management functions, emphasizing the continuing support of the travel agency community, while simultaneously developing greater contact and interactivity with our high-value guest base. Each brand has its
own website, which provides access to information about our products to users throughout the world, and substantially all provide booking engines to our travel partners and to our customers to enable them to more efficiently book our cruises, shore
excursions and, in some cases, other onboard activities. We also support booking capabilities through global distribution systems, including Amadeus, Travelport and SABRE. Although the vast majority of our cruises are distributed through
travel agents, we also accept telephone and internet bookings from customers who choose to contact us directly. Finally, as part of our effort to improve the embarkation process for our guests, as well as increase our efficiency, most of our
brands offer their guests the ability to generate their own electronic ticket documents via their websites.

Nieuw Amsterdam






To further stimulate demand, we offer a number of homeports that are closer to guests’
homes as this enables certain guests to lower the price of their cruise vacation by substantially reducing or eliminating the cost of air travel to and from the port.

In the UK and Australia we have formed a sales alliance known as the “Complete Cruise Solution,” whereby our UK and Australian sales forces and back-office operations are able to provide their
travel agents with one-stop cruise shopping for a number of our brands. In North America and the UK, we also raise consumer and travel agent awareness through the “World’s Leading Cruise Lines” alliances for our families of North
American and UK cruise brands. Finally, most of our cruise brands offer their own past guest recognition programs, such as Princess’ “Captain’s Circle”, Costa’s “CostaClub” or Holland America Line’s
“Mariner Society,” through which they reward repeat guests with special incentives such as discounted fares, expedited ship embarkation and disembarkation and onboard activities.



XIV.Seasonality

Our
revenues from the sale of passenger tickets are seasonal. Historically, demand for cruises has been greatest during our third fiscal quarter, which includes the Northern Hemisphere summer months. This higher demand during the third quarter
results in higher net revenue yields and, accordingly, the largest share of our net income is earned during this period. The seasonality of our results is increased due to ships being taken out of service for maintenance, which we schedule during
non-peak demand periods. In addition, substantially all of Holland America Princess Alaska Tours’ revenues and net income is generated from May through September in conjunction with the Alaska cruise season.



XV.Competition

We
compete with land-based vacation alternatives throughout the world, including, among others, hotels, resorts (including all-inclusives), theme parks, organized tours, land-based casino operations and vacation ownership properties located in Las
Vegas, Nevada, Orlando, Florida, the Caribbean (including the Bahamas), France, Dubai, Canary Islands and various Mediterranean, Mexican, and Hawaiian Island destinations, as well as numerous other vacation choices throughout the world.

Our primary cruise competitors for North American-sourced guests are RCCL, which owns Royal Caribbean International (“RCI”),
Celebrity Cruises (“Celebrity”) and Azamara Club Cruises; Norwegian Cruise Line (“NCL”), Oceania Cruises and Regent Seven Seas Cruises, all three of which are controlled by Apollo Management LP; Disney Cruise Line
(“Disney”), MSC Cruises (“MSC”), Crystal Cruises, Silversea Cruises and Windstar Cruises.

Our primary
cruise competitors for European-sourced guests in the UK are RCI, Celebrity, NCL, MSC, Thomson Cruises, which is owned by TUI AG (“TUI”); Fred Olsen Cruise Lines and Saga Cruises; and in continental Europe they are MSC, Louis Cruise Line,
and CDF Croisieres de France, Pullmantur and RCI, all three owned by RCCL; TUI Cruises, which is jointly owned by RCCL and TUI; Hapag-Lloyd, which is also owned by TUI; and Phoenix Reisen. We also compete for guests throughout Europe with other
North American cruise competitors, including Celebrity, Disney and NCL.

Our primary cruise competitors for guests sourced
from other parts of the world, such as Australia, New Zealand, Asia and South America, are RCI, Celebrity, Pullmantur, Star Cruises, NCL, CVC Cruise and MSC.

Our North American, European and Australian brands also compete among themselves for guests.






XVI.Governmental Regulations



a.Maritime Regulations



1.General

Our ships
are regulated by various international, national, state and local laws, regulations and treaties in force in the jurisdictions in which our ships operate. Our ships, which are registered in the Bahamas, Bermuda, Italy, the Netherlands, Panama,
Portugal and the UK, are regulated by these jurisdictions and are required to comply with the international conventions that govern the safety of our ships, guests and crew and the protection of the environment. Each country of registry
conducts periodic inspections to verify compliance with these regulations as discussed more fully below. In addition, the regulations of the European Union (“EU”), the U.S. and the many other international ports that our ships visit
apply to some aspects of our ship operations.

Our ships are subject to annual, intermediate, dry-docking and class renewal
surveys by ship classification societies. These surveys ensure that our ships comply with international conventions adopted by the countries of registry and domestic rules and regulations, and verify that our ships have been maintained in accordance
with the rules of the classification society and that recommended repairs have been satisfactorily completed.

Our ships are
subject to inspection by the port regulatory authorities in the various countries that they visit. Such inspections include verification of compliance with the maritime safety, security, environmental, customs, immigration, health and labor
regulations applicable to each port. For example, in U.S. ports these authorities include the U.S. Coast Guard and U.S. Customs and Border Protection. In EU ports, the Paris Memorandum of Understanding enforces internationally accepted
conventions through Port State Control Inspections by 27 Marine Administrations. In UK ports, these authorities include the Maritime & Coastguard Agency, TRANSEC and the Port Health Authority.

We believe maritime safety, security, environmental, health and labor issues will continue to be areas of focus by relevant government
authorities in the U.S., the EU and elsewhere where our cruise ships operate. Legislation, regulations or treaties, or changes thereto, in these areas could impact our operations and have and will likely subject us to increasing compliance
costs in the future.



2.Maritime Safety Regulations

The International Maritime Organization (“IMO”), a specialized agency of the United Nations, has adopted safety standards as part of the International Convention for Safety of Life at Sea
(“SOLAS”), which apply to all of our ships. Among other things, SOLAS establishes requirements for vessel design, structural features, materials, construction, life saving equipment, safe management and operation and security in order to
help ensure guest and crew safety and security. SOLAS requirements are periodically revised for both new and existing ships. One significant set of modifications entered into force in 2010 that requires all existing passenger ships to comply with
current standards regarding fire safety. Our existing fleet is compliant with these 2010 requirements.

In 1993, SOLAS was
amended to incorporate the International Safety Management Code (“ISM Code”), which provides an international standard for the safe management and operation of ships and for pollution prevention. The ISM Code is mandatory for passenger
vessel operators. All of our operations and ships are regularly audited by national authorities and maintain the required certificates of compliance with the ISM Code. National authorities, acting under the provisions of the international agreements
related to Port State Control, regularly inspect our ships when they are in that nation’s waters.

In 2004, the
IMO’s Maritime Safety Committee approved amended SOLAS requirements related to the damage stability of new passenger cruise vessels. These regulations, which were adopted in May 2005, apply to vessels whose keels were laid after January 1,
2009, and thus do not affect our existing fleet or our vessels currently under contract. For vessels with keels laid after January 1, 2009, compliance with these standards require the development of new designs. The Maritime Safety
Committee also amended SOLAS to require new passenger cruise vessels whose keels are laid after July 1, 2010, to comply with the “safe return to port” requirements, which relate to the development of vessel survivability standards,
and will also require the development of new ship designs. Compliance with both these regulations is not expected to result in significant cost increases.






3.Maritime Security Regulations

Our ships are subject to various security requirements, including the International Ship and Port Facility Security Code (“ISPS Code”), which is part of SOLAS. Among other things, the ISPS Code
requires vessel owners to implement security measures, conduct vessel security assessments, and develop security plans. Under these requirements, we have prepared and submitted security plans for all our ships to their respective countries of
registry, and International Ship Security Certificates have been issued demonstrating compliance with the ISPS Code.

The U.S.
Maritime Transportation Security Act of 2002 (“MTSA”) is the governing regulation for ships that operate in U.S. ports. MTSA establishes Area Maritime Security requirements for port areas that provide authority for the U.S. Coast Guard to
implement operational and physical security measures on a port area basis that could affect our operation in those areas.



4.Maritime Environmental Regulations

We are subject to numerous international, national, state and local environmental laws, regulations and treaties that govern, among other things, air emissions, waste discharge, water management and
disposal, and the storage, handling, use and disposal of hazardous substances, such as chemicals, solvents, paints and asbestos. We are committed to helping to preserve the environment, not only because of the existing legal requirements, but
because a pristine environment is one of the key elements that bring our guests on board our ships.

If we violate or fail to
comply with environmental legislation, regulations or treaties, we could be fined or otherwise sanctioned by regulators. We have made, and will continue to make, capital and other expenditures to comply with environmental legislation, regulations
and treaties.

See Part I, Item 1A. “Risk Factors.” for additional discussion of our environmental risks.



i.International Regulations

The most important environmental convention governing ships is the IMO International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships (“MARPOL”). This convention applies to all of our ships and includes requirements
designed to prevent and minimize both accidental and operational pollution by oil, sewage, garbage and air emissions. All of our ships must carry an International Oil Pollution Prevention Certificate, an International Sewage Pollution
Prevention Certificate, and an International Air Pollution Prevention Certificate. These certificates are issued by the ship’s state of registry indicating that our ships are operating in compliance with the MARPOL regulations regarding oil,
sewage and air pollution prevention.

Many countries have ratified and adopted IMO Conventions which, among other things,
impose liability for pollution damage, subject to defenses and to monetary limits, which monetary limits do not apply where the spill is caused by the owner’s actual fault or by the owner’s intentional or reckless conduct. In
jurisdictions that have not adopted the IMO Conventions, various national, regional or local laws and regulations have been established to address oil and waste pollution.

The International Organization for Standardization (“ISO”) is an international standard-setting body which produces worldwide
industrial and commercial standards. ISO 14001, an environmental management standard that was developed to help organizations manage their processes, products and services to minimize environmental impacts, presents a structured approach to
setting environmental objectives and targets. It provides a framework for any organization to apply these broad conceptual tools to their own processes. During 2006, we completed corporate-wide implementation of ISO 14001. The
environmental management systems of all of our cruise brands are certified in accordance with ISO 14001, with the exception of Ibero, which became fully owned in July 2009. Ibero is currently developing plans to certify its environmental
management systems in the near term.






ii.U.S. Federal and State Regulations

The U.S. Act to Prevent Pollution from Ships, implementing the MARPOL convention, provides for severe civil and criminal penalties related to ship-generated pollution for incidents in U.S. waters within
three nautical miles and in some cases in the 200-mile exclusive economic zone.

The U.S. Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (the
“OPA 90”) provides for strict liability for water pollution, such as oil pollution or possible oil pollution incidents in the 200-mile exclusive economic zone of the U.S., subject to defined monetary limits. OPA 90 requires that, in
order for us to operate in U.S. waters, we must obtain Certificates of Financial Responsibility from the U.S. Coast Guard for each of our ships operating in U.S. waters. These certificates demonstrate our ability to meet the maximum amount of
liability that our ships could be subject to for removal costs and damages related to water pollution, such as from an oil spill or a release of a hazardous substance, up to each ship’s statutory liability limit. Our financial
responsibility under these certificates is supported by certain of our insurers who provide guarantees aggregating $1.1 billion.

Most U.S. states that border navigable waterways or seacoasts have also enacted environmental regulations that impose strict liability for removal costs and damages resulting from a discharge of oil or a release of a hazardous substance.
These laws may be more stringent than U.S. federal law and in some cases have no statutory limits of liability.

In connection
with certain of our Alaska cruise operations, Holland America Line, Princess and Carnival Cruise Lines rely on concession permits from the U.S. National Park Service (“NPS”) to operate their cruise ships in Glacier Bay National Park and
Preserve. Such permits must be periodically renewed. We cannot be certain that they will continue to be renewed or that regulations relating to the renewal of such permits, including preference or historical rights, will remain unchanged in the
future. In January 2009, the NPS renewed our permits through the 2019 Alaska cruise season.

The state of Alaska enacted
legislation which prohibits certain discharges in designated Alaskan waters, ports or near shorelines and requires that certain discharges be monitored to verify compliance with the standards established by the legislation. Both the state and
federal environmental regimes in Alaska are more stringent than the federal regime under the Federal Water Pollution Control Act with regard to discharge from vessels. The legislation also provides that repeat violators of the regulations could
be prohibited from operating in Alaskan waters.



iii.EU Regulations

In
the past 30 years the EU has adopted a substantial and diverse range of environmental measures aimed at improving the quality of the environment for European citizens and providing them with a high quality of life. To support the implementation
and enforcement of Community environmental legislation, the Community has adopted directives on environmental liability and enforcement and a recommendation providing for minimum criteria for environmental inspections.

In November 2002, the European Commission adopted a European Union strategy to reduce atmospheric emissions from seagoing ships. The
strategy reports on the magnitude and impact of ship emissions in the EU and sets out a number of actions to reduce ship emissions. The EU strategy seeks to implement the Sulfur Oxide (“SOx”) Emission Control Areas set out in MARPOL
Annex VI, and to press for tighter Nitrogen Oxide (“NOx”) standards. The Commission also urges Member States to ratify MARPOL Annex VI.

The EU continues to pursue an aggressive policy towards environmental protection and we can expect to see legislation being implemented in the near future related to waste water discharges in the Baltic
Sea and greenhouse gas reduction.



iv.Low Sulfur Fuel Regulations

Limitations on the sulfur content of fuel are part of regulations approved as part of MARPOL Annex VI. MARPOL Annex VI calls on the IMO to monitor the worldwide average sulfur content of fuel oil
supplied for use aboard vessels.

In 2008, MARPOL Annex VI was amended to require additional reductions in sulfur emissions by
reducing the sulfur content requirements for fuel oil. As part of these new requirements, the concept of Emission Control Areas (“ECAs”) was established with stricter limitations on sulfur emissions in these areas. Currently
there are two ECAs in operation,






one in the Baltic Sea and the other in the North Sea/English Channel. Specifically, from July 1, 2010, ships operating in ECAs will have to reduce their fuel sulfur content from the
current 1.5% to 1.0%, and from January 1, 2015 and thereafter it will be further reduced to 0.1%. Compliance with these requirements in the existing ECAs has increased our fuel costs and, beginning July 1, 2010 will further increase
our fuel costs, however, we do not expect that this increase will be significant.

On January 1, 2010, an EU directive
became effective that requires the use of 0.1% sulfur content in all marine fuels used while ships are at berth or anchored in EU ports. This requires the use of distillate fuels, such as marine gas oil, further increasing fuel
costs. However, the impact of compliance with this directive is not expected to be significant.

Global sulfur fuel
content limits are currently 4.5% and are required to be reduced by these 2008 MARPOL regulations to 3.5% by January 1, 2012, which will not have a significant impact on our fuel costs.

The U.S. and Canada have applied to the IMO for an ECA out to 200 nautical miles on their east, west and gulf coasts, as well as the
Hawaiian Islands, all of which could be in force by 2012. Additional ECAs may also be established in the future, such as for areas around the Bahamas, Mexico, Norway and in the Mediterranean. Compliance in this proposed U.S. and Canadian
ECA with the 1.0% low sulfur content requirement will increase our fuel costs in 2012 and beyond. Based on current itineraries, fuel prices and technologies and our 2010 capacities and fuel consumption, we estimate that the implementation of
the proposed U.S. and Canadian ECA would increase our annual fuel costs by approximately $50 million to $70 million.

Commencing in 2015, based on current itineraries, fuel prices and technologies and our estimated 2010 capacities and fuel consumption, we estimate that the implementation of the 0.1% low sulfur content requirement in the two existing ECAs
and the proposed U.S. and Canadian ECA would additionally increase our annual fuel costs by approximately $100 million to $130 million.

Global sulfur fuel content limits, excluding the ECA limits that will remain at 0.1%, will be reduced to 0.5% by January 1, 2020, subject to a feasibility review to be completed no later than
2018. If this reduction is implemented in 2020 it will significantly increase our fuel costs. However, the amount of such increases in 2020 and thereafter is not reasonably determinable at this time, given the length of time until such
possible implementation date and other mitigating factors discussed below.

The cost impacts from implementing progressively
lower sulfur content requirements globally and in ECAs may be mitigated by, among other things, the favorable impact of future changes in the supply and demand balance for marine and other fuels, future developments of and investments in sulfur
emission abatement and propulsion technologies, including more advanced engines and enhanced exhaust gas treatment systems, and new fuel conservation initiatives.



5.Maritime Health Regulations

We are committed to providing a healthy environment for all of our guests and crew. We voluntarily work with public health agencies throughout the world to monitor health and sanitary conditions on
all of our ships. As an example, for ships visiting U.S. ports we collaborate with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (“CDC”) - Vessel Sanitation Program of the Department of Health and Human Services. The CDC
established the Vessel Sanitation Program (“VSP”) in the early 1970s as a cooperative activity with the cruise industry.

We maintain frequent communication with the appropriate public health authorities and, as required, proactively report any communicable illnesses that are of public health concern. Through our collaborative efforts we work with the
authorities to develop and revise guidelines, review plans and conduct on-site inspections for all newbuilds and significant existing ship renovations. In addition, we continue to maintain our ships by meeting, and often exceeding, applicable
public health guidelines and requirements, complying with inspections, and conducting crew training and guest education programs regularly throughout the life of the ship.

See “Maritime Labor Regulations” below for additional discussion of health regulations.






6.Maritime Labor Regulations

In 2006, the International Labour Organization (“ILO”), an agency of the United Nations that develops and oversees international labor standards, adopted a new Consolidated Maritime Labour Convention (“MLC
2006”). MLC 2006 contains a comprehensive set of global standards based on those that are already found in 68 maritime labor Conventions and Recommendations adopted by the ILO since 1920. It brings almost all of these Conventions and
Recommendations together in a single new Convention that uses a new format with some updating, where necessary, to reflect modern conditions and language. MLC 2006 includes a broad range of requirements in areas such as the definition of a
seafarer, minimum age of seafarers, medical certificates, recruitment practices, training, repatriation, recreational facilities, health and welfare, hours of work and rest, accommodations and wages and entitlements. While many of the practices
were widely adhered to by ships registered in different countries, MLC 2006 will add requirements not previously in effect, particularly in the area of occupational safety and health. The detailed requirements of MLC 2006 directly address many
seafarers’ issues and, therefore, if effectively implemented will provide worldwide standards to improve the health, safety and status of seafarers.

Thirty member countries representing 33% of the world’s merchant ship tonnage are required to ratify the MLC 2006 before it goes into effect 12 months after such ratification. We currently
expect ratification in late 2010, and entry into force, requiring our implementation in late 2011 or early 2012. Implementation may increase our crew and newbuilding costs. However, the amount of such increase is not determinable at this
time since the enacting countries’ legislation has not yet been published to enable us to determine the impact of compliance.



b.Consumer Regulations

Our ships that call on U.S. ports are regulated by the Federal Maritime Commission (“FMC”). Public Law 89-777, which is administered by the FMC, requires most cruise line operators who embark guests in U.S. ports to establish
financial responsibility for their liability to passengers for non-performance of transportation, for personal injury and for loss of life. The FMC’s regulations require that a cruise line demonstrate its financial responsibility for
non-performance of transportation through a guarantee, escrow arrangement, surety bond or insurance. Currently, the amount required must equal 110% of the cruise line’s highest amount of customer deposits over a two-year period, up to a
maximum coverage level of $15 million. In order to comply with this requirement, we have an aggregate of $90 million of guarantees provided by some of our insurers. Our Protection and Indemnity (“P&I”) coverages are used to
establish our financial responsibility for personal injury and loss of life.

In the UK, in some cases we are currently
required to obtain licenses from and post bonds with various organizations in connection with the conduct of our business and our ability to meet our liabilities in the event of non-performance of obligations to consumers. The most significant
requirement relates to Abta, which requires us to maintain approximately $130 million of sterling-denominated bonds to cover our brands’ UK passenger deposit liabilities.

We are also required by German and French law to obtain a guarantee from a reputable insurance company to ensure that, in case of
insolvency, our customers will be refunded any monies they have paid on account of a booking and, in addition, that they will be repatriated without additional cost if insolvency occurs after a cruise starts. Additionally, in Australia we are a
member of the Travel Compensation Fund which provides compensation, as a last resort, to consumers who suffer losses in their dealings with travel agents. Finally, other jurisdictions may require the establishment of financial responsibility
for passengers from their jurisdictions.



XVII.Financial Information

For financial information about our cruise reporting segment and geographic information with respect to each of the three years in the period ended November 30, 2009, see Note 11, “Segment Information” to our Consolidated
Financial Statements in Exhibit 13 to this Form 10-K.



C.Employees

Our
shoreside operations have approximately 10,600 full-time and 4,200 part-time/seasonal employees. We also employ approximately 70,000 crew, including officers, onboard our 93 ships at any one time. Due to the highly seasonal nature of our
Alaskan and Canadian operations, Holland America Princess Alaska Tours increases its work force during






the late spring and summer months in connection with the Alaskan cruise season, employing additional seasonal personnel, which have been included above. We have entered into agreements with
unions covering certain employees in our hotel, transportation and shipboard operations. We consider our employee and union relations generally to be good.

We source our shipboard officers primarily from Italy, the UK, Holland, Germany and Norway. The remaining crew positions are manned by persons from around the world. We utilize various manning
agencies in many countries and regions to help secure our shipboard employees.



D.Suppliers

Our
largest purchases are for fuel, travel agency services, food and beverages, airfare, port facility utilization, repairs and maintenance, including dry-docking, advertising and marketing, hotel and restaurant products and supplies, communication
services and for the construction and refurbishment of our ships. Although we utilize a select number of suppliers for most of our food and beverages, communication services, air transportation services and hotel and restaurant products and
supplies, most of these products and services are available from multiple sources at competitive prices. The use of a select number of suppliers enables us to, among other things, obtain volume discounts. We purchase fuel and port facility
services at some of our ports of call from a limited number of suppliers. In addition, we perform our major dry-dock and ship improvement work at a limited number of dry-dock facilities in Australia, British Columbia, Canada, the Caribbean
(including the Bahamas), Europe, Singapore, and the U.S. Finally, as of January 28, 2010, we have agreements in place for the construction of 13 cruise ships with three shipyards. We believe there are sufficient dry-dock and shipbuilding
facilities to meet our anticipated repair, maintenance, refurbishment and newbuild requirements.



E.Insurance



I.General

We
maintain insurance to cover a number of risks associated with owning and operating our vessels and other non-ship related risks. All such insurance policies are subject to coverage limits, exclusions and deductible levels. Insurance
premium increases are dependent on our own loss experience and the general premium requirements of our insurers. We cannot be certain that affordable and viable direct and reinsurance markets will be available to us in the future. We maintain
certain levels of self-insurance for all the below-mentioned coverages, some of which have increased in recent years, and we may increase our self-insurance levels further in the future to mitigate premium increases. We do not carry coverage
related to loss of earnings or revenues from our ships or other operations.



II.P&I Coverages

Third-party liabilities in connection with our cruise activities are covered by entry in P&I clubs, which are mutual indemnity associations owned by ship owners. Our vessels are entered in two P&I clubs; Standard Steamship
Owners’ Protection and Indemnity Association (Europe) Ltd. and The Steamship Mutual Underwriting Association (Bermuda) Limited. The P&I clubs in which we participate are part of a worldwide group of P&I clubs, known as the International
Group of P&I Clubs (the “IG”). The IG insures directly, and through reinsurance markets, a large portion of the world’s shipping fleets. Coverage is subject to the P&I clubs’ rules and the limit of coverage is
determined by the IG. P&I coverage includes legal, statutory or pre-approved contract liabilities and other expenses related to crew, guests and other third parties. This coverage also includes shipwreck removal, pollution and damage to
third party property.



III.Hull and Machinery Insurance

We maintain insurance on the hull and machinery of each of our ships in amounts equal to the estimated value of each ship. The coverage for hull and machinery is provided by international marine
insurers. Most insurers make it a condition for insurance coverage that a ship be certified as “in class” by a classification society that is a member of the International Association of Classification Societies
(“IACS”). All of our ships have been certified within the last twelve months to be in class by an IACS member.






IV.War Risk Insurance

We maintain war risk insurance coverage for legal liability to crew, guests and other third parties as well as loss or damage to our vessels arising from war or war-like actions, including terrorist incidents. Items excluded from this
coverage are claims arising from chemical, nuclear and biological attacks. War risk insurance coverage is provided by international marine insurers and Mutual War Risk Clubs. In addition, excess war risk insurance is provided by our two P&I
clubs for all our ships. Under the terms of our war risk insurance coverage, which is typical for war risk policies in the marine industry, insurers can give seven days notice to the insured that the liability and physical damage policies can
be cancelled. However, the policy can be reinstated at different premium rates. This gives insurers the ability to increase our premiums following events that they determine have increased their risk.



V.Other Insurance

We have standard property and casualty insurance coverage for certain shoreside assets and liabilities to third parties, including our tour business, shoreside and certain port facility assets, as well as workers’ compensation and
employee health insurance coverages.



F.Trademarks and Other Intellectual Property

We own and have registered or licensed, numerous trademarks and domain names, which we believe are widely recognized throughout the world and have considerable value. These intangible assets enable
us to distinguish our cruise product, ships and programs from those of our competitors. Our trademarks include the trade names of our cruise lines, each of which we believe is a widely-recognized brand in the cruise vacation industry, as well
as our ship names and a wide variety of cruise services and products. We have entered into licenses, including a license to use the P&O name, the P&O flag and other relevant trademarks and domain names in relation to cruising and
related activities. We also have a license to use the “Love Boat”name and related marks. See Note 10, “Fair Value Measurements, Derivatives Instruments and Hedging Activities” to our Consolidated Financial Statements
and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Critical Accounting Estimates – Asset Impairments” in Exhibit 13 to this Form 10-K for additional discussion of our trademarks.



G.Taxation



I.U.S. Federal Income Tax

We are primarily foreign corporations engaged in the business of operating passenger vessels in international transportation. We also own and operate, among other businesses, the hotel, transportation and tour business of Holland
America Princess Alaska Tours through U.S. corporations. See Part I, Item 1A. “Risk Factors.”

Our North
American passenger vessel business and certain ship-owning subsidiaries are engaged in a trade or business within the U.S. Depending on the itinerary of any particular vessel, that vessel may generate income from sources within the U.S. We
believe that under Section 883 of the Internal Revenue Code and applicable income tax treaties, our U.S. source income and the income of our ship-owning subsidiaries, to the extent derived from or incidental to the international operation of a
ship or ships, is currently exempt from U.S. federal income tax. Regulations under Section 883 list items that the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) does not consider to be incidental to ship operations. Among the items identified
as not incidental are income from the sale of air transportation, shore excursions and pre-and post-cruise land packages to the extent earned from sources within the U.S.

Our domestic U.S. operations, principally the hotel, transportation and tour business of Holland America Princess Alaska Tours, are subject to normal state and federal income taxation in the U.S.



a.Application of Section 883 of the Internal Revenue Code

In general, under Section 883, certain non-U.S. corporations are not subject to U.S. federal income tax or branch profits tax on U.S. source income derived from, or incidental to, the international
operation of a ship or ships. Applicable U.S. Treasury regulations provide, in general that a foreign corporation will qualify for the benefits of Section 883 if, in relevant part, (i) the foreign country in which the foreign
corporation is organized grants an equivalent exemption to corporations organized in the U.S. and (ii) the foreign corporation meets a defined publicly-traded test. In addition, to the extent a foreign corporation’s shares are owned
by a direct or indirect parent corporation which itself meets the publicly-traded test, then such subsidiary will be deemed owned by individuals resident in the country of incorporation of such parent corporation and the subsidiary will satisfy the
applicable stock ownership requirements in lieu of the publicly-traded test.






We believe that Panama is an equivalent exemption jurisdiction and Carnival Corporation
currently qualifies as a publicly traded corporation under the regulations and substantially all of its income, with the exceptions noted above under “U.S. Federal Income Tax,” will continue to be exempt from U.S. federal income
taxes. If, in the future, Panama no longer qualified as an equivalent exemption jurisdiction or Carnival Corporation were to fail to qualify as a publicly traded corporation, it and all of its ship-owning or operating subsidiaries that rely on
Section 883 for exempting cruise operations income would be subject to U.S. federal income tax on their U.S. source cruise operation income. In such event, the net income of Carnival Corporation’s ship-owning or operating subsidiaries
would be materially reduced.

Although the above represents our interpretation of this Internal Revenue Code provision and the
U.S. Treasury regulations, the IRS’s interpretation of these provisions could differ materially. In addition, provisions of the Internal Revenue Code including Section 883, are subject to change at any time by legislation. Moreover,
changes could occur in the future with respect to the trading volume or trading frequency of Carnival Corporation shares or with respect to the identity, residence, or holdings of Carnival Corporation’s direct or indirect shareholders that
could affect Carnival Corporation’s and its subsidiaries eligibility for the Section 883 exemption. Accordingly, it is possible that Carnival Corporation and its ship-owning or operating subsidiaries’ whose tax exemption is based
on Section 883 could lose this exemption. If Carnival Corporation and/or its ship-owning or operating subsidiaries were not entitled to the benefit of Section 883, Carnival Corporation and/or its ship-owning or operating subsidiaries
would be subject to U.S. federal income and branch taxation on a portion of its income resulting in higher than normal tax rates.



b.Exemption Under Applicable Income Tax Treaties

We believe that the U.S. source transportation income earned by Carnival plc and its UK and Italian resident subsidiaries currently qualify for exemption from U.S. federal income tax under applicable
bilateral U.S. income tax treaties. There is, however, no authority that directly addresses the effect, if any, of DLC arrangements on the availability of benefits under the treaties and, consequently, the matter is not free from
doubt. These treaties may be revoked by either applicable country, replaced or modified with new agreements that treat income from international operation of ships differently than under the agreements currently in force. If any of our
subsidiaries that currently claim exemption from U.S. income taxation on their U.S. source shipping income under an applicable treaty do not qualify for benefits under the existing treaties, or if the existing treaties are revoked, replaced or
materially modified in a manner adverse to our interests and, with respect to U.S. federal income tax only, if any such subsidiary does not qualify for exemption under Section 883, such ship-owning or operating subsidiary may be subject to U.S.
federal income taxation on a portion of its income.



c.Taxation in the Absence of an Exemption under Section 883 or any Applicable U.S. Income Tax Treaty

Shipping income that is attributable to transportation of passengers which begins or ends in the U.S. is considered to be 50% derived from
U.S. sources. Shipping income that is attributable to transportation of passengers which begins and ends in foreign countries is considered 100% derived from foreign sources. Shipping income that is attributable to the transportation of
passengers which begins and ends in the U.S. without stopping at an intermediate foreign port is considered to be 100% derived from U.S. sources.

The legislative history of the transportation income source rules suggests that a cruise that begins and ends in a U.S. port, but that calls on more than one foreign port, will derive U.S. source income
only from the first and last legs of the cruise. Because there are no regulations or other IRS interpretations of these rules, the applicability of the transportation income source rules in the aforesaid manner is not free from doubt.

In the absence of an exemption under Section 883 or any applicable U.S. income tax treaty, as appropriate, we and/or our
subsidiaries would be subject to either the net income and branch profits tax regimes of Section 882 and Section 884 of the Internal Revenue Code (collectively the “net tax regime”) or the four percent of gross income tax regime
of Section 887 of the Internal Revenue Code (the “four percent tax regime”).






Where the relevant foreign corporation has, or is considered to have, a fixed place of
business in the U.S. that is involved in the earning of U.S. source shipping income and substantially all of this shipping income is attributable to regularly scheduled transportation, the net tax regime is applicable. If the foreign corporation
does not have a fixed place of business in the U.S. or substantially all of its income is not derived from regularly scheduled transportation, the four percent tax regime will apply.

The net tax regime should be the tax regime applied to Carnival Corporation and its vessel owning subsidiaries based in the U.S. in the
absence of an exemption under Section 883. Under the net tax regime, U.S. source shipping income, net of applicable deductions, would currently be subject to a federal corporate income tax of up to 35% and state income taxes at varying rates;
and the net after-tax income would be potentially subject to a further branch tax of 30%. In addition, interest paid by the corporations, if any, would generally be subject to a branch interest tax.

The four percent tax regime should be the tax regime applicable to our vessel owning subsidiaries based outside the U.S. in the absence of
an exemption under Section 883 or any applicable U.S. income tax treaty. Under the four percent tax regime, gross U.S. source shipping income would be subject to a four percent tax, without the benefit of deductions.



II.UK and Australian Income Tax

Cunard, Ocean Village, P&O Cruises and P&O Cruises Australia have all elected to enter the UK tonnage tax regime. Companies to which the tonnage tax regime applies pay corporation tax on
profit calculated by reference to the net tonnage of qualifying vessels. UK corporation tax is not chargeable under the normal UK tax rules on these brands’ relevant shipping income. Relevant shipping income includes income from the
operation of qualifying ships and from shipping related activities. It also includes dividends from foreign companies, which are subject to a tax on profits in their country of residence or elsewhere and the activities of which broadly would
qualify in full for the UK tonnage tax regime if they were UK resident.

For a company to be eligible for the regime, it must
be subject to UK corporation tax and, among other matters, operate qualifying ships that are strategically and commercially managed in the UK. There is also a seafarer training requirement to which the UK tonnage tax companies are subject.

Our UK non-shipping activities that do not qualify under the UK tonnage tax regime, which are not currently or forecast to be
significant, remain subject to normal UK corporation tax.

P&O Cruises Australia is a division of Carnival plc, and the
shipping profit income from this operation is subject to UK tonnage tax as discussed above. Substantially all of this operation’s income is exempt from Australian corporation taxes by virtue of the UK/Australian income tax treaty.



III.Italian, German, Portuguese and Spanish Income Tax

Carnival plc’s German and Spanish brands, AIDA and Ibero, are both subsidiaries of Costa. Effective through fiscal 2014, Costa is entered into the Italian Tonnage Tax regime. This regime
taxes Costa’s, AIDA’s and Ibero’s shipping profits, as defined and which is substantially all of their income, calculated by reference to the net tonnage of their qualifying vessels.

Most of Costa’s and AIDA’s income, and Ibero’s income through 2009, not considered to be shipping profits for Italian Tonnage
Tax purposes, will be taxed under the Italian tax regime for Costa’s, AIDA’s and Ibero’s Italian-registered ships. The majority of AIDA’s profits are exempt from German corporation taxes by virtue of the Italy/Germany income
tax treaty.

All of Ibero’s vessels are registered in Portugal. Provided certain local employment requirements are
satisfied, beginning in 2010 most of Ibero’s income not considered to be shipping profits for Italian Tonnage Tax purposes will be exempt from Portuguese income tax through 2011 and thereafter and will be subject to a favorable Portuguese
income tax regime at a lower than normal rate through 2020. Ibero’s Spanish operations are minimal and, therefore, its Spanish income taxes are minimal.






IV.U.S. State Income Taxes

In addition to the U.S. federal income and branch level taxes discussed above, Carnival Corporation and Carnival plc and certain of its affiliates are subject to various U.S. state income taxes generally imposed on each state’s portion
of the U.S. source income subject to U.S. federal income taxes. However, the state of Alaska imposes an income tax on its allocated portion of the total income of our companies doing business in Alaska and certain of their affiliates.
