Business Strategy and Competitive Environment

﻿

Schwab was founded on the belief that average Americans deserve access to a better investing experience. Although much has changed in the intervening years, the Company’s purpose remains clear – to champion every client’s goals with passion and integrity. Guided by this purpose and the aspiration of creating the most trusted leader in investment services, management has adopted a strategy described as “Through Clients’ Eyes.”

﻿

Under this approach, the Company’s strategic goals are focused on putting clients’ perspectives, needs,and desires at the forefront. Because investing plays a fundamental role in building financial security, the Company strives to deliver a better investing experience for its clients – individual investors and the people and institutions who serve them – by disrupting longstanding industry practices on their behalf and providing superior service. The Company aims to offer a broad range of products and solutions to meet client needs with a focus on transparency and value. In addition, management works tocouplethe Company’s scale and resourceswith ongoingexpense discipline to keep costs low and ensure that products and solutions are affordableas well asresponsive toclientneeds. Finally, the Company aims to maximizeitsmarketvaluation andstockholderreturns over time.

﻿

Management estimates that investable wealth in the U.S. currently exceeds $30 trillion, which means the Company’s$2.78trillion in client assets represent a market share of less than ten percent, leaving substantial opportunity for growth.The

Company’s strategy is based on theprinciplethat developing trusted relationships will translate into more assets from both new and existing clients, ultimately driving more revenue and, along with expense discipline,generatingearnings growth and building long-term stockholder value.

﻿

Within Investor Services, the Company’s competition in serving individual investors includes a wide range of brokerage, wealth management, and asset management firms, as well as banks and trust companies.In the Advisor Services arena, the Company competes with institutional custodians, traditional and discount brokers, banks and investment advisory firms and trust companies.

﻿

Across both segments, the Company’s key competitive advantages are:

﻿

·Scale andSize of the Business-As one of the largest investment services firms in the United States (U.S.), the Company is able to spread operating costs and amortize new investments over a large base of clients and has the resources to evolve capabilities to meet client needs.

·Operating Efficiency - Coupled with scale, the Company’s operating efficiency and sharing of infrastructure across different businesses creates a cost advantage that enables the Company to competitively price products and services while profitably serving many different client channels.

·Operating Structure - Adding bank and asset management capabilities to the broker-dealer helps the Company serve a wider array of client needs, thereby deepening client relationships, enhancing the stability of client assets, and enabling diversified revenue streams.

·Brand and Corporate Reputation-In an industrydependent on trust, the Company’s reputation and brand across multiple constituents enables it to attract clients and employeeswhilecrediblyintroducingnew products to the market.

·Service Culture-Delivering a great client experience earns the trust and loyalty of clients andincreases the likelihood that those clients will refer others.

·Willingness to Disrupt-The Company’s willingness to challenge the status quo to benefit clients fosters innovation and continuous improvement, which helps to attract more clients and assets.

﻿

Sources of Net Revenues

﻿

The Company’s major sources of net revenues are net interest revenue, asset management and administration fees, and trading revenue. These revenue streams are supported by the Company’s combination of bank, broker-dealer and asset managementoperating subsidiaries, each of which brings specific capabilities that enable the Company to provide clients with the products and services theyare looking for.

﻿

Net interest revenue is the difference between interest generated on interest-earning assets and interest paid on funding sources, the majority of which is derived from client cash balances heldbythe Company as part of the clients’ overall relationship with the Company. While certain client cash balances areheldon the broker-dealer’s balance sheet orsweptto money market funds,a substantial amount of existing cash balances andmostnewclient cashinflows are sweptto Schwab Bank, which also offers clients checking and savings account capabilities. Over time, as supporting capital is available, the Company has been directing a growing proportion of client cash sweep balances to Schwab Bank relative to those going to the broker-dealer or moneymarketfunds.This shift has been effected through changes to default sweep options and the periodic bulk transfer of larger balances.Schwab Bank provides these balances withaccess toFederal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) insurance protection, as allowed, and provides the Company with greater flexibility in terms of options for investing the cash and administering theinterestratepaid on client deposits. Optimizing the return on client sweep cash as part of net interest revenue supports the Company’s efforts to offer clients the best possible value in the areas most important to them across their overall relationship with the Company.

﻿

The Company generates the majority of its asset management and administration fees through its proprietary and third-party mutual fund and ETF offerings, as well as fee-based advisory solutions; a portion of these fees comes from client cash balances placed in the Company’s money market mutual funds.

﻿

The Company generates trading revenue through commissions earned for executing trades for clients in individual equities,options,fixed income securities, and certain third-party mutual funds and ETFs, as well as principal transaction revenue earned primarily from actions to support client trading in fixed income securities.

﻿

Regulation

﻿

As a participant in the securities, banking and financial services industries, the Company is subject to extensive regulation under both federal and state laws by governmental agencies, supervisory authorities, and self-regulatory organizations (SROs). The Company is also subject to oversight by regulatory bodies in other countries in which the Company operates. These regulations affect the Company’s business operations and impose capital, client protection and market conduct requirements.

﻿

As a result of the enactment of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act in 2010 (Dodd-Frank), the adoption of implementing regulations by the federal regulatory agencies, and other recent regulatory reforms, the Company has experienced significant changes in the laws and regulations that apply to it, how it is regulated, and regulatory expectations in the areas of compliance, risk management, corporate governance, operations, capital and liquidity.

﻿

Holding Company and Bank Regulation

﻿

CSC is a savings and loan holding company and Schwab Bank, CSC’s depository institution subsidiary, is a federal savings bank. CSC is regulated, supervised, and examined by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Federal Reserve), and Schwab Bank is regulated, supervised, and examined by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), and the FDIC. CSC and Schwab Bank are also subject to regulation and various requirements and restrictions under state and other federal laws.

﻿

This regulatory framework is designed to protect depositors and consumers, the safety and soundness of depository institutions and their holding companies, and the stability of the banking system as a whole. This framework affects the activities and investments of CSC, Schwab Bank and CSC’s non-bank subsidiaries and gives the regulatory authorities broad discretion in connection with their supervisory, examination and enforcement activities and policies.

﻿

Financial Regulatory Reform

﻿

Following the enactment of Dodd-Frank, the federal banking agencies have adopted a number of implementing regulations and other regulatory reforms that are significant for CSC and Schwab Bank. These regulations are highlighted below.

﻿

BaselIII Capital and Liquidity Framework

﻿

In 2013, the U.S. Federal banking agencies adopted strengthened regulatory capital requirements for U.S. banking organizations consistent with Basel III (Final Regulatory Capital Rules). The Final Regulatory Capital Rules established Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) Capital as a new capital standard, increased minimum required risk-based capital ratios, narrowed the eligibility criteria for regulatory capital instruments, provided for new regulatory capital deductions and adjustments, and modified methods for calculating risk-weighted assets (the denominator of risk-based capital ratios). SeeCapital Management in Part II, Item 7,and Item 8 – Note 22 for more information on capital requirements.

﻿

The Final Regulatory Capital Rules provided for a one-time election which CSC and Schwab Bank made to exclude accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) from the calculation ofall capital ratios. The Final Regulatory Capital Rules also introduced a capital conservation buffer that limits a banking organization’s ability to make capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments to executive officers if a banking organization fails to maintain a capital conservation buffer of more than 2.5%, on a fully phased-in basis, in excess of all of its minimum risk-based capital ratio requirements.

﻿

The Final Regulatory Capital Rules provide for a “standardized approach” framework for the calculation of a banking organization’s regulatory capital and risk-weighted assets. Depository institutions and their holding companies with consolidated total assets of $250 billion or more, or total on-balance-sheet foreign exposures of $10 billion or more, are also required to calculate their regulatory capital and risk-weighted assets using an “advanced approaches” framework and must satisfy the minimum capital ratios under both approaches. Such companies must also maintain a minimum supplementary leverage ratio of at least 3.0% and are subject to certain other enhanced provisions. CSC and Schwab Bank are currently only subject to the “standardized approach” framework.

﻿





-6-





THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION

The new capital requirements under the Final Regulatory Capital Rules became effective in 2015, for CSC, which had not previously been subject to any consolidated capital requirements, and Schwab Bank.

﻿

In 2014, U.S. Federal banking agencies adopted an inter-agency rule that imposes a quantitativeLiquidity CoverageRatio(LCR)requirement on large banking organizations. Banking organizations with $250 billion or more in total consolidated assets or foreign exposures of $10 billion or more must holdHigh Quality Liquid Assets(HQLA)in an amount equal to at least 100% of their projected net cash outflows over the 30-day period. Other bank and savings and loan holding companies with total consolidated assets of $50 billion or more, such as CSC, are subject to a modified LCR rule requiring them to hold HQLA in an amount equal to at least 70% of their projected net cash outflows over the 30-day period. The modified LCR rule went into effect on January 1, 2016, with holding companies subject to the rule required to hold at least 90% of the necessary amount of HQLA in 2016 and at least 100% starting on January 1, 2017.

﻿

Capital Stress Testing

﻿

In 2012, the OCC issued final rules implementing provisions of Dodd-Frank that require national banks and federal savings associations with total consolidated assets of more than $10 billion to conduct annual company-run stress tests. Under the Dodd-Frank Act Stress Test (DFAST) rules, Schwab Bank must conduct annual stress tests using certain scenarios and prescribed stress-testing methodologies, report the results to the OCC and the Federal Reserve and publish a summary of the results of its stress tests. In July 2016, Schwab Bank submitted its company-run stress test results to the OCC. In October 2016, Schwab Bank publicly disclosed a summary of its stress test results under the severely adverse scenario prescribed by the OCC based upon a nine-quarter timeframe beginning on January 1, 2016 and ending on March 31, 2018. In its summary, Schwab Bank reported that its 7.1%Tier 1 leverage ratio at the beginning of the forecast period declined to a low of 6.7% during the nine-quarter forecast horizon and ended at 7.2%.

﻿

Under the Federal Reserve’s DFAST regulations, CSC will be required to conduct its first stress test using financial statement data as of December 31, 2016, report the results of that stress test to the Federal Reserve by April 5, 2017, and publicly disclose a summary of its stress test results between June 15 and June 30, 2017. CSC is not subject to the annual Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) process, which requires certain financial institutions to submit annual capital plans to the Federal Reserve. CSC has been taking steps to implement stress testing policies, procedures, systems, and governance structures that are designed to be consistent with regulatory expectations for a firm of its size and complexity.

﻿

Insured Depository Institution Resolution Plans

﻿

In 2011 and 2012, the FDIC issued rules requiring insured depository institutions with total consolidated assets of $50 billion or more to submit to the FDIC periodic plans providing for their resolution by the FDIC in the event of failure (resolution plans or so-called “living wills”) under the receivership and liquidation provisions of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act. Under these rules, Schwab Bank is required to file with the FDIC an annual resolution plan demonstrating how the bank could be resolved in an orderly and timely manner in the event of receivership such that the FDIC would be able to:ensure that the bank’s depositors receive access to their deposits within one business day; maximize the net present value of the bank’s assets when disposed of; and minimize losses incurred by the bank’s creditors.

﻿

Consumer Financial Protection

﻿

In 2011, pursuant to Dodd-Frank, the CFPB began operations and was given broad rulemaking, supervisory and enforcement authority for a wide range of federal consumer protection laws relating to financial products. As a federal savings bank with $10 billion or more in consolidated total assets, Schwab Bank’s lending and deposit-taking activities are subject to regulation, supervision and examination by the CFPB. The CFPB has adopted many consumer protection rules since its creation and has additional authority to issue orders, guidance and policy statements, conduct examinations, and bring enforcement actions.

﻿

Deposit Insurance Assessments

﻿

The FDIC’s Deposit Insurance Fund (DIF) provides insurance coverage for certain deposits, generally up to $250,000 per depositor per account ownership type, and is funded by quarterly assessments on insured depository institutions. In 2011, the FDIC established a risk-based deposit premium assessment system that, for large insured depository institutions with at least $10 billion in total consolidated assets, such as Schwab Bank, uses a scorecard method based on a number of factors, including the institution’s regulatory ratings, asset quality and brokered deposits. The deposit insurance assessment base is calculated as average consolidated total assets minus average tangible equity.





-7-





THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION

﻿

The Dodd-Frank Act (i) raised the minimum reserve ratio for the DIF to 1.35% (from the former minimum of 1.15%) and (ii) required that the DIF’s reserve ratio reach 1.35% by September 30, 2020.

﻿

In March 2016, the FDIC issued a final rule imposing a flat-rate surcharge on the quarterly assessments of insured depository institutions with total assets of $10 billion or more to pay for the increase. The surcharge went into effect on July 1, 2016,at the same time as a scheduled reduction in the regular FDIC insurance.As a result, the Company is now subject to a 3 basis point regular assessment on its total assessment base (down from 5 basis points) and a new 4.5 basis point surcharge on the amount of its assessment base in excess of $10 billion.

﻿

Community Reinvestment Act

﻿

The Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 (CRA) requires Schwab Bank’s primary federal bank regulatory agency, the OCC, to assess the bank’s record in meeting the credit needs of the communities served by the bank, including low- and moderate-income neighborhoods and persons. Institutions are assigned one of four ratings and the assessment is reviewed in connection with any acquisition, merger or branch office application.

﻿

Source of Strength

﻿

The Dodd-Frank Act codified the Federal Reserve’s long-held position that a depository institution holding company must serve as a source of financial strength for its subsidiary depository institutions, the so-called “source of strength doctrine.” In effect, the holding company may be compelled to commit resources to support the subsidiary in the event the subsidiary is in financial distress.

﻿

Broker-Dealer andInvestment AdvisorRegulation

﻿

CSC’s principal broker-dealers are Schwab and optionsXpress.Schwab is registered as a broker-dealer with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the fifty states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico. optionsXpress is registered as a broker-dealer with the SEC, the fifty states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands. Schwab and CSIM are registered asinvestment advisorswith the SEC. Additionally, Schwab and optionsXpress are regulated by the Commodities Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) with respect to the commodity futures and trading activities they conduct as an introducing broker and futures commission merchant, respectively.

﻿

Much of the regulation of broker-dealers has been delegated to SROs. Schwab is a member of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc. (FINRA), the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board (MSRB), NYSE Arca, and the Chicago Board Options Exchange(CBOE). optionsXpress is also a member of FINRA and the MSRB. In addition to the SEC, the primary regulators of Schwab and optionsXpress are FINRA and, for municipal securities, the MSRB. The National Futures Association (NFA) is Schwab and optionsXpress’s primary regulator for futures and commodities trading activities.

﻿

The principal purpose of regulating broker-dealers andinvestment advisorsis the protection of clients and securities markets. The regulations cover all aspects of the securities business, including, among other things, sales and trading practices, publication of research, margin lending, uses and safekeeping of clients’ funds and securities, capital adequacy, recordkeeping and reporting, fee arrangements, disclosure to clients, fiduciary duties owed to advisory clients, and the conduct of directors, officers,and employees.

﻿

Schwab and optionsXpress are both subject to Rule 15c3-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Uniform Net Capital Rule) and related SRO requirements. The CFTC and NFA also impose net capital requirements. The Uniform Net Capital Rule specifies minimum capital requirements intended to ensure the general financial soundness and liquidity of broker-dealers. CSC itself is not a registered broker-dealer and it is not subject to the Uniform Net Capital Rule. If Schwab fails to maintain specified levels of net capital, such failure could constitute a default by CSC of certain debt covenants under its credit agreement.

﻿

The Uniform Net Capital Rule prohibits a broker-dealer subsidiary from paying cash dividends, making unsecured advances or loans or repaying subordinated loans if such payment would result in a net capital amount of less than 5% of aggregate debit balances or less than 120% of its minimum dollar requirement of $250,000.

﻿

In addition to net capital requirements, as self-clearing broker-dealers, Schwab and optionsXpress are subject to cash deposit and collateral requirements with clearing houses, such as the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation and Options Clearing
