Item 1.Business



General Corporate Overview



The Charles Schwab Corporation (CSC), headquartered in San Francisco, California, was incorporated in 1986 and engages, through its
subsidiaries (collectively referred to as the Company, and primarily located in San Francisco except as indicated), in securities brokerage, banking, asset management, and related financial services. At December 31, 2010, the Company had
$1.57 trillion in client assets, 8.0 million active brokerage accounts(a), 1.5 million corporate retirement plan participants, and 690,000 banking accounts.



Significant business subsidiaries of CSC
include:



•Charles Schwab & Co., Inc. (Schwab), which was incorporated in 1971, is a securities broker-dealer with 302 domestic branch offices in 45
states, as well as a branch in each of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and London, U.K., and serves clients in Hong Kong through one of CSC’s subsidiaries;



•Charles Schwab Bank (Schwab Bank), which commenced operations in 2003, is a federal savings bank located in Reno, Nevada; and



•Charles Schwab Investment Management, Inc. (CSIM), which is the investment advisor for Schwab’s proprietary mutual funds, referred to as the
Schwab Funds®.



The Company provides financial services to individuals and institutional
clients through two segments – Investor Services and Institutional Services. The Investor Services segment includes the Company’s retail brokerage and banking operations. The Institutional Services segment provides custodial, trading, and
support services to independent investment advisors (IAs), as well as retirement plan, equity compensation plan, and other financial services to corporations and their employees. For financial information by segment for the three years ended
December 31, 2010, see “Item 8 – Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – 24. Segment Information.”



As of December 31, 2010, the Company had full-time, part-time and
temporary employees, and persons employed on a contract basis that represented the equivalent of about 12,800 full-time employees.



Acquisitions and Divestiture



On November 9, 2010, the Company completed its acquisition of substantially all of the assets of Windward Investment Management, Inc. (Windward),
which was an investment advisory firm that managed diversified investment portfolios comprised primarily of exchange-traded fund securities.



In July 2007, the Company sold all of the outstanding stock of U.S. Trust Corporation (USTC, and with its subsidiaries collectively referred to as
U.S. Trust). U.S. Trust was a subsidiary that provided wealth management services.



In March 2007, the Company acquired The 401(k) Company, which offers retirement plan services. The acquisition enhanced the Company’s ability to meet the needs of retirement plans of all sizes. The
acquisition also provided the opportunity to capture rollover accounts from individuals participating in retirement plans served by The 401(k) Company and to cross-sell the Company’s other investment and banking services to plan participants.



Business Strategy and Competitive
Environment



The Company’s purpose is to help everyone
be financially fit. The Company’s strategy is to meet the financial services needs of individual investors, both directly and indirectly, through its two segments. To pursue its strategy, the Company focuses on: building client loyalty;
innovating in ways that benefit clients; operating in a disciplined manner; and leveraging its strengths through shared core processes and technology platforms. The Company provides clients with a compelling combination of

personalized relationships, superior service, and great value, delivered through a blend of people and technology. People provide the client focus and personal touch that are essential in serving
investors, while technology helps create services that are scalable and consistent. This combination helps the Company address a wide range of client needs – from tools and information for self-directed or active investors, to advice services,
to retirement and equity-based incentive plans, to support services for independent IAs – while enabling each client to easily utilize some or all of these capabilities according to their unique circumstances.



The Company’s competition in serving individual investors includes a
wide range of brokerage, wealth management, and asset management firms, as well as banks and trust companies. In serving these investors and competing for a growing percentage of the investable wealth in the U.S., the Company offers a multi-channel
service delivery model, which includes branch, telephonic, and online capabilities. Under this model, the Company can offer personalized service at competitive prices while giving clients the choice of where, when, and how they do business with the
Company. Schwab’s branches and regional telephone service centers are staffed with trained and experienced financial consultants (FCs) focused on building and sustaining client relationships. The Company offers the ability to meet client
investing needs through a single ongoing point of contact, even as those needs change over time. In particular, management believes that the Company’s ability to provide those clients seeking help, guidance, or advice with an integrated,
individually tailored solution – ranging from occasional consultations to an ongoing relationship with a Schwab FC or an IA – is a competitive strength compared to the more fragmented offerings of other firms.



The Company’s online and telephonic channels provide quick and efficient
access to an extensive array of information, research, tools, trade execution, and administrative services, which clients can access according to their needs. For example, as clients trade more actively, they can use these channels to access highly
competitive pricing, expert tools, and extensive service capabilities – including experienced, knowledgeable teams of trading specialists and integrated product offerings.



Individuals investing for retirement through 401(k) plans can take advantage
of the Company’s bundled offering of multiple investment choices, education, and third-party advice. Management also believes the Company is able to compete with the wide variety of financial services firms striving to attract individual client
relationships by complementing these capabilities with the extensive array of investment, banking, and lending products and services described in the following section.



In the IA arena, the Company competes with institutional custodians,
traditional and discount brokers, banks, and trust companies. Management believes that its Institutional Services segment can maintain its market leadership position primarily through the efforts of its expanded sales and support teams, which are
dedicated to helping IAs grow, compete, and succeed in serving their clients. In addition to focusing on superior service, Institutional Services competes by utilizing technology to provide IAs with a highly-developed, scalable platform for
administering their clients’ assets easily and efficiently. Institutional Services sponsors a variety of national, regional, and local events designed to help IAs identify and implement better ways to grow and manage their practices
efficiently.



Another important aspect of the
Company’s ability to compete is its ongoing focus on efficiency and productivity, as lower costs give the Company greater flexibility in its approach to pricing and investing for growth. Management believes that this flexibility remains
important in light of the current competitive environment, in which a number of competitors offer reduced online trading commission rates and lower expense ratios on certain classes of mutual funds. Additionally, the Company’s nationwide
marketing effort is an important competitive tool because it reinforces the attributes of the Schwab®brand.



Products and Services



The Company offers a broad range of products to address individuals’
varying investment and financial needs. Examples of these product offerings include:



•Brokerage – an array of brokerage accounts including some with check-writing features, debit card, and billpay; individual retirement accounts;
retirement plans for small to large businesses; 529 college savings accounts; designated brokerage accounts; equity incentive plan accounts; and margin loans, as well as access to fixed income securities, and equity and debt offerings;



•Banking – checking accounts linked to brokerage accounts, savings accounts, certificates of deposit, demand deposit accounts, first mortgages,
home equity lines of credit (HELOCs), and pledged asset loans;



•Trust – trust custody services, personal trust reporting services, and administrative trustee services;

out investment and portfolio management decisions, as well as a range of fully delegated managed solutions that provide ongoing portfolio management.



Schwab strives to demystify investing by educating and assisting clients in the development of investment plans. Educational tools
include workshops, interactive courses, and online information about investing. Additionally, Schwab provides various internet-based research and analysis tools that are designed to help clients achieve better investment outcomes. As an example of
such tools, Schwab Equity Ratings®is a quantitative model-based stock rating system that provides all clients
with ratings on approximately 3,000 stocks, assigning each equity a single grade: A, B, C, D, or F. Stocks are rated based on specific factors relating to fundamentals, valuation, momentum, and risk and ranked so that the number of ‘buy
consideration’ ratings – As and Bs – equals the number of ‘sell consideration’ ratings – Ds and Fs.



Clients may need specific investment recommendations, either from time to time or on an ongoing basis. The Company provides clients seeking advice with
customized solutions. The Company’s approach to advice is based on long-term investment strategies and guidance on portfolio diversification and asset allocation. This approach is designed to be offered consistently across all of Schwab’s
delivery channels.



Schwab Private
ClientTMfeatures a personal advice relationship with a
designated portfolio consultant, supported by a team of investment professionals who provide individualized service, a customized investment strategy developed in collaboration with the client, and ongoing guidance and execution.



For clients seeking a relationship in which investment
decisions are fully delegated to a financial professional, the Company offers several alternatives. The Company provides investors access to professional investment management in a diversified account that is invested exclusively in either mutual
funds or ETFs through the Schwab Managed PortfolioTMprogram. The Company also refers investors who want to utilize a specific third-party money manager to direct a portion of their investment assets to the Schwab Managed Account program. In addition, clients who want the assistance of an independent
professional in managing their financial affairs may be referred to IAs in the Schwab Advisor Network®. These
IAs provide personalized portfolio management, financial planning, and wealth management solutions.



The Company strives to deliver information, education, technology, service, and pricing that meet the specific needs of clients who trade actively. Schwab offers integrated Web- and software-based trading
platforms, which incorporate intelligent order routing technology, real-time market data, options trading, premium stock research, and multi-channel access, as well as sophisticated account and trade management features, risk management tools,
decision support tools, and dedicated personal support.



The
Company serves both foreign investors and non-English-speaking U.S. clients who wish to trade or invest in U.S. dollar-based securities. The Company has a physical presence in the United Kingdom and Hong Kong. In the U.S., the Company serves
Chinese-, Portuguese-, Spanish-, and Vietnamese-speaking clients through a combination of its branch offices and Web-based and telephonic services.

Regulation



CSC is a savings and loan holding company and Schwab Bank, CSC’s
depository institution subsidiary, is a federal savings bank. CSC and Schwab Bank are both currently subject to supervision and regulation by the Office of Thrift Supervision. However, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act
legislation eliminates the Office of Thrift Supervision and transfers its functions to other federal banking agencies effective July 21, 2011, unless extended or delayed for up to an additional six months. As a result, the Federal Reserve will
become CSC’s primary regulator and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency will become the primary regulator of Schwab Bank. As a savings and loan holding company, CSC is not subject to specific statutory capital requirements. However,
CSC is required to maintain capital that is sufficient to support the holding company and its subsidiaries’ business activities, and the risks inherent in those activities.



Schwab Bank is subject to regulation and supervision and to various
requirements and restrictions under federal and state laws, including regulatory capital guidelines. Among other things, these requirements govern transactions with CSC and its non-depository institution subsidiaries, including loans and other
extensions of credit, investments or asset purchases, dividends, and investments. The federal banking agencies have broad powers to enforce these regulations, including the power to terminate deposit insurance, impose substantial fines and other
civil and criminal penalties, and appoint a conservator or receiver. Schwab Bank is required to maintain minimum capital levels as specified in federal banking laws and regulations. Failure to meet the minimum levels will result in certain
mandatory, and possibly additional discretionary, actions by the regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on Schwab Bank.



The securities industry in the United States is subject to extensive regulation under both federal and state laws. Schwab is registered as a broker-dealer
with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the fifty states, and the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico. Schwab and CSIM are registered as investment advisors with the SEC. Additionally, Schwab is regulated by the Commodities
Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) with respect to the futures and commodities trading activities it conducts as an introducing broker.



Much of the regulation of broker-dealers has been delegated to self-regulatory organizations (SROs), which in Schwab’s case includes the Financial
Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc. (FINRA), the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board (MSRB), NYSE Arca, and the Chicago Board Options Exchange. The primary regulators of Schwab are FINRA and, for municipal securities, the MSRB. The CFTC has
designated the National Futures Association (NFA) as Schwab’s primary regulator for futures and commodities trading activities. The Company’s business is also subject to oversight by regulatory bodies in other countries in which the
Company operates.



The principal purpose of regulating
broker-dealers and investment advisors is the protection of clients and the securities markets. The regulations to which broker-dealers and investment advisors are subject cover all aspects of the securities business, including, among other things,
sales and trading practices, publication of research, margin lending, uses and safekeeping of clients’ funds and securities, capital adequacy, recordkeeping and reporting, fee arrangements, disclosure to clients, fiduciary duties owed to
advisory clients, and the conduct of directors, officers and employees.

THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION



As a registered broker-dealer, Schwab is subject to Rule 15c3-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of
1934 (the Uniform Net Capital Rule) and related SRO requirements. The CFTC and NFA also impose net capital requirements. The Uniform Net Capital Rule specifies minimum capital requirements that are intended to ensure the general financial soundness
and liquidity of broker-dealers. Because CSC itself is not a registered broker-dealer, it is not subject to the Uniform Net Capital Rule. However, if Schwab failed to maintain specified levels of net capital, such failure would constitute a default
by CSC under certain debt covenants.



The Uniform Net Capital Rule
limits broker-dealers’ ability to transfer capital to parent companies and other affiliates. Compliance with the Uniform Net Capital Rule could limit Schwab’s operations and its ability to repay subordinated debt to CSC, which in turn
could limit CSC’s ability to repay debt, pay cash dividends, and purchase shares of its outstanding stock.



Sources of Net Revenues



The Company’s major sources of net revenues are asset management and administration fees, net interest revenue, and trading revenue. The Company generates asset management and administration fees
through its proprietary and third-party mutual fund offerings, as well as fee-based investment management and advisory services. Net interest revenue is the difference between interest earned on interest-earning assets (such as cash, short- and
long-term investments, and mortgage and margin loans) and interest paid on funding sources (including banking deposits and client cash in brokerage accounts, short-term borrowings, and long-term debt). The Company generates trading revenue through
commissions earned for executing trades for clients and principal transaction revenue from trading activity in fixed income securities.



For revenue information by source for the three years ended December 31, 2010, see “Item 7 – Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Results of Operations – Net Revenues.”
