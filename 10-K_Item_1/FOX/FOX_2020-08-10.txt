Business Overview

FOX produces and delivers compelling news, sports and entertainment content through its primary iconic brands, including FOX News Media, FOX Sports, FOX Entertainment and FOX Television Stations. The Company, with a simple structure focused on two principal reporting segments, differentiates itself in a crowded media and entertainment marketplace through the leadership positions of the Company’s brands and premium programming, with a focus on live and “appointment-based” content that brings communities together, a significant presence in major markets and the broad distribution of the Company’s content across traditional and digital platforms.

Our Competitive Strengths

Premium brands that resonate deeply with viewers.

Under the banner of the FOX name, we produce and distribute content through some of the world’s leading and most valued brands. Our long track record of challenging the status quo emboldens us to continue making innovative decisions, disrupting competitors and forming deeper relationships with audiences. FOX News is among the most influential and recognized news brands in the world. FOX Sports has earned a reputation for bold sports programming and, with its far-reaching presence in virtually every U.S. household, is the premier destination for live sports events and sports commentary. FOX Entertainment is renowned for its engaging primetime entertainment, including the top broadcast entertainment series,The Masked Singer. These brands and others in our portfolio, including our local station affiliates broadcasting under the FOX brand, hold cultural significance with consumers and commercial importance for distributors and advertisers. The quality of our programming and the strength of our brands maximize the value of our content through a combination of affiliate fees and advertising sales.

Leadership positions across strategically significant programming platforms.

FOX enjoys a leadership position across our core news, sports and entertainment businesses. As linear television viewership declines across the industry, “appointment-based” programming that is the FOX hallmark remains resilient. FOX News has been the #1 national cable news network for over 18 years and is the top-rated national cable news network in primetime and total viewing across key demographics as of June 2020. A leader in marquee live sports broadcasts, FOX Sports programs Thursday night and Sunday National Football League (“NFL”) football, the Major League Baseball (“MLB”)All-Star GameandWorld Seriesand other marquee events, including the Fédération Internationale de Football Association (“FIFA”)World Cupand theSuper Bowl. FOX Sports’ broadcast ofSuper Bowl LIVin February 2020 was watched by approximately 150 million unique multiplatform viewers and generated one of the highest revenue days in television history. FOX Entertainment programming ranked #1 among all broadcast network primetime entertainment programming for the 2019-2020 broadcast season in the key Adults 18-49 demographic, moving from last to first in back-to-back seasons, while delivering the top showThe Masked Singer, as well as the four highest






rated new entertainment seriesLEGO Masters,911: Lone Star,Prodigal SonandThe Masked Singer: After The Mask.The FOX Television Stationsended fiscal 2020covering 18 Nielsen-designated market areas (“DMAs”), including 14 of the 15 largest.Taken together, we believe our leadership positions willcontinue tosupport strong affiliate fee revenue growth and sustained advertising revenue, while enabling us to nimbly respond to the challenges relating to rapidly evolving technologies and changes in consumer behavior that traditional media companies are facing.

Significant presence and relevance in major domestic markets.

The FOX portfolio combines the range of national cable and broadcast networks with the power of tailored local television. FOX News and FOX Business are available in approximately 80 million U.S. households and the FOX Network is available in essentially all U.S. households. Additionally, our 29 owned and operated television stations cover 18 DMAs, including 14 of the 15 largest, and maintain duopolies in 11 DMAs, including New York, Los Angeles and Chicago, the three largest. These stations provide balanced content of national interest with programming of note to local communities, producing over 1,000 hours of local news coverage each week. The breadth and depth of our footprint allows us to produce and distribute our content in a cost-effective manner and share best business practices and models across regions. It also enables us to engage audiences, develop deeper consumer relationships and create more compelling product offerings.

Attractive financial profile, including multiple revenue streams, strong balance sheet and tax asset benefit.

We have achieved strong revenue growth and profitability in a complex industry environment over the past several years, led by affiliate fee increases. Additionally, our strong balance sheet provides us with the financial flexibility to continue to invest across our businesses, allocate resources toward investments in growth initiatives, take advantage of strategic opportunities, including potential acquisitions across the range of media categories in which we operate, and return capital to our stockholders. We also benefit from a tax asset that resulted from the step-up in the tax basis of our assets following the Transaction, which will provide an annual cash tax benefit for many years.

Goals and Strategies

Maintain leading positions in live news, live sports and quality entertainment.

We have long been a leader in news, sports and entertainment programming. We believe that building on our leading market positions is essential to our success. We are investing in our most attractive growth opportunities by allocating capital to our news, sports and original entertainment programming, which we believe have distinct competitive advantages. For example, we have continued our investments in digital properties at FOX News Media, including additional investments in the FOX Nation subscription video-on-demand (“SVOD”) service and the rebranding of the FOX Business suite of digital products. FOX Sports has extended the FOX Sports brand through a partnership with The Stars Group (subsequently acquired by Flutter Entertainment plc (“Flutter”)) that launched the free-to-play game FOX Bet Super 6 and the FOX Bet wagering app in fiscal 2020. FOX Entertainment is investing in more co-production arrangements and owns a stake in nearly all new series that aired on the FOX Network during the 2019-2020 broadcast season. We believe continuing to provide compelling news, sports and entertainment programming across platforms will increase audience engagement and drive growth across our distribution, affiliate and advertising relationships.

Increase revenue growth through the continued delivery of high quality, premium and valuable content.

With a focused portfolio of assets, we create and produce high quality programming that delivers value for our viewers and our affiliate and advertising partners. We intend to continue to receive appropriate value for our content, particularly through affiliate fees. Additionally, we expect our enhanced ability to acquire independent programming through co-production arrangements will facilitate growth by enabling us to directly manage the economics and programming decisions of our broadcast network and stations group. We also believe our unique ability to deliver “appointment-based” viewing and audiences at scale, along with innovative advertising platforms, delivers substantial value to our advertising customers, and the unique nature of our “appointment-based” content positions us to maintain and even grow audiences during a time of increasing consumer fragmentation.

Expand our online distribution offerings and direct engagement with consumers, increasing complementary sources of revenues.

Our key networks are offered on all major digital MVPD services, reflecting the strength of our brands and the “must-have” nature of our content. We are also cultivating direct interactions between FOX brands and consumers outside






traditional linear television. For example, in fiscal 2020, we acquired Tubi, which owns and operates a leading AVOD service, while divesting our passive stake in Roku, Inc. Tubi provides us with a 100% owned digital platform to access a wider digital audience and to further the reach of our content. We also acquired 67% of the equity in Credible, a U.S. consumer finance marketplace that is playing a featured role in the rebranded FOX Business suite of digital productsand otherintegrations across the FOX portfolio of brands. In addition, FOX Sportshas partnered with The Stars Group(subsequently acquired by Flutter), whichlaunched the FOX Bet app in fiscal 2020, and we own an equity stake in Flutter and maintain valuable options to acquire up to 50% ofTheStars Group’sU.S. business and approximately 18.5% of FanDuelGroup, a majority-owned subsidiary of Flutter. FOX Television Stations also upgraded its suite of digital properties and launched its first AVOD service, FOX Soul, which features programming focused on the African American community. We intend to identify similarly innovative new products, services and investments across our business to increase revenues and profitability in the future.

Important competitive factors include the prices charged for programming, the quantity, quality and variety of programming offered, the accessibility of such programming, the ability to adapt to new technologies and distribution platforms, quality of user experience and the effectiveness of marketing efforts.

FOX News Media.FOX News’ primary competition comes from the cable networks CNN, HLN and MSNBC. FOX Business’ primary competition comes from the cable networks CNBC and Bloomberg Television.

On a national level, the primary competitors to FS1, FS2, and the Big Ten Network are ESPN, ESPN2, NBC Sports Network, CBS Sports Network, TNT, league-owned networks such as NFL Network, NHL Network, NBA TV and MLB Network, and collegiate conference-specific networks such as the SEC Network, Pac-12 Network and ACC Network.

(a)VHF television stations transmit on Channels 2 through 13 and UHF television stations on Channels 14 through 36. The Federal Communications Commission (the “FCC”) applies a discount (the “UHF Discount”) which attributes only 50% of the television households in a local television market to the audience reach of a UHF television station for purposes of calculating whether that station’s owner complies with the national station ownership cap imposed by FCC regulations and by statute; in making this calculation, only the station’s RF broadcast channel is considered. In a duopoly market, both stations must be UHF for the discount to apply. In addition, the coverage of two commonly owned stations in the same market is counted only once. The percentages listed are rounded and do not take into account the UHF Discount. For more information regarding the FCC’s national station ownership cap, see “Government Regulation.”

In October 2019, the Company premieredWWE Friday Night SmackDown.






The FOX Network obtains entertainment programming from major television studios, including Twentieth Century FoxTelevision (which, following the Disney Merger, is owned by Disney), and independent television production companies pursuant to license agreements. The terms of those agreements generally provide the FOX Network with the right to broadcast a television series for a minimum of four seasons. National sports programming is obtained through license agreements with professional or collegiate sports leagues or organizations, including long-term agreementswith the NFL, MLB, college football and basketball conferences, NASCAR, FIFAand WWE.

The FOX Network provides programming to affiliates in accordance with affiliation agreements of varying durations, which grant to each affiliate the right to broadcast network television programming on the affiliated station. Such agreements typically run three or more years and have staggered expiration dates. These affiliation agreements require affiliates to the FOX Network to carry the FOX Network programming in all time periods in which the FOX Network programming is offered to those affiliates, subject to certain exceptions stated in the affiliation agreements.

The FOX Network also distributes programming through its network-branded website, FOX.com, and its FOX NOW and FOX Sports apps, which offer live streaming of the FOX Network shows and programming from many broadcast stations affiliated with the FOX Network, and licenses programming for distribution through MVPDs’ websites and apps.

MyNetworkTV

The programming distribution service, Master Distribution Service, Inc. (branded as MyNetworkTV), distributes two hours per night, Monday through Friday, of off-network programming from syndicators to its over 180 licensee stations, including 10 stations owned and operated by the Company, and is available to approximately 98% of U.S. households as of June 30, 2020.

Competition

The network television broadcasting business is highly competitive. The FOX Network, MyNetworkTV and Tubi compete for audiences, programming and advertising revenue with a variety of competing media, including other broadcast television networks, cable television systems and networks; other Internet-delivered platforms such as SVOD and AVOD services and mobile, gaming and social media platforms; audio programming; and print and other media. In addition, the FOX Network and MyNetworkTV compete with other broadcast networks and programming distribution services to secure affiliations or station agreements with independently owned television stations in markets across the U.S. ABC, NBC and CBS each broadcast a significantly greater number of hours of programming than the FOX Network and, accordingly, may be able to designate or change time periods in which programming is to be broadcast with greater flexibility than the FOX Network. Technological developments are also continuing to affect competition within the broadcast television marketplace.






Each of the stations owned and operated by FOX Television Stations also competes for advertising revenues with other television stations, radio and cable systems in its respective market area, along with other advertising media,including Internet-delivered platforms such as SVOD and AVOD services and mobile, gaming and social media platforms,newspapers, magazines, outdoor advertising and direct mail. All of the stations owned and operated by FOX Television Stations are located in highly competitive markets. Additional items that are material to the competitive position of each of the television stations include management experience, authorized power and assigned frequency of that station. Competition for sales of broadcast advertising time is based primarily on the anticipated and actually delivered size and demographic characteristics of audiences as determined by various rating services, price, the time of day when the advertising is to be broadcast, competition from the other broadcast networks, cable television systems, direct broadcast satellite television, services and digital media and general economic conditions. Competition for audiences is based primarily on the selection of programming, the acceptance of which is dependent on the reaction of the viewing public, which is often difficult to predict.

Other, Corporate and Eliminations

The Other, Corporate and Eliminations segment consists primarily of the FOX Studio Lot, Credible, corporate overhead costs and intracompany eliminations.

FOX Studio Lot

FOX owns the FOX StudioLot in Los Angeles, California. The historic lot is located on over 50 acres of land and has over 1.85 million square feet of space for both administration and production/post-production services available to service a wide array of industry clients, including 15 sound stages, two broadcast studios, theaters and screening rooms, editing rooms and other production facilities.

FOX Sports provides The Stars Group with an exclusive license to use certain FOX Sports trademarks under a long-term commercial arrangement. Subject to certain conditions and applicable gaming regulatory approvals, FOX Sports has an option until August 2029 to acquire up to 50% of the equity in The Stars Group’s U.S. business. In May 2020, The Stars Group combined with Flutter to create a global leader in sports betting and gaming. As part of that transaction, FOX Sports received an option until 2031 to acquire an approximately 18.5% equity interest in FanDuel Group, a majority-owned subsidiary of Flutter. In May 2020, the Company participated in an equity offering by Flutter, investing approximately $100 million. As of June 30, 2020, the Company owns approximately four million ordinary shares of Flutter, representing approximately 3% of Flutter.

Government Regulation

The Communications Act and FCC Regulation

The television broadcast industry in the U.S. is highly regulated by federal laws and regulations issued and administered by various agencies, including the FCC. The FCC regulates television broadcasting, and certain aspects of the operations of cable, satellite and other electronic media that compete with broadcasting, pursuant to theCommunications Act of 1934, as amended (the “Communications Act”). The introduction of new laws and regulations or changes in the enforcement or interpretation of existing laws and regulations could have a negative impact on the operations, prospects and financial performance of the Company.






Broadcast Licenses.The Communications Act permits the operation of television broadcast stations only in accordance with a license issued by the FCC upon a finding that the grant of the license would serve the public interest, convenience and necessity. The Company owns broadcast licensees in connection with its ownership and operation of television stations. Under the Communications Act, television broadcast licenses may be granted for a maximum term of eight years. Generally, the FCC renews broadcast licenses upon finding that the television station has served the public interest, convenience and necessity; there have been no serious violations by the licensee of the Communications Act or FCC rules and regulations; and there have been no other violations by the licensee of the Communications Act or FCC rules and regulations which, taken together, indicate a pattern of abuse.As of June 30, 2020,FOX Television Stations hastwopending renewal applications for its television broadcast licensesand is filing license renewal applications for its other stations in calendar years 2020-2023.

Ownership Regulations.Under the FCC’s national television ownership rule, one party may own television stations with a collective national audience reach of not more than 39% of all U.S. television households, subject to the UHF discount. Under the UHF discount, a UHF television station is attributed with reaching only 50% of the television households in its market for purposes of calculating national audience reach. In December 2017, the FCC issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking pursuant to which it will consider modifying, retaining or eliminating the 39% national television audience reach limitation (including the UHF discount). If the FCC determines in the future to eliminate the UHF discount and the national television audience reach limitation is not eliminated or modified, the Company’s ability to acquire television stations in additional markets may be negatively affected.

Under the FCC’s local television ownership rule, one party may own up to two television stations in the same DMA and presumptively only one station ranked among the top-four stations based on audience share as of the application date. In November 2017, the FCC issued a reconsideration order that relaxed the local television ownership rule so that, among other things, station owners could petition the FCC to permit ownership of two stations among the top four in a market. As discussed below, the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit (the “Third Circuit”) vacated the FCC’s order and that decision is on appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court.

The Company is also subject to other communications laws and regulations relating to ownership. For example, FCC dual network rules prohibit any of the four major broadcast television networks — FOX, ABC, CBS, and NBC — from being under common ownership or control. In addition, under the Communications Act, no broadcast station licensees may be owned by a corporation if more than 25% of the corporation’s stock is owned or voted by non-U.S. persons, their representatives, or by any other corporation organized under the laws of a foreign country. This ownership limit can be waived if the FCC finds it to be in the public interest. The FCC could review the Company’s compliance with the foreign ownership regulations in connection with its consideration of FOX Television Stations’ license renewal applications. The Company’s amended and restated certificate of incorporation authorizes the Company’s Board of Directors to take action to prevent, cure or mitigate the effect of stock ownership above the applicable foreign ownership threshold, including: refusing to permit any transfer of common stock to or ownership of common stock by a non-U.S. stockholder; voiding a transfer of common stock to a non-U.S. stockholder; suspending rights of stock ownership if held by a non-U.S. stockholder; or redeeming common stock held by a non-U.S. stockholder.






Carriage and Content Regulations.FCC regulations require each television broadcaster to elect, at three-year intervals, either to require carriage of its signal bytraditionalMVPDs in the station’s market or to negotiate the termsthroughwhich that broadcast station would permit transmission of its signal by thetraditionalMVPDs within its market, which we refer to as the retransmission consent.FOX Television Stations have historicallyelected retransmission consent for all oftheirowned and operated stationsand the Company has been compensated as a result.

Federal legislation limits the amount of commercial matter that may be broadcast during programming originally designed for children 12 years of age and younger to 10 ½ minutes per hour during the weekend and 12 minutes per hour during the week. In addition, under FCC regulations, television stations are generally required to broadcast a minimum of three hours per week of programming, which, among other requirements, must serve, as a “significant purpose,” the educational and informational needs of children 16 years of age and under. Under FCC rules that were revised in 2019, one of the three hours per week may air on a television’s station’s multicast stream(s); the other two hours must air on the primary programming stream. A television station found not to have complied with the programming requirements or commercial limitations could face sanctions, including monetary fines and the possible non-renewal of its license.

FCC rules prohibit the broadcast by television and radio stations of indecent or profane material between the hours of 6:00 a.m. and 10:00 p.m. Federal law currently authorizes the FCC to impose fines of up to $407,270 per incident for violation of the prohibition against indecent and profane broadcasts. The FCC may impose fines or revoke licenses for serious or multiple violations of the indecency prohibition. Because indecency complaints are confidential, there may be pending nonpublic complaints alleging the broadcast of indecent or profane material by FOX Television Stations (and it is not possible to predict the outcome of any such complaints).

Modifications to the Company’s programming to reduce the risk of indecency violations could have an adverse effect on the competitive position of FOX Television Stations and the FOX Network. If indecency regulation is extended to Internet or cable and satellite programming, and such extension was found to be constitutional, some of the Company’s other programming services could be subject to additional regulation that might affect subscription and viewership levels.

The FCC continues to enforce strictly its regulations concerning sponsorship identification, political advertising, children’s television, environmental concerns, equal employment opportunity, technical operating matters and antenna tower maintenance. In addition, the Federal Trade Commission, or FTC, has increased its focus on unfair and deceptive advertising practices, particularly with respect to social media marketing. Both FCC and FTC rules and guidance require marketers to clearly and conspicuously disclose whenever there has been payment for a marketing message or when there is a material connection between an advertiser and a product endorser.

FCC rules also require the closed captioning of almost all broadcast and cable programming. In addition, Federal law requires affiliates of the four largest broadcast networks in the 60 largest markets to carry a specified minimum amount of hours of primetime or children’s programming per calendar quarter with video descriptions, i.e., a verbal description of key visual elements inserted into natural pauses in the audio and broadcast over a separate audio channel. The same statute requires programming that was captioned on television to retain captions when distributed via Internet Protocol apps or services.

FCC regulations govern various aspects of the agreements between networks and affiliated broadcast stations, including, among other things, a mandate that television broadcast station licensees retain the right to reject or refuse network programming in certain circumstances or to substitute programming that the licensee reasonably believes to be of greater local or national importance.

Violation of FCC regulations can result in substantial monetary forfeitures, periodic reporting conditions, short-term license renewals and, in egregious cases, denial of license renewal or revocation of license. Violation of FTC-imposed obligations can result in enforcement actions, litigation, consent decrees and, ultimately, substantial monetary fines.

C-Band Reallocation.In order to free up additional spectrum that will likely be used to provide the next generation of commercial wireless broadband services, commonly referred to as 5G services, in March 2020 the FCC adopted a Report and Order that will reallocate through an FCC auction the lower 300 MHz portion of the 500 MHz in the 3.7 to 4.2 GHz (“C-Band”). The C-Band forms the backbone of the infrastructure for how the Company delivers its programming to broadcast affiliates and traditional MVPDs. Currently, there is no viable, scalable and reliable alternative for video delivery. If the FCC does not ensure that the interference protection rules it adopted in February 2020 sufficiently safeguard video delivery while it reallocates and “repacks” the C-Band, it would significantly hinder the Company’s ability to deliver its programming to broadcast affiliates and traditional MVPDs.






Broadcast Transmission Standard.In November 2017, the FCC adopted rules to permit television broadcasters to voluntarily broadcast using the “Next Generation” broadcast television transmission standard developed by the Advanced Television Systems Committee, Inc., also referred to as “ATSC 3.0.” FOX Television Stations is actively planning to build out ATSC 3.0 facilities. FOX Television Stations is participating in various ATSC 3.0 testing with other broadcasters, but it is too early to predict the impact of this technical standard on the Company’s operations.In June 2020, the FCC adopted a Declaratory Ruling and Notice of Proposed Rulemaking declaring that local and national ownership restrictions do not apply to non-video services. The Notice of Proposed Rulemaking raises a number of questions that could impact the adoption and roll-out of both video and non-video ATSC 3.0 services.

Privacy and Information Regulation

Although the Company and the media industry are active in self-regulatory initiatives relating to advertising and online privacy, such initiatives may be replaced or superseded by government action. A number of privacy and data security bills that address the collection, maintenance and use of personal information, breach notification requirements and cybersecurity are pending or have been adopted at both the state and federal level, including the proposed California Privacy Rights Act ballot initiative, which would impose additional obligations on businesses. In addition, the FTC and state attorneys general have made privacy and data security an enforcement focus.

Foreign jurisdictions also have implemented and continue to introduce new privacy and data security laws and regulations, some of which may apply to the Company’s operations. It is possible that our current data protection policies and practices may be deemed inconsistent with new legal requirements or interpretations thereof, and could result in the violation of these new laws and regulations. The EU General Data Protection Regulation, in particular, regulates the collection, use and security of personal data and restricts the trans-border flow of such data. Canada, Australia and Mexico likewise have enacted data protection legislation.

The Company monitors and considers these privacy and data security laws and regulations, particularly with respect to the design and operation of digital content services and legal and regulatory compliance programs. These laws and regulations and their interpretation are subject to change, and could result in increased compliance costs, claims, financial penalties for noncompliance, changes to business practices, including with respect to tailored advertising, or otherwise impact the Company’s business. For example, violations of applicable privacy and data security laws could result in significant monetary fines and other penalties, require us to expend significant resources to defend, remedy and/or address, and harm our reputation even if we are not ultimately responsible for the violation.






Consumer Finance Laws and Regulations

Credible, a consumer finance marketplace that FOX acquired during fiscal 2020, markets and provides services in heavily regulated industries across the United States. As a result, Credible is subject to a variety of federal and state laws and regulations. These include the laws and regulations governing the collection, use and transfer of consumer information described above and the following:

•the Truth-in-Lending Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Credit Reporting Act, the Fair Housing Act, the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, or “RESPA,” and similar state laws, and federal and state unfair and deceptive acts and practices, or “UDAAP,” laws and regulations, all of which place restrictions on the manner in which consumer loans are marketed and originated, and some of which impose restrictions on the amount and nature of fees that may be charged or paid to Credible by lenders and real estate professionals for providing or obtaining consumer loan requests;

•the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, which imposes, among other things, requirements related to mortgage disclosures; and

•federal and state licensing laws, such as the Secure and Fair Enforcement for Mortgage Licensing Act of 2008, or “SAFE Act,” which establishes minimum standards for the licensing and regulation of mortgage loan originators.

Intellectual Property

The Company’s intellectual property assets include copyrights in television programming and other publications, websites and technologies; trademarks, trade dress, service marks, logos, slogans, sound marks, design rights, symbols, characters, names, titles and trade names, domain names; patents or patent applications for inventions related to its products, business methods and/or services, trade secrets and know how; and licenses of intellectual property rights of various kinds. The Company derives value from these assets through the production, distribution and/or licensing of its television programming to domestic and international cable and satellite television services, video-on-demand services, operation of websites, and through the sale of products, such as collectible merchandise, apparel, books and publications, among others.

The Company devotes significant resources to protecting its intellectual property, relying upon a combination of copyright, trademark, unfair competition, patent, trade secret and other laws and contract provisions. There can be no assurance of the degree to which these measures will be successful in any given case. Policing unauthorized use of the Company’s products and services and related intellectual property is often difficult and the steps taken may not in every case prevent the infringement by unauthorized third parties of the Company’s intellectual property. The Company seeks to limit that threat through a combination of approaches, including offering legitimate market alternatives, deploying digital rights management technologies, pursuing legal sanctions for infringement, promoting appropriate legislative initiatives and international treaties and enhancing public awareness of the meaning and value of intellectual property and intellectual property laws. Piracy, including in the digital environment, continues to present a threat to revenues from products and services based on intellectual property.

Third parties may challenge the validity or scope of the Company’s intellectual property from time to time, and such challenges could result in the limitation or loss of intellectual property rights. Even if not valid, such claims may result in substantial costs and diversion of resources that could have an adverse effect on the Company’s operations.
