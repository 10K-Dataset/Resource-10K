ITEM 1.BUSINESS



D.R. Horton, Inc. is one of the largest homebuilding companies in the United States. We construct and sell homes through our operating divisions in26states and77metropolitan markets of the United States, primarily under the name of D.R. Horton,America’s Builder. Our common stock is included in the S&P 500 Index and listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol “DHI.” Unless the context otherwise requires, the terms “D.R. Horton,” the “Company,” “we” and “our” used herein refer to D.R. Horton, Inc., a Delaware corporation, and its predecessors and subsidiaries.



Donald R. Horton began our homebuilding business in 1978. In 1991, we were incorporated in Delaware to acquire the assets and businesses of our predecessor companies, which were residential home construction and development companies owned or controlled by Mr. Horton. In 1992, we completed our initial public offering of our common stock. Our company’s growth over the years was achieved by investing available capital into our existing homebuilding markets and into start-up operations in new markets. Additionally, we acquired other homebuilding companies, which strengthened our position in existing markets and expanded our geographic presence and product offerings in other markets. Our homes generally range in size from1,000to4,000square feet and in price from$100,000to$600,000. For the year endedSeptember 30, 2012, we closed18,890homes with an average sales price of approximately$223,300.



Through our financial services operations, we provide mortgage financing and title agency services to homebuyers in many of our homebuilding markets. DHI Mortgage, our 100% owned subsidiary, provides mortgage financing services primarily to our homebuilding customers and generally sells the mortgages it originates and the related servicing rights to third-party purchasers. DHI Mortgage originates loans in accordance with purchaser guidelines and historically has sold most of its mortgage production within 30 days of origination. Our subsidiary title companies serve as title insurance agents by providing title insurance policies, examination and closing services, primarily to our homebuilding customers.



Our financial reporting segments consist of six homebuilding segments and a financial services segment. Our homebuilding operations are the most substantial part of our business, comprising approximately97%of consolidated revenues, which totaled$4.4 billionin fiscal2012. Our homebuilding operations generate most of their revenues from the sale of completed homes, with a lesser amount from the sale of land and lots. In addition to building traditional single-family detached homes, we also build attached homes, such as town homes, duplexes, triplexes and condominiums. The sale of detached homes generated approximately90%of home sales revenues in fiscal2012. Our financial services segment generates its revenues from originating and selling mortgages and collecting fees for title insurance agency and closing services.

Operating Strategy and Structure



For a substantial part of our company's existence, we achieved significant growth and profitability through an operating strategy focused on capturing greater market share while maintaining a strong balance sheet. To execute our strategy, we invested available capital in our existing homebuilding markets, opportunistically entered new markets and acquired other homebuilding companies.



During the industry downturn over the last several years, we managed our business to generate a significant amount of cash from operations. We used this cash to reduce our outstanding debt and increase our cash balances, which provided us with a strong liquidity position, lower balance sheet leverage and improved operational flexibility. We also implemented restrictive land and lot inventory investment guidelines and did not increase our inventory levels from 2007 through 2011.



Although new home demand remains at low historical levels, in fiscal 2012 we saw an improvement in demand that has positively impacted our profitability and our confidence in the new home market. We have begun increasing our capital investments in land, lot and home inventories to expand our operations, while controlling our construction costs and selling and overhead expenses to increase our profitability. We expect, however, that the recent improvement in conditions will continue to be uneven across our markets in the near term. Our strong balance sheet and liquidity provide us flexibility to execute the appropriate operating strategy in each of our markets based on the relative strength or weakness of housing conditions in each market.



Geographic Diversity



Our homebuilding business began in the Dallas/Fort Worth area, which is still one of our largest local homebuilding operations and home to our corporate headquarters. We significantly expanded our business across the United States by entering additional markets through start-up operations and acquisitions, and we currently operate in26states and77markets. This provides us with geographic diversification in our homebuilding inventory investments and our sources of revenues and earnings. We believe our diversification strategy helps to mitigate the effects of local and regional economic cycles and enhances our long-term potential.



Economies of Scale



We are the largest homebuilding company in the United States in terms of number of homes closed in fiscal2012. By the same measure, we are also one of the five largest builders in many of our markets in fiscal2012. We believe that our national, regional and local scale of operations provides us with benefits that may not be available in the same degree to some other smaller homebuilders, such as:

•Greater access to and lower cost of capital, due to our strong balance sheet and our lending and capital markets relationships;

•Negotiation of volume discounts and rebates from national, regional and local materials suppliers and lower labor rates from certain subcontractors; and

•Enhanced leverage of our general and administrative activities, which allows us greater flexibility to compete for greater market share in each of our markets.



Decentralized Operations



We decentralize our homebuilding activities to give operating flexibility to our local division presidents on certain key operating decisions. AtSeptember 30, 2012, we had32separate homebuilding operating divisions, many of which operate in more than one market area. Generally, each operating division consists of a division president; land entitlement, acquisition and development personnel; a sales manager and sales personnel; a construction manager and construction superintendents; customer service personnel; a controller; a purchasing manager and office staff. We believe that division presidents and their management teams, who are familiar with local conditions, generally have better information on which to base many decisions regarding their operations. Our division presidents receive performance bonuses based upon achieving targeted financial and operating metrics related to their operating divisions.









Operating Division Responsibilities



Each operating division is responsible for:

•Site selection, which involves

— A feasibility study;

— Soil and environmental reviews;

— Review of existing zoning and other governmental requirements; and

— Review of the need for and extent of offsite work required to meet local building codes;

•Negotiating lot option, land acquisition and related contracts;

•Obtaining all necessary land development and home construction approvals;

•Selecting land development subcontractors and ensuring their work meets our contracted scopes;

•Selecting building plans and architectural schemes;

•Selecting construction subcontractors and ensuring their work meets our contracted scopes;

•Planning and managing homebuilding schedules;

•Developing and implementing local marketing plans;

•Determining the pricing for each house plan in a given community; and

•Coordinating post-closing customer service and warranty repairs.



Centralized Controls



We centralize the key risk elements of our homebuilding business through our regional and corporate offices. We have four separate homebuilding regional offices. Generally, each regional office consists of a region president, legal counsel, a chief financial officer and limited office support staff. Each of our region presidents and their management teams are responsible for oversight of the operations of certain homebuilding operating divisions, including:

•Review and approval of division business plans and budgets;

•Review of all land and lot acquisition contracts;

•Review of all business and financial analysis for potential land and lot inventory investments;

•Oversight of land and home inventory levels; and

•Review of major personnel decisions and division incentive compensation plans.











Our corporate executives and corporate office departments are responsible for establishing our operational policies and internal control standards and for monitoring compliance with established policies and controls throughout our operations. The corporate office also has primary responsibility for direct management of certain key risk elements and initiatives through the following centralized functions:

•Financing;

•Cash management;

•Risk and litigation management;

•Allocation of capital;

•Issuance and monitoring of inventory investment guidelines to our operating divisions;

•Monitoring and analysis of margins, expenses, profitability and inventory levels;

•Environmental assessments of land and lot acquisitions;

•Approval and funding of land and lot acquisitions;

•Accounting and management reporting;

•Internal audit;

•Information technology systems;

•Administration of payroll and employee benefits;

•Negotiation of national purchasing contracts;

•Administration of customer satisfaction surveys and reporting of results; and

•Approval of major personnel decisions and management incentive compensation plans.



Cost Management



We control overhead costs by centralizing certain administrative and accounting functions and by monitoring staffing and compensation levels of administrative and management personnel. We review other general and administrative costs to identify efficiencies and savings opportunities in our operating divisions and our regional and corporate offices. We also direct many of our promotional activities toward local real estate brokers, which we believe is an efficient use of our advertising expenditures.



We control construction costs by striving to design our homes efficiently and by obtaining competitive bids for construction materials and labor. We also seek to negotiate favorable pricing from our primary subcontractors and suppliers based on the volume of services and products we purchase from them on a local, regional and national basis. We compare our land development expenditures to budgeted amounts and monitor our construction costs on each house. We review our overall inventory levels, margins, expenses and profitability through our management information systems.



Acquisitions



We routinely evaluate opportunities to profitably expand our operations, including potential acquisitions of other homebuilding or related businesses. In fiscal 2012, we acquired the homebuilding operations of a company that operates in our Southeast region. Acquisitions of homebuilding businesses can provide us with immediate land and home inventories, as well as control of additional land and lot positions through option contracts. In addition, employees may have specialized knowledge of local market conditions, including existing relationships with municipalities, land owners, developers, subcontractors and suppliers. These inventory positions and local market knowledge and relationships could take us several years to develop through our own start-up efforts. We seek to limit the risks associated with acquiring other companies by conducting extensive operational, financial and legal due diligence on each acquisition and by performing financial analysis to determine that each acquisition will have a positive impact on our earnings within an acceptable period of time.









Markets



We conduct our homebuilding operations in the geographic regions, states and markets listed below, and we conduct our mortgage and title operations in many of these markets. Our homebuilding operating divisions are aggregated into six reporting segments, also referred to as reporting regions, which comprise the markets below. Our financial statements contain additional information regarding segment performance.

When evaluating new or existing homebuilding markets for purposes of capital allocation, we consider local, market-specific factors, including among others:

•Economic conditions;

•Employment levels and job growth;

•Income level of potential homebuyers;

•Local housing affordability and typical mortgage products utilized;

•Market for homes at our targeted price points;

•Availability of land and lots on acceptable terms;

•Land entitlement and development processes;

•New and secondary home sales activity;

•Competition; and

•Prevailing housing products, features, cost and pricing.



Land Policies



We acquire land after we have completed due diligence and generally after we have obtained the rights (known as entitlements) to begin development or construction work resulting in an acceptable number of residential lots. Before we acquire lots or tracts of land, we will, among other things, complete a feasibility study, which includes soil tests, independent environmental studies and other engineering work. We also evaluate the status of necessary zoning and other governmental entitlements required to develop and use the property for home construction. Although we purchase and develop land primarily to support our homebuilding activities, we may sell land and lots to other developers and homebuilders where we have excess land and lot positions.



We also enter into land/lot option contracts, in which we obtain the right, but generally not the obligation, to buy land or lots at predetermined prices on a defined schedule commensurate with anticipated home closings or planned development. Our option contracts generally are non-recourse, which limits our financial exposure to our earnest money deposited with land and lot sellers and any pre-acquisition due diligence costs we incurred. This enables us to control land and lot positions with limited capital investment, which substantially reduces the risks associated with land ownership and development.



Almost all of our land and lot positions are acquired directly by us. We are a party to a small number of joint ventures, all of which are consolidated in our financial statements.



We attempt to mitigate our exposure to real estate inventory risks by:

•Managing our supply of land/lots controlled (owned and optioned) in each market based on anticipated future home closing levels;

•Monitoring local market and demographic trends, housing preferences and related economic developments, including the identification of desirable housing submarkets based on the quality of local schools, new job opportunities, local growth initiatives and personal income trends;

•Utilizing land/lot option contracts, where possible;

•Seeking to acquire developed lots which are substantially ready for home construction, where possible;

•Limiting the size of acquired land parcels to smaller tracts, where possible, and controlling our investments in land acquisition, land development and housing inventory to match the expected housing demand in each of our operating markets;

•Generally commencing construction of custom features or optional upgrades on homes under contract only after the buyer’s receipt of mortgage approval and receipt of satisfactory deposits from the buyer; and

•Monitoring and managing the number of speculative homes (homes under construction without an executed sales contract) built in each subdivision.









Construction



Our home designs are selected or prepared in each of our markets to appeal to the tastes and preferences of local homebuyers in each community. We also offer optional interior and exterior features to allow homebuyers to enhance the basic home design and to allow us to generate additional revenues from each home sold. We continually adjust our product offerings to address our customers’ expectations for affordability, home size and features.



Substantially all of our construction work is performed by subcontractors. Subcontractors typically are selected after a competitive bidding process and retained for a specific subdivision or series of house plans pursuant to a contract that obligates the subcontractor to complete construction at an agreed-upon price. Agreements with the subcontractors and suppliers we use generally are negotiated for each subdivision or series of house plans. We employ construction superintendents to monitor homes under construction, participate in major design and building decisions, coordinate the activities of subcontractors and suppliers, review the work of subcontractors for quality and cost controls and monitor compliance with zoning and building codes. In addition, our construction superintendents play a significant role in working with our homebuyers by assisting with option selection and home modification decisions, educating buyers on the construction process and instructing buyers on post-closing home maintenance.



Construction time for our homes depends on the weather, availability of labor, materials and supplies, size of the home, and other factors. We typically complete the construction of a home within three to six months.



We typically do not maintain significant inventories of construction materials, except for work in progress materials for homes under construction. Generally, the construction materials used in our operations are readily available from numerous sources. We have contracts exceeding one year with certain suppliers of our building materials that are cancelable at our option with 30 days notice. As housing demand and activity began to increase in fiscal 2012, we experienced minor shortages and delays of materials and labor in some of our operating markets which we expect to be temporary and which have not had a material effect on our consolidated operating results.



Marketing and Sales



We market and sell our homes through commissioned employees and independent real estate brokers. We typically conduct home sales from sales offices located in furnished model homes in each subdivision, and we typically do not offer our model homes for sale until the completion of a subdivision. Our sales personnel assist prospective homebuyers by providing them with floor plans, price information, tours of model homes and assisting them with the selection of options and other custom features. We train and inform our sales personnel as to the availability of financing, construction schedules, and marketing and advertising plans. As our customers are typically first-time or move-up homebuyers, we attempt to adjust our product mix and pricing within our homebuilding markets to keep our homes affordable. As market conditions warrant, we may provide potential homebuyers with one or more of a variety of incentives, including discounts and free upgrades, to be competitive in a particular market.



We market our homes and communities to prospective homebuyers and real estate brokers in our local markets through electronic media, including email, social networking sites and our company Internet website, as well as brochures, flyers, newsletters and promotional events. We also use billboards, radio, television and newspaper advertising as necessary in each local market. We attempt to position our subdivisions in locations that are desirable to potential homebuyers and convenient to or visible from local traffic patterns, which helps to minimize advertising costs. We believe that model homes play a substantial role in our marketing efforts and therefore expend significant effort to create an attractive atmosphere in our model homes.



We also build speculative homes in most of our subdivisions. These homes enhance our marketing and sales efforts to prospective homebuyers who are relocating to these markets, as well as to independent brokers, who often represent homebuyers requiring a completed home within a short time frame. We determine our speculative homes strategy in each market based on local market factors, such as new job growth, the number of job relocations, housing demand and supply, seasonality, current sales contract cancellation trends and our past experience in the market. We maintain a level of speculative home inventory in each subdivision based on our current and planned sales pace, and we monitor and adjust speculative home inventory on an ongoing basis as conditions warrant. Speculative homes help to provide us with opportunities to sell additional homes at a profit and generate positive returns and cash flows on our inventory of owned lots.











Our sales contracts require an earnest money deposit which varies in amount among our markets and subdivisions. Additionally, customers are generally required to pay additional deposits when they select options or upgrade features for their homes. Most of our sales contracts stipulate that when customers cancel their contracts with us, we have the right to retain their earnest money and option deposits; however, our operating divisions often choose to refund the deposit. Our sales contracts also include a financing contingency which permits customers to cancel and receive a refund of their deposit if they cannot obtain mortgage financing at prevailing or specified interest rates within a specified period. Our contracts may include other contingencies, such as the sale of an existing home. As a percentage of gross sales orders, cancellations of sales contracts in fiscal2012were24%, compared to27%in fiscal2011. The length of time between the signing of a sales contract for a home and delivery of the home to the buyer (closing) is generally from two to six months.



Customer Service and Quality Control



Our operating divisions are responsible for pre-closing quality control inspections and responding to customers’ post-closing needs. We believe that a prompt and courteous response to homebuyers’ needs during and after construction reduces post-closing repair costs, enhances our reputation for quality and service and ultimately leads to repeat and referral business from the real estate community and homebuyers. We typically provide our homebuyers with a ten-year limited warranty for major defects in structural elements such as framing components and foundation systems, a two-year limited warranty on major mechanical systems, and a one-year limited warranty on other construction components. The subcontractors who perform the actual construction also provide us with warranties on workmanship and are generally prepared to respond to us and the homeowner promptly upon request. In addition, some of our suppliers provide manufacturer’s warranties on specified products installed in the home.



Sales Order Backlog



AtSeptember 30, 2012, the value of our backlog of sales orders was$1,667.9 million(7,240homes), an increase of61%from$1,036.2 million(4,854homes) atSeptember 30, 2011. The average sales price of homes in backlog was$230,400atSeptember 30, 2012, up8%from the$213,500average atSeptember 30, 2011. Sales order backlog represents homes under contract but not yet closed at the end of the period. Many of the contracts in our sales order backlog are subject to contingencies, including mortgage loan approval and buyers selling their existing homes, which can result in cancellations. A portion of the contracts in backlog will not result in closings due to cancellations. Substantially all of the homes in our sales backlog atSeptember 30, 2012are scheduled to close in fiscal year2013. Further discussion of our backlog is provided in Item 7 “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” under Part II of this annual report on Form 10-K.



Customer Mortgage Financing



We provide mortgage financing services principally to purchasers of our homes in the majority of our homebuilding markets through our 100% owned subsidiary, DHI Mortgage. DHI Mortgage assists in the sales transaction by coordinating the mortgage application, mortgage commitment and home closing processes to facilitate a timely and efficient home-buying experience for our buyers. DHI Mortgage originates mortgage loans for a substantial portion of our homebuyers. During the year endedSeptember 30, 2012, DHI Mortgage provided mortgage financing services for approximately59%of our total homes closed, and approximately84%of DHI Mortgage’s loan volume related to homes closed by our homebuilding operations.



To limit the risks associated with our mortgage operations, DHI Mortgage originates loan products that we believe can be sold to third-party purchasers. DHI Mortgage generally sells the loans and their servicing rights to third-party purchasers shortly after origination with limited recourse provisions. In markets where we currently do not provide mortgage financing, we work with a variety of mortgage lenders that make available to homebuyers a range of mortgage financing programs.



Title Services



Through our subsidiary title companies, we serve as a title insurance agent in selected markets by providing title insurance policies, examination and closing services primarily to the purchasers of homes we build and sell. We currently assume little or no underwriting risk associated with these title policies.









Employees



AtSeptember 30, 2012, we employed3,477persons, of whom923were sales and marketing personnel,1,081were executive, administrative and clerical personnel,736were involved in construction and737worked in mortgage and title operations. We believe that our relations with our employees are good.



Competition



The homebuilding industry is highly competitive. We compete with numerous other national, regional and local homebuilders for homebuyers, desirable properties, raw materials, skilled labor, employees, management talent and financing. We also compete with resales of existing homes, foreclosed homes and with the rental housing market. Our homes compete on the basis of quality, price, design, mortgage financing terms and location. Our financial services business competes with other mortgage lenders, including national, regional and local mortgage bankers and other financial institutions, some of which are subject to fewer government regulations or have greater access to capital, different lending criteria and broader product offerings.



Governmental Regulation and Environmental Matters



The homebuilding industry is subject to extensive and complex regulations. We and the subcontractors we use must comply with many federal, state and local laws and regulations, including zoning, density and development requirements, building, environmental, advertising, labor and real estate sales rules and regulations. These regulations and requirements affect the development process, as well as building materials to be used, building designs and minimum elevation of properties. Our homes are inspected by local authorities where required, and homes eligible for insurance or guarantees provided by the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) and the Department of Veteran Affairs (VA) are subject to inspection by them. These regulations often provide broad discretion to the administering governmental authorities. In addition, our new housing developments may be subject to various assessments for schools, parks, streets, utilities and other public improvements.



Our homebuilding operations are also subject to an extensive variety of local, state and federal statutes, ordinances, rules and regulations concerning protection of health, safety and the environment. The particular environmental laws for each site vary greatly according to location, environmental condition and the present and former uses of the site and adjoining properties.



Our mortgage company and title insurance agencies must comply with extensive federal and state laws and regulations as administered by numerous federal and state government agencies. These include eligibility and other requirements for participation in the programs offered by the FHA, VA, Government National Mortgage Association (Ginnie Mae), Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae), Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac) and the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA). These laws and regulations also require compliance with consumer lending laws and other regulations governing disclosure requirements, prohibitions against discrimination and real estate settlement procedures. These laws and regulations subject our operations to examination by the applicable agencies.



Seasonality



Prior to the recent downturn in the homebuilding industry which began to affect our seasonal patterns in fiscal 2007, we experienced relatively predictable seasonal variations in our quarterly operating results and capital requirements. We began to experience our normal seasonal pattern again in both fiscal 2011 and 2012. We generally have more homes under construction, close more homes and have greater revenues and operating income in the third and fourth quarters of our fiscal year. The seasonal activity increases our working capital requirements for our homebuilding operations during the third and fourth fiscal quarters and increases our funding requirements for the mortgages we originate in our financial services segment at the end of these quarters. As a result of seasonal activity, our quarterly results of operations and financial position at the end of a particular fiscal quarter are not necessarily representative of the balance of our fiscal year.
