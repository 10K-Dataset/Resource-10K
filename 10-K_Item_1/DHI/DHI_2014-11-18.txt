ITEM 1.BUSINESS



D.R. Horton, Inc. is the largest homebuilding company by volume in the United States. We construct and sell homes through our operating divisions in27states and79metropolitan markets of the United States, under the names of D.R. Horton,America’s Builder, Express Homes, Emerald Homes, Breland Homes, Regent Homes and Crown Communities. Our common stock is included in the S&P 500 Index and listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol “DHI.” Unless the context otherwise requires, the terms “D.R. Horton,” the “Company,” “we” and “our” used herein refer to D.R. Horton, Inc., a Delaware corporation, and its predecessors and subsidiaries.



Donald R. Horton began our homebuilding business in 1978 in Fort Worth, Texas. In 1991, we were incorporated in Delaware to acquire the assets and businesses of our predecessor companies, which were residential home construction and development companies owned or controlled by Mr. Horton. In 1992, we completed the initial public offering of our common stock. Our company expanded and diversified its operations geographically over the years by investing available capital into our existing homebuilding markets and into start-up operations in new markets, as well as by acquiring other homebuilding companies. Our product offerings across our operating markets are broad and diverse. Our homes range in size from1,000to more than4,000square feet and in price from$100,000to more than$1,000,000. For the year endedSeptember 30, 2014, we closed28,670homes with an average sales price of approximately$272,200.



Through our financial services operations, we provide mortgage financing and title agency services to homebuyers in many of our homebuilding markets. DHI Mortgage, our 100% owned subsidiary, provides mortgage financing services primarily to our homebuilding customers and generally sells the mortgages it originates and the related servicing rights to third-party purchasers. DHI Mortgage originates loans in accordance with purchaser guidelines and sells substantially all of its mortgage production shortly after origination. Our subsidiary title companies serve as title insurance agents by providing title insurance policies, examination and closing services, primarily to our homebuilding customers.



Our financial reporting segments consist of six homebuilding segments and a financial services segment. Our homebuilding operations are the most substantial part of our business, comprising approximately98%of consolidated revenues, which totaled$8.0 billionin fiscal2014. Our homebuilding operations generate most of their revenues from the sale of completed homes, with a lesser amount from the sale of land and lots. Approximately90%of our home sales revenue in fiscal2014came from the construction and sale of single-family detached homes, with the remainder from attached homes, such as town homes, duplexes, triplexes and condominiums. Our financial services segment generates its revenues from originating and selling mortgages and collecting fees for title insurance agency and closing services.



In addition to our homebuilding and financial services operations, we have ancillary activities that are related to our homebuilding business and real estate holdings, but are not components of our core homebuilding operations. These include the activities of our captive insurance subsidiary and other insurance-related subsidiaries, subsidiaries that own rental properties and collect rental income, and subsidiaries that own income-producing assets such as non-residential real estate, mineral rights and other rights or assets. These ancillary activities and the related income or loss are not significant, either individually or in the aggregate.

OPERATING STRUCTURE AND PROCESSES



Following is an overview of our company's operating structure and the significant processes that support our business controls, strategies and performance.



Homebuilding Markets



Our homebuilding business began in the Dallas/Fort Worth area, which is still one of our largest local homebuilding operations and home to our corporate headquarters. We currently operate in27states and79markets, which provides us with geographic diversification in our homebuilding inventory investments and our sources of revenues and earnings. We believe our geographic diversification lowers our operational risks by mitigating the effects of local and regional economic cycles, and it also enhances our earnings potential by providing more diverse opportunities to invest in our business.












We conduct our homebuilding operations in the geographic regions, states and markets listed below, and we conduct our mortgage and title operations in many of these markets. Our homebuilding operating divisions are aggregated into six reporting segments, also referred to as reporting regions, which comprise the markets below. Our financial statements contain additional information regarding segment performance.

When evaluating new or existing homebuilding markets for purposes of capital allocation, we consider local, market-specific factors, including among others:

•Economic conditions;

•Employment levels and job growth;

•Income level of potential homebuyers;

•Local housing affordability and typical mortgage products utilized;

•Market for homes at our targeted price points;

•Availability of land and lots in desirable locations on acceptable terms;

•Land entitlement and development processes;

•Availability of qualified subcontractors;

•New and secondary home sales activity;

•Competition; and

•Prevailing housing products, features, cost and pricing.



Economies of Scale



We are the largest homebuilding company in the United States in fiscal2014as measured by number of homes closed and revenues, and we are also one of the largest builders in many of the markets in which we operate. We believe that our national, regional and local scale of operations provides us with benefits that may not be available to the same degree to some other smaller homebuilders, such as:

•Greater access to and lower cost of capital, due to our balance sheet strength and our lending and capital markets relationships;

•Negotiation of volume discounts and rebates from national, regional and local materials suppliers and lower labor rates from certain subcontractors; and

•Enhanced leverage of our general and administrative activities, which allow us flexibility to adjust to changes in market conditions and compete effectively in each of our markets.



Decentralized Homebuilding Operations



We view homebuilding as a local business; therefore, most of our direct homebuilding activities are decentralized, which provides flexibility to our local managers on operational decisions. AtSeptember 30, 2014, we had37separate homebuilding operating divisions, many of which operate in more than one market area. Generally, each operating division consists of a division president; a controller; land entitlement, acquisition and development personnel; a sales manager and sales and marketing personnel; a construction manager and construction superintendents; customer service personnel; a purchasing manager and office staff. We believe that our division presidents and their management teams, who are familiar with local conditions, generally have the best information on which to base many decisions regarding their operations. Our division presidents receive performance based compensation if they achieve targeted financial and operating metrics related to their operating divisions. Following is a summary of our homebuilding activities that are decentralized in our local operating divisions, and the control and oversight functions that are centralized in our regional and corporate offices:










Operating Division Responsibilities



Each operating division is responsible for:

•Site selection, which involves

— A feasibility study;

— Soil and environmental reviews;

— Review of existing zoning and other governmental requirements;

— Review of the need for and extent of offsite work required to obtain project entitlements; and

— Financial analysis of the potential project;

•Negotiating lot option, land acquisition and related contracts;

•Obtaining all necessary land development and home construction approvals;

•Selecting land development subcontractors and ensuring their work meets our contracted scopes;

•Selecting building plans and architectural schemes;

•Selecting construction subcontractors and ensuring their work meets our contracted scopes;

•Planning and managing homebuilding schedules;

•Developing and implementing local marketing and sales plans;

•Determining the pricing for each house plan in a given community; and

•Coordinating post-closing customer service and warranty repairs.



Centralized Controls



We centralize many important risk elements of our homebuilding business through our regional and corporate offices. We have five separate homebuilding regional offices. Generally, each regional office consists of a region president, legal counsel, a chief financial officer and limited office support staff. Each of our region presidents and their management teams are responsible for oversight of the operations of a number of homebuilding operating divisions, including:

•Review and approval of division business plans and budgets;

•Review of all land and lot acquisition contracts;

•Review of all business and financial analysis for potential land and lot inventory investments;

•Oversight of land and home inventory levels;

•Monitoring division financial and operating performance; and

•Review of major personnel decisions and division incentive compensation plans.












Our corporate executives and corporate office departments are responsible for establishing our operational policies and internal control standards and for monitoring compliance with established policies and controls throughout our operations. The corporate office also has primary responsibility for direct management of certain key risk elements and initiatives through the following centralized functions:

•Financing;

•Cash management;

•Allocation of capital;

•Issuance and monitoring of inventory investment guidelines to our operating divisions;

•Approval and funding of land and lot acquisitions;

•Monitoring and analysis of margins, costs, profitability and inventory levels;

•Risk and litigation management;

•Environmental assessments of land and lot acquisitions;

•Information technology systems;

•Accounting and management reporting;

•Income taxes;

•Internal audit;

•Public reporting and investor and media relations;

•Administration of payroll and employee benefits;

•Negotiation of national purchasing contracts;

•Administration of customer satisfaction surveys and reporting of results; and

•Approval of major personnel decisions and management incentive compensation plans.



Cost Controls



We control construction costs by designing our homes efficiently and by obtaining competitive bids for construction materials and labor. We also competitively bid and negotiate pricing from our subcontractors and suppliers based on the volume of services and products we purchase on a local, regional and national basis. We monitor our land development expenditures and construction costs versus budgets for each house and community, and we review our inventory levels, margins, expenses, profitability and returns for each operating market compared to both its business plan and our performance expectations.



We control overhead costs by centralizing certain accounting and administrative functions and by monitoring staffing and compensation levels. We review other general and administrative costs to identify efficiencies and savings opportunities in our operating divisions and our regional and corporate offices. We also direct many of our promotional activities toward local real estate brokers, which we believe is an efficient use of our marketing expenditures.












Land/Lot Acquisition and Inventory Management



We acquire land for use in our homebuilding operations after we have completed due diligence and generally after we have obtained the rights (known as entitlements) to begin development or construction work resulting in an acceptable number of residential lots. Before we acquire lots or tracts of land, we complete a feasibility study, which includes soil tests, independent environmental studies, other engineering work and financial analysis. We also evaluate the status of necessary zoning and other governmental entitlements required to develop and use the property for home construction. Although we purchase and develop land primarily to support our homebuilding activities, we may sell land and lots to other developers and homebuilders where we have excess land and lot positions.



We also enter into land/lot option contracts, in which we obtain the right, but generally not the obligation, to buy land or lots at predetermined prices on a defined schedule commensurate with anticipated home closings or planned development. Our option contracts generally are non-recourse, which limits our financial exposure to our earnest money deposited into escrow under the terms of the contract and any pre-acquisition due diligence costs we incur. This enables us to control land and lot positions with limited capital investment, which substantially reduces the risks associated with land ownership and development.



We directly acquire almost all of our land and lot positions. We are a party to a small number of joint ventures, all of which are consolidated in our financial statements.



We attempt to mitigate our exposure to real estate inventory risks by:

•Managing our supply of land/lots controlled (owned and optioned) in each market based on anticipated future home closing levels;

•Monitoring local market and demographic trends, housing preferences and related economic developments, including the identification of desirable housing submarkets based on the quality of local schools, new job opportunities, local growth initiatives and personal income trends;

•Utilizing land/lot option contracts, where possible;

•Seeking to acquire developed lots which are substantially ready for home construction, where possible;

•Controlling our levels of investment in land acquisition, land development and housing inventory to match the expected housing demand in each of our operating markets;

•Generally commencing construction of custom features or optional upgrades on homes under contract only after the buyer’s receipt of mortgage approval and receipt of satisfactory deposits from the buyer; and

•Monitoring and managing the number of speculative homes (homes under construction without an executed sales contract) built in each subdivision.



Land Development and Home Construction



Substantially all of our land development and home construction work is performed by subcontractors. Subcontractors typically are selected after a competitive bidding process, and are retained for a specific subdivision or series of house plans pursuant to a contract that obligates the subcontractor to complete the scope of work at an agreed-upon price. We employ land development managers and construction superintendents to monitor land development and home construction activities, participate in major design and building decisions, coordinate the activities of subcontractors and suppliers, review the work of subcontractors for quality and cost controls and monitor compliance with zoning and building codes. In addition, our construction superintendents play a significant role in working with our homebuyers by assisting with option selection and home modification decisions, educating buyers on the construction process and instructing buyers on post-closing home maintenance.












Our home designs are selected or prepared in each of our markets to appeal to the tastes and preferences of local homebuyers in each community. We offer optional interior and exterior features to allow homebuyers to enhance the basic home design and to allow us to generate additional revenues from each home sold. We continually adjust our product offerings to address our customers’ expectations for affordability, home size and features. Construction time for our homes depends on the availability of labor, materials and supplies, the weather, the size of the home and other factors. We complete the construction of most homes withinthreetosix months.



We typically do not maintain significant inventories of land development or construction materials, except for work in progress materials for active development projects and homes under construction. Generally, the construction materials used in our operations are readily available from numerous sources. We have contracts exceeding one year with certain suppliers of building materials that are cancelable at our option.



We are subject to governmental regulations that affect our land development and construction activities. At times, we have experienced delays because of the entitlement process, which is dependent upon receiving the proper approvals from municipalities that may not be adequately staffed.



Marketing and Sales



In most of our markets, we use the D.R. Horton, Emerald Homes and Express Homes brand names to market and sell our homes. Our D.R. Horton branded communities are the core of our business and account for the substantial majority of our home closings, focusing on the first time and first time move-up homebuyer. Our Emerald branded communities, introduced in fiscal 2013, appeal to buyers in search of higher-end move-up and luxury homes. Our Express branded communities were introduced in fiscal 2014 to accommodate a segment of entry-level buyers, whose focus is primarily on affordability. In several markets, we also use the Crown Communities, Breland Homes and Regent Homes brands, after we acquired their homebuilding operations. Crown and Breland's product offerings are similar to our D.R. Horton communities, and Regent's communities are similar to our Express Homes communities. Homes marketed under our Express Homes and Regent Homes brands together represented5%of our fiscal 2014 home closings, and homes marketed under our Emerald Homes brand represented2%of our fiscal 2014 home closings.



We market and sell our homes primarily through commissioned employees, and the majority of our home closings also involve an independent real estate broker. We typically conduct home sales from sales offices located in furnished model homes in each subdivision, and we generally do not offer our model homes for sale until the completion of a subdivision. Our sales personnel assist prospective homebuyers by providing floor plans and price information, demonstrating the features and layouts of model homes and assisting with the selection of options and other custom features. We train and inform our sales personnel as to the availability of financing, construction schedules, and marketing and advertising plans. As market conditions warrant, we may provide potential homebuyers with one or more of a variety of incentives, including discounts and free upgrades, to be competitive in a particular market.



We market our homes and communities to prospective homebuyers and real estate brokers through electronic media, including email, social networking sites and our company website, as well as brochures, flyers, newsletters and promotional events. We also use billboards, radio, television, magazine and newspaper advertising as necessary in each local market. We attempt to position our subdivisions in locations that are desirable to potential homebuyers and convenient to or visible from local traffic patterns, which helps to reduce advertising costs. Model homes play a substantial role in our marketing efforts, and we expend significant effort and resources to create an attractive atmosphere in our model homes.



We also build speculative homes in most of our subdivisions. These homes enhance our marketing and sales efforts to prospective homebuyers who are renters or who are relocating to these markets, as well as to independent brokers, who often represent homebuyers requiring a home within a short time frame. We determine our speculative homes strategy in each market based on local market factors, such as new job growth, the number of job relocations, housing demand and supply, seasonality, current sales contract cancellation trends and our past experience in the market. We maintain a level of speculative home inventory in each subdivision based on our current and planned sales pace, and we monitor and adjust speculative home inventory on an ongoing basis as conditions warrant. Speculative homes help to provide us with opportunities to compete effectively with existing homes available in the market and improve our profits and returns.












Sales Contracts and Backlog



Our sales contracts require an earnest money deposit which varies in amount across our markets and subdivisions. Additionally, customers are generally required to pay additional deposits when they select options or upgrade features for their homes. Our sales contracts include a financing contingency which permits customers to cancel and receive a refund of their deposit if they cannot obtain mortgage financing at prevailing or specified interest rates within a specified period. Our contracts may include other contingencies, such as the sale of an existing home. We either retain or refund customer deposits on canceled sales contracts, depending upon the applicable provisions of the contract or other circumstances.



Sales order backlog represents homes under contract but not yet closed at the end of the period. AtSeptember 30, 2014, the value of our backlog of sales orders was$2,858.8 million(9,888homes),an increaseof29%from$2,210.1 million(8,205homes) atSeptember 30, 2013. The average sales price of homes in backlog was$289,100atSeptember 30, 2014,up7%from the$269,400average atSeptember 30, 2013. Many of the contracts in our sales order backlog are subject to contingencies, such as those described above, which can result in cancellations. A portion of the contracts in backlog will not result in closings due to cancellations. As a percentage of gross sales orders, cancellations of sales contracts were23%and24%in fiscal2014and2013, respectively.



The length of time between the signing of a sales contract for a home and delivery of the home to the buyer (closing) is generally fromtwotosix months; therefore, substantially all of the homes in our sales backlog atSeptember 30, 2014are scheduled to close in fiscal year2015. Further discussion of our backlog is provided in Item 7 “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” under Part II of this annual report on Form 10-K.



Customer Service and Quality Control



Our operating divisions are responsible for pre-closing quality control inspections and responding to customers’ post-closing needs. We believe that a prompt and courteous response to homebuyers’ needs during and after construction reduces post-closing repair costs, enhances our reputation for quality and service and ultimately leads to repeat and referral business from the real estate community and homebuyers. We typically provide our homebuyers with a ten-year limited warranty for major defects in structural elements such as framing components and foundation systems, a two-year limited warranty on major mechanical systems, and a one-year limited warranty on other construction components. The subcontractors who perform the actual construction also provide us with warranties on workmanship and are generally prepared to respond to us and the homeowner promptly upon request. In addition, some of our suppliers provide manufacturer’s warranties on specified products installed in the home.



Customer Mortgage Financing



We provide mortgage financing services principally to purchasers of our homes in the majority of our homebuilding markets through our 100% owned subsidiary, DHI Mortgage. DHI Mortgage assists in the sales transaction by coordinating the mortgage application, mortgage commitment and home closing processes to facilitate a timely and efficient home buying experience for our buyers. DHI Mortgage originates mortgage loans for a substantial portion of our homebuyers. During the year endedSeptember 30, 2014, DHI Mortgage provided mortgage financing services for approximately50%of our total homes closed, and approximately88%of DHI Mortgage’s loan volume related to homes closed by our homebuilding operations. Most of our homebuilding divisions also work with a number of additional mortgage lenders that offer a range of mortgage financing programs to our homebuyers.



To limit the risks associated with our mortgage operations, DHI Mortgage originates loan products that we believe can be sold to third-party purchasers of mortgage loans. DHI Mortgage sells substantially all of the loans and their servicing rights to third-party purchasers shortly after origination with limited recourse provisions. DHI Mortgage centralizes most of its control and oversight functions, including those related to loan underwriting, quality control, regulatory compliance, secondary marketing of loans, hedging activities, accounting and financial reporting.














Title Services



Through our subsidiary title companies, we serve as a title insurance agent in selected markets by providing title insurance policies, examination and closing services primarily to our homebuilding customers. We currently assume little or no underwriting risk associated with these title policies.



Employees



AtSeptember 30, 2014, we employed5,621persons, of whom1,364were sales and marketing personnel,1,499were involved in construction,1,662were office personnel and1,096worked in mortgage and title operations. We believe that we have good relations with our employees.



Acquisitions



We routinely evaluate opportunities to profitably expand our operations, including potential acquisitions of other homebuilding or related businesses. InAugust 2012, we acquired the homebuilding operations of Breland Homes, which operates in Huntsville and Mobile, Alabama and along the coast of Mississippi. InOctober 2013, we acquired the homebuilding operations of Regent Homes, Inc., which operates in Charlotte, Greensboro and Winston-Salem, North Carolina. InMay 2014, we acquired the homebuilding operations of Crown Communities, which operates in Georgia, South Carolina and eastern Alabama.



Acquisitions of homebuilding businesses can provide us with immediate land and home inventories, as well as control of additional land and lot positions through option contracts. In addition, employees may have specialized knowledge of local market conditions, including existing relationships with municipalities, land owners, developers, subcontractors and suppliers. These inventory positions and local market knowledge and relationships could take us several years to develop through our own start-up efforts. We seek to limit the risks associated with acquiring other companies by conducting extensive operational, financial and legal due diligence on each acquisition and by performing financial analysis to determine that each acquisition will have a positive impact on our earnings within an acceptable period of time.



Competition



The homebuilding industry is highly competitive. We compete with numerous other national, regional and local homebuilders for homebuyers, desirable properties, raw materials, skilled labor, employees, management talent and financing. We also compete with resales of existing and foreclosed homes and with the rental housing market. Our homes compete on the basis of quality, price, design, mortgage financing terms and location.



The competitors to our financial services businesses include other title companies and mortgage lenders, including national, regional and local mortgage bankers and other financial institutions. Some of these competitors are subject to fewer governmental regulations and have greater access to capital than we do, and some of them may operate with different lending criteria and may offer a broader array of financing and other products and services to consumers than we do.












Governmental Regulation and Environmental Matters



The homebuilding industry is subject to extensive and complex regulations. We and the subcontractors we use must comply with many federal, state and local laws and regulations, including zoning, density and development requirements, building, environmental, advertising, labor and real estate sales rules and regulations. These regulations and requirements affect substantially all aspects of our land development and home design, construction and sales processes in varying degrees across our markets. Our homes are inspected by local authorities where required, and homes eligible for insurance or guarantees provided by the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) and the Department of Veteran Affairs (VA) are subject to inspection by them. These regulations often provide broad discretion to the administering governmental authorities. In addition, our new housing developments may be subject to various assessments for schools, parks, streets, utilities and other public improvements.



Our homebuilding operations are also subject to an extensive variety of local, state and federal statutes, ordinances, rules and regulations concerning protection of health, safety and the environment. The particular environmental laws for each site vary greatly according to location, environmental condition and the present and former uses of the site and adjoining properties.



Our mortgage company and title insurance agencies must comply with extensive federal and state laws and regulations as administered by numerous federal and state government agencies. These include eligibility and other requirements for participation in the programs offered by the FHA, VA, Government National Mortgage Association (Ginnie Mae), Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae), Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac) and the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA). These laws and regulations also require compliance with consumer lending laws and other regulations governing disclosure requirements, prohibitions against discrimination and real estate settlement procedures. These laws and regulations subject our operations to regular, extensive examinations by the applicable agencies.



Seasonality



Although significant changes in market conditions have impacted our seasonal patterns in the past and could do so again in the future, we generally have more homes under construction, close more homes and have greater revenues and operating income in the third and fourth quarters of our fiscal year. The seasonal activity increases our working capital requirements for our homebuilding operations during our third and fourth fiscal quarters and increases our funding requirements for the mortgages we originate in our financial services segment at the end of these quarters. As a result of seasonal activity, our quarterly results of operations and financial position at the end of a particular fiscal quarter are not necessarily representative of the balance of our fiscal year.
