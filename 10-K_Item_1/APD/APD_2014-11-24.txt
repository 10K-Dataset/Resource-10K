Narrative Description of Business by Segments

Merchant Gases

Merchant Gases provides atmospheric gases, such as oxygen, nitrogen, and argon (primarily recovered by the cryogenic
distillation of air); process gases such as hydrogen, helium (purchased or refined from crude helium), and carbon dioxide; specialty gases; temporary gas supply services; and equipment, throughout the world to customers in diversified industries,
including metals, glass, electronics, chemical processing, food processing, healthcare, general manufacturing, and petroleum and natural gas industries.

Merchant Gases supplies the following types of products:

Liquid
bulk—Product is delivered in bulk (in liquid or gaseous form) by tanker or tube trailer and stored, usually in its liquid state, in equipment designed and installed by the Company at the customer’s site for vaporizing into a gaseous
state as needed. Liquid bulk sales are typically governed by three- to five-year contracts.

Packaged
gases—Small quantities of product are delivered in either cylinders or dewars. The Company operates packaged gas businesses in Europe, Asia, and Latin America. In the United States, the Company’s packaged gas business sells products
only for the electronics and magnetic resonance imaging (principally helium) industries.

Small on-site
plants—Customers receive product through small on-sites (cryogenic or noncryogenic generators), either by a sale of gas contract or the sale of the equipment to the customer.

Electric power is the largest cost component in the production of atmospheric gases—oxygen, nitrogen, and argon. Natural gas is
also an energy source at a number of the Company’s Merchant Gases facilities. The Company mitigates energy and natural gas price increases through pricing formulas and surcharges. Helium is primarily produced as a by-product of natural gas
production. We purchase crude helium for purification and resale. During fiscal year 2014, we experienced shortages in helium supply due to industry-wide sourcing shortfalls, and the supply/demand dynamics in this product continue to evolve. No
other significant difficulties were encountered in obtaining adequate supplies of energy or raw materials during the year.

Merchant Gases competes worldwide against three global industrial gas companies: L’Air Liquide S.A.; Linde AG; and Praxair,
Inc.; and several regional sellers (including Airgas, Inc., primarily with respect to liquid bulk sales). Competition in industrial gases is based primarily on price, reliability of supply, and the development of industrial gas applications.

Merchant Gases sales constituted 41% of consolidated sales in fiscal year 2014, 40% in fiscal year 2013, and 38% in
fiscal year 2012. Sales of atmospheric gases (oxygen, nitrogen, and argon) via the Liquid bulk, Packaged gases







and Small on-site plants supply modes constituted approximately 49% of the Merchant Gases segment in fiscal year 2014, 48% in fiscal year 2013, and 54% in fiscal year 2012. These sales
constituted approximately 20% of the total Company consolidated sales in fiscal year 2014, 19% in fiscal year 2013, and 21% in fiscal year 2012.

The Company owns a 67.3% controlling interest in the outstanding shares of Indura S.A., an industrial gas company in South America which produces packaged and liquid bulk gases and sells related hard goods. Indura
S.A. is accounted for as part of the Merchant Gases operating segment. The Merchant Gases segment also includes the Company’s share of the results of several joint ventures accounted for by the equity method. The largest of these joint ventures
operate in Mexico, Italy, South Africa, Saudi Arabia, India, and Thailand.

Tonnage Gases

Tonnage Gases provides hydrogen, carbon monoxide, nitrogen, oxygen, and syngas (a hydrogen-carbon monoxide mixture) principally to
the energy production and refining, chemical, and metallurgical industries worldwide. Gases are produced at large facilities located adjacent to customers’ facilities or by pipeline systems from centrally located production facilities and are
generally governed by contracts with 15- to 20- year terms. The Company is the world’s largest provider of hydrogen, which is used by oil refiners to facilitate the conversion of heavy crude feedstock and lower the sulfur content of gasoline
and diesel fuels to reduce smog and ozone depletion. The energy production industry uses nitrogen injection for enhanced recovery of oil and natural gas and oxygen for gasification. The metallurgical industry uses nitrogen for inerting and oxygen
for the manufacture of steel and certain nonferrous metals. The chemical industry uses hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, carbon monoxide, and syngas as feedstocks in the production of many basic chemicals. The Company delivers product through pipelines
from centrally located facilities in or near the United States Gulf Coast; Los Angeles, California; Alberta, Canada; Rotterdam, the Netherlands; the United Kingdom; Western Belgium; Ulsan, Korea; Nanjing, China; Tangshan, China; Kuan Yin, Taiwan;
and Singapore. The Company also owns less than controlling interests in pipelines located in Thailand and South Africa.

Natural gas is the principal raw material for hydrogen, carbon monoxide, and syngas production. Electric power is the largest cost
component in the production of atmospheric gases. The Company mitigates energy and natural gas price increases through long-term cost pass-through provisions in its contracts. During fiscal year 2014, no significant difficulties were encountered in
obtaining adequate supplies of power and natural gas, however we experienced interruptions in availability of syngas, which affected our hydrogen and carbon monoxide sales in the United States Gulf Coast.

Tonnage Gases competes against three global industrial gas companies: L’Air Liquide S.A.; Linde AG; Praxair, Inc.; and several
regional competitors. Competition is based primarily on price, reliability of supply, the development of applications that use industrial gases, and, in some cases, provision of other services or products such as power and steam generation. We also
have a competitive advantage in regions where we have pipeline networks, which enable us to provide a reliable and economic supply of products to customers.

Tonnage Gases sales constituted approximately 32% of consolidated sales in fiscal year 2014, 33% in fiscal year 2013, and 33% in fiscal year 2012. Sales of hydrogen and related products constituted approximately
68% of the Tonnage Gases segment in fiscal year 2014, 62% in fiscal year 2013, and 57% in fiscal year 2012. These sales constituted approximately 22% of the total Company consolidated sales in fiscal year 2014, 21% in fiscal year 2013, and 19% in
fiscal year 2012.

Electronics and Performance Materials

Electronics and Performance Materials employs applications technology to provide solutions to a broad range of global industries
through chemical synthesis, analytical technology, process engineering, and surface science. This segment provides the electronics industry with specialty gases (such as nitrogen trifluoride, arsine, phosphine, white ammonia, silicon tetrafluoride,
carbon tetrafluoride, hexafluoroethane, tungsten hexafluoride, and critical etch gases), tonnage gases (primarily nitrogen), chemicals mechanical planarization slurries, specialty chemicals, services, and equipment primarily for the manufacture of
silicon and compound semiconductors and thin film transistor liquid crystal displays. These products are delivered through various supply chains, including bulk delivery or distribution by pipelines such as those located in California’s Silicon
Valley; Phoenix, Arizona; Tainan, Taiwan; Gumi and Giheung, Korea; and Tianjin, China.

Electronics and Performance
Materials also provides performance materials for a wide range of products, including coatings, inks, adhesives, civil engineering, personal care, institutional and industrial cleaning, mining, oil refining, and polyurethanes, and focuses on the
development of new materials aimed at providing unique functionality to emerging markets. Principal performance materials include polyurethane catalysts and other additives for







polyurethane foam, epoxy amine curing agents and auxiliary products for epoxy systems, specialty surfactants for formulated systems, and functional additives for industrial cleaning and mining
industries.

The Electronics and Performance Materials segment uses a wide variety of raw materials, including ammonia,
tungsten powder, hydrogen fluoride, amines, alcohols, epoxides, organic acids, and ketones. During fiscal year 2014, no significant difficulties were encountered in obtaining adequate supplies of energy or raw materials.

The Electronics and Performance Materials segment faces competition on a product-by-product basis against competitors ranging from
niche suppliers with a single product to larger and more vertically integrated companies. Competition is principally conducted on the basis of price, quality, product performance, reliability of product supply, technical innovation, service, and
global infrastructure.

Total sales from Electronics and Performance Materials constituted approximately 23% of total
Company consolidated sales in fiscal year 2014, 22% in fiscal year 2013, and 24% in fiscal year 2012.

Equipment and
Energy

Equipment and Energy designs and manufactures cryogenic equipment for air separation, hydrocarbon recovery
and purification, natural gas liquefaction (LNG), and helium distribution (cryogenic transportation containers), and serves energy markets in a variety of ways.

Equipment is sold globally to customers in the chemical and petrochemical manufacturing, oil and gas recovery and processing, and steel and primary metals processing industries. This business segment also provides
a broad range of plant design, engineering, procurement, and construction management services to its customers.

Energy
markets are served through the Company’s operation and partial ownership of cogeneration and flue gas desulfurization facilities. In addition, we are developing hydrogen as an energy carrier, energy-from-waste facilities to produce electricity
(Tees Valley), carbon capture technologies for a variety of industrial and power applications, and oxygen-based technologies to serve energy markets in the future. The Company operates and owns a 48.8% interest in a 112-megawatt gas-fueled power
generation facility in Thailand. The Company also operates and owns a 70% interest in a flue gas desulfurization facility in Indiana.

Steel, aluminum, and capital equipment subcomponents (compressors, etc.) are the principal raw materials in the construction of equipment in this business segment. Adequate raw materials for individual projects are
acquired under firm purchase agreements. The Company mitigates these cost components, in part, through long-term cost pass-through provisions in contracts. During fiscal year 2014, no significant difficulties were encountered in obtaining adequate
supplies of raw materials.

Equipment and Energy competes with a great number of firms for all of its offerings, except
LNG heat exchangers, for which there are fewer competitors due to the limited market size and proprietary technologies. Competition is based primarily on technological performance, service, technical know-how, price, and performance guarantees.

The backlog of equipment orders (including letters of intent believed to be firm) from third-party customers was
approximately $520 million on 30 September 2014, approximately 12% of which is for cryogenic equipment and 75% of which is for LNG heat exchangers, as compared with a total backlog of approximately $402 million on 30 September 2013. The
Company expects that approximately $320 million of the backlog on 30 September 2014 will be completed during fiscal year 2015.

Narrative Description of the Company’s Business Generally

Seasonality

Although none of the four business segments are subject to seasonal fluctuations to any material extent, the Electronics and Performance Materials segment is susceptible to the cyclical nature of the electronics
industry and to seasonal fluctuations in underlying end-use performance materials markets.

Working Capital

The Company maintains inventory where required to facilitate the supply of products to customers on a reasonable
delivery schedule. Merchant Gases inventory consists primarily of industrial, specialty gas, and crude helium inventories supplied to customers through liquid bulk and packaged gases supply modes. Electronics and Performance Materials inventories
consist primarily of bulk and packaged specialty gases and chemicals, bulk and packaged performance chemical solutions and also include inventories to support sales of equipment and services. Tonnage Gases and Equipment and Energy have limited
inventory.

Customers

We do not have a homogeneous customer base or end market, and no single customer accounts for more than 10% of our consolidated revenues. The Tonnage Gases and Electronics and Performance Materials segments do have
concentrations of customers in specific industries, primarily refining, chemicals, and electronics. Within each of these industries, the Company has several large-volume customers with long-term contracts. A negative trend affecting one of these
industries, or the loss of one of these major customers, although not material to our consolidated revenue, could have an adverse impact on the affected segment.

Governmental Contracts

No segment’s business is subject to a government entity’s renegotiation of profits or termination of contracts that would be material to our business as a whole.
