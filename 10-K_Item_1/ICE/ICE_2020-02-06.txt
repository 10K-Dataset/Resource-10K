ITEM 1.BUSINESS

Introduction

We are a leading global operator of regulated exchanges, clearing houses and listings venues, and a provider of data services for commodity, financial, fixed income and equity markets. We operate regulated marketplaces for listing, trading and clearing a broad array of derivatives contracts and securities across major asset classes, including energy and agricultural commodities, metals, interest rates, equities, exchange traded funds, or ETFs, credit derivatives, digital assets,  bonds and currencies, and also offer mortgage and technology services. In addition, we offer comprehensive data services to support the trading, investment, risk management and connectivity needs of customers around the world and across asset classes.



Our History

In 2000, ICE was founded with the idea of transforming the energy markets by creating a marketplace that removed barriers and drove greater transparency and access. By staying close to our customers, we have expanded into new asset classes and services, while retaining a core mission of reducing friction in markets and bringing efficiency to our customers’ workflows.

Today, we are a Fortune 500 company, providing a global community of market participants an array of execution venues, risk management tools, capital-raising capabilities and mission-critical data and analytics. With a leading-edge approach to developing technology, we provide trading infrastructure in major market centers around the world, offering customers the ability to manage risk and make informed decisions in the jurisdictions and asset classes of their choice. By leveraging our core strengths, we seek to continue to identify new ways to serve our customers and transform global markets.










Our Business Segments

Our business is conducted through two reportable business segments:

•Trading and Clearing; and

•Data and Listings.

The majority of our identifiable assets are located in the United States, or U.S. and the United Kingdom, or U.K. For a summary of our revenues, net assets and net property and equipment by geographic region, see Note 18 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report.

Trading and Clearing Segment

We provide execution and risk management services to businesses, investors and traders across major asset classes, such as commodities, interest rates, credit default swaps, or CDS, bonds, foreign exchange, equities and mortgage-related products. We operate multiple trading venues, including 12 regulated exchanges and six clearing houses, which are strategically positioned in major market centers around the world, including the U.S., U.K., European Union, or EU, Canada and Singapore.

The Trading and Clearing segment accounted for 49% of our consolidated revenues, or$2.5 billionin2019. Our Trading and Clearing business can experience moderate seasonal fluctuations, although such seasonal impacts have been somewhat negated in periods of high volume trading. Key asset classes include:










•Energy Futures and Options:We are a leading marketplace for global crude and refined oil. We offer trading and clearing services across a range of global benchmark contracts, including: Brent, West Texas Intermediate, or WTI, Platts Dubai, Gasoil, Heating Oil, and hundreds of additional grades and related spread contracts. The Brent complex, which includes the ICE Brent crude oil futures contract, our largest contract by volume traded, is a group of related benchmarks used to price a range of traded oil products, including approximately two-thirds of the world’s internationally traded crude oil. The ICE Low Sulphur Gasoil futures contract is a European diesel oil contract that serves as a middle distillate pricing benchmark for refined oil products, particularly in Europe and Asia. We also operate the world’s second largest market for trading in WTI crude oil futures, as measured by the volume of contracts traded. The WTI crude futures contract is the benchmark for pricing U.S. crude oil. Together, these benchmarks form the foundation for a suite of more than 600 other related oil products such as locational spreads, product spreads and refining spreads. These are precise risk management tools that benefit from the deep liquidity in, and their relationship to, our global oil benchmarks.

Our global natural gas complex spans important trading hubs from the U.S. and Canada to Europe and Asia, underpinned by a global offering of more than 800 financially and physically-delivered natural gas contracts. We support liquidity and risk management across markets, from key delivery points in the U.S. to the U.K. National Balancing Point, or NBP, and European TTF futures contracts. In Asia, our Japan Korea Marker (JKM) Liquefied Natural Gas, or LNG, futures contract has become the leading LNG benchmark.

In our power markets, we offer a global suite of electric power contracts and are the largest venue for electronic power trading in the world. In addition, we operate the world’s leading market for emissions trading, an important component of risk management for global corporations and energy intensive industries in working to mitigate climate impacts.



•Agricultural & Metals Futures and Options:We offer benchmark futures and options contracts on the most globally relevant commodities including: sugar, coffee, cocoa, cotton and frozen concentrated orange juice, as well as key metal contracts such as gold, silver and iron ore. Our markets provide global businesses effective price risk management tools to hedge input costs critical to the global flow of goods and services around the world.



•Financial Futures and Options:Our global interest rate complex spans geographies, currencies and tenors, providing market participants with effective tools to manage global interest rate risk. We offer the largest marketplace to transact in U.K. and European interest rates, including Short Sterling, Gilts, Sterling Overnight Index Average, or SONIA, and Euribor. In addition, we offer one- and three-month contracts on the Secured Overnight Financing Rates, or SOFR, adding to our interest rate complex. Other Financial Futures and Options include a range of contracts on key global equity and FX benchmarks such as the MSCI®World, MSCI®Emerging Markets, MSCI®EAFE, the FTSE®100 and the U.S. Dollar Index, or USDX.










•Cash Equities and Equity Options:Through our five registered securities exchanges, including the New York Stock Exchange, or the NYSE, we serve a broad range of global capital markets participants, including investors, traders, market makers and global corporations. With a mission to provide a transparent, efficient and high quality trading market to our customers, we operate five cash equity exchange venues and two options markets.



•Fixed Income and Credit:We offer electronic trade execution for CDS instruments and are the industry leader in global CDS clearing, as measured by gross notional cleared. ICE Bonds, our fixed income execution business, offers deep liquidity pools across multiple trading protocols, such as click-to-trade, auctions and request for quote, or RFQ, providing our customers a choice in how they manage fixed income risk.



Through ICE Mortgage Services, we operate the Mortgage Electronic Registration Systems, or MERS, a national electronic database that tracks changes in mortgage servicing and beneficial ownership interests in U.S. residential loans, and Simplifile, LC, or Simplifile, which serves as an electronic liaison between lenders, settlement agents and county recording offices, streamlining the local recording of residential mortgage transactions in the U.S.



•OTC and Other Transactions:Our over-the-counter, or OTC, energy markets comprise of bilaterally-traded energy contracts. We operate our financially-settled bilateral energy markets through ICE Swap Trade, and we offer electronic trading of contracts based on physically-settled natural gas, power and refined oil contracts through ICE U.S. OTC Commodity Markets.



•Other Revenue:Other revenues primarily include interest income on certain clearing margin deposits, regulatory penalties and fines, fees for use of our facilities, regulatory fees charged to member organizations of our U.S. securities exchanges, designated market maker service fees, technology development fees, exchange membership fees and agricultural grading and certification fees.



We operate six clearing houses, each of which acts as a central counterparty that, for its clearing members, becomes the buyer to every seller and the seller to every buyer. Through this central counterparty function, our clearing houses provide financial security for each transaction, for the duration of the position, by limiting counterparty credit risk. Our clearing houses are responsible for providing clearing services to each of our futures exchanges and certain of our clearing houses clear contracts traded outside of our execution venues.



Mechanisms have been created, called guaranty funds, to provide partial protection in the event of a clearing member default. With the exception of ICE NGX Canada Inc., or ICE NGX, each of the ICE Clearing Houses requires that each clearing member make deposits into a guaranty fund maintained by the relevant ICE Clearing House. In addition, we have contributed $404 million of our own cash to the guaranty funds included in the table below, and such amounts are at risk and could be used in the event of a clearing member default. In September 2019, we also added a layer of insurance to our clearing member default protection. The default insurance has a three-year term that commenced on September 17, 2019, for the following clearing houses in the following amounts: ICE Clear Credit -$50 million; ICE Clear Europe -$75 million; and, ICE Clear US -$25 million. In addition, ICE NGX maintains a guaranty fund of$100 millionfunded by a letter of credit issued by a major Canadian bank, and backed by default insurance.



Our contributions to each clearing house as ofDecember 31, 2019are listed below and our clearing houses are referred to herein collectively as “the ICE Clearing Houses”:

Data and Listings Segment

We provide a range of data and listing services for global financial and commodity markets, including pricing and reference data, exchange data, analytics, feeds, index services, desktops and connectivity solutions as well as corporate and ETF listing services on our cash equity exchanges. Revenues in our Data and Listings segment are largely subscription-based and recurring in nature and generally not impacted by seasonality. The Data and Listings segment generated revenues of$2.7 billionin2019and accounted for 51% of our consolidated revenues.





•Pricing and Analytics:We provide global securities evaluations, reference data, market indices, risk analytics, derivative pricing and other information designed to address our customers’ portfolio management, trading, risk management, reporting valuation and regulatory compliance needs.








We provide fixed income valuations, including independent evaluated pricing services, on 2.8 million fixed income securities and other hard-to-value financial instruments each day. These instruments span approximately 154 countries and 65 currencies that cover a wide range of financial instruments including sovereign, corporate and municipal bonds, mortgage and asset-backed securities and leveraged loans.

Our reference data complements our evaluated pricing by offering our clients a broad range of descriptive information, covering over 33 million financial instruments across over 210 markets. Our reference data coverage increased from 13 million securities in 2018 by adding both active and inactive, or historical, securities. This data is used by clients to inform risk management, support regulatory and compliance needs, create indices and improve operational efficiency. Additionally, we completed a unified and comprehensive reference data service for exchange traded derivatives, or ETD, products traded on ICE exchanges and cleared at ICE Clearing Houses.

We also offer a range of multi-asset class analytics including valuation services for OTC derivatives and structured products, best execution services, ICE Liquidity Indicators™ and fixed income and equity portfolio analytics to help analyze risk and return exposures. These offerings, including our pricing and reference data, are delivered over our secure technology platforms and are used by investment professionals to simulate various market environments to help forecast performance, construct portfolios, validate investment strategies, conduct stress testing, generate dynamic risk measures, analyze asset cash flows and support regulatory compliance requirements.

We also design and distribute many of today’s leading indices and benchmarks across fixed income, equity, commodity and currency markets. ICE Data Indices, LLC, or ICE Data Indices, which includes the ICE BofA indices, is the benchmark provider for more than $1 trillion in fund assets, and is second largest in benchmarked assets under management, or AUM, for fixed income funds. Our index calculation agent services provide clients with independent and objective operational outsourcing, including design, support, maintenance, calculation and distribution of third-party indices. Our ETF valuations service provides clients with intraday calculations of indicative net asset values, or iNAVs.

ICE Benchmark Administration, or IBA, is the regulated administrator of a range of benchmarks including the London Interbank Offered Rate, or LIBOR, the ICE Swap Rate, the London Bullion Market, or LBMA Gold and Silver Price and the ISDA Standard Initial Margin Model, or SIMM, Crowdsourcing Utility. IBA has implemented processes, governance, systems and technology that enhance the transparency and security of these benchmarks and services, which are relied upon globally.

•Exchange Data and Feeds:We provide real-time, historical, and derived pricing data, order book and transaction information related to our trading venues, which span global commodity and financial markets. We publish a broad range of proprietary data and content from our electronic futures trading platform, as well as our cash equity and equity options venues. In addition, we receive a share of revenue from the National Market System Plan, or NMS Plan. Under the NMS Plan, the Financial Industry Markets Authority, or FINRA, and all SEC-registered securities exchanges send trades and top-of-book quotes in exchange listed securities to a central consolidator, which then distributes the data pursuant to SEC-approved requirements. Finally, through our consolidated feeds business, we offer a broad array of third-party trading venues and news feeds.

•Desktops and Connectivity:Our Desktop and Connectivity services provide the connection to our exchanges, clearing houses and data centers. These services also facilitate the global distribution of our ICE Data Services data.  Through our ICE Global Network, we offer connectivity solutions to access markets and data through highly secure, resilient and low latency network options, as well as global colocation services and Direct Market Access provides connectivity to over 150 trading venues and data from over 750 third-party sources. Our ICE Global Network wireless service offers one of the most extensive ultra-low latency network connectivity solutions among the New York, Chicago, Toronto and Tokyo metro areas. Our Desktop service offers a range of products and services to support commodity and energy traders, risk managers, financial advisors, wealth managers, retail traders, Investor Relations Officers and Chief Financial Officers. These applications deliver real-time financial market information and decision-support tools to help clients analyze financial markets and make investment decisions. Our robust instant messaging, or IM, system protects the privacy of clients’ business information while allowing collaboration with nearly 100,000 market participants in the industry through a secure channel.

•Listings:Through our listings services, we offer corporate and ETF issuers access to the U.S. capital markets. Our listing venues allow companies to list domestic and international equity securities, corporate structured products, convertible bonds, trackers and debt securities. In2019, the NYSE and NYSE American LLC, or NYSE American, raised the most capital, globally, for the ninth consecutive year, with approximately $112 billion raised in initial public offerings, or IPOs, and follow-on offerings from over 300 transactions. The total capital raised by NYSE-listed and








NYSE American-listed companies was 30% higher than the capital raised by the next largest exchange and more than any other exchange in the world.

Product and Services Development

We leverage our customer relationships, global distribution, technology infrastructure and software development capabilities to diversify our products and services. We are continually developing, evaluating and testing new products for introduction into our markets to better serve our client base. The majority of our product development relates to evaluating new contracts or new markets based on customer demand. New contracts often must be reviewed and approved by relevant regulators. Outside of third-party licensing costs, we typically do not incur separate, material costs for the development of new products - such costs are embedded in our normal costs of operations.

While we primarily develop our products and services internally, we also periodically evaluate and enter into strategic partnerships and licensing arrangements to develop new products and services. We intend to continue to invest to expand our trading, clearing, data and listings offerings to serve the evolving needs of our global customer base.

Technology

Technology is a key component of our business strategy and competitive position and we regard effective execution of our technology initiatives as crucial to our sustainable business operations, market competitiveness, compliance and risk management and overall success. Our technology solutions support the entire risk management workflow: trading and clearing technology, multi-asset class analytics, risk assessment tools, robust data offerings, instant messaging capabilities and flexible connectivity and delivery solutions. Where feasible, we design and build our own systems and write our own software programs since we believe that having control over our technology allows us to be more responsive to our customers’ needs, better support the dynamic nature of our business, provide the highest quality markets and deliver relevant, timely and actionable data to the markets and customers we serve.

•ICE Trading Platform and Technology:The ICE trading platform supports trading in our cleared futures and options markets as well as our bilateral OTC markets. We also offer voice brokers a facility for submitting block trades for products that are eligible for clearing. Speed, reliability, resilience, capacity and security are critical performance criteria for electronic trading platforms. Connectivity to our trading platform for our markets is available through our web-based front-end, as well as multiple independent software vendors, or ISVs, and application programming interfaces, or APIs.

•Clearing Technology:A broad range of trade management and clearing services are offered through the integrated technology infrastructure that serves our clearing houses. The ICE clearing systems encompass a number of integrated systems, including post-trade position management, risk management, settlement and treasury and reporting functions. A core component of our derivatives clearing houses is the risk management of clearing firm members. Our extensive technology and rules-based risk systems provide analytical tools that allow us to determine margin, evaluate credit risk and monitor the trading activities and overall risk of the clearing members.



•NYSE Trading Platforms and Related Technology:The NYSE electronic trading platform features an open system architecture that allows users to access our system via one of the many front-end trading applications developed by ISVs. For equity options, we offer a hybrid model of electronic and open outcry trading through NYSE American Options and NYSE Arca Options. We developed an integrated trading platform and matching engine known as NYSE Pillar and have migrated all of our cash equity securities markets to this platform. We also expect to migrate our equity options markets to this platform, which have historically operated on distinct platforms. This integrated platform is expected to improve performance and reduce the complexity of operating multiple trading systems.



•ICE Data Services Technology:ICE Data Services technology uses integrated platforms to capture, store and process information, perform analytics and maintain connectivity solutions using a single configurable data capture mechanism and a flexible delivery capability. Together, the platforms enable real-time processing and delivery of information, accelerate new product development and improve production reliability. Our data and analytics are delivered via real-time messaging, files, web services and other on-demand facilities and state-of-the-art front-ends. In addition, the technology underpinning our ICE Global Network supports scalable bandwidth and a wide variety of connectivity options including fiber, wireless, colocation and hosting.



•Business Continuity Planning and Disaster Recovery:We maintain comprehensive business continuity and disaster recovery plans and facilities designed to enable nearly continuous availability of our markets and other








services in the event of a business disruption or disaster. We maintain incident and crisis management plans that address responses to disruptive events at any of our locations worldwide.

Cybersecurity

Our business activities rely extensively on technology and software, including the systems used by our business partners, regulators and customers. In addition, our activities involve the use and retention of confidential data and information. These activities make us susceptible to cyber-attacks. We employ the following activities, processes and strategies to evaluate, manage and address these risks.



•Strategy:We maintain a Cybersecurity Strategy, or CSS, which emphasizes consideration of the nature of our business, ongoing intelligence collection regarding cybersecurity threats, and initiatives to specifically address prominent areas of cybersecurity risk. The CSS outlines the key priorities for our cybersecurity program and the methods by which our Information Security department seeks to accomplish those goals. The CSS is ratified by the Risk Committee of our Board of Directors and when applicable, also by the corporate governance committees of our regulated subsidiaries.



•Risk Management:Thematic threats such as sabotage, fraud, and theft of assets or customer data are used to frame our risk management activities. Asset theft often involves organized crime or financially motivated nations staging sophisticated, well-planned campaigns to steal significant cash, cryptocurrency, or equivalent assets. Our thematic threats, along with others, are evaluated by our Board of Directors as well as our Risk Committee, Chief Risk Officer and Chief Information Security Officer, or CISO. The CSS provides the framework we use for assessing risk, prioritizing testing, identifying remedial actions and validating improvements. The CSS also provides for the deployment of external and internal teams of ethical hackers that operate alongside our traditional vulnerability detection processes.



•Information Sharing:We recognize the importance of collaboration and information sharing among private sector firms in the financial services sector, across sectors, and with global public-sector agencies, when appropriate. Our   cybersecurity leaders hold positions within the Financial Services Information Sharing and Analysis Center and the Financial Systemic Analysis and Resiliency Center in the U.S., the Financial Sector Cyber Collaboration Centre in the U.K., and similar organizations across the EU and in Singapore.



•Governance and Leadership:Our Information Security department is led by our CISO, who provides comprehensive reports to a dedicated internal governance committee at least quarterly outlining threat assessment, control performance, and ongoing enhancements. Additionally, cybersecurity matters are reported to and discussed with a cross-subsidiary leadership committee, the Risk Committee of our Board of Directors, and when applicable, subsidiary boards. Our CISO and other senior security leaders conduct periodic cybersecurity education sessions with our employees and directors. These sessions cover general cybersecurity topics as well as specific details regarding our cybersecurity program.



•Third-Party Review:Our information security group utilizes extensive penetration testing, vulnerability scanning, ethical hacking and maturity assessment services from global leaders in these practices. The results of these reviews alongside frequent regulatory and customer examinations are assessed, with any resulting mitigation activity assigned and tracked to remediation.



•Controls: Our identification of risks and selection of cyber-related controls is performed in the context of the critical financial infrastructure we maintain and operate. Our ongoing threat assessments are intended to identify changes in external events and in our activities, infrastructure and processes that could necessitate reprioritization of risks and controls. The nature of our business activities mandates an emphasis on sabotage and asset theft as primary threats in addition to the other typical contemporary themes of data theft. Our focus on these threats leads to an emphasis on social engineering controls, behavioral detection of insider threat, and deliberate and rehearsed recovery strategies.

We attempt to protect our intellectual property rights by relying on trademarks, patents, copyrights, database rights, trade secrets, restrictions on disclosure and other methods.

FTSE® and the FTSE indexes are trademarks and service marks of the London Stock Exchange plc and Financial Times Limited and are used under license. MSCI® and the MSCI indexes are trademarks and service marks of MSCI Inc. or its affiliates and are used under license.

Employees

As ofDecember 31, 2019, we had a total of5,989employees with 1,691 in New York, 1,035 in Atlanta, 754 in the U.K., 533 in India, and a total of 1,976 employees across our other offices around the world. Of our total employee base, less than 1% is subject to collective bargaining agreements, and such relations are considered to be good.



Our Competitive Strengths

We believe we compete on the basis of a number of factors, including:

•depth and liquidity of markets;

•price transparency;

•reliability and speed of trade execution and processing;

•technological capabilities and innovation;

•breadth of products and services;

•rate and quality of new product developments;

•quality and stability of services;

•distribution and ease of connectivity;

•mid- and back-office service offerings, including differentiated and value-added services;

•transaction costs; and

•reputation.

We believe that we compete favorably with respect to these factors, and that our deep, liquid markets, breadth of product offerings, new product development, customer relationships and efficient, secure settlement, clearing and support services distinguish us from our competitors. We believe that to maintain our competitive position, we must continue to develop new and innovative products and services, enhance our technology infrastructure, maintain liquidity and offer competitive pricing.

We believe our key strengths include our:

•Diverse and Liquid Product Offerings:Many of our futures contracts serve as global benchmarks for managing risk relating to exposure to price movements in the underlying products, including financial, energy and agricultural commodities. For example, we operate the leading market for ICE Brent crude oil futures, as measured by the volume of contracts traded in2019. The ICE Brent Crude futures contract is the benchmark for pricing light, sweet crude oil produced and consumed outside of the U.S. It is part of the Brent complex, which forms the price reference for approximately two-thirds of the world’s internationally-traded physical oil. In addition, we operate a leading market for short-term European interest rates contracts, with our principal contracts based on implied forward rates on European Money Markets Institute Euribor rates and a short-term Sterling contract based on the ICE LIBOR rate, as well as Gilts and the SONIA contract. We also offer markets in other key commodity and financial benchmarks such as: sugar, cocoa, cotton, coffee, MSCI®World, MSCI®Emerging Markets, MSCI®EAFE, the FTSE®100 and the USDX. In our cash equities markets, as evidenced by our leading market share, the NYSE's unique market model and technology delivers low levels of volatility and provides participants with deep liquidity.








•Risk Management Expertise:We offer a range of central clearing and related risk management services to promote the liquidity and security of our markets in jurisdictions around the world to meet local regulatory and operational needs in key financial market centers. The credit and performance assurance provided by our clearing houses to clearing members is designed to substantially reduce counterparty risk and is a critical component of our exchanges’ identities as reliable and secure marketplaces for global transactions. Our clearing houses are designed to protect the financial integrity of our markets by maintaining strong governance and rules, managing collateral, facilitating payments and collections, enhancing capital efficiency and limiting counterparty credit risk.

•Unique Derived Data Services:Our global data services business consists of unique information derived from our various execution venues and clearing houses, as well as analytics, valuation services, reference data, desktops, indices and connectivity solutions. Our acquisitions, including of the Bank of America Merrill Lynch, or BofAML's, indices (now named the ICE BofA indices), SuperDerivatives, Interactive Data, Standard & Poor’s Securities Evaluations, Inc., or SPSE, and Credit Market Analysis have served to expand our data services to better address the rising demand for independent, real-time information, which is being driven by regulation, market fragmentation, technology and data demands, passive investing and indexation. We believe our data services are relevant to our clients’ business operations regardless of market volatility and price levels due to the need for continuous information and analysis. ICE Data Pricing & Reference Data is an independent provider of evaluated pricing services and reference data solutions. We are a leading source to the institutional investment community for market data and analytic and financial information. We also offer our fixed income continuous evaluated pricing service, best execution service, and ICE Liquidity Indicators in the front, middle and back office, extending the reach of fixed income evaluations into intra-day applications.

•Global Distribution:We operate multiple trading venues, including 12 regulated exchanges, as well as six clearing houses, which are strategically-positioned in major market centers around the world, including the U.S., U.K., EU, Canada and Singapore. Our ICE Global Network, which is our highly secure, resilient and low latency connectivity offering, provides connectivity to over 150 trading venues and data from over 750 third-party sources, including ICE-operated markets and data services.

•Technology:Our proprietary systems are built using state-of-the-art technology and support the entire risk management workflow: trading and clearing technology, multi-asset class analytics, risk management tools, a robust data offering, instant messaging capabilities and flexible connectivity and delivery solutions. We employ a significant number of employees in technology-related activities, including product management, system architecture, software development, network engineering, server maintenance and continuity, cybersecurity, system and data performance, systems analysis, quality assurance, database administration and customer technical support. Speed, reliability, resilience, capacity and security are critical performance criteria for electronic trading platforms. Connectivity to our trading platform for our markets is available through our web-based front-end, as well as multiple ISVs and APIs.

Competitors

The markets in which we operate are global and highly competitive. We face competition in all aspects of our business from a number of different enterprises, both domestic and international, including traditional exchanges, electronic trading platforms, data vendors and voice brokers.

Trading and Clearing Segment

•We face competition from multiple exchanges, electronic trading systems, third-party clearing houses, technology firms, voice brokers active in the credit derivatives markets, market data vendors and trading facilities in the U.S. and globally. Some of these exchanges are consortiums formed by banks and exchanges.

•We face significant competition with respect to equities trading, and this competition is expected to remain intense. Our current and prospective competitors include regulated markets, dark pools and other alternative trading systems, or ATSs, market makers and other execution venues. We also face competition from large brokers and customers that may assume the role of principal and act as counterparty to orders originating from retail customers, or by matching their respective order flows through bilateral trading arrangements, including through internalization of order flow. NYSE Arca and NYSE American Options face considerable competition in the equity options markets; their principal U.S. competitors are the Cboe Global Markets and Nasdaq.

•Our fixed income trading venues, which include ICE Credit Trade, BondPoint, TMC Bonds, LLC, or TMC Bonds, and NYSE Bonds, compete with other electronic trading venues. Our platforms also compete for volume traded bilaterally or trading activity that is not done through an electronic venue.

•In our ICE Mortgage Services business, which includes MERS and Simplifile, we compete with other digital mortgage solution providers. We also compete for mortgage activity that does not utilize digital solutions.








Data and Listings Segment

•ICE Data Services faces intense competition in all aspects of its business. We broadly compete with purchased third-party information and services from large global suppliers of financial market data. Our Exchange Data products compete with similar offerings by other exchange groups, and that competition for order flow among the exchange groups and other alternative trading venues constrains the pricing for our proprietary data products. Our Pricing and Analytics services compete with information obtained from informal industry relationships and sources, such as broker quotes, as well as other index and portfolio analytics providers. Our Connectivity business competes with other extranet providers.

•Our principal competitor for corporate listings in the U.S. is Nasdaq. For ETF listings, we compete with Nasdaq and Cboe Global Markets. We also face competition for foreign issuer listings from a number of stock exchanges outside the U.S. As other liquidity venues and new entrants seek exchange status, we may face more competition for listings.



Our Growth Strategy

We seek to advance our leadership position in our markets by focusing our efforts on the following key strategies for growth:

•expand our data offerings and the markets we serve to address the rising demand for information;

•enhance our extensive trading, clearing and risk management capabilities;

•maintain leadership in our listings businesses;

•further develop our technology infrastructure and increase distribution; and

•strengthen competitive position through select acquisitions and strategic relationships.

The record consolidated revenues we achieved in 2019 reflect our focus on the implementation and execution of our long-term growth strategy.

Expand our Data Offerings and the Markets We Serve to Address the Rising Demand for Information

With the growth of our ICE derivatives markets and NYSE equity markets, we have strengthened and enhanced our data services to meet the demand for more data solutions. Our growth has been driven by many factors, such as increased automation, regulation and demand for independent, secure, real-time information. To build on our exchange data and connectivity businesses, we have acquired multiple assets in the past several years, including Interactive Data, SPSE, which we renamed Securities Evaluations, Credit Market Analysis and BofAML’s Global Research division’s index business (now named the ICE BofA indices).

These assets are now part of ICE Data Services, supporting our growth strategy by expanding the markets we serve and adding new data, connectivity and valuation services to our platform. This growth allows us to serve the full trade life cycle from pre-trade, through-trading to post-trade activities. By bringing together a wide range of data and analytics as well as delivery mechanisms through our Desktops and Connectivity business, we offer customers a comprehensive and flexible solution to address the need for more transparency, efficiency and information across their respective workflows.

We will continue to look for strategic opportunities to grow our data offerings and will also continue to pursue opportunities in markets we do not currently serve. Our recent acquisitions and new product and service offerings have allowed us to grow using a balanced approach, which is supported by an increased demand for these types of services including: portfolio management and analytics, exchange data, real time and historical trading data, pricing, reference and valuation data.








Enhance our Extensive Trading, Clearing and Risk Management Capabilities

Our derivatives customer base has grown and diversified as a result of several drivers, including the addition of new markets and products, the move toward increased risk management and counterparty credit management, mark-to-market and margining services as well as regulatory requirements. We continue to add new participants to our markets, which bring additional demand for new products and services. Our markets support price transparency and risk management, particularly in times of volatility and for products where there is less liquidity. In addition, the use of hedging, trading and risk management programs by commercial enterprises continues to rise based on the availability of technology to deliver more products, as well as the security and the capital efficiencies offered by clearing. We develop new products, but have also increased our capabilities through licenses and acquisitions of companies and intellectual property. Further, by acquiring, building and maintaining our own geographically diverse clearing operations, we are able to respond to market demand for central clearing and related risk management services across diverse geographic and regulatory jurisdictions. As new markets evolve, we intend to leverage our domain knowledge to meet additional demand for cleared products and related risk management solutions.

As requirements for regulatory compliance and capital efficiencies grow, the use of clearing, data and related post-trade services, particularly from independent data and benchmark providers also continues to grow. We intend to continue to expand our customer base by leveraging our existing relationships and our global sales and marketing team to promote participation in our markets, and by expanding our range of products and services.

Maintain Leadership in our Listings Businesses

There are nearly 2,200 total companies listed on the NYSE and NYSE American. We will continue to focus on enhancing our product offerings and services to retain and attract companies of all sizes and industries to our listing venues. In2019, demand for our listing services continued to be strong in terms of new listings and secondary offerings. A total of 89 new issuers listed on NYSE and NYSE American in2019. In2019, NYSE and NYSE American raised the most capital globally with approximately $112 billion raised in IPOs and follow-on offerings from over 300 transactions. The NYSE listed 58 IPOs in2019, raising total IPO proceeds of approximately $29 billion, including the largest U.S. IPO of2019. The NYSE has listed 24 of the 25 largest U.S. IPOs of all time. Our listed companies benefit from:

•a high-tech/ high-touch platform that combines technology and human judgment;

•the NYSE's proprietary hybrid trading model including access to Designated Market Makers, or DMMs, Supplemental Liquidity Providers, or SLPs, and NYSE Floor Brokers;

•the deepest pools of liquidity; and

•lower volatility and tighter spreads, particularly during times of heightened volatility.

NYSE Arca listed ETFs with approximately $3.4 trillion in AUM representing 77% of all U.S. listed ETFs as ofDecember 31, 2019. We strive to maintain our leadership position by offering ETF issuers:

•guidance through the complete listings process, including expert consultations around regulatory and legal items;

•over a decade of experience in listing nearly 3,100 ETFs across a wide range of asset classes and investment strategies;

•a focus on customer service from experienced ETF professionals;

•the highest liquidity in ETFs of any exchange and some of the most narrow quoted bid / ask spreads; and

•Lead Market Maker, or LMM, and incentive programs.

Further Develop Our Technology Infrastructure and Increase Distribution

We develop and maintain our own infrastructure, electronic trading platforms, clearing systems and data and analytics platforms to ensure scalability and the delivery of technology that meets our expanding customer base’s demands for price transparency, reliability, risk management and transaction efficiency. We intend to continue to increase ease of access and connectivity with our existing and prospective market participants. We will continue rolling out NYSE Pillar, our new integrated trading platform and matching engine, to our equity options markets to improve performance and reduce the complexity of operating multiple trading systems. We operate systems that support trading, clearing and data and analytics across five data centers. We also offer connectivity solutions to global exchanges and content service








providers through dedicated data circuits. Finally, we operate our ICE Global Network, which provides connectivity to over 150 trading venues and data from over 750 third-party sources, including ICE-operated markets and data services.

Strengthen Competitive Position Through Select Acquisitions and Strategic Relationships

We were an early consolidator in global markets and we intend to continue to explore and pursue acquisitions and other strategic opportunities to strengthen our competitive position globally, broaden our product offerings and services and support the growth of our company while enhancing stockholder value as measured by return on invested capital, earnings and cash flow growth. We may enter into business combinations, make acquisitions or enter into strategic partnerships, joint ventures or other alliances, any of which may be material. In addition to growing our business, we may enter into these transactions for a variety of additional reasons, including leveraging our existing strengths to enter new markets or related industries, expanding our products and services, diversifying our business, addressing underserved markets, advancing our technology and anticipating or responding to regulatory or other potential changes in our industry or other industries. For example, in June 2019, we acquired Simplifile to expand our ICE Mortgage Services portfolio. Simplifile offers an array of mortgage services, primarily serving as an electronic liaison between lenders, settlement agents and county recording offices, streamlining the local recording of residential mortgage transactions.

Regulation

Our activities and the markets in which we operate are subject to regulations that impact us as well as our customers, and, in turn, meaningfully influence our activities, the manner in which we operate and our strategy. We are primarily subject to the jurisdiction of regulatory agencies in the U.S., U.K., EU, Canada, Singapore and Abu Dhabi. Failure to satisfy regulatory requirements can or may give rise to sanctions by the applicable regulator. See the discussion below and Item 1(A) "-Risk Factors" in this Annual Report for additional descriptions of regulatory and legislative risks and uncertainties.

Regulation of our Derivatives Business

Our regulated derivatives markets and clearing houses are based primarily in the U.S., U.K., EU, Canada, Singapore and Abu Dhabi.

•Our U.S. futures exchange, ICE Futures U.S., is subject to extensive regulation by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, or CFTC, under the Commodity Exchange Act, or CEA. The CEA generally requires that futures trading in the U.S. be conducted on a commodity exchange registered as a Designated Contract Market, or DCM. As a registered DCM, ICE Futures U.S. is a self-regulatory organization, or SRO, that has implemented rules and procedures to comply with the core principles applicable to it under the CEA.








•In the U.K., ICE Futures Europe is a Recognized Investment Exchange, or RIE, in accordance with the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000. Like U.S. regulated derivatives markets, RIEs are SROs with surveillance and compliance responsibilities.

•In the EU, ICE Endex is a regulated market in the Netherlands and its derivative markets are licensed under the Dutch Financial Services Act and supervised by the Dutch National Bank, or DNB, and the Netherlands Authority for the Financial Markets, or AFM.

•In Singapore, ICE Futures Singapore is an approved exchange and is supervised by the Monetary Authority of Singapore, or MAS.

•In Abu Dhabi, ICE Futures Abu Dhabi is an RIE and regulated by the Financial Services Regulatory Authority, or FSRA. ICE Futures Abu Dhabi is expected to launch following regulatory approval.

•In Canada, ICE NGX is recognized as an exchange and clearing house by the Alberta Securities Commission and is also registered by the CFTC as a Foreign Board of Trade and as a Derivatives Clearing Organization, or DCO.

•ICE Clear Credit and ICE Clear U.S. are regulated by the CFTC as DCOs. DCOs are subject to extensive regulation by the CFTC under the CEA. The Financial Stability Oversight Council, or FSOC, has designated ICE Clear Credit as a systemically important financial market utility under Title VIII of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, or Dodd-Frank Act. As such, ICE Clear Credit has access to the Federal Reserve System and holds deposits of$19.5 billionof its U.S. dollar cash in its cash accounts at the Federal Reserve as ofDecember 31, 2019.

•ICE Clear Europe, which is primarily regulated in the U.K. by the Bank of England, or BOE, as a Recognized Clearing House, is also subject to regulation by the CFTC as a DCO. Both ICE Clear Credit and ICE Clear Europe are also regulated by the SEC as clearing agencies because they clear security-based swaps.

•In the EU, ICE Clear Netherlands is an authorized central counterparty and is regulated by the DNB and AFM.

•In Singapore, ICE Clear Singapore is an approved clearing house supervised by the MAS.

Regulation of our Securities Business

•In our cash equities and options markets, NYSE, NYSE Arca, NYSE American, NYSE National and NYSE Chicago are national securities exchanges and, as such, are SROs and subject to oversight by the SEC. Accordingly, our U.S. securities exchanges are regulated by the SEC and, in turn, are the regulators of their members. As national securities exchanges, NYSE, NYSE Arca, NYSE American, NYSE National and NYSE Chicago must comply with, and enforce compliance by their members with, the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, or the Exchange Act.

•Our U.S.-based execution-oriented fixed income markets are operated by our two SEC-registered broker-dealers, Creditex Securities Corporation, which operates two SEC registered ATSs, ICE BondPoint and ICE Credit Trade, and TMC Bonds, which operates the TMC Bonds ATS. Both Creditex Securities Corporation and TMC Bonds are subject to oversight by the SEC and are members of FINRA, and are registered with the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board, or MSRB. FINRA and MSRB are SROs that regulate broker-dealers in the U.S. ICE Securities Execution & Clearing, LLC, a full clearing member of the National Securities Clearing Corporation, the Fixed Income Clearing Corporation and The Depository Trust Corporation, provides correspondent clearing for Creditex Securities and is subject to oversight by the SEC, FINRA and the MSRB.

•Our U.K.-based execution-oriented fixed income market is operated by Creditex Brokerage, L.L.P., which is an operator of a multilateral trading facility, or MTF, and ICE Markets Limited, which acts as the matched principal counterparty to transactions arranged on the MTF operated by Creditex Brokerage. Both Creditex Brokerage and ICE Markets Limited are regulated by the U.K.’s Financial Conduct Authority, or FCA.  Additionally, Creditex Brokerage is authorized to provide automated trading services in Hong Kong and is subject to oversight by the Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission in connection with its offering of bonds in Hong Kong.

Regulation of our Data Business

We have a U.S. subsidiary that is registered with the SEC under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, or the Investment Advisers Act, for its evaluated pricing services. The Investment Advisers Act imposes numerous regulatory obligations on registered investment advisers, including those relating to the management and distribution of products and services, record-keeping, compliance oversight, operational and marketing requirements, disclosure obligations and prohibitions on fraudulent activities. Investment advisers also are subject to certain state securities laws and regulations. ICE Data Services (Australia) Pty. Ltd. provides financial services in Australia and is licensed by the Australian Securities and Investment Commission, or








ASIC. ICE Data Desktop Solutions (Europe) Limited provides certain financial services throughout Europe and is regulated by the FCA. ICE Data Indices, LLC, or ICE Data Indices, applies the International Organization of Securities Commissions Principles for Financial Benchmarks to its indices, and as a third country (i.e. non-EU) Benchmark Administrator in Europe. ICE Data Indices has been recognized as a third country benchmark administrator under Article 32 of the EU Benchmarks Regulation, or BMR, by the FCA. ICE Benchmark Administration Limited is authorized and regulated by the FCA in connection with the regulated activity of administering a benchmark, and is authorized as a benchmark administrator under the BMR. See “Regulatory Changes” below for more information.

Regulatory Changes

Domestic and foreign policy makers continue to review their legal frameworks governing financial markets, and periodically change the laws and regulations that apply to our business and to our customers’ businesses. Our key areas of focus on these evolving efforts are:

•Brexit timing and implications.On January 31, 2020, the U.K. officially withdrew from the EU. In connection with the U.K.'s withdrawal from the EU, the U.K. and the EU entered into a withdrawal agreement, which, amongst other things, includes a transitional period until December 31, 2020, during which EU law will continue to apply in and to the U.K.



•

Continued access by EU market participants to U.K. CCPs and exchanges

.



•The proposed revisions to the regulatory structure of non-EU clearing houses.On January 1, 2020, the European Market Infrastructure Regulation, or EMIR 2.2, became effective, which revises the EU's current regulatory and supervisory structure for EU and non-EU clearing houses. These revisions of the regulatory structure may have an impact on our non-EU clearing houses if they are determined to be systemically important or likely to become systemically important to the financial stability of the EU or one or more of its Member States. It remains uncertain what the nature and extent of the regulation's impact will be on the regulation and supervision of one or more of our non-EU clearing houses, which will depend on ESMA’s future determination of whether a non-EU clearing house is systemically important to the EU or its Member States and the extent to which ESMA will rely on such clearing house’s domestic regulator.

•Requirement that European exchanges and CCPs offer non-discriminatory access.The non-discriminatory access provisions of the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive II, or MiFID II, would require our European exchanges and CCPs to offer access to third parties on commercially reasonable terms. In addition, MiFID II could require our European exchanges and CCPs to allow participants to trade and/or clear at other venues, which may encourage competing venues to offer lookalikes of our products. In June 2016, the EU approved a 12-month postponement of implementation and compliance with this provision of MiFID II to January 3, 2018. On January 3, 2018, ICE Futures Europe and ICE Clear Europe received a deferral from the FCA and the BOE, respectively, which delays the non-discriminatory access provision of MiFID II until July 3, 2020. In addition, on February 28, 2018, the AFM granted ICE Endex and ICE Clear Netherlands a deferral which delays the non-discriminatory access provisions for those entities until July 3, 2020.

•Basel III capital charges.The implementation of capital charges in Basel III could have a negative impact on certain of our clearing members, in particular, the Supplemental Leverage Ratio applicable to certain financial institutionsmay impose capital requirements on certain of our clearing house members and their customers that may raise the costs and thus discourage financial institutions from client clearing. In June 2019, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision revised its treatment of the leverage ratio capital requirement for derivatives that a bank centrally clears on behalf of its clients. The revised treatment will permit both cash and non-cash forms of initial margin and variation margin received from a client to offset the replacement cost and potential future exposure for client cleared derivatives only. The revision will apply to the version of the leverage ratio standard that will serve as the Pillar 1 minimum capital requirement as of January 1, 2022. In November 2019, the Federal Reserve Board, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, or FDIC, and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency finalized rule changes to the derivative exposure calculations and








leverage ratio requirements. The final rule also revised the treatment of the leverage ratio capital requirement for derivatives that a bank centrally clears on behalf of its clients to permit both cash and non-cash forms of initial margin and variation margin received from a client to offset the replacement cost and potential future exposure for client cleared derivatives only. The compliance date for the revised regulation is January 1, 2022, however early adoption is permitted beginning April 1, 2020.

•Capital requirements for investment firms acting as market makers.EU policy makers are developing a framework for prudential requirements for European investment firms. The proposed rules risk imposing disproportionate capital requirements on European investment firms acting as market makers. European investment firms may be discouraged from acting as market makers on certain markets operated by ICE Futures Europe and ICE Endex due to the increased capital requirements.

•Position limits.The adoption and implementation of position limit rules in the U.S. and the EU could have an impact on our commodities business if comparable trading venues in foreign jurisdictions are not subject to equivalent rules. Position limits became effective in the EU beginning January 2018 under MiFID II.The FCA has published certain position limits for commodity contracts. In certain cases, the position limits are either lower or higher than the corresponding limits on U.S. equivalent contracts. In November 2019, ESMA issued a consultation paper on position limits seeking market views on proposed changes to the position limits and position management regime. Conversely, in January 2020, the CFTC proposed a rule which replaces the CFTC's prior Dodd-Frank position limit efforts. There is potential for further divergence between MiFID II and U.S. position limit rules if the U.S. makes changes to the financial regulations and the EU either does not make changes to MiFID II or makes changes inconsistent with U.S. regulations.

•A proposed European financial transaction tax.A number of EU Member States have considered such a tax, but many details remain to be discussed and agreed, including how to assess the tax at a Member State level. Implementation of a financial transaction tax could result in a reduction in volumes and liquidity, which would have a negative impact on our European operations.

•The EU Benchmarks Regulation, or BMR.In June 2016, the BMR entered into force and the majority of provisions applied from January 2018. Under the BMR, benchmarks provided by a third-country (i.e. non-EU) benchmark administrator may be used by EU-supervised entities provided that the European Commission, or EC, has adopted an equivalence decision or the administrator has been recognized or endorsed and the benchmarks are listed on the register established by ESMA. The BMR provides for a transition period which was extended by the EU authorities to January 1, 2022 for providers of critical benchmarks and third-country benchmark providers. In May 2019, ICE Data Indices received recognition from the FCA, and as such, benchmarks provided by ICE Data Indices and included in the ESMA register may continue to be used by supervised entities in the EU. In October 2019, the EC published a consultation reviewing the BMR and included a proposal to provide competent authorities with broader powers to require a benchmark administrator to change the methodology of a critical benchmark. Increasing the powers of a competent authority to change the underlying market or benchmark could result in increased risks to the administrator of a critical benchmark and the operator of a derivatives market referencing the benchmark. We are monitoring the impacts to our business as a result of the consultation and any resulting legislative changes.

•Market Data Requirements.Our U.K. and EU derivatives exchanges could be impacted by changes to requirements related to the dissemination of market data. In its December 2019 report to the EC, ESMA recommended, among other things, against outright regulation of market data prices, however ESMA suggested that users could gain transparency into how market data prices are set with the help of new supervisory guidance and targeted changes to the MiFID II/Markets in Financial Instruments Regulation, or MiFIR, text. The EC is considering ESMA’s report and is expected to issue its own report on these issues in mid-2020.

In addition, in October 2019, the SEC proposed a change to Rule 608 that would eliminate the provision allowing market data fee changes proposed by NMS Plans to become immediately effective. Further, in January 2020, the SEC requested comment on a proposed order directing the exchanges and FINRA to submit a plan to create a new, single NMS Plan to replace the three existing NMS Plans that govern the dissemination of real-time, consolidated equity market data for NMS stocks. If implemented, these changes could impact NYSE’s revenues from the consolidated “SIP” feeds.

•The SEC Transaction Fee Pilot.In December 2018, the SEC adopted a Transaction Fee Pilot. The final rule established a pilot program, for at least one-year and up to two-years, that will limit the fees charged and rebates paid by our five national securities exchanges in certain securities to be designated by the SEC. On March 28, 2019, the SEC partially stayed the Transaction Fee Pilot, pending resolution of our and two other national securities exchanges’ petitions for review of the Transaction Fee Pilot by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. The only requirement that the SEC did not stay was the requirement that the exchanges collect data during a pre-pilot period, which began on July 1, 2019 and terminated on December 31, 2019.
