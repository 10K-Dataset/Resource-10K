The Company’s business was originally founded in 1948. Prior to 1986, the Company was primarily a franchisor, under the namesAccountempsandRobert Half(now calledRobert Half Finance & Accounting), of offices providing temporary and full-time professionals in the fields of accounting and finance. Beginning in 1986, the Company and its current management embarked on a strategy of acquiring franchised locations. All of the franchises have been acquired. The Company believes that direct ownership of offices allows it to better monitor and protect the image of its trade names, promotes a more consistent and higher level of quality and service throughout its network of offices and improves profitability by centralizing many of its administrative functions. Since 1986, the Company has significantly expanded operations at many of the acquired locations, opened many new locations and acquired other local or regional providers of specialized temporary service personnel. The Company has also expanded the scope of its services by launching the new product linesOfficeTeam,Robert Half Technology,Robert Half Management Resources,Robert Half LegalandThe Creative Group.

In 2002, the Company hired more than 700 professionals who had been affiliated with the internal audit and business and technology risk consulting practice of Arthur Andersen LLP, including more than 50 individuals who had been partners of that firm. These professionals formed the base of the Company’s Protiviti Inc. subsidiary.Protivitihas enabled the Company to enter the market for business consulting and internal audit services, which market the Company believes offers synergies with its traditional lines of business.

Accountemps

TheAccountempstemporary services division offers customers a reliable and economical means of dealing with uneven or peak workloads for accounting, finance, and bookkeeping personnel caused by such predictable events as vacations, taking inventories, tax work, month-end activities and special projects, and such unpredictable events as illness and emergencies. Businesses view the use of temporary employees as a means of controlling personnel costs and converting such costs from fixed to variable. The cost and inconvenience to clients of hiring and firing regular employees are eliminated by the use ofAccountempstemporaries. The temporary workers are employees ofAccountempsand are paid byAccountemps. The customer pays a fixed rate only for hours worked.

Competition

The Company’s staffing services face competition in attracting clients as well as skilled specialized employment candidates. The staffing business is highly competitive, with a number of firms offering services similar to those provided by the Company on a national, regional or local basis. In many areas the local companies are the strongest competitors. The most significant competitive factors in the staffing business are price and the reliability of service, both of which are often a function of the availability and quality of personnel. The Company believes it derives a competitive advantage from its long experience with and commitment to the specialized employment market, its national presence, and its various marketing activities.

Protivitifaces competition in its efforts to attract clients, expand relationships with existing clients and win proposal presentations.

Significant competitive factors include reputation, technology, tools, project methodologies, price of services and depth of skills of personnel.Protivitibelieves its competitive strengths lie in the collaborative approach they take to working with clients which drive knowledge transfer, understanding of client issues and value creation. This is coupled with a “configure-to-fit” resourcing model to create blended teams of full-time Protiviti professionals and engagement professionals from Robert Half’s network of specialized talent to precisely match expertise, approach and people to the changing global needs of clients on consulting and managed solutions projects.
