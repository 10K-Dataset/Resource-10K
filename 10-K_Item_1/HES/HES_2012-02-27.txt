A description of our significant E&P operations is as follows:

United States

At December 31, 2011, 28% of the Corporation’s total proved reserves were located in the United States. During 2011, 35% of the Corporation’s crude oil and natural gas liquids production
and 16% of its natural gas production were from United States operations. The Corporation’s production in the United States was from offshore properties in the Gulf of Mexico, as well as onshore properties principally in the Williston Basin of
North Dakota and in the Permian Basin of Texas.

Offshore:The Corporation’s
production offshore the United States was principally from the Shenzi (Hess 28%), Llano (Hess 50%), Conger (Hess 38%), Baldpate (Hess 50%), Hack Wilson (Hess 25%) and Penn State (Hess 50%) fields.

At the Shenzi Field, the operator is expected to complete initial installation of water injection equipment and drill additional
development wells in 2012. At the outside operated Llano Field, a workover on a shut-in well, which was producing in excess of 10,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day prior to shut-in, will be completed in 2012. Additional development drilling
at the Llano Field is planned to commence during the second half of 2012.

During the third quarter of 2011, the Corporation,
as operator, and its partner sanctioned the development of the Tubular Bells Field (Hess 57%) in the Mississippi Canyon Block 725 Area in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. In 2012, field development will be advanced with the on-going construction of a
floating production system and development drilling that is scheduled to start in the second quarter. First production is anticipated in 2014.

At the Pony prospect on Green Canyon Block 468 (Hess 100%), the Corporation has signed a non-binding agreement with the owners of the adjacent Knotty Head prospect on Green Canyon Block 512 that outlines
a proposal to jointly develop the field. This agreement provides that the Corporation will be operator of the joint development. Negotiation of a joint operating agreement, including working interest percentages for the partners, and planning for
the field development are progressing. The project is now targeted for sanction in 2013.







At December 31, 2011, the Corporation had interests in 289 blocks in the Gulf of
Mexico, of which 267 were exploration blocks comprising 1,054,000 net undeveloped acres, with an additional 46,000 net acres held for production and development operations.

Onshore:In North Dakota, the Corporation holds nearly 900,000 net acres in the Bakken oil shale play (Bakken). In 2012, the Corporation plans to invest
approximately $1.9 billion for drilling and infrastructure in the Bakken. The Corporation plans to operate 16 rigs with five dedicated hydraulic fracturing crews in 2012. Infrastructure investments include completion of a crude oil rail loading and
storage facility, which is due to become fully operational in the first quarter of 2012, and continuing expansion of the Tioga gas plant.

In Texas, the Corporation holds a 34% interest in the Seminole-San Andres Unit and is operator. The Corporation also holds more than 100,000 net acres in the Eagle Ford shale. First production from the

In 2011, the Corporation entered into agreements to acquire approximately 85,000 net acres in the Utica Shale play in eastern Ohio for approximately $750 million, principally through the acquisition of
Marquette Exploration, LLC. The Corporation also completed the acquisition of a 50% undivided interest in CONSOL Energy Inc.’s (CONSOL) nearly 200,000 acres in the Utica Shale play for $59 million in cash at closing and the agreement to fund
50% of CONSOL’s share of the drilling costs up to $534 million within a 5-year period. Appraisal of the Utica acreage commenced in the fourth quarter of 2011 and will continue during 2012 with the acquisition of seismic and the planned drilling
of 29 wells.

Europe

At December 31, 2011, 37% of the Corporation’s total proved reserves were located in Europe (Norway 23%, United Kingdom 4%, Denmark 3% and Russia 7%). During 2011, 35% of the Corporation’s
crude oil and natural gas liquids production and 13% of its natural gas production were from European operations.

Norway:Substantially all of the 2011 Norwegian production was from the Corporation’s interests
in the Valhall Field (Hess 64%). At December 31, 2011, the Corporation also held interests in the Hod (Hess 63%) and Snohvit (Hess 3%) fields. All three of the Corporation’s Norwegian field interests are located offshore.

At the Valhall Field, a multi-year redevelopment project is scheduled to be completed in 2012. The project includes the installation of
two new platforms with production, compression and water injection equipment and living quarters. In addition, further drilling is planned for Valhall in 2012. In the third quarter of 2012, there is expected to be significant downtime for the
operator to complete the project and commission the new facilities.

In August 2011, the Corporation completed the sale of its
interests in the Snorre Field (Hess 1%), offshore Norway. In January 2012, the Corporation completed the sale of its interests in the Snohvit Field.

United Kingdom:Production of crude oil and natural gas liquids from the United Kingdom North Sea was principally from the Corporation’s non-operated interests in
the Bittern (Hess 28%), Nevis (Hess 27%), Beryl (Hess 22%) and Schiehallion (Hess 16%) fields. Natural gas production from the United Kingdom was primarily from the Nevis (Hess 27%) and Beryl (Hess 22%) fields. The Corporation also has interests in
the Atlantic (Hess 25%), Cromarty (Hess 90%), Fife, Flora and Angus (Hess 85%), Fergus (Hess 65%), Ivanhoe and Rob Roy (Hess 77%), Renee (Hess 14%) and Rubie (Hess 19%) fields. These fields are no longer producing and decommissioning activities have
commenced.

In the first half of 2011, the Corporation completed the sale of a package of natural gas producing assets
including its interests in the Easington Catchment Area (Hess 30%), the Bacton Area (Hess 23%), the Everest Field (Hess 19%) and the Lomond Field (Hess 17%), as well as its interest in the Central Area Transmission System pipeline. The Corporation
also completed the sale of its interest in the Cook Field (Hess 28%) in August 2011.

Denmark:Crude oil and natural gas production comes from the Corporation’s operated interest in
the South Arne Field (Hess 62%), offshore Denmark. In October 2011, the Corporation acquired an additional 4% interest in the South Arne Field increasing its interest to 62% from 58%.

Russia:The Corporation’s activities in Russia are conducted through its interest in a
subsidiary operating in the Volga-Urals region. In the third quarter of 2011, the Corporation acquired an additional 5% interest in its







subsidiary, increasing its ownership to 90%. As of December 31, 2011, this subsidiary had exploration and production rights in 22 license areas. During 2012, the Corporation plans to
continue drilling and to install gas treatment facilities that are anticipated to start up in the fourth quarter of 2012.

France:    The Corporation’s activities in France are conducted through an agreement with Toreador
Resources Corporation (Toreador), under which it can invest in an initial exploration phase and earn up to a 50% working interest in, and become operator of, Toreador’s approximately 680,000 net acres in the Paris Basin. An initial six
exploration well program, which was scheduled to begin in 2011, was deferred due to a temporary drilling moratorium requested by the government prior to the implementation of a law prohibiting hydraulic fracturing. In 2012, the Corporation
anticipates drilling up to three conventional vertical wells and continuing geological and geophysical analysis.

Africa

At December 31, 2011, 17% of the Corporation’s total proved reserves were located in Africa (Equatorial Guinea
5%, Algeria 1% and Libya 11%). During 2011, 25% of the Corporation’s crude oil and natural gas liquids production was from its African operations.

Equatorial Guinea:The Corporation is operator and owns an interest in Block G (Hess 85%) which contains the Ceiba Field and Okume Complex. During 2012, the
Corporation intends to drill additional production wells at the Ceiba Field. Additional development drilling at the Okume Complex is planned to commence during 2013.

Algeria:The Corporation has a 49% interest in a venture with the Algerian national oil company that redeveloped three oil fields. The Corporation also has an interest
in Bir El Msana (BMS) Block 401C (Hess 45%). In 2011, the Corporation sanctioned a small development project at the BMS Field.

Libya:The Corporation, in conjunction with its Oasis Group partners, has oil and gas production
operations in the Waha concessions in Libya (Hess 8%). The Corporation also owns a 100% interest in offshore exploration Area 54 in the Mediterranean Sea, where two wells discovered hydrocarbons.

In response to civil unrest in Libya, a number of measures were taken by the international community in the first quarter of 2011,
including the imposition of economic sanctions. Production at the Waha Field was suspended in the first quarter of 2011. As a consequence of the civil unrest and the sanctions, the Corporation delivered force majeure notices to the Libyan government
relating to the agreements covering its exploration and production interests in order to protect its rights while it was temporarily prevented from fulfilling its obligations and benefiting from the rights granted by those agreements. Production at
the Waha Field restarted during the fourth quarter of 2011 at levels that were significantly lower than those prior to the civil unrest. The Corporation’s Libyan production averaged 23,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boepd) for the full
year of 2010 and 4,000 boepd for 2011. The force majeure covering the Corporation’s production interests was withdrawn at the end of the fourth quarter of 2011, as the economic sanctions were lifted. The force majeure covering the
Corporation’s offshore exploration interests remained in place at year-end but is expected to be withdrawn in 2012. The Corporation had proved reserves of 166 million barrels of oil equivalent in Libya at December 31, 2011. At
December 31, 2011, the net book value of the Corporation’s exploration and production assets in Libya was approximately $500 million.

Ghana:The Corporation holds a 90% interest and is operator in the Deepwater Tano Cape Three Points License where the Corporation drilled an exploration well in 2011

Brazil:The Corporation has a 40% interest in block BM-S-22 located offshore Brazil.

Sales Commitments

In the E&P segment, the Corporation has contracts to sell fixed quantities of its natural gas and natural gas liquids (NGL) production. The natural gas contracts principally relate to producing fields
in Asia. The most significant of these commitments relates to the JDA where the minimum contract quantity of natural gas is estimated at 107 million mcf per year based on current entitlements under a sales contract expiring in 2027. There







are additional natural gas supply commitments on producing fields in Thailand and Indonesia which currently total approximately 45 million mcf per year under contracts expiring in years 2021
through 2029. The Corporation also has a commitment to supply approximately 15 million mcf of natural gas per year in the Bakken under a sales contract expiring in 2013. The Corporation also has NGL contracts relating to the Bakken, which
commence in 2013. The minimum contract quantity under these contracts, which expire in 2023, is approximately 9.6 million barrels per year. The estimated total volume of production subject to sales commitments under all these contracts is
approximately 2,422 million mcf of natural gas and 96 million barrels of NGL. The Corporation has not experienced any significant constraints in satisfying the committed quantities required by its sales commitments and it anticipates being
able to meet future requirements from available proved and probable reserves.

Natural gas is marketed by the M&R segment
on a spot basis and under contracts for varying periods of time to local distribution companies, and commercial, industrial and other purchasers. These natural gas marketing activities are primarily conducted in the eastern portion of the United
States, where the principal source of supply is purchased natural gas, not the Corporation’s production from the E&P segment. The Corporation has not experienced any significant constraints in obtaining the required supply of purchased
natural gas.

Marketing and Refining

Refining

The Corporation owns a 50% interest in HOVENSA L.L.C. (HOVENSA), a joint venture with a subsidiary of Petroleos de Venezuela S.A. (PDVSA) that operated a refinery in the U.S. Virgin Islands. In addition,
the Corporation owns and operates a refining facility in Port Reading, New Jersey.

HOVENSA:In January 2012, HOVENSA announced a decision to shut down its refinery in St. Croix, U.S.
Virgin Islands and operate the complex as an oil storage terminal. For further discussion of the refinery shutdown, see Note 5, HOVENSA L.L.C. Joint Venture in the notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Refining operations at HOVENSA consisted of crude units, a fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) unit and a delayed coker unit. The following
table summarizes capacity and utilization rates for HOVENSA:

*HOVENSA’s crude oil refining capacity was reduced to 350,000 from 500,000 barrels per day in the first half of 2011.

Gross crude runs at HOVENSA averaged 284,000 barrels per day in 2011 compared with 390,000 barrels per day in 2010 and
402,000 barrels per day in 2009. These utilization rates reflect weaker refining margins, together with planned and unplanned maintenance.

Port Reading Facility:The Corporation owns and operates an FCC unit in Port Reading, New Jersey, with a capacity of 70,000 barrels per day. This facility,
which processes residual fuel oil and vacuum gas oil, operated at a rate of approximately 63,000 barrels per day in 2011 compared with 55,000 and 63,000 barrels per day, respectively in 2010 and 2009. Substantially all of Port
Reading’s production is gasoline and heating oil. During 2010, the Port Reading refining facility was shut down for 41 days for a scheduled turnaround.

Marketing

The Corporation markets refined petroleum products,

Other Items

Gulf of Mexico Update

The Corporation has filed 183 Suspension of Operations (SOO) requests with the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (BSEE). These SOO requests seek the BSEE’s approval for the extension of
leases beyond their initial period where operations required to hold the leases have been delayed due to circumstances beyond the control of the Corporation. All 183 SOO requests have been approved for one year extensions. In addition, the
Corporation has applied and received approval for exploration plans for two deepwater prospects. Further discussions have been held with the BSEE concerning the Corporation’s oil spill response plan for its Gulf of Mexico operations, which is
also awaiting approval. This plan sets forth expectations for response training, drills and capabilities and the strategies, procedures and methods that the Corporation will employ in the event of a spill covering the following topics: spill
response organization, incident command post, communications and notifications, spill detection and assessment (including worst case discharge scenarios), identification and protection of environmental resources, strategic response planning,
mobilization and deployment of spill response equipment and personnel, oil and debris removal and disposal, the use of dispersants and chemical and biological agents, in-situ burning of oil, wildlife rehabilitation and documentation requirements.







Emergency Preparedness and Response Plans and Procedures

The Corporation has in place a series of business and asset-specific emergency preparedness, response and business continuity plans that
detail procedures for rapid and effective emergency response and environmental mitigation activities. These plans are risk appropriate and are maintained, reviewed and updated as necessary to ensure their accuracy and suitability. Where appropriate,
they are also reviewed and approved by the relevant host government authorities.

Responder training and drills are routinely
held worldwide to assess and continually improve the effectiveness of the Corporation’s plans. The Corporation’s contractors, service providers, representatives from government agencies and, where applicable, joint venture partners
participate in the drills to ensure that emergency procedures are comprehensive and can be effectively implemented.

The Corporation continues to participate in a number of industry-wide task forces that are studying better ways to assess the risk of and
prevent onshore and offshore incidents, access and control blowouts in subsea environments, and improve containment and recovery methods. The task forces are working closely with the oil and gas industry and international government agencies to
implement improvements and increase the effectiveness of oil spill prevention, preparedness, response and recovery processes.

Insurance Coverage and Indemnification

The Corporation maintains insurance coverage that includes coverage for physical damage to its property, third party liability, workers’ compensation and employers’ liability, general liability,
sudden and accidental pollution, and other coverage. This insurance coverage is subject to deductibles, exclusions and limitations and there is no assurance that such coverage will adequately protect the Corporation against liability from all
potential consequences and damages.

The amount of insurance covering physical damage to the Corporation’s property and
liability related to negative environmental effects resulting from a sudden and accidental pollution event, excluding windstorm coverage in the Gulf of Mexico for which it is self insured, varies by asset, based on the asset’s estimated
replacement value or the estimated maximum loss. In the case of a catastrophic event, first party coverage consists of two tiers of insurance. The first $250 million of coverage is provided through an industry mutual insurance group. Above this $250
million threshold, insurance is carried which ranges in value to over $2.0 billion in total, depending on the asset coverage level, as described above. Additionally, the Corporation carries insurance which provides third party coverage for general
liability, and sudden and accidental pollution, up to $1 billion. Beginning in 2012, the first layer of insurance coverage has been increased to $300 million, and above that threshold, insurance is carried which ranges in value to over $2.25
billion.







Other insurance policies provide coverage for, among other things: charterer’s legal
liability, in the amount of $500 million per occurrence and aircraft liability, in the amount of $300 million per occurrence.

The Corporation’s insurance policies renew at various dates each year. Future insurance coverage for the industry could increase in
cost and may include higher deductibles or retentions, or additional exclusions or limitations. In addition, some forms of insurance may become unavailable in the future or unavailable on terms that are deemed economically acceptable.

Generally, the Corporation’s drilling contracts (and most of its other offshore services contracts) provide for a mutual hold
harmless indemnity structure whereby each party to the contract (the Corporation and Contractor) indemnifies the other party for injuries or damages to their personnel and property regardless of fault. Variations include indemnity exclusions to the
extent a claim is attributable to the gross negligence and/or willful misconduct of a party. Third-party claims, on the other hand, are generally allocated on a fault basis.

The Corporation is customarily responsible for, and indemnifies the Contractor against, all claims, including those from third-parties, to the extent attributable to pollution or contamination by
substances originating from its reservoirs or other property (regardless of fault, including gross negligence and willful misconduct) and the Contractor is responsible for and indemnifies the Corporation for all claims attributable to pollution
emanating from the Contractor’s property. Additionally, the Corporation is generally liable for all of its own losses and most third-party claims associated with catastrophic losses such as blowouts, cratering and loss of hole, regardless of
cause, although exceptions for losses attributable to gross negligence and/or willful misconduct do exist. Lastly, many offshore services contracts include overall limitations of the Contractor’s liability equal to the value of the contract or
a fixed amount, whichever is greater.

Under a standard joint operating agreement (JOA), each party is liable for all claims
arising under the JOA, not covered by or in excess of insurance carried by the JOA, to the extent of its participating interest (operator or non-operator). Variations include indemnity exclusions where the claim is based upon the gross negligence
and/or willful misconduct of a party in which case such party is solely liable. However, under some production sharing contracts between a governmental entity and commercial parties, liability of the commercial parties to the governmental entity is
joint and several.

Environmental

Compliance with various existing environmental and pollution control regulations imposed by federal, state, local and foreign governments is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the
Corporation’s financial condition or results of operations. The Corporation spent $19 million in 2011 for environmental remediation. The Corporation anticipates capital expenditures for facilities, primarily to comply with federal, state and
local environmental standards, other than for the low sulfur requirements, of approximately $120 million in both 2012 and 2013. For further discussion of environmental matters see the Environment, Health and Safety section of Item 7.Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.

Number of Employees

The number of persons employed by the Corporation at year-end was approximately 14,350 in 2011 and 13,800 in 2010.

Item 1A.Risk Factors Related to Our
Business and Operations

Our business activities and the value of our securities are subject to significant
risk factors, including those described below. The risk factors described below could negatively affect our operations, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations, and as a result, holders and purchasers of our securities could lose
part or all of their investments. It is possible that additional risks relating to our securities may be described in a prospectus supplement if we issue securities in the future.

Our business and operating results are highly dependent on the market prices of crude oil, natural gas, refined petroleum products and
electricity, which can be very volatile.

If we fail to successfully increase our reserves, our future crude oil and natural gas production will be
adversely impacted.We own or have access to a finite amount of oil and gas reserves which will be depleted over time. Replacement of oil and gas production and reserves, including proved undeveloped reserves, is subject
to successful exploration drilling, development activities, and enhanced recovery programs. Therefore, future oil and gas production is dependent on technical success in finding and developing additional hydrocarbon reserves. Exploration activity
involves the interpretation of seismic and other geological and geophysical data, which does not always successfully predict the presence of commercial quantities of hydrocarbons. Drilling risks include unexpected adverse conditions, irregularities
in pressure or formations, equipment failure, blowouts and weather interruptions. Future developments may be affected by unforeseen reservoir conditions which negatively affect recovery factors or flow rates. The costs of drilling and development
activities have increased in recent years which could negatively affect expected economic returns. Reserve replacement can also be achieved through acquisition. Although due diligence is used in evaluating acquired oil and gas properties, similar
risks may be encountered in the production of oil and gas on properties acquired from others.

There are inherent
uncertainties in estimating quantities of proved reserves and discounted future net cash flow, and actual quantities may be lower than estimated.Numerous uncertainties exist in estimating quantities of proved reserves and
future net revenues from those reserves. Actual future production, oil and gas prices, revenues, taxes, capital expenditures, operating expenses, and quantities of recoverable oil and gas reserves may vary substantially from those assumed in the
estimates and could materially affect the estimated quantities of our proved reserves and the related future net revenues. In addition, reserve estimates may be subject to downward or upward changes based on production performance, purchases or
sales of properties, results of future development, prevailing oil and gas prices, production sharing contracts, which may decrease reserves as crude oil and natural gas prices increase, and other factors.

We are subject to changing laws and regulations and other governmental actions that can significantly and adversely affect our
business.Federal, state, local, territorial and foreign laws and regulations relating to tax increases and retroactive tax claims, disallowance of tax credits and deductions, expropriation or nationalization of property,
mandatory government participation, cancellation or amendment of contract rights, and changes in import and export regulations, limitations on access to exploration and development opportunities, as well as other political developments may affect
our operations. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform Act, enacted in 2010, delegated rulemaking responsibilities to carry out the Act to various U.S. government agencies. Our business could potentially be adversely impacted by one or more of the final







rules under this Act, when issued, including potential additional costs to engage in certain derivative transactions. We also market motor fuels through lessee-dealers and wholesalers in certain
states where legislation prohibits producers or refiners of crude oil from directly engaging in retail marketing of motor fuels. Similar legislation has been periodically proposed in various other states. As a result of the accident in April 2010 at
the BP p.l.c. (BP) operated Macondo prospect in the Gulf of Mexico (in which the Corporation was not a participant) and the ensuing significant oil spill, a temporary drilling moratorium was imposed in the Gulf of Mexico. While this moratorium has
since been lifted, significant new regulations have been imposed and further legislation and regulations may be proposed, including an increase in the potential liability in the event of an oil spill. The new regulatory environment has resulted in a
longer permitting process and higher costs.

Political instability in areas where we operate can adversely affect our
business.Some of the international areas in which we operate, and the partners with whom we operate, are politically less stable than other areas and partners. Political unrest in North Africa and the Middle East has
affected and may continue to affect our operations in these areas as well as oil and gas markets generally. The threat of terrorism around the world also poses additional risks to the operations of the oil and gas industry.

Our oil and gas operations are subject to environmental risks and environmental laws and regulations that can result in significant
costs and liabilities.Our oil and gas operations, like those of the industry, are subject to environmental risks such as oil spills, produced water spills, gas leaks and ruptures and discharges of substances or gases that
could expose us to substantial liability for pollution or other environmental damage. For example, the accident at the BP operated Macondo prospect in April 2010 resulted in a significant release of crude oil which caused extensive environmental and
economic damage. Our operations are also subject to numerous United States federal, state, local and foreign environmental laws and regulations. Non-compliance with these laws and regulations may subject us to administrative, civil or criminal
penalties, remedial clean-ups and natural resource damages or other liabilities. In addition, increasingly stringent environmental regulations, particularly relating to the production of motor and other fuels, have resulted and will likely continue
to result in higher capital expenditures and operating expenses for us and the oil and gas industry in general.

Concerns have
been raised in certain jurisdictions where we have operations concerning the safety and environmental impact of the drilling and development of unconventional oil and gas resources, particularly using the process of hydraulic fracturing. While we
believe that these operations can be conducted safely and with minimal impact on the environment, regulatory bodies are responding to these concerns and may impose moratoriums and new regulations on such drilling operations that would likely have
the effect of prohibiting or delaying such operations and increasing their cost. For example, a moratorium prohibiting hydraulic fracturing is currently impacting the Corporation’s operations in France.

Concerns about climate change may result in significant operational changes and expenditures and reduced demand for our
products.We recognize that climate change is a global environmental concern. Continuing political and social attention to the issue of climate change has resulted in both existing and pending international agreements and
national, regional or local legislation and regulatory measures to limit greenhouse gas emissions. These agreements and measures may require significant equipment modifications, operational changes, taxes, or purchase of emission credits to reduce
emission of greenhouse gases from our operations, which may result in substantial capital expenditures and compliance, operating, maintenance and remediation costs. In addition, we manufacture petroleum fuels, which through normal customer use
result in the emission of greenhouse gases. Regulatory initiatives to reduce the use of these fuels may reduce our sales of, and revenues from, these products. Finally, to the extent that climate change may result in more extreme weather related
events, we could experience increased costs related to prevention, maintenance and remediation of affected operations in addition to costs and lost revenues related to delays and shutdowns.

Our industry is highly competitive and many of our competitors are larger and have greater resources than we
have.The petroleum industry is highly competitive and very capital intensive. We encounter competition from numerous companies in each of our activities, including acquiring rights to explore for crude oil and natural
gas, and in purchasing and marketing of refined petroleum products, natural gas and electricity. Many competitors, including national oil companies, are larger and have substantially greater resources. We are also in competition with producers and
marketers of other forms of energy. Increased competition for worldwide oil and gas assets has significantly increased the cost of acquisitions. In addition,







competition for drilling services, technical expertise and equipment has, in the recent past, affected the availability of technical personnel and drilling rigs, resulting in increased capital
and operating costs.

Catastrophic events, whether naturally occurring or man-made, may materially affect our operations and
financial conditions.Our oil and gas operations are subject to unforeseen occurrences which have affected us from time to time and which may damage or destroy assets, interrupt operations and have other significant
adverse effects. Examples of catastrophic risks include hurricanes, fires, explosions and blowouts, such as the accident at the Macondo prospect operated by BP in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010. Although we maintain insurance coverage against property
and casualty losses, there can be no assurance that such insurance will adequately protect the Corporation against liability from all potential consequences and damages. Moreover, some forms of insurance may be unavailable in the future or be
available only on terms that are deemed economically unacceptable.

Item 3.Legal Proceedings

The Corporation, along with many other companies engaged in refining and marketing of gasoline, has been a party to lawsuits and claims
related to the use of methyl tertiary butyl ether (MTBE) in gasoline. A series of similar lawsuits, many involving water utilities or governmental entities, were filed in jurisdictions across the United States against producers of MTBE and petroleum
refiners who produced gasoline containing MTBE, including the Corporation. The principal allegation in all cases was that gasoline containing MTBE is a defective product and that these parties are strictly liable in proportion to their share of the
gasoline market for damage to groundwater resources and are required to take remedial action to ameliorate the alleged effects on the environment of releases of MTBE. In 2008, the majority of the cases against the Corporation were settled. In 2010
and 2011, additional cases were settled including an action brought in state court by the State of New Hampshire. Two separate cases brought by the State of New Jersey and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico remain unresolved. In 2007, a pre-tax charge
of $40 million was recorded to cover all of the known MTBE cases against the Corporation.

On July 25, 2011, the Virgin Islands Department of Planning and Natural Resources commenced an
enforcement action against HOVENSA by issuance of documents titled “Notice Of Violation, Order For Corrective Action, Notice Of Assessment of Civil Penalty, Notice Of Opportunity For Hearing” (the “NOVs”). The NOVs assert
violations of Virgin Islands Air Pollution Control laws and regulations arising out of odor incidents on St. Croix in May 2011 and proposes total penalties of $210,000. HOVENSA is engaging in settlement discussions with the Government of the Virgin
Islands, but believes that it has good defenses against the asserted violations.

On December 16, 2010, the Virgin Islands
Department of Planning and Natural Resources commenced four separate enforcement actions against HOVENSA by issuance of documents titled “Notice Of Violation, Order For Corrective Action, Notice Of Assessment of Civil Penalty, Notice Of
Opportunity For Hearing”. The NOVs assert violations of Virgin Islands Air Pollution Control laws and regulations arising out of air release incidents







at the HOVENSA refinery in 2009 and 2010 and propose total penalties of $1,355,000. HOVENSA anticipates settling this matter in the first quarter of 2012.

In July 2004, Hess Oil Virgin Islands Corp. (HOVIC), a wholly owned subsidiary of the Corporation, and HOVENSA, each received a letter
from the Commissioner of the Virgin Islands Department of Planning and Natural Resources and Natural Resources Trustees, advising of the Trustee’s intention to bring suit against HOVIC and HOVENSA under the Comprehensive Environmental Response,
Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA). The letter alleges that HOVIC and HOVENSA are potentially responsible for damages to natural resources arising from releases of hazardous substances from the HOVENSA refinery, which had been operated by HOVIC
until October 1998. An action was filed on May 5, 2005 in the District Court of the Virgin Islands against HOVENSA, HOVIC and other companies that operated industrial facilities on the south shore of St. Croix asserting that the defendants
are liable under CERCLA and territorial statutory and common law for damages to natural resources. HOVIC and HOVENSA are continuing to vigorously defend this matter and do not believe that this matter will result in a material liability as they
believe that they have strong defenses against this complaint.

The Corporation periodically receives notices from the EPA that
it is a “potential responsible party” under the Superfund legislation with respect to various waste disposal sites. Under this legislation, all potentially responsible parties are jointly and severally liable. For certain sites, the
EPA’s claims or assertions of liability against the Corporation relating to these sites have not been fully developed. With respect to the remaining sites, the EPA’s claims have been settled, or a proposed settlement is under
consideration, in all cases for amounts that are not material. The ultimate impact of these proceedings, and of any related proceedings by private parties, on the business or accounts of the Corporation cannot be predicted at this time due to the
large number of other potentially responsible parties and the speculative nature of clean-up cost estimates, but is not expected to be material.

The Corporation is from time to time involved in other judicial and administrative proceedings, including proceedings relating to other environmental matters. The Corporation cannot predict with certainty
if, how or when such proceedings will be resolved or what the eventual relief, if any, may be, particularly for proceedings that are in their early stages of development or where plaintiffs seek indeterminate damages. Numerous issues may need to be
resolved, including through potentially lengthy discovery and determination of important factual matters before a loss or range of loss can be reasonably estimated for any proceeding. Subject to the foregoing, in management’s opinion, based
upon currently known facts and circumstances, the outcome of such proceedings is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the financial condition, results of operations or cash flows of the Corporation.

Item 7.Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

Overview

The Corporation
is a global integrated energy company that operates in two segments, Exploration and Production (E&P) and Marketing and Refining (M&R). The E&P segment explores for, develops, produces, purchases, transports and sells crude oil and
natural gas. The M&R segment manufactures refined petroleum products and purchases, markets and trades refined petroleum products, natural gas and electricity.

Net income in 2011 was $1,703 million compared with $2,125 million in 2010 and $740 million in 2009. Diluted earnings per share were $5.01 in 2011 compared with $6.47 in 2010 and $2.27 in 2009. A
table of items affecting comparability between periods is shown on page 23.

Exploration and Production

The Corporation’s strategy for the E&P segment is to profitably grow reserves and production in a sustainable
and financially disciplined manner. The Corporation’s total proved reserves were 1,573 million barrels of oil equivalent (boe) at December 31, 2011 compared with 1,537 million boe at December 31, 2010 and 1,437 million
boe at December 31, 2009.

E&P earnings were $2,675 million in 2011, $2,736 million in 2010 and
$1,042 million in 2009. Average realized crude oil selling prices were $89.99 per barrel in 2011, $66.20 in 2010 and $51.62 in 2009, including the impact of hedging. Average realized natural gas selling prices were $5.96 per mcf in 2011, $5.63
in 2010 and $4.85 in 2009. Production averaged 370,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boepd) in 2011, a decrease of 48,000 boepd or 11% from 2010. Production averaged 408,000 boepd in 2009. The Corporation estimates that total worldwide
production will average between 370,000 and 390,000 boepd in 2012, excluding the impact of asset sales and any Libyan production.

The following is an update of significant E&P activities during 2011:



•In North Dakota, net production from the Bakken oil shale play averaged approximately 30,000 boepd during 2011 and 38,000 boepd for the fourth quarter
2011. The Corporation forecasts Bakken production will average 60,000 boepd for the full year of 2012 and is targeted to reach 120,000 boepd in 2015.



•The Corporation and its partner sanctioned the development of the Tubular Bells Field (Hess 57%) in the Mississippi Canyon Block 725 Area in the
deepwater Gulf of Mexico. In 2012, field development will be advanced with the construction of a floating production system and development drilling is scheduled to start in the second quarter. First production is anticipated in 2014.



•In the third quarter of the year, the Corporation announced the acquisition of approximately 185,000 net acres in the Utica Shale play in eastern Ohio.
The Corporation entered into agreements to acquire approximately 85,000 net acres for approximately $750 million, principally through the acquisition of Marquette Exploration, LLC. In October 2011, the Corporation completed the acquisition of a 50%
undivided interest in CONSOL Energy Inc.’s (CONSOL) nearly 200,000 acres in the Utica Shale play for $59 million in cash at closing and the agreement to fund 50% of CONSOL’s share of the drilling costs up to $534 million within a 5-year
period. Appraisal of the Utica acreage commenced in the fourth quarter and will continue during 2012 with the acquisition of seismic and the planned drilling of 29 wells.



•The Corporation filed a Notice of Discovery with the Ministry for Energy of Ghana for the Paradise-1 exploration well in the Deepwater Tano Cape Three
Points block. The well encountered an estimated 490 net feet of oil and gas condensate pay over three separate intervals. The Corporation is operator and has a 90% working interest in the license. The Corporation anticipates commencing additional
exploration drilling in the first quarter of 2012, subject to government approvals and rig availability.



•In 2011, the Corporation drilled the Andalan-1 well on the Semai V block, offshore Indonesia (Hess 100%). The well encountered reservoir sands and
hydrocarbons but not in commercial quantities. This well, along with a follow up well, was expensed in the fourth quarter. In September 2011, the operator of Block CA-1 in Brunei (Hess 14%) spud the Julong Center well. This well also failed to find
commercial quantities of hydrocarbons and was expensed.







•In February 2011, the Corporation completed the sale of its interests in certain natural gas producing assets located in the United Kingdom North Sea
for cash proceeds of $359 million, after post-closing adjustments, resulting in a pre-tax gain of $343 million ($310 million after income taxes). In August 2011, the Corporation completed the sale of its interests in the Snorre Field (Hess 1%),
offshore Norway and the Cook Field (Hess 28%) in the United Kingdom North Sea for cash proceeds of $131 million, after post-closing adjustments. These disposals resulted in non-taxable gains totaling $103 million.

Status of Libyan Operations

In response to civil unrest in Libya, a number of measures were taken by the international community in the first quarter of 2011, including the imposition of economic sanctions. Production at the Waha
Field was suspended in the first quarter of 2011. As a consequence of the civil unrest and the sanctions, the Corporation delivered force majeure notices to the Libyan government relating to the agreements covering its exploration and production
interests in order to protect its rights while it was temporarily prevented from fulfilling its obligations and benefiting from the rights granted by those agreements. Production at the Waha Field restarted during the fourth quarter of 2011 at
levels that were significantly lower than those prior to the civil unrest. The Corporation’s Libyan production averaged 23,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boepd) for the full year of 2010 and 4,000 boepd for 2011. The force majeure
covering the Corporation’s production interests was withdrawn at the end of the fourth quarter of 2011, as the economic sanctions were lifted. The force majeure covering the Corporation’s offshore exploration interests remained in place at
year-end but is expected to be withdrawn in 2012. The Corporation had proved reserves of 166 million barrels of oil equivalent in Libya at December 31, 2011. At December 31, 2011, the net book value of the Corporation’s
exploration and production assets in Libya was approximately $500 million.

Marketing and Refining

The Corporation’s strategy for the M&R segment is to deliver strong operating performance and generate free cash flow. In January
2012, HOVENSA announced a decision to shut down its refinery in St. Croix, U.S. Virgin Islands and operate the complex as an oil storage terminal. Results from M&R activities amounted to losses of $584 million in 2011, losses of
$231 million in 2010 and earnings of $127 million in 2009. Refining operations generated losses of $728 million in 2011, $445 million in 2010 and $87 million in 2009. Refining results include after-tax charges of $525 million in
2011 and $289 million in 2010 related to the Corporation’s investment in HOVENSA. Marketing earnings were $185 million in 2011, $215 million in 2010 and $168 million in 2009.

Liquidity and Capital and Exploratory Expenditures

Net cash provided by operating activities was $4,984 million in 2011, $4,530 million in 2010 and $3,046 million in 2009. At December 31, 2011, cash and cash equivalents totaled
$351 million compared with $1,608 million at December 31, 2010, principally due to increased capital expenditures. Total debt was $6,057 million at December 31, 2011 and $5,583 million at December 31, 2010. The
Corporation’s debt to capitalization ratio at December 31, 2011 was 24.6% compared with 24.9% at the end of 2010.

Capital and exploratory expenditures were as follows for the years ended December 31:



201120102009(Millions of dollars)Exploration and ProductionUnited States$4,305$2,935$1,200International3,0392,8221,927Total Exploration and Production7,3445,7573,127Marketing, Refining and Corporate11898118Total capital and exploratory expenditures$7,462$5,855$3,245Exploration expenses charged to income included above:United States$197$154$144International259209183Total exploration expenses charged to income included above$456$363$327











The Corporation anticipates investing $6.8 billion in capital and exploratory
expenditures in 2012, substantially all of which is targeted for E&P operations.

In the following discussion and elsewhere in this report, the financial effects of certain transactions are disclosed on an after-tax
basis. Management reviews segment earnings on an after-tax basis and uses after-tax amounts in its review of variances in segment earnings. Management believes that after-tax amounts are a preferable method of explaining variances in earnings, since
they show the entire effect of a transaction rather than only the pre-tax amount. After-tax amounts are determined by applying the income tax rate in each tax jurisdiction to pre-tax amounts.







Comparison of Results

*Amounts differ from E&P operating revenues in Note 19, Segment Information in the notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements primarily due to the
exclusion of sales of hydrocarbons purchased from third parties.

After considering the E&P items
affecting comparability of earnings between periods in the table on page 27, the remaining changes in E&P earnings are primarily attributable to changes in selling prices, production and sales volumes, operating costs, exploration expenses,
income taxes and foreign exchange, as discussed below.

Selling Prices:Higher average
selling prices increased E&P revenues by approximately $2,400 million in 2011 compared with 2010. Higher average selling prices increased E&P revenues by approximately $1,775 million in 2010 compared with 2009.

The Corporation’s average selling prices were as follows for the years ended December 31:

In October 2008, the Corporation closed Brent crude oil hedges covering 24,000 barrels per day from 2009 through 2012 by entering into
offsetting contracts with the same counterparty. The deferred after-tax losses as of the date the hedge positions were closed are recorded in earnings as the contracts mature. Crude oil hedges reduced E&P earnings by $327 million ($517 million
before income taxes) in 2011, $338 million ($533 million before income taxes) in 2010 and $337 million ($533 million before income taxes) in 2009. The remaining realized after-tax losses from the closed hedge positions will be approximately $325
million in 2012. The Corporation also entered into Brent crude oil hedges using fixed-price swap contracts to hedge 120,000 boepd of crude oil sales volumes for the full year of 2012 at an average price of $107.70 per barrel.

Production and Sales Volumes:The Corporation’s crude oil and natural gas production was 370,000
boepd in 2011 compared with 418,000 boepd in 2010 and 408,000 boepd in 2009. The principal reasons for the reduction are described below. Approximately 72% in 2011, 73% in 2010 and 72% in 2009 of the Corporation’s production was from
crude oil and natural gas liquids. The Corporation currently estimates that its 2012 production will average between 370,000 and 390,000 boepd, excluding the impact of asset sales and any Libyan production.

The Corporation’s net daily worldwide production was as follows for the years ended December 31:



201120102009(In thousands)Crude oil — barrels per dayUnited States817560Europe898883Africa66113120Asia131316Total249289279Natural gas liquids — barrels per dayUnited States131411Europe333Asia11—Total171814Natural gas — mcf per dayUnited States10010893Europe81134151Asia and other442427446Total623669690Barrels of oil equivalent — per day*370418408







*Reflects natural gas production converted on the basis of relative energy content (six mcf equals one barrel). Barrel of oil equivalence does not necessarily result
in price equivalence as the equivalent price of natural gas on a barrel of oil equivalent basis has been substantially lower than the corresponding price for crude oil over the recent past. See the average selling prices in the table above.







United States:Crude oil production in the United
States was higher in 2011 compared with 2010, primarily due to new wells in the Bakken oil shale play, partly offset by lower production due to a shut-in well at the Llano Field. Natural gas production was lower in 2011 compared with 2010, primarily
due to this shut-in well at the Llano Field. Crude oil and natural gas production was higher in 2010 compared with 2009, primarily due to new production from the Shenzi, Llano, Conger and Bakken fields.

Europe:Crude oil production was comparable in 2011 and 2010, as higher production from Russia was
largely offset by lower production from the Corporation’s United Kingdom North Sea assets. Crude oil production was higher in 2010 compared with 2009, due to higher production in Russia and in Norway following the acquisition of additional
interests in the Valhall and Hod fields in 2010. Natural gas production was lower in 2011 compared with 2010, primarily due to the sale in February 2011 of certain natural gas producing assets in the United Kingdom North Sea. Natural gas production
was lower in 2010 compared with 2009, primarily due to downtime at certain United Kingdom gas fields.

Africa:Crude oil production decreased in 2011 compared with 2010 due to the suspension of production
in Libya following civil unrest, the exchange in September 2010 of the Corporation’s interests in Gabon for increased interests in Norway, lower production entitlement in Equatorial Guinea and Algeria as a result of higher selling prices, and
natural decline in Equatorial Guinea. Crude oil production decreased in 2010 compared with 2009 following the exchange of Gabon for additional interests in the Valhall and Hod fields in Norway and lower entitlement to Algerian production.

Asia and other:Natural gas production in 2011 was higher than 2010, primarily due to
higher total nominations at the Joint Development Area of Malaysia and Thailand (JDA) and the adjacent Block PM301 in Malaysia and first production from the Gajah Baru Complex at the Natuna A Field in Indonesia, which commenced production in the
fourth quarter of 2011. Natural gas production in 2010 was lower than in 2009, primarily due to downtime at the Pangkah Field in Indonesia and a temporary shut-in at the Bumi Field in the JDA.

Sales Volumes:Lower sales volumes and other operating revenues decreased revenue by approximately
$1,100 million in 2011 compared with 2010 and higher sales volumes and other operating revenues increased revenue by $135 million in 2010 compared with 2009.

Operating Costs and Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization:Cash operating costs, consisting of production expenses and general and administrative expenses,
increased by $460 million in 2011 compared with 2010 and increased by $145 million in 2010 compared with 2009. The increase in 2011 was primarily due to higher production taxes as a result of higher selling prices, together with higher
operating and maintenance expenses, mainly in Norway and in the Bakken oil shale play. The increase in costs in 2010 compared to 2009 was primarily due to higher production taxes as a result of higher selling prices.

Depreciation, depletion and amortization charges increased by $83 million in 2011 and $109 million in 2010, compared with the
corresponding amounts in prior years. The increases in both 2011 and 2010 were primarily due to higher per barrel costs, reflecting higher finding and development costs. In addition, the higher total per barrel costs in 2011 resulted from a greater
proportion of production volumes from the Bakken.

Excluding items affecting comparability between periods, cash operating
costs per barrel of oil equivalent were $19.71 in 2011, $14.45 in 2010 and $13.70 in 2009. Depreciation, depletion and amortization costs per barrel of oil equivalent were $17.06 in 2011, $14.56 in 2010 and $14.19 in 2009. For 2012, cash operating
costs are estimated to be in the range of $20.00 to $21.00 per barrel and depreciation, depletion and amortization costs are estimated to be in the range of $20.50 to $21.50 per barrel, resulting in total unit costs in the range of $40.50 to $42.50
per barrel of oil equivalent, excluding Libyan operations.

Exploration
Expenses:Exploration expenses increased in 2011 compared to 2010, mainly due to higher dry hole expenses. Dry hole expenses included amounts relating to two exploration wells on the Semai V Block, offshore Indonesia
and a well in the North Red Sea Block 1, offshore Egypt. Exploration expenses also increased in 2010 from 2009, primarily due to higher lease amortization.

Income Taxes:Excluding the impact of items affecting comparability, the effective income tax rates for E&P operations were 38% in 2011, 44% in 2010 and 48% in
2009. The decrease in the effective income tax rate in 2011 compared with 2010 was predominantly due to the suspension of Libyan operations. The effective income tax rate for E&P operations in 2012 is estimated to be in the range of 36% to 40%,
excluding Libyan operations.







Foreign Exchange:The after-tax foreign currency losses
were $16 million in 2011, $9 million in 2010 and $10 million in 2009.

Items Affecting Comparability of
Earnings:Reported E&P earnings include the following items affecting comparability of income (expense) before and after income taxes for the years ended December 31:



Before Income TaxesAfter Income Taxes201120102009201120102009(Millions of dollars)Gains on asset sales$446$1,208$—$413$1,130$—Royalty dispute resolution——143——89Asset impairments(358)(532)(54)(140)(334)(26)Dry hole expense—(101)——(64)—Reductions in carrying values of assets——(23)——(18)Income tax adjustment———(29)——$88$575$66$244$732$45





2011:In February 2011, the Corporation completed the sale of its interests in the Easington Catchment Area
(Hess 30%), the Bacton Area (Hess 23%), the Everest Field (Hess 19%) and the Lomond Field (Hess 17%) in the United Kingdom North Sea for cash proceeds of $359 million, after post-closing adjustments. These disposals resulted in pre-tax gains
totaling $343 million ($310 million after income taxes). These assets had a productive capacity of approximately 15,000 boepd. The total combined net book value of the disposed assets prior to the sale was $16 million, including allocated goodwill
of $14 million. In August 2011, the Corporation completed the sale of its interests in the Snorre Field (Hess 1%), offshore Norway and the Cook Field (Hess 28%) in the United Kingdom North Sea for cash proceeds of $131 million, after post-closing
adjustments. These disposals resulted in non-taxable gains totaling $103 million. The total combined net book value of the disposed assets prior to the sale was $28 million, including allocated goodwill of $11 million.

In the third quarter of 2011, the Corporation recorded impairment charges of $358 million ($140 million after income taxes) related to
increases in the Corporation’s estimated abandonment liabilities primarily for non-producing properties which resulted in the book value of the properties exceeding their fair value. See Note 9, Asset Retirement Obligations in the notes to the
Consolidated Financial Statements.

In July 2011, the United Kingdom increased the supplementary tax rate on petroleum
operations to 32% from 20% with an effective date of March 24, 2011. As a result, the Corporation recorded a charge of $29 million to increase the deferred tax liability in the United Kingdom.

2010:    The Corporation completed the exchange of its interests in Gabon and the Clair Field in the United
Kingdom for additional interests of 28% and 25%, respectively, in the Valhall and Hod fields in Norway. This non-monetary transaction, which was recorded at fair value, resulted in a pre-tax gain of $1,150 million ($1,072 million after income
taxes). The Corporation also completed the sale of its interest in the Jambi Merang natural gas development project in Indonesia for a gain of $58 million.

The Corporation recorded a charge of $532 million ($334 million after income taxes) to fully impair the carrying value of its 55% interest in the West Mediterranean Block 1 concession (West Med
Block), located offshore Egypt. This interest was acquired in 2006 and included four natural gas discoveries and additional exploration prospects. The Corporation and its partners subsequently explored and further evaluated the area, made a fifth
discovery, conducted development planning, and held negotiations with the Egyptian authorities to amend the existing gas sales agreement. In September 2010, the Corporation and its partners notified the Egyptian authorities of their decision to
cease exploration activities and to relinquish a significant portion of the block. As a result, the Corporation fully impaired the carrying value of its interest in the West Med Block. The West Med Block was relinquished in 2011. The Corporation
also recorded $101 million ($64 million after income taxes) of dry hole expenses related to previously suspended well costs on the West Med Block offshore Egypt and Block BM-S-22 offshore Brazil, both of which were drilled prior to 2010.







2009:The U.S. Supreme Court decided it would not review
the decision of the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals against the U.S. Minerals Management Service (predecessor to the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Regulation and Enforcement) relating to royalty relief under the Deep Water Royalty Relief Act of
1995. As a result, the Corporation recognized after-tax income of $89 million to reverse all previously recorded royalties covering the periods from 2003 to 2009. The pre-tax amount of $143 million was reported in Other, net in the Statement of
Consolidated Income.

The Corporation recorded total asset impairment charges of $54 million ($26 million after
income taxes) to reduce the carrying value of two-short lived fields in the United Kingdom North Sea. Pre-tax charges of approximately $23 million ($18 million after income taxes) were recorded to impair the carrying values of production equipment
and to write down materials inventories in Equatorial Guinea and the United States. The pre-tax amount of most of the inventory write downs was reported in Production expenses in the Statement of Consolidated Income.

The Corporation’s future E&P earnings may be impacted by external factors, such as volatility in the selling prices of crude oil
and natural gas, reserve and production changes, exploration expenses, industry cost inflation, changes in foreign exchange rates and income tax rates, the effects of weather, political risk, environmental risk and catastrophic risk. In addition, as
a result of the oil spill in 2010 at the BP p.l.c. operated Macondo prospect in the Gulf of Mexico, there have been and there may be further changes in laws and regulations that could impact the Corporation’s future drilling operations and
increase its potential liability in the event of an oil spill. For a more comprehensive description of the risks that may affect the Corporation’s E&P business, see Item 1A.Risk Factors Related to Our Business and Operations.

Marketing and Refining

Results from M&R activities were losses of $584 million in 2011, losses of $231 million in 2010 and earnings of $127 million in 2009. Excluding the items affecting comparability reflected in
the table on page 23 and discussed below, results were losses of $59 million in 2011 and earnings of $58 million in 2010 and $115 million in 2009.

Refining:Refining results consist of the Corporation’s share of HOVENSA’s losses, together with the results of Port Reading and other miscellaneous
operating activities. Refining losses were $728 million in 2011 (including $525 million of after-tax losses related to the impairment recorded by HOVENSA and other charges due to the decision to shut down the refinery in St. Croix), $445 million in
2010 (including a $289 million after-tax charge to reduce the carrying value of the Corporation’s equity investment in HOVENSA) and $87 million in 2009 (including a benefit of $12 million due to an income tax adjustment).







In December 2010, the Corporation recorded an impairment charge of $300 million before
income taxes ($289 million after income taxes) to reduce the carrying value of its equity investment in HOVENSA, which was recorded in Income (loss) from equity investment in HOVENSA L.L.C., on the Statement of Consolidated Income. The investment
had been adversely affected by consecutive annual operating losses resulting from continued weak refining margins and refinery utilization, and a fourth quarter 2010 debt rating downgrade. As a result of a strategic assessment in 2010, HOVENSA
decided to lower its crude oil refining capacity to 350,000 from 500,000 barrels per day in 2011. The Corporation performed an impairment analysis and concluded that its investment had experienced an other than temporary decline in value. For
discussion of the impairment charge, see Note 5, HOVENSA L.L.C. Joint Venture in the notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Excluding items affecting comparability discussed above, the Corporation’s share of HOVENSA’s results was a loss of $198 million in 2011, $137 million in 2010 ($222 million before income taxes)
and $141 million ($230 million before income taxes) in 2009. U.S. Virgin Island income taxes have not been recorded on the Corporation’s share of HOVENSA’s 2011 results due to cumulative operating losses. These results reflect
lower refining margins, higher fuel costs and lower sales volumes. During 2010, the fluid catalytic cracking unit at HOVENSA was shut down for a scheduled turnaround. The Corporation’s share of HOVENSA’s turnaround expenses was
approximately $20 million after income taxes.

Other after-tax refining results, principally from Port Reading operations,
were a loss of $5 million in 2011, a loss of $19 million in 2010 and income of $42 million in 2009. During 2010, the Port Reading refining facility was shut down for 41 days for a scheduled turnaround. The after-tax expenses for the Port
Reading turnaround were approximately $30 million. The turnaround expenses are included in Other operating expenses in the Statement of Consolidated Income.

The following table summarizes refinery utilization rates for the years ended December 31:

*HOVENSA’s crude oil refining capacity was reduced to 350,000 from 500,000 barrels per day in the first half of 2011.

Marketing:Marketing operations, which consist principally of retail gasoline and energy marketing
activities, generated income of $185 million in 2011, $215 million in 2010 and $168 million in 2009. The decrease in earnings in 2011 compared with 2010 was due to lower sales volumes and lower margins. The increase in earnings in 2010 compared
with 2009 reflected improved margins from the weak economic environment in 2009.

The table below summarizes marketing sales
volumes for the years ended December 31:

The Corporation has a 50% voting interest in a consolidated partnership that trades energy commodities and energy derivatives. The
Corporation also takes trading positions for its own account. The Corporation’s after-tax results from trading activities, including its share of the results of the trading partnership, amounted to a loss of $41 million in 2011, a loss of
$1 million in 2010 and earnings of $46 million in 2009.

Marketing expenses increased in 2011 compared with 2010
reflecting higher retail credit card fees, maintenance, environmental and employee related expenses. Marketing expenses increased in 2010 compared with 2009, principally reflecting changes in retail credit card fees.







The Corporation’s future M&R earnings may be impacted by supply and demand factors,
volatility in margins, credit risks, the effects of weather, competitive industry conditions, political risk, environmental risk and catastrophic risk. For a more comprehensive description of the risks that may affect the Corporation’s M&R
business, see Item 1A.Risk Factors Related to Our Business and Operations.

Corporate

The following table summarizes corporate expenses for the years ended December 31:



201120102009(Millions of dollars)Corporate expenses (excluding items affecting comparability)$260$256$227Income taxes (benefits)(106)(104)(82)Net corporate expenses154152145Items affecting comparability between periods, after-tax—760Total corporate expenses, after-tax$154$159$205





Excluding items affecting comparability between periods, net corporate expenses were comparable in 2011 and 2010. The increase in net
corporate expenses in 2010 compared with 2009 primarily reflects higher employee and insurance costs and bank facility fees. After-tax corporate expenses in 2012 are estimated to be in the range of $160 million to $170 million.

In 2010, the Corporation recorded a pre-tax charge of $11 million ($7 million after income taxes) related to the repurchase of
the remaining $116 million of fixed-rate public notes that were scheduled to mature in 2011. In 2009, the Corporation recorded pre-tax charges of $54 million ($34 million after income taxes) related to the repurchase of $546 million in fixed-rate
public notes that were scheduled to mature in 2011 and $42 million ($26 million after income taxes) relating to retirement benefits and employee severance costs. The pre-tax charges in connection with the debt repurchases were recorded in Other,
net, and the pre-tax amounts of the retirement benefits and severance costs were recorded in General and administrative expenses in the Statement of Consolidated Income.

Interest

Interest expense was as follows for the years ended
December 31:



201120102009(Millions of dollars)Total interest incurred$396$366$366Capitalized interest(13)(5)(6)Interest expense before income taxes383361360Income taxes (benefits)(149)(140)(136)After-tax interest expense$234$221$224





The increase in interest expense in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily reflects higher average borrowings following the issuance of $1.25
billion of 30-year fixed-rate public notes in August 2010. Capitalized interest increased in 2011 due to the sanctioning of the Tubular Bells project. Interest expense was comparable in 2010 and 2009. After-tax interest expense in 2012 is expected
to be in the range of $245 million to $255 million.

Consolidated Sales and Cost of Products Sold

Sales and other operating revenues totaled $38,466 million in 2011, $33,862 million in 2010 and $29,614 million
in 2009. The increase in Sales and other operating revenues of 14% year-on-year from 2009 to 2011 is primarily due to higher crude oil and refined petroleum product selling prices, partially offset by lower crude oil and refined petroleum product
sales volumes.







The increase in Cost of products sold each year principally reflects higher prices for

Capital expenditures in 2011 included acquisitions of approximately $800 million for 185,000 net acres in the Utica Shale play in eastern
Ohio, $214 million for interests in two blocks in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq and $116 million for an additional 4% interest in the South Arne Field in Denmark. Capital expenditures in 2010 included acquisitions of 167,000 net acres in the Bakken
oil shale play in North Dakota from TRZ Energy, LLC for $1,075 million in cash and additional interests of 8% and 13% in the Valhall and Hod fields, respectively, for $507 million in cash. Capital expenditures in 2009 included acquisitions of $188
million for unproved leaseholds and $74 million for a 50% interest in blocks PM301 and PM302 in Malaysia, which are adjacent to Block A-18 of the JDA. In addition, proceeds from asset sales were $490 million in 2011 and $183 million in 2010.







Financing Activities:During 2011, net proceeds from
borrowings on available credit facilities were $422 million. During 2010, net proceeds from borrowings were $1,098 million, including the August 2010 issuance of $1,250 million of 30-year fixed-rate public notes with a coupon of 5.6% scheduled
to mature in 2041. The proceeds were used to purchase additional acreage in the Bakken and additional interests in the Valhall and Hod fields. In January 2010, the Corporation completed the repurchase of the remaining $116 million of fixed-rate
public notes that were scheduled to mature in 2011.

Total common stock dividends paid were $136 million in 2011 and $131
million in 2010 and 2009. The Corporation received net proceeds from the exercise of stock options, including related income tax benefits of $88 million, $54 million and $18 million in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.

Future Capital Requirements and Resources

The Corporation anticipates investing a total of approximately $6.8 billion in capital and exploratory expenditures during 2012, substantially all of which is targeted for E&P operations. The
Corporation expects to fund its 2012 operations, including capital expenditures, its share of HOVENSA financial support totaling $487 million, dividends, pension contributions and required debt repayments, with existing cash on-hand, cash flows
from operations including the effect of hedging, proceeds from asset sales and its available credit facilities. Crude oil and natural gas prices are volatile and difficult to predict. In addition, unplanned increases in the Corporation’s
capital expenditure program could occur. If conditions were to change, such as a significant decrease in commodity prices or an unexpected increase in capital expenditures, the Corporation would take steps to protect its financial flexibility and
may pursue other sources of liquidity, including the issuance of debt securities, the issuance of equity securities, and/or asset sales.

The table below summarizes the capacity, usage, and available capacity of the Corporation’s borrowing and letter of credit facilities at December 31, 2011:

(a)Total capacity of $1 billion subject to the amount of eligible receivables posted as collateral.



(b)Committed and uncommitted lines have expiration dates through 2014.

In April 2011, the Corporation entered into a new $4 billion syndicated revolving credit facility that matures in April 2016. This facility, which replaced a $3 billion facility that was scheduled to
mature in May 2012, can be used for borrowings and letters of credit. Borrowings on the facility bear interest at 1.25% above the London Interbank Offered Rate. A facility fee of 0.25% per annum is also payable on the amount of the facility.
The interest rate and facility fee are subject to adjustment if the Corporation’s credit rating changes. The covenants that establish restrictions on the amount of total borrowings and secured debt are consistent with the previous facility.

The Corporation has a 364-day asset-backed credit facility securitized by certain accounts receivable from its Marketing and
Refining operations. Under the terms of this financing arrangement, the Corporation has the ability to borrow or issue letters of credit of up to $1 billion subject to the availability of sufficient levels of eligible receivables. At
December 31, 2011, outstanding borrowings under this facility of $350 million were collateralized by a total of $947 million of accounts receivable, which are held by a wholly-owned subsidiary. These receivables are only available to pay the
general obligations of the Corporation after satisfaction of the outstanding obligations under the asset-backed facility.

The
Corporation also has a shelf registration statement filed with the SEC under which it may issue additional debt securities, warrants, common stock or preferred stock. Promptly after filing this report, as a result







of the Corporation’s existing shelf registration expiring on February 26, 2012, the Corporation anticipates filing a new shelf registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933,
as amended, under which it may issue, among other things, additional debt securities, warrants, common stock or preferred stock.

The Corporation’s long-term debt agreements contain a financial covenant that restricts the amount of total borrowings and secured
debt. At December 31, 2011, the Corporation is permitted to borrow up to an additional $24.9 billion for the construction or acquisition of assets. The Corporation has the ability to borrow up to an additional $4.5 billion of secured
debt at December 31, 2011.

The Corporation’s $1.7 billion in letters of credit outstanding at December 31, 2011
were primarily issued to satisfy margin requirements. See also Note 17, Risk Management and Trading Activities in the notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Credit Ratings

There are three major credit rating agencies that
rate the Corporation’s debt. All three agencies have currently assigned an investment grade rating with a stable outlook to the Corporation’s debt. The interest rates and facility fees charged on some of the Corporation’s credit
facilities, as well as margin requirements from risk management and trading counterparties, are subject to adjustment if the Corporation’s credit rating changes.

Contractual Obligations and Contingencies

Following is a table
showing aggregated information about certain contractual obligations at December 31, 2011:

*At December 31, 2011, the Corporation’s debt bears interest at a weighted average rate of 6.8%.

Supply commitments include term purchase agreements at market prices for a portion of the gasoline necessary to supply the
Corporation’s retail marketing system and feedstocks for the Port Reading refining facility. In addition, the Corporation has commitments to purchase refined petroleum products, natural gas and electricity to supply contracted customers in its
energy marketing business. These commitments were computed based predominately on year-end market prices.

The table also
reflects future capital expenditures, including the portion of the Corporation’s planned $6.8 billion capital investment program for 2012 that was contractually committed at December 31, 2011. Obligations for operating expenses
include commitments for transportation, seismic purchases, oil and gas production expenses and other normal business expenses. Other long-term liabilities reflect contractually committed obligations in the Consolidated Balance Sheet at
December 31, 2011, including asset retirement obligations, pension plan liabilities and estimates for uncertain income tax positions.

During 2011, the Corporation entered into a lease agreement for a floating production system and related support activities for the Tubular Bells Field. Payments under this five year contract, which total
approximately $420 million and are expected to commence by mid-2014, are included in Capital expenditures and other investments in the contractual obligations table above. The Corporation also has a tolling agreement with Bayonne Energy Center, LLC
(BEC) (Hess 50%), a joint venture formed to generate electricity for sale into the







New York City market. Under the tolling arrangement, the Corporation will pay its share of a predetermined monthly amount to BEC following the start up of plant operations, which is expected in
mid-2012. Estimated payments through 2027, which total approximately $415 million, are included in Operating expenses in the contractual obligations table.

The Corporation and certain of its subsidiaries lease gasoline stations, drilling rigs, tankers, office space and other assets for varying periods under leases accounted for as operating leases.

The Corporation has a contingent purchase obligation to acquire the remaining interest in WilcoHess, a retail gasoline station
joint venture. This contingent obligation, which expires in April 2014, was approximately $205 million at December 31, 2011.

The Corporation is contingently liable under letters of credit and under guarantees of the debt of other entities directly related to its business at December 31, 2011 as shown below (in millions of
dollars):



Letters of credit$67Guarantees15$82





Off-balance Sheet Arrangements

The Corporation has leveraged leases not included in its Consolidated Balance Sheet, primarily related to retail gasoline stations that the Corporation operates. The net present value of these leases is
$388 million at December 31, 2011 compared with $394 million at December 31, 2010. If these leases were included as debt, the Corporation’s December 31, 2011 debt to capitalization ratio would increase to 25.7% from
24.6%.

See also Note 18, Guarantees and Contingencies in the notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Foreign Operations

The
Corporation conducts exploration and production activities outside the United States, principally in Algeria, Australia, Azerbaijan, Brazil, Brunei, China, Denmark, Egypt, Equatorial Guinea, France, Ghana, Indonesia, the Kurdistan region of Iraq,
Libya, Malaysia, Norway, Peru, Russia, Thailand and the United Kingdom. Therefore, the Corporation is subject to the risks associated with foreign operations, including political risk, tax law changes and currency risk.

Accounting Policies

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

Accounting policies and estimates affect the recognition of assets and liabilities in the Corporation’s Consolidated Balance Sheet and revenues and expenses in the Statement of Consolidated Income.
The accounting methods used can affect net income, equity and various financial statement ratios. However, the Corporation’s accounting policies generally do not change cash flows or liquidity.

Accounting for Exploration and Development Costs:Exploration and production
activities are accounted for using the successful efforts method. Costs of acquiring unproved and proved oil and gas leasehold acreage, including lease bonuses, brokers’ fees and other related costs, are capitalized. Annual lease rentals,
exploration expenses and exploratory dry hole costs are expensed as incurred. Costs of drilling and equipping productive wells, including development dry holes, and related production facilities are capitalized. In production operations, costs of
injected CO2for tertiary recovery are expensed as incurred.

The costs of exploratory wells that find oil and gas reserves are capitalized pending determination of whether proved reserves
have been found. Exploratory drilling costs remain capitalized after drilling is completed if (1) the well has found a sufficient quantity of reserves to justify completion as a producing well and







(2) sufficient progress is being made in assessing the reserves and the economic and operational viability of the project. If either of those criteria is not met, or if there is substantial
doubt about the economic or operational viability of the project, the capitalized well costs are charged to expense. Indicators of sufficient progress in assessing reserves and the economic and operating viability of a project include: commitment of
project personnel, active negotiations for sales contracts with customers, negotiations with governments, operators and contractors and firm plans for additional drilling and other factors.

Crude Oil and Natural Gas Reserves:The SEC revised its oil and gas reserve estimation and disclosure
requirements effective for year-end 2009 reporting. In addition, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) revised its accounting standard on oil and gas reserve estimation and disclosures. The determination of estimated proved reserves is a
significant element in arriving at the results of operations of exploration and production activities. The estimates of proved reserves affect well capitalizations, the unit of production depreciation rates of proved properties and wells and
equipment, as well as impairment testing of oil and gas assets and goodwill.

For reserves to be booked as proved they must be
determined with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from known reservoirs under existing economic conditions, operating methods and government regulations. In addition, government and project operator approvals must be obtained and,
depending on the amount of the project cost, senior management or the board of directors must commit to fund the project. The Corporation maintains its own internal reserve estimates that are calculated by technical staff that work directly with the
oil and gas properties. The Corporation’s technical staff updates reserve estimates throughout the year based on evaluations of new wells, performance reviews, new technical data and other studies. To provide consistency throughout the
Corporation, standard reserve estimation guidelines, definitions, reporting reviews and approval practices are used. The internal reserve estimates are subject to internal technical audits and senior management review. The Corporation also engages
an independent third party consulting firm to audit approximately 80% of the Corporation’s total proved reserves.

Impairment of Long-lived Assets and Goodwill:As explained below, there are significant differences
in the way long-lived assets and goodwill are evaluated and measured for impairment testing. The Corporation reviews long-lived assets, including oil and gas fields, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the
carrying amounts may not be recovered. Long-lived assets are tested based on identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. If the carrying amounts of the long-lived assets are not expected to
be recovered by undiscounted future net cash flow estimates, the assets are impaired and an impairment loss is recorded. The amount of impairment is based on the estimated fair value of the assets generally determined by discounting anticipated
future net cash flows.

In the case of oil and gas fields, the present value of future net cash flows is based on
management’s best estimate of future prices, which is determined with reference to recent historical prices and published forward prices, applied to projected production volumes and discounted at a risk-adjusted rate. The projected production
volumes represent reserves, including probable reserves, expected to be produced based on a stipulated amount of capital expenditures.

The production volumes, prices and timing of production are consistent with internal projections and other externally reported information. Oil and gas prices used for determining asset impairments will
generally differ from those used in the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows, since the standardized measure requires the use of historical twelve month average prices.

The Corporation’s impairment tests of long-lived E&P producing assets are based on its best estimates of future production
volumes (including recovery factors), selling prices, operating and capital costs, the timing of future production and other factors, which are updated each time an impairment test is performed. The Corporation could have impairments if the
projected production volumes from oil and gas fields decrease, crude oil and natural gas selling prices decline significantly for an extended period or future estimated capital and operating costs increase significantly.

The Corporation’s goodwill is tested for impairment annually in the fourth quarter or when events or circumstances indicate that the
carrying amount of the goodwill may not be recoverable. The goodwill test is conducted at a reporting unit level, which is defined in accounting standards as an operating segment or one level







below an operating segment. The reporting unit or units to be used in an evaluation and measurement of goodwill for impairment testing are determined from a number of factors, including the
manner in which the business is managed. The Corporation has concluded that the E&P segment is the reporting unit for the purposes of testing goodwill for impairment, since the E&P segment is managed globally by one segment manager who
allocates financial and technical resources globally and reviews operating results at the segment level. Accordingly, the Corporation expects that the benefits of goodwill will be recovered through the operations of that segment.

If any of the E&P segment components, such as our financial reporting regions (United States, Europe, Africa and Asia) were considered
to be reporting units, an analysis would be performed to determine if these components were economically similar as defined in the accounting standard for goodwill (ASC 350-20-35). If components are economically similar, that guidance requires
that those components be aggregated and deemed a single reporting unit.

While the Corporation believes that the E&P segment
is the reporting unit because of the manner in which the business is managed, it also evaluated the required aggregation criteria specified in the accounting standard for segment reporting (ASC 280-10-50-11) and determined that its components are
economically similar for the following reasons:



•The Corporation operates its exploration and production segment as a single, global business.

•Each component produces oil and gas.

•The exploration and production processes are similar in each component.

•The methods used by each component to market and distribute oil and gas are similar.

•Customers of each component are similar.

•The components share technical resources and support services.

If the Corporation reorganized its exploration and production business such that there was more than one reporting unit, goodwill may be
assigned to two or more reporting units.

The Corporation’s fair value estimate of the E&P segment is the sum of:
(1) the discounted anticipated cash flows of producing assets and known developments, (2) the estimated risk adjusted present value of exploration assets, and (3) an estimated market premium to reflect the market price an acquirer
would pay for potential synergies including cost savings, access to new business opportunities, enterprise control, improved processes and increased market share. The Corporation also considers the relative market valuation of similar E&P
companies.

The determination of the fair value of the E&P segment depends on estimates about oil and gas reserves, future
prices, timing of future net cash flows and market premiums. Significant extended declines in crude oil and natural gas prices or reduced reserve estimates could lead to a decrease in the fair value of the E&P segment that could result in an
impairment of goodwill.

As there are significant differences in the way long-lived assets and goodwill are evaluated and
measured for impairment testing, there may be impairments of individual assets that would not cause an impairment of the goodwill assigned to the E&P segment.

Impairment of Equity Investees:The Corporation reviews equity method investments for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an other
than temporary decline in value may have occurred. The fair value measurement used in the impairment assessment is based on quoted market prices, where available, or other valuation techniques, including discounted cash flows. Differences between
the carrying value of the Corporation’s equity investments and its equity in the net assets of the affiliate that result from impairment charges are amortized over the remaining useful life of the affiliate’s fixed assets.

Income Taxes:Judgments are required in the determination and recognition of income tax assets and
liabilities in the financial statements. These judgments include the requirement to only recognize the financial statement effect of a tax position when management believes that it is more likely than not, that based on the technical merits, the
position will be sustained upon examination.

The Corporation has net operating loss carryforwards or credit carryforwards in
several jurisdictions, including the United States, and has recorded deferred tax assets for those losses and credits. Additionally, the Corporation has deferred tax assets due to temporary differences between the book basis and tax basis of certain







assets and liabilities. Regular assessments are made as to the likelihood of those deferred tax assets being realized. If it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets
will not be realized, a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amount that is expected to be realized. In evaluating realizability of deferred tax assets, the Corporation refers to the reversal periods for available
carryforward periods for net operating losses and credit carryforwards, temporary differences, the availability of tax planning strategies, the existence of appreciated assets and estimates of future taxable income and other factors. Estimates of
future taxable income are based on assumptions of oil and gas reserves and selling prices that are consistent with the Corporation’s internal business forecasts. Additionally, the Corporation has income taxes which have been deferred on
intercompany transactions eliminated in consolidation related to transfers of property, plant and equipment remaining within the consolidated group. The amortization of these income taxes deferred on intercompany transactions will occur ratably with
the recovery through depletion and depreciation of the carrying value of these assets. The Corporation does not provide for deferred U.S. income taxes for that portion of undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries that are indefinitely
reinvested in foreign operations.

Fair Value Measurements:The Corporation’s
derivative instruments and supplemental pension plan investments are recorded at fair value, with changes in fair value recognized in earnings or other comprehensive income each period as appropriate. The Corporation uses various valuation
approaches in determining fair value, including the market and income approaches. The Corporation’s fair value measurements also include non-performance risk and time value of money considerations. Counterparty credit is considered for
receivable balances, and the Corporation’s credit is considered for accrued liabilities.

The Corporation also records
certain nonfinancial assets and liabilities at fair value when required by generally accepted accounting principles. These fair value measurements are recorded in connection with business combinations, the initial recognition of asset retirement
obligations and any impairment of long-lived assets, equity method investments or goodwill.

The Corporation determines fair
value in accordance with the FASB fair value measurements accounting standard which established a hierarchy for the inputs used to measure fair value based on the source of the input, which generally range from quoted prices for identical
instruments in a principal trading market (Level 1) to estimates determined using related market data (Level 3). Multiple inputs may be used to measure fair value, however, the level of fair value is based on the lowest significant
input level within this fair value hierarchy.

Details on the methods and assumptions used to determine the fair values are as
follows:

Fair value measurements based on Level 1 inputs:Measurements that are most
observable are based on quoted prices of identical instruments obtained from the principal markets in which they are traded. Closing prices are both readily available and representative of fair value. Market transactions occur with sufficient
frequency and volume to assure liquidity. The fair value of certain of the Corporation’s exchange traded futures and options are considered Level 1.

Fair value measurements based on Level 2 inputs:Measurements derived indirectly from observable inputs or from quoted prices from markets that are less liquid
are considered Level 2. Measurements based on Level 2 inputs include over-the-counter derivative instruments that are priced on an exchange traded curve but have contractual terms that are not identical to exchange traded contracts. The
Corporation utilizes fair value measurements based on Level 2 inputs for certain forwards, swaps and options. The liability related to the Corporation’s crude oil hedges is classified as Level 2.

Fair value measurements based on Level 3 inputs:Measurements that are least observable are
estimated from related market data determined from sources with little or no market activity for comparable contracts or are positions with longer durations. For example, in its energy marketing business, the Corporation sells natural gas and
electricity to customers and offsets the price exposure by purchasing forward contracts. The fair value of these sales and purchases may be based on specific prices at less liquid delivered locations, which are classified as Level 3. Fair
values determined using discounted cash flows and other unobservable data are also classified as Level 3.

Derivatives:The Corporation utilizes derivative instruments for both risk management and trading
activities. In risk management activities, the Corporation uses futures, forwards, options and swaps, individually or in combination to mitigate its exposure to fluctuations in the prices of crude oil, natural gas, refined petroleum







products and electricity, as well as changes in interest and foreign currency exchange rates. In trading activities, the Corporation, principally through a consolidated partnership, trades
energy-related commodities and derivatives, including futures, forwards, options and swaps, based on expectations of future market conditions.

All derivative instruments are recorded at fair value in the Corporation’s Consolidated Balance Sheet. The Corporation’s policy for recognizing the changes in fair value of derivatives varies
based on the designation of the derivative. The changes in fair value of derivatives that are not designated as hedges are recognized currently in earnings. Derivatives may be designated as hedges of expected future cash flows or forecasted
transactions (cash flow hedges) or hedges of firm commitments (fair value hedges). The effective portion of changes in fair value of derivatives that are designated as cash flow hedges is recorded as a component of other comprehensive income (loss).
Amounts included in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) for cash flow hedges are reclassified into earnings in the same period that the hedged item is recognized in earnings. The ineffective portion of changes in fair value of derivatives
designated as cash flow hedges is recorded currently in earnings. Changes in fair value of derivatives designated as fair value hedges are recognized currently in earnings. The change in fair value of the related hedged commitment is recorded as an
adjustment to its carrying amount and recognized currently in earnings.

Derivatives that are designated as either cash flow or
fair value hedges are tested for effectiveness prospectively before they are executed and both prospectively and retrospectively on an on-going basis to determine whether they continue to qualify for hedge accounting. The prospective and
retrospective effectiveness calculations are performed using either historical simulation or other statistical models, which utilize historical observable market data consisting of futures curves and spot prices.

Retirement Plans:The Corporation has funded non-contributory defined benefit pension plans and an
unfunded supplemental pension plan. The Corporation recognizes in the Consolidated Balance Sheet the net change in the funded status of the projected benefit obligation for these plans.

The determination of the obligations and expenses related to these plans are based on several actuarial assumptions, the most significant
of which relate to the discount rate for measuring the present value of future plan obligations; expected long-term rates of return on plan assets; and rate of future increases in compensation levels. These assumptions represent estimates made by
the Corporation, some of which can be affected by external factors. For example, the discount rate used to estimate the Corporation’s projected benefit obligation is based on a portfolio of high-quality, fixed income debt instruments with
maturities that approximate the expected payment of plan obligations, while the expected return on plan assets is developed from the expected future returns for each asset category, weighted by the target allocation of pension assets to that asset
category. Changes in these assumptions can have a material impact on the amounts reported in the Corporation’s financial statements.

Asset Retirement Obligations:







Environment, Health and Safety

The Corporation has a values-based, socially-responsible strategy focused on improving environment, health and safety performance and
making a positive impact on communities where it does business. The strategy is reflected in the Corporation’s environment, health, safety and social responsibility (EHS & SR) policies and by environment and safety management systems
that help protect the Corporation’s workforce, customers and local communities. The Corporation’s management systems are designed to uphold or exceed international standards and are intended to promote internal consistency, adherence to
policy objectives and continual improvement in EHS & SR performance. Improved performance may, in the short-term, increase the Corporation’s operating costs and could also require increased capital expenditures to reduce potential
risks to assets, reputation and license to operate. In addition to enhanced EHS & SR performance, improved productivity and operational efficiencies may be realized as collateral benefits from investments in EHS & SR. The
Corporation has programs in place to evaluate regulatory compliance, audit facilities, train employees, prevent and manage risks and emergencies and to generally meet corporate EHS & SR goals.

The Corporation produces and distributes fuel oils in the United States. Many states and localities are adopting requirements that mandate
a lower sulfur content of fuel oils and restrict the types of fuel oil sold within their jurisdictions. These proposals could require capital expenditures by the Corporation for its Port Reading refining facility to meet the required sulfur content
standards or other changes in the marketing of fuel oils and affect the profitability of that facility.

The Corporation has
undertaken a program to assess, monitor and reduce the emission of greenhouse gases, including carbon dioxide and methane. The Corporation recognizes that climate change is a global environmental concern. The Corporation is committed to the
responsible management of greenhouse gas emissions from our existing assets and future developments and is implementing a strategy to control our carbon emissions.

The Corporation will have continuing expenditures for environmental assessment and remediation. Sites where corrective action may be necessary include gasoline stations, terminals, onshore exploration and
production facilities, refineries (including solid waste management units under permits issued pursuant to the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act) and, although not currently significant, “Superfund” sites where the Corporation has
been named a potentially responsible party.

The Corporation accrues for environmental assessment and remediation expenses when
the future costs are probable and reasonably estimable. At year-end 2011, the Corporation’s reserve for estimated remediation liabilities was approximately $60 million. The Corporation expects that existing reserves for environmental
liabilities will adequately cover costs to assess and remediate known sites. The Corporation’s remediation spending was $19 million in 2011, $13 million in 2010 and $11 million in 2009. Capital expenditures for facilities, primarily to comply
with federal, state and local environmental standards, other than for the low sulfur requirements, were approximately $95 million in 2011, $85 million in 2010 and $50 million in 2009.







Forward-looking Information

Certain sections of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including Business and Properties, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Quantitative and
Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk, include references to the Corporation’s future results of operations and financial position, liquidity and capital resources, capital expenditures, oil and gas production, tax rates, debt repayment,
hedging, derivative, market risk and environmental disclosures, off-balance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations and contingencies, which include forward-looking information. These sections typically include statements with words such as
“anticipate”, “estimate”, “expect”, “forecast”, “guidance”, “could”, “may”, “should”, “would” or similar words, indicating that future outcomes are uncertain.
Forward-looking disclosures are based on the Corporation’s current understanding and assessment of these activities and reasonable assumptions about the future. Actual results may differ from these disclosures because of changes in market
conditions, government actions and other factors. For more information regarding the factors that may cause the Corporation’s results to differ from these statements, see Item 1A.Risk Factors Related to Our Business and Operations.



Item 7A.Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

In the normal course of its business, the Corporation is exposed to commodity risks related to changes in the price of crude oil, natural gas, refined petroleum products and electricity, as well as to
changes in interest rates and foreign currency values. In the disclosures that follow, risk management activities are referred to as energy marketing and corporate risk management activities. The Corporation also has trading operations, principally
through a 50% voting interest in a consolidated partnership that trades energy-related commodities, securities and derivatives. These activities are also exposed to commodity risks primarily related to the prices of crude oil, natural gas and
refined petroleum products. The following describes how these risks are controlled and managed.

Controls:The Corporation maintains a control environment under the direction of its chief risk
officer and through its corporate risk policy, which the Corporation’s senior management has approved. Controls include volumetric, term and value at risk limits. The chief risk officer must approve the use of new instruments or commodities.
Risk limits are monitored and are reported on a daily basis to business units and to senior management. The Corporation’s risk management department also performs independent verifications of sources of fair values and validations of valuation
models. These controls apply to all of the Corporation’s risk management and trading activities, including the consolidated trading partnership. The Corporation’s treasury department is responsible for administering and monitoring foreign
exchange rate and interest rate hedging programs.

The Corporation uses value at risk to monitor and control commodity risk
within its risk management and trading activities. The value at risk model uses historical simulation and the results represent the potential loss in fair value over one day at a 95% confidence level. The model captures both first and second order
sensitivities for options. Results may vary from time to time as strategies change in trading activities or hedging levels change in risk management activities.

Instruments:The Corporation primarily uses forward commodity contracts, foreign exchange forward contracts, futures, swaps, options and energy commodity based
securities in its risk management and trading activities. These contracts are generally widely traded instruments with standardized terms. The following describes these instruments and how the Corporation uses them:



•Forward Commodity Contracts:The Corporation enters into contracts for the forward purchase and sale of commodities. At settlement date, the
notional value of the contract is exchanged for physical delivery of the commodity. Forward contracts that are deemed normal purchase and sale contracts are excluded from the quantitative market risk disclosures.



•Forward Foreign Exchange Contracts:The Corporation enters into forward contracts primarily for the British Pound and the Thai Baht, which
commit the Corporation to buy or sell a fixed amount of these currencies at a predetermined exchange rate on a future date.



•Exchange Traded Contracts:The Corporation uses exchange traded contracts, including futures, on a number of different underlying energy
commodities. These contracts are settled daily with the relevant exchange and may be subject to exchange position limits.







•Swaps:The Corporation uses financially settled swap contracts with third parties as part of its risk management and trading activities. Cash
flows from swap contracts are determined based on underlying commodity prices or interest rates and are typically settled over the life of the contract.



•Options:Options on various underlying energy commodities include exchange traded and third party contracts and have various exercise periods.
As a seller of options, the Corporation receives a premium at the outset and bears the risk of unfavorable changes in the price of the commodity underlying the option. As a purchaser of options, the Corporation pays a premium at the outset and has
the right to participate in the favorable price movements in the underlying commodities.



•Energy Securities:Energy securities include energy-related equity or debt securities issued by a company or government or related derivatives
on these securities.

Risk Management Activities

Energy marketing activities:In its energy marketing activities, the Corporation sells refined
petroleum products, natural gas and electricity principally to commercial and industrial businesses at fixed and floating prices for varying periods of time. Commodity contracts such as futures, forwards, swaps and options together with physical
assets, such as storage, are used to obtain supply and reduce margin volatility or lower costs related to sales contracts with customers.

Corporate risk management:Corporate risk management activities include transactions designed to reduce risk in the selling prices of crude oil, refined petroleum
products or natural gas produced by the Corporation or to reduce exposure to foreign currency or interest rate movements. Generally, futures, swaps or option strategies may be used to reduce risk in the selling price of a portion of the
Corporation’s crude oil or natural gas production. Forward contracts may also be used to purchase certain currencies in which the Corporation does business with the intent of reducing exposure to foreign currency fluctuations. Interest rate
swaps may also be used, generally to convert fixed-rate interest payments to floating.

The Corporation has outstanding foreign
exchange contracts used to reduce its exposure to fluctuating foreign exchange rates for various currencies, including the British Pound and the Thai Baht. At December31,2011, the Corporation had a payable for foreign
exchange contracts maturing in 2012 with a fair value of $14million. The change in fair value of the foreign exchange contracts from a 10% strengthening of the U.S. Dollar exchange rate is estimated to be a loss of
approximately $89 million at December 31, 2011.

The Corporation’s outstanding long-term debt of $6,040 million has a
fair value of $7,317 million at December 31, 2011. A 15% decrease in the rate of interest would increase the fair value of debt by approximately $247 million at December 31, 2011.

foreign exchange and interest rate derivatives described above:



20112010(Millions of dollars)At December 31$94$5Average305High946Low84





The increase in the value at risk for the Corporation’s energy marketing and risk management commodity derivatives activities in 2011
primarily reflects additional Brent crude oil cash flow hedge positions as described in Note 17, Risk Management and Trading Activities in the notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Trading Activities

Trading activities are conducted principally through a
trading partnership in which the Corporation has a 50% voting interest. This consolidated entity intends to generate earnings through various strategies primarily using energy commodities, securities and derivatives. The Corporation also takes
trading positions for its own account.

The information that follows represents 100% of the trading partnership and the Corporation’s proprietary trading accounts.
Derivative trading transactions are marked-to-market and unrealized gains or losses are recognized currently in earnings. Gains or losses from sales of physical products are recorded at the time of sale. Net realized gains on trading activities
amounted to $44 million in 2011 and $375 million in 2010. The following table provides an assessment of the factors affecting the changes in fair value of financial instruments and derivative commodity contracts used in trading activities:

Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial
Reporting

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial
reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f). Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the
effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, based on the framework in Internal Control — Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on our evaluation, management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2011.

The Corporation’s independent registered public accounting firm, Ernst & Young LLP, has audited the effectiveness of the
Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2011, as stated in their report, which is included herein.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

Hess Corporation

We have audited Hess Corporation’s internal control
over financial reporting as of December 31, 2011, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria). Hess
Corporation’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s
Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards
require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control
over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered
necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s
internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions
and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that
receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections
of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, Hess Corporation maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2011 based on the COSO criteria.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheet of Hess Corporation and consolidated subsidiaries as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, and the related statements of consolidated income, cash flows, and equity and
comprehensive income for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2011 of Hess Corporation and consolidated subsidiaries, and our report dated February 27, 2012 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

of the Corporation’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and schedule based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position
of Hess Corporation and consolidated subsidiaries at December 31, 2011 and 2010, and the consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2011, in conformity with
U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also, in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly in all material respects, the
information set forth therein.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (United States), Hess Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2011, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring

HESS CORPORATION AND CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS



1.Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Nature of Business:Hess Corporation and its subsidiaries
(the Corporation) engage in the exploration for and the development, production, purchase, transportation and sale of crude oil and natural gas. These activities are conducted principally in Algeria, Australia, Azerbaijan, Brazil, Brunei, China,
Denmark, Egypt, Equatorial Guinea, France, Ghana, Indonesia, the Kurdistan region of Iraq, Libya, Malaysia, Norway, Peru, Russia, Thailand, the United Kingdom and the United States (U.S.). In addition, the Corporation manufactures refined petroleum
products and purchases, markets and trades refined petroleum products, natural gas and electricity. The Corporation owns 50% of HOVENSA L.L.C. (HOVENSA), a joint venture in the U.S. Virgin Islands. In January 2012, HOVENSA announced a decision to
shut down its refinery and continue to operate the complex as an oil storage terminal. The Corporation also operates a refining facility, terminals and retail gasoline stations, most of which include convenience stores that are located on the East
Coast of the United States.

In preparing financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles (GAAP), management makes estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet and revenues and expenses in the Statement of Consolidated Income. Actual results could differ
from those estimates. Among the estimates made by management are oil and gas reserves, asset valuations, depreciable lives, pension liabilities, legal and environmental obligations, asset retirement obligations and income taxes. Certain information
in the financial statements and notes has been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation. In the preparation of these financial statements, the Corporation has evaluated subsequent events through the date of issuance.

Principles of Consolidation:The consolidated financial
statements include the accounts of Hess Corporation and entities in which the Corporation owns more than a 50% voting interest or entities that the Corporation controls. The Corporation consolidates the trading partnership in which it owns a 50%
voting interest and over which it exercises control. The Corporation’s undivided interests in unincorporated oil and gas exploration and production ventures are proportionately consolidated. Investments in affiliated companies, 20% to 50% owned
and where the Corporation has the ability to influence the operating or financial decisions of the affiliate, including HOVENSA, are accounted for using the equity method.

Revenue Recognition:The Corporation recognizes
revenues from the sale of crude oil, natural gas, refined petroleum products and other merchandise when title passes to the customer. Sales are reported net of excise and similar taxes in the Statement of Consolidated Income. The Corporation
recognizes revenues from the production of natural gas properties based on sales to customers. Differences between Exploration & Production (E&P) natural gas volumes sold and the Corporation’s share of natural gas production are
not material. Revenues from natural gas and electricity sales by the Corporation’s marketing operations are recognized based on meter readings and estimated deliveries to customers since the last meter reading.

In its E&P activities, the Corporation engages in crude oil purchase and sale transactions with the same counterparty that are entered
into in contemplation of one another for the primary purpose of changing location or quality. Similarly, in its marketing activities, the Corporation enters into refined petroleum product purchase and sale transactions with the same counterparty.
These arrangements are reported net in Sales and other operating revenues in the Statement of Consolidated Income.

Derivatives:The Corporation utilizes derivative instruments
for both risk management and trading activities. In risk management activities, the Corporation uses futures, forwards, options and swaps, individually or in combination, to mitigate its exposure to fluctuations in prices of crude oil, natural gas,
refined petroleum products and electricity, as well as changes in interest and foreign currency exchange rates. In trading activities, the Corporation, principally through a consolidated partnership, trades energy-related commodities and
derivatives, including futures, forwards, options and swaps based on expectations of future market conditions.

All derivative
instruments are recorded at fair value in the Corporation’s Consolidated Balance Sheet. The Corporation’s policy for recognizing the changes in fair value of derivatives varies based on the designation of the derivative. The changes in
fair value of derivatives that are not designated as hedges are recognized currently







HESS CORPORATION AND CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued)



in earnings. Derivatives may be designated as hedges of expected future cash flows or forecasted transactions (cash flow hedges) or hedges of firm commitments (fair value hedges). The effective
portion of changes in fair value of derivatives that are designated as cash flow hedges is recorded as a component of other comprehensive income (loss) while the ineffective portion of the changes in fair value is recorded currently in earnings.
Amounts included in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) for cash flow hedges are reclassified into earnings in the same period that the hedged item is recognized in earnings. Changes in fair value of derivatives designated as fair value
hedges are recognized currently in earnings. The change in fair value of the related hedged commitment is recorded as an adjustment to its carrying amount and recognized currently in earnings.

Cash and Cash Equivalents:Cash equivalents
consist of highly liquid investments, which are readily convertible into cash and have maturities of three months or less when acquired.

Inventories:Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or
market. For refined petroleum product inventories valued at cost, the Corporation uses principally the last-in, first-out (LIFO) inventory method. For the remaining inventories, cost is generally determined using average actual costs.

Exploration and Development
Costs:E&P activities are accounted for using the successful efforts method. Costs of acquiring unproved and proved oil and gas leasehold acreage, including lease bonuses, brokers’ fees and other related
costs, are capitalized. Annual lease rentals, exploration expenses and exploratory dry hole costs are expensed as incurred. Costs of drilling and equipping productive wells, including development dry holes, and related production facilities are
capitalized. In production operations, costs of injected CO2for tertiary recovery are expensed as incurred.

The costs of exploratory wells that find oil and gas reserves are capitalized
pending determination of whether proved reserves have been found. Exploratory drilling costs remain capitalized after drilling is completed if (1) the well has found a sufficient quantity of reserves to justify completion as a producing well
and (2) sufficient progress is being made in assessing the reserves and the economic and operational viability of the project. If either of those criteria is not met, or if there is substantial doubt about the economic or operational viability
of a project, the capitalized well costs are charged to expense. Indicators of sufficient progress in assessing reserves and the economic and operating viability of a project include commitment of project personnel, active negotiations for sales
contracts with customers, negotiations with governments, operators and contractors, firm plans for additional drilling and other factors.

Depreciation, Depletion and
Amortization:The Corporation records depletion expense for acquisition costs of proved properties using the units of production method over proved oil and gas reserves. Depreciation and depletion expense for oil and
gas production equipment and wells is calculated using the units of production method over proved developed oil and gas reserves. Provisions for impairment of undeveloped oil and gas leases are based on periodic evaluations and other factors.
Depreciation of all other plant and equipment is determined on the straight-line method based on estimated useful lives. Retail gas stations and equipment related to a leased property, are depreciated over the estimated useful lives not to exceed
the remaining lease period. The Corporation records the cost of acquired customers in its energy marketing activities as intangible assets and amortizes these costs on the straight-line method over the expected renewal period based on historical
experience.

Capitalized Interest:Interest from external
borrowings is capitalized on material projects using the weighted average cost of outstanding borrowings until the project is substantially complete and ready for its intended use, which for oil and gas assets is at first production from the field.
Capitalized interest is depreciated over the useful lives of the assets in the same manner as the depreciation of the underlying assets.

Asset Retirement Obligations:The
Corporation has material legal obligations to remove and dismantle long-lived assets and to restore land or seabed at certain exploration and production locations. The Corporation recognizes a liability for the fair value of legally required asset
retirement obligations associated with long-lived assets in the period in which the retirement obligations are incurred. In addition, the fair value of any legally







HESS CORPORATION AND CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued)



required conditional asset retirement obligations is recorded if the liability can be reasonably estimated. The Corporation capitalizes the associated asset retirement costs as part of the
carrying amount of the long-lived assets.

Impairment of Long-lived
Assets:The Corporation reviews long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recovered. If the carrying amounts are not expected to be
recovered by undiscounted future cash flows, the assets are impaired and an impairment loss is recorded. The amount of impairment is based on the estimated fair value of the assets generally determined by discounting anticipated future net cash
flows. In the case of oil and gas fields, the net present value of future cash flows is based on management’s best estimate of future prices, which is determined with reference to recent historical prices and published forward prices, applied
to projected production volumes and discounted at a risk-adjusted rate. The projected production volumes represent reserves, including probable reserves, expected to be produced based on a stipulated amount of capital expenditures. The production
volumes, prices and timing of production are consistent with internal projections and other externally reported information. Oil and gas prices used for determining asset impairments will generally differ from the average prices used in the
standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows.

Impairment of Equity Investees:The
Corporation reviews equity method investments for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an other than temporary decline in value may have occurred. The fair value measurement used in the impairment assessment is based
on quoted market prices, where available, or other valuation techniques, including discounted cash flows. Differences between the carrying value of the Corporation’s equity investments and its equity in the net assets of the affiliate that
result from impairment charges are amortized over the remaining useful life of the affiliate’s fixed assets.

Impairment of Goodwill:Goodwill is tested
for impairment annually in the fourth quarter or when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the goodwill may not be recoverable. This impairment test is calculated at the reporting unit level, which for the
Corporation’s goodwill is the Exploration and Production operating segment. The Corporation identifies potential impairments by comparing the fair value of the reporting unit to its book value, including goodwill. If the fair value of the
reporting unit exceeds the carrying amount, goodwill is not impaired. If the carrying value exceeds the fair value, the Corporation calculates the possible impairment loss by comparing the implied fair value of goodwill with the carrying amount. If
the implied fair value of goodwill is less than the carrying amount, an impairment would be recorded.

Income Taxes:

Fair Value Measurements:The Corporation’s
derivative instruments and supplemental pension plan investments are recorded at fair value, with changes in fair value recognized in earnings or other comprehensive income each period as appropriate. The Corporation uses various valuation
approaches in determining fair value, including the market and income approaches. The Corporation’s fair value measurements also include







HESS CORPORATION AND CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued)



non-performance risk and time value of money considerations. Counterparty credit is considered for receivable balances, and the Corporation’s credit is considered for accrued liabilities.

The Corporation also records certain nonfinancial assets and liabilities at fair value when required by GAAP. These fair value
measurements are recorded in connection with business combinations, the initial recognition of asset retirement obligations and any impairment of long-lived assets, equity method investments or goodwill.

The Corporation determines fair value in accordance with the fair value measurements accounting standard which established a hierarchy for
the inputs used to measure fair value based on the source of the input, which generally range from quoted prices for identical instruments in a principal trading market (Level 1) to estimates determined using related market data
(Level 3). Multiple inputs may be used to measure fair value, however, the level of fair value is based on the lowest significant input level within this fair value hierarchy.

Details on the methods and assumptions used to determine the fair values are as follows:

Fair value measurements based on Level 1 inputs:Measurements that are most observable are based
on quoted prices of identical instruments obtained from the principal markets in which they are traded. Closing prices are both readily available and representative of fair value. Market transactions occur with sufficient frequency and volume to
assure liquidity. The fair value of certain of the Corporation’s exchange traded futures and options are considered Level 1.

Fair value measurements based on Level 2 inputs:Measurements derived indirectly from observable inputs or from quoted prices from markets that are less liquid
are considered Level 2. Measurements based on Level 2 inputs include over-the-counter derivative instruments that are priced on an exchange traded curve, but have contractual terms that are not identical to exchange traded contracts. The
Corporation utilizes fair value measurements based on Level 2 inputs for certain forwards, swaps and options. The liability related to the Corporation’s crude oil hedges is classified as Level 2.

Fair value measurements based on Level 3 inputs:Measurements that are least observable are
estimated from related market data, determined from sources with little or no market activity for comparable contracts or are positions with longer durations. For example, in its energy marketing business, the Corporation enters into contracts to
sell natural gas and electricity to customers and offsets the price exposure by purchasing forward contracts. The fair value of these sales and purchases may be based on specific prices at less liquid delivered locations, which are classified as
Level 3. There may be offsets to these positions that are priced based on more liquid markets, which are, therefore, classified as Level 1 or Level 2. Fair values determined using discounted cash flows and other unobservable data are
also classified as Level 3.

Retirement Plans:The Corporation
recognizes the funded status of defined benefit postretirement plans in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The funded status is measured as the difference between the fair value of plan assets and the projected benefit obligation. The Corporation
recognizes the net changes in the funded status of these plans in the year in which such changes occur. Prior service costs and actuarial gains and losses in excess of 10% of the greater of the benefit obligation or the market value of assets are
amortized over the average remaining service period of active employees.

Share-based
Compensation:The fair value of all share-based compensation is expensed and recognized on a straight-line basis over the full vesting period of the awards.

Foreign Currency
Translation:The U.S. Dollar is the functional currency (primary currency in which business is conducted) for most foreign operations. Adjustments resulting from translating monetary assets and liabilities that
are denominated in a non-functional currency into the functional currency are recorded in Other, net in the Statement of Consolidated Income. For operations that do not use the U.S. Dollar as the functional currency, adjustments resulting from
translating foreign currency assets and liabilities into U.S. Dollars are recorded in a separate component of equity titled Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).

Maintenance and Repairs:Maintenance and repairs
are expensed as incurred, including costs of refinery turnarounds. Capital improvements are recorded as additions in Property, plant and equipment.







HESS CORPORATION AND CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued)



Environmental Expenditures:The Corporation accrues
and expenses environmental costs to remediate existing conditions related to past operations when the future costs are probable and reasonably estimable. The Corporation capitalizes environmental expenditures that increase the life or efficiency of
property or that reduce or prevent future adverse impacts to the environment.



2.Acquisitions and Dispositions

2011:In the third quarter of 2011, the Corporation entered into agreements to
acquire approximately 85,000 net acres in the Utica Shale play in eastern Ohio for approximately $750 million, principally through the acquisition of Marquette Exploration, LLC (Marquette). This acquisition strengthens the Corporation’s
portfolio of unconventional assets. The acquisition of Marquette has been accounted for as a business combination and the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed were recorded at fair value. The estimated fair value was based on a valuation
approach using market related data which is a Level 3 measurement. The majority of the purchase price was assigned to unproved properties and the remainder to producing wells and working capital. This transaction is subject to normal post-closing
adjustments.

In October 2011, the Corporation completed the acquisition of a 50% undivided interest in CONSOL Energy
Inc.’s (CONSOL) nearly 200,000 acres, in the Utica Shale play in eastern Ohio, for $59 million in cash at closing and the agreement to fund 50% of CONSOL’s share of the drilling costs up to $534 million within a 5-year period.
This transaction has been accounted for as an asset acquisition.

In February 2011, the Corporation completed the sale of its
interests in the Easington Catchment Area (Hess 30%), the Bacton Area (Hess 23%), the Everest Field (Hess 19%) and the Lomond Field (Hess 17%) in the United Kingdom North Sea for cash proceeds of $359 million, after post-closing adjustments.
These disposals resulted in pre-tax gains totaling $343 million ($310 million after income taxes). These assets had a productive capacity of approximately 15,000 boepd. The total combined net book value of the disposed assets prior to the
sale was $16 million, including allocated goodwill of $14 million.

In August 2011, the Corporation completed the
sale of its interests in the Snorre Field (Hess 1%), offshore Norway and the Cook Field (Hess 28%) in the United Kingdom North Sea for cash proceeds of $131 million, after post-closing adjustments. These disposals resulted in non-taxable gains
totaling $103 million. These assets were producing at a combined net rate of approximately 2,500 boepd at the time of sale. The total combined net book value of the disposed assets prior to the sale was $28 million, including allocated goodwill
of $11 million.

2010:In December, the Corporation acquired approximately
167,000 net acres in the Bakken oil shale play (Bakken) in North Dakota from TRZ Energy, LLC for $1,075 million in cash. In December, the Corporation also completed the acquisition of American Oil & Gas Inc. (American Oil & Gas)
for approximately $675 million through the issuance of approximately 8.6 million shares of the Corporation’s common stock, which increased the Corporation’s acreage position in the Bakken by approximately 85,000 net acres. The
properties acquired are located near the Corporation’s existing acreage. These acquisitions strengthen the Corporation’s acreage position in the Bakken, leverage existing capabilities and infrastructure and are expected to contribute to
future reserve and production growth. Both of these transactions were accounted for as business combinations and the majority of the fair value of the assets acquired was assigned to unproved properties. The total goodwill recorded on these
transactions was $332 million after final post-closing adjustments.

In September, the Corporation completed the exchange of
its interests in Gabon and the Clair Field in the United Kingdom for additional interests of 28% and 25%, respectively, in the Valhall and Hod fields offshore Norway. This non-monetary exchange was accounted for as a business combination and was
recorded at fair value. The transaction resulted in a pre-tax gain of $1,150 million ($1,072 million after income taxes). The total combined carrying amount of the disposed assets prior to the exchange was $702 million, including goodwill of $65
million. The Corporation also acquired, from a different third party, additional interests of 8% and 13% in the Valhall and Hod fields, respectively, for $507 million in cash. This acquisition was accounted for as a







HESS CORPORATION AND CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued)



business combination. As a result of both of these transactions, the Corporation’s total interests in the Valhall and Hod fields are 64% and 63%, respectively. The primary reason for these
transactions was to acquire long-lived crude oil reserves and future production growth. The following table summarizes the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in 2010 and adjusted for final post-closing adjustments in both of
these transactions:





ExchangeAcquisitionTotal(Millions of dollars)Property, plant and equipment$2,020$570$2,590Goodwill688219907Current assets15523178Total assets acquired2,8638123,675Current liabilities(135)(32)(167)Deferred tax liabilities(688)(219)(907)Asset retirement obligations(188)(54)(242)Net assets acquired$1,852$507$2,359





For all 2010 acquisitions and the exchange described above, the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at fair value. The
estimated fair value of the property, plant and equipment acquired in the transactions described above was primarily based on an income approach. The significant inputs used in this Level 3 fair value measurement include assumed future production
and capital based on anticipated development plans, commodity prices, costs and a risk-adjusted discount rate. The goodwill recorded equals the deferred tax liability recognized for the differences in book and tax bases of the assets acquired. The
goodwill is not expected to be deductible for income tax purposes.

In January, the Corporation completed the sale of its
interest in the Jambi Merang natural gas development project in Indonesia (Hess 25%) for cash proceeds of $183 million. The transaction resulted in a gain of $58 million, after deducting the net book value of assets including goodwill of
$7 million.

2009:The Corporation acquired for $74 million a 50% interest in Blocks PM301
and PM302 in Malaysia, which are adjacent to Block A-18 of the Joint Development Area of Malaysia/Thailand (JDA) and contain an extension of the Bumi Field. The Corporation also acquired 37 previously leased retail gasoline stations, primarily
through the assumption of $65 million of fixed-rate notes.



3.Libyan Operations

In response to civil unrest in Libya, a number of measures were taken by the international community in the first
quarter of 2011, including the imposition of economic sanctions. Production at the Waha Field was suspended in the first quarter of 2011. As a consequence of the civil unrest and the sanctions, the Corporation delivered force majeure notices to the
Libyan government relating to the agreements covering its exploration and production interests in order to protect its rights while it was temporarily prevented from fulfilling its obligations and benefiting from the rights granted by those
agreements. Production at the Waha Field restarted during the fourth quarter of 2011 at levels that were significantly lower than those prior to the civil unrest. The Corporation’s Libyan production averaged 23,000 barrels of oil equivalent per
day (boepd) for the full year of 2010 and 4,000 boepd for 2011. The force majeure covering the Corporation’s production interests was withdrawn at the end of the fourth quarter of 2011, as the economic sanctions were lifted. The force majeure
covering the Corporation’s offshore exploration interests remained in place at year-end but is expected to be withdrawn in 2012. The Corporation had proved reserves of 166 million barrels of oil equivalent in Libya at December 31,
2011. At December 31, 2011, the net book value of the Corporation’s exploration and production assets in Libya was approximately $500 million.

5.HOVENSA L.L.C. Joint Venture

The Corporation has a 50% interest in HOVENSA L.L.C. (HOVENSA), a joint venture with a subsidiary of Petroleos de
Venezuela, S.A. (PDVSA), which owns a refinery in the U.S. Virgin Islands. The Corporation’s investment in HOVENSA is accounted for using the equity method. In accordance with Rule 3-09 of Regulation S-X, the Corporation has filed the audited
financial statements for HOVENSA in this report on Form 10-K. Summarized financial information for HOVENSA as of December 31 and for the years then ended follows:

investment.









HESS CORPORATION AND CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued)



In December 2010, the Corporation recorded an impairment
charge of $300 million before income taxes ($289 million after income taxes) to reduce the carrying value of its equity investment in HOVENSA to its fair value, which was recorded in Income (loss) from equity investment in HOVENSA L.L.C. The
investment had been adversely affected by consecutive annual operating losses resulting from continued weak refining margins and refinery utilization and a fourth quarter 2010 debt rating downgrade. As a result of a strategic assessment in 2010,
HOVENSA decided to lower crude oil refining capacity to 350,000 from 500,000 barrels per day in 2011. The Corporation performed an impairment analysis and concluded that its investment had experienced an other than temporary decline in value. The
fair value was determined based on an income approach using estimated refined petroleum product selling prices and volumes, related costs of product sold, capital and operating expenditures and a market based discount rate (a Level 3 fair value
measurement).

In February 2012, HOVENSA completed a tender offer to repurchase its outstanding tax exempt bonds at par.

In the fourth quarter of 2011, the Corporation agreed to sell its
interests in the Snohvit Field in Norway (Hess 3%) for approximately $135 million, after normal closing adjustments. At December 31, 2011, the Corporation classified this property and another property as assets held for sale. At
December 31, 2011, the total carrying amount of these assets of $764 million was reported in Other current assets, including goodwill of $62 million. In addition, related asset retirement obligations and deferred income taxes totaling $556
million were reported in Accrued liabilities. In accordance with GAAP, properties classified as held for sale are not depreciated but are subject to impairment testing.

The following table discloses the amount of capitalized exploratory well costs pending determination of proved reserves at December 31, and the changes therein during the respective years:

The preceding table excludes exploratory dry hole costs of $348 million, $127 million and $193 million in 2011, 2010 and 2009,
respectively, which were incurred and subsequently expensed in the same year. In 2011, capitalized well costs reclassified based on the determination of proved reserves primarily related to the Tubular Bells project in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico,
which was sanctioned during the year.

At December 31, 2011, exploratory drilling costs capitalized in excess of one year
past completion of drilling were incurred as follows (in millions of dollars):





2010$423200944820083922007722006168$1,503





The capitalized well costs in excess of one year relate to 11 projects. Approximately 43% of the capitalized well costs in excess of one
year relates to the Pony prospect in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. The Corporation has signed a non-binding agreement with the owners of the adjacent Knotty Head prospect on Green Canyon Block 512 that outlines a proposal to jointly develop the
field. Negotiation of a joint operating agreement, including working interest percentages for the partners, and planning for the field development are progressing. The project is now targeted for sanction in 2013. Approximately 30% relates to Block
WA-390-P, offshore Western Australia, where further drilling and other appraisal and commercial activities are ongoing. Approximately 18% relates to Area 54, offshore Libya, where force majeure was declared in 2011 following the civil unrest in
Libya, see Note 3, Libyan Operations in the notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The Corporation expects the force majeure to be lifted in 2012 and commercial negotiations with the Libyan government to resume. The remainder of the
capitalized well costs in excess of one year relates to projects where

8.Asset Impairments

During 2011, the Corporation recorded impairment charges of $358 million ($140 million after income taxes)
related to increases in the Corporation’s estimated abandonment liabilities primarily for non-producing properties which resulted in the book value of the properties exceeding their fair value. See also Note 9, Asset Retirement Obligations in
the notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The Corporation’s estimated fair values for these properties were determined using a valuation approach based on market related data which is a Level 3 fair value measurement.

During 2010, the Corporation recorded a charge of $532 million ($334 million after income taxes) to fully impair the carrying value
of its 55% interest in the West Mediterranean Block 1 concession (West Med Block), located offshore Egypt. This interest was acquired in 2006 and included four natural gas discoveries and additional exploration prospects. The Corporation and its
partners subsequently explored and further evaluated the area, made a fifth discovery, conducted development planning, and held negotiations with the Egyptian authorities to amend the existing gas sales agreement. In September 2010, the Corporation
and its partners notified the Egyptian authorities of their decision to cease exploration activities on the block and to relinquish a significant portion of the block. As a result, the Corporation fully impaired the carrying value of its interest in
the West Med Block. The Corporation’s estimated fair value of the West Med Block was determined using a valuation approach based on market related data (Level 3 fair value measurement).

During 2009, the Corporation recorded total asset impairment charges of $54 million ($26 million after income taxes) to reduce the
carrying value of two short-lived fields in the United Kingdom North Sea.



9.Asset Retirement Obligations

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued)



In 2011, the revisions of estimated liabilities reflect an increase in well abandonment
obligations resulting from enhanced cement seal verification procedures, changes in scope and timing due to updated work programs and higher service and equipment costs. In 2010, liabilities incurred mostly related to the acquisition of additional
interests in the Valhall and Hod fields. Liabilities settled or disposed of primarily relate to assets held for sale and dispositions.



10.Long-term Debt

Long-term debt at December 31 consists of the following:

In April 2011, the Corporation entered into a new $4 billion syndicated revolving credit facility that matures in April 2016. This
facility, which replaced a $3 billion facility that was scheduled to mature in May 2012, can be used for borrowings and letters of credit. Borrowings on the facility bear interest at 1.25% above the London Interbank Offered Rate. A facility fee of
0.25% per annum is also payable on the amount of the facility. The interest rate and facility fee are subject to adjustment if the Corporation’s credit rating changes. The covenants that establish restrictions on the amount of total
borrowings and secured debt are consistent with the previous facility.

The Corporation has a 364-day asset-backed credit
facility securitized by certain accounts receivable from its Marketing and Refining operations. Under the terms of this financing arrangement, the Corporation has the ability to borrow or issue letters of credit of up to $1 billion, subject to the
availability of sufficient levels of eligible receivables. At December 31, 2011, outstanding borrowings under this facility of $350 million were collateralized by a total of $947 million of accounts receivable, which are held by a wholly-owned
subsidiary. These receivables are only available to pay the general obligations of the Corporation after satisfaction of the outstanding obligations under the asset-backed facility. At December 31, 2011, the Corporation classified $350 million
of borrowings under the asset-backed credit facility and $100 million of borrowings under a short-term credit facility as long-term debt, based on the available capacity under the $4 billion syndicated revolving credit facility.

The Corporation uses the Black-Scholes model to estimate the fair value of employee
stock options. The following weighted average assumptions were utilized for stock options awarded:





201120102009Risk free interest rate1.81%2.14%1.80%Stock price volatility.395.390.390Dividend yield.49%.67%.70%Expected life in years4.54.54.5Weighted average fair value per option granted$27.98$20.18$18.47





The risk free interest rate is based on the expected life of the options and is obtained from published sources. The stock price
volatility is determined from historical stock prices using the same period as the expected life of the options. The expected stock option life is based on historical exercise patterns.

In May 2008, shareholders approved the 2008 Long-term Incentive Plan and in May 2010, approved an amendment to the 2008 Long-term
Incentive Plan. The Corporation also has stock options outstanding under a former plan. At December 31, 2011, the number of common shares reserved for issuance under the 2008 Long-term Incentive Plan, as amended, is as follows (in thousands):

12.Foreign Currency

Foreign currency gains (losses) before income taxes recorded in the Statement of Consolidated Income amounted to $(29)
million in 2011, $(5) million in 2010 and $20 million in 2009. Foreign currency translation adjustments recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) were a reduction to stockholders’ equity of $84 million at December 31,
2011 and an increase to stockholders’ equity of $12 million at December 31, 2010.



13.Retirement Plans

The Corporation has funded noncontributory defined benefit pension plans for a significant portion of its employees. In
addition, the Corporation has an unfunded supplemental pension plan covering certain employees, which provides incremental payments that would have been payable from the Corporation’s principal pension plans, were it not for limitations imposed
by income tax regulations. The plans provide defined benefits based on years of service and final average salary. Additionally, the Corporation maintains an unfunded postretirement medical plan that provides health benefits to certain qualified
retirees from ages 55 through 65. The measurement date for all retirement plans is December 31.

The accumulated benefit obligation for the funded defined benefit pension plans increased to $1,703 million at
December 31, 2011 from $1,355 million at December31, 2010 primarily due to a reduction in the discount rate. The accumulated benefit obligation for the unfunded defined benefit pension plan was $202 million at
December 31, 2011 and $176 million at December 31, 2010.

The Corporation’s 2012 pension and postretirement medical expense is estimated to be approximately $145 million, of which
approximately $85 million relates to the amortization of unrecognized net actuarial losses.

The weighted average

The assumptions used to determine net periodic benefit cost for each year were established at the end of each previous year while the
assumptions used to determine benefit obligations were established at each year-end. The net periodic benefit cost and the actuarial present value of benefit obligations are based on actuarial assumptions that are reviewed on an annual basis. The
discount rate is developed based on a portfolio of high-quality, fixed income debt instruments with maturities that approximate the expected payment of plan obligations. The overall expected return on plan assets is developed from the expected
future returns for each asset category, weighted by the target allocation of pension assets to that asset category.

The
Corporation’s investment strategy is to maximize long-term returns at an acceptable level of risk through broad diversification of plan assets in a variety of asset classes. Asset classes and target allocations are

determined by the Corporation’s investment committee and include domestic and foreign equities, fixed income, and other investments, including hedge funds, real estate and private equity.
Investment managers are prohibited from investing in securities issued by the Corporation unless indirectly held as part of an index strategy. The majority of plan assets are highly liquid, providing ample liquidity for benefit payment requirements.
The current target allocations for plan assets are 50% equity securities, 25% fixed income securities (including cash and short-term investment funds) and 25% to all other types of investments. Asset allocations are rebalanced on a periodic basis
throughout the year to bring assets to within an acceptable range of target levels.

The following tables provide the fair

*The increase in the valuation allowances from 2010 to 2011 is principally attributable to operating loss and tax credit carry forwards and other deductible temporary
differences originating in the current year.

At December 31, 2011, the Corporation has recognized a gross deferred tax asset related to net operating loss
carryforwards of $1,204 million before application of the valuation allowances. The deferred tax asset is comprised of approximately $920 million attributable to foreign net operating losses, which begin to expire in 2020, $90 million attributable
to United States federal operating losses which begin to expire in 2020 and $194 million attributable to losses in various states which begin to expire in 2012. At December 31, 2011, the Corporation has federal, state and foreign alternative
minimum tax credit carryforwards of approximately $140 million, which can be carried forward indefinitely and approximately $1 million of other business credit carryforwards. Foreign tax credit carryforwards, which begin to expire in 2016,
total $255 million. Included within Property, plant and equipment and investments in the foregoing table are taxes deferred, resulting from intercompany transactions eliminated in consolidation related to transfers of property, plant and
equipment remaining within the consolidated group.

In the Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, deferred tax assets

*The decrease in the effective income tax rate in 2011 compared with 2010 attributable to the effect of foreign operations relates to a change in the proportion of
income earned among foreign jurisdictions, with the suspension of Libyan operations providing the highest impact.

Below is a reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits:

At December 31, 2011, the unrecognized tax benefits include $331 million, which if recognized, would affect the Corporation’s
effective income tax rate. Over the next 12 months, it is reasonably possible that the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits could decrease by $30 to $40 million due to settlements with taxing authorities and lapsing of statutes of limitation.
The Corporation had accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits of approximately $42 million as of December 31, 2011 and approximately $16million as of December 31, 2010.

The Corporation has not recognized deferred income taxes for that portion of undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries expected to be
indefinitely reinvested in foreign operations. The Corporation had undistributed earnings from foreign subsidiaries expected to be indefinitely reinvested in foreign operations of approximately $5.2 billion at December 31, 2011. If these
earnings were not indefinitely reinvested, a deferred tax liability of approximately $1.8 billion would be recognized, not accounting for the potential utilization of foreign tax credits in the United States.

The Corporation and its subsidiaries file income tax returns in the United States and various foreign jurisdictions. The Corporation is no
longer subject to examinations by income tax authorities in most jurisdictions for years prior to 2005.

Income taxes paid (net
of refunds) in 2011, 2010 and 2009 amounted to $1,384 million, $1,450 million and $1,177 million, respectively.

17.Risk Management and Trading Activities

In the normal course of its business, the Corporation is exposed to commodity risks related to changes in the prices of
crude oil, natural gas, refined petroleum products and electricity, as well as to changes in interest rates and foreign currency values. In the disclosures that follow, risk management activities are referred to as energy marketing and corporate
risk management activities. The Corporation also has trading operations, principally through a 50% voting interest in a consolidated partnership, that trades energy-related commodities, securities and derivatives. These activities are also exposed
to commodity price risks primarily related to the prices of crude oil, natural gas, refined petroleum products and electricity.

The Corporation maintains a control environment under the direction of its chief risk officer and through its corporate risk policy, which
the Corporation’s senior management has approved. Controls include volumetric, term and value at risk limits. The chief risk officer must approve the use of new instruments or commodities. Risk limits are monitored and are reported on a daily
basis to business units and senior management. The Corporation’s risk management department also performs independent verifications of sources of fair values and validations of valuation models. These controls apply to all of the
Corporation’s risk management and trading activities, including the consolidated trading partnership. The Corporation’s treasury department is responsible for administering and monitoring foreign exchange and interest rate hedging
programs.

Following is a description of the Corporation’s activities that use derivatives as part of their operations and
strategies. Derivatives include both financial instruments and forward purchase and sale contracts. Gross notional amounts of both long and short positions are presented in the volume tables below. These amounts include long and short positions that
offset in closed positions and have not reached contractual maturity. Gross notional amounts do not quantify risk or represent assets or liabilities of the Corporation, but are used in the calculation of cash settlements under the contracts.

Energy Marketing Activities:In its energy marketing activities, the Corporation sells
refined petroleum products, natural gas and electricity principally to commercial and industrial businesses at fixed and floating prices for varying periods of time. Commodity contracts such as futures, forwards, swaps and options, together with
physical assets such as storage and pipeline capacity, are used to obtain supply and reduce margin volatility or lower costs related to sales contracts with customers.

The table below shows the gross volume of the Corporation’s energy marketing commodity contracts outstanding:





At December 31,20112010Crude oil and refined petroleum products (millions of barrels)2830Natural gas (millions of mcf)2,6162,210Electricity (millions of megawatt hours)244301





The changes in fair value of certain energy marketing commodity contracts that are not designated as hedges are recognized currently in
earnings. Revenues from the sales contracts are recognized in Sales and other







HESS CORPORATION AND CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued)



operating revenues in the Statement of Consolidated Income, while supply contract purchases and net settlements from financial derivatives related to these energy marketing activities are
recognized in Cost of products sold in the Statement of Consolidated Income. Net realized and unrealized pre-tax gains on derivative contracts not designated as hedges amounted to $65 million in 2011, $247 million in 2010 and $102 million in 2009.

At December 31, 2011, a portion of energy marketing commodity contracts are designated as cash flow hedges to hedge
variability of expected future cash flows of forecasted supply transactions. The length of time over which the Corporation hedges exposure to variability in future cash flows is predominantly one year or less. For contracts outstanding at
December 31, 2011, the maximum duration was approximately two years. The Corporation records the effective portion of changes in the fair value of cash flow hedges as a component of Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in the
Consolidated Balance Sheet. Amounts recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) are reclassified into Cost of products sold in the Statement of Consolidated Income in the same period that the hedged item is recognized in earnings. The
ineffective portion of changes in fair value of cash flow hedges is recognized immediately in Cost of products sold.

The
after-tax deferred losses relating to energy marketing activities recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) were $64 million and $147 million at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The Corporation estimates that a loss of
approximately $44 million will be reclassified into earnings over the next twelve months. During 2011, 2010 and 2009, the Corporation reclassified after-tax losses from Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) of $105 million, $318 million and
$596 million ($172 million, $527 million and $955 million of pre-tax losses), respectively. The amounts of ineffectiveness were a loss of $4 million in 2011, a gain of $2 million in 2010 and a loss of $2million in 2009. The pre-tax
amount of deferred hedge losses is reflected in Accounts payable and the related income tax benefits are recorded as deferred income tax assets, which are included in Other current assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.

Corporate Risk Management:Corporate risk management activities include transactions designed to
reduce risk in the selling prices of crude oil, refined petroleum products or natural gas produced by the Corporation or to reduce exposure to foreign currency or interest rate movements. Generally, futures, swaps or option strategies may be used to
fix the forward selling price of a portion of the Corporation’s crude oil, refined petroleum products or natural gas production. Forward contracts may also be used to purchase certain currencies in which the Corporation does business with the
intent of reducing exposure to foreign currency fluctuations. These forward contracts comprise various currencies including the British Pound and Thai Baht. Interest rate swaps may be used to convert interest payments on certain long-term debt from
fixed to floating rates.

The table below shows the gross volume of Corporate risk management derivative contracts outstanding:





At December 31,20112010Commodity, primarily crude oil (millions of barrels)5135Foreign exchange (millions of U.S. Dollars)$900$1,025Interest rate swaps (millions of U.S. Dollars)$895$310





During 2008, the Corporation closed Brent crude oil cash flow hedges covering 24,000 barrels per day through 2012, by entering into
offsetting contracts with the same counterparty. As a result, the valuation of those contracts is no longer subject to change due to price fluctuations. The deferred hedge losses as of the date that the hedges were closed are being recorded in
earnings as the hedged transactions occur. Hedging activities primarily related to closed Brent crude oil positions decreased Exploration and Production Sales and other operating revenues by $517 million in 2011 and $533 million in both 2010 and
2009 ($327 million, $338 million and $337 million after-taxes, respectively).

During the fourth quarter of 2011, the
Corporation entered into Brent crude oil hedges using fixed-price swap contracts to hedge the variability of expected future cash flows from 90,000 barrels per day of forecasted

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued)



crude oil sales volumes for the full year of 2012. In January 2012, the Corporation entered into additional Brent crude oil hedges of 30,000 barrels per day for the full year of 2012. The average
price for these hedges is $107.70 per barrel. The Corporation records the effective portion of changes in the fair value of cash flow hedges as a component of Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). Amounts recorded in Accumulated other
comprehensive income (loss) are reclassified into Sales and other operating revenues in the Statement of Consolidated Income in the same period that the hedged item is recognized in earnings. The ineffective portion of changes in the fair value of
cash flow hedges is recognized immediately in Sales and other operating revenues.

The after-tax deferred losses in Accumulated
other comprehensive income (loss) related to Brent crude oil hedges were $286 million and $638 million at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The entire amount of net after-tax deferred losses of $286 million as of December 31,
2011 will be reclassified into earnings during 2012. In 2011, the amount of ineffectiveness from Brent crude oil hedges was a gain of $9 million.

As a result of changes in the fair value of cash flow hedge positions used in the Corporation’s Energy Marketing and Corporate Risk Management Activities, pre-tax deferred losses in Accumulated other
comprehensive income (loss) decreased by $5 million in 2011, increased by $324 million in 2010 and $1,148 million in 2009 ($2 million, $198 million and $729 million after-tax, respectively).

At December 31, 2011 and 2010, the Corporation had interest rate swaps with gross notional amounts of $895 million and $310 million,
respectively, which were designated as fair value hedges. Changes in the fair value of interest rate swaps and the hedged fixed-rate debt are recorded in Interest expense in the Statement of Consolidated Income. For the years ended December 31,
2011 and 2010, the Corporation recorded increases of $45million and $8 million (excluding accrued interest), respectively, in the fair value of interest rate swaps and a corresponding adjustment in the carrying value of the hedged
fixed-rate debt.

Foreign exchange contracts are not designated as hedges. Gains or losses on foreign exchange contracts are
recognized immediately in Other, net in Revenues and non-operating income in the Statement of Consolidated Income.

Net
realized and unrealized pre-tax gains (losses) on derivative contracts used for Corporate risk management and not designated as hedges amounted to the following:

Trading Activities:Trading activities are conducted principally through a trading partnership in
which the Corporation has a 50% voting interest. This consolidated entity intends to generate earnings through various strategies primarily using energy-related commodities, securities and derivatives. The Corporation also takes trading positions
for its own account. The information that follows represents 100% of the trading partnership and the Corporation’s proprietary trading accounts.

Fair Value Measurements:The Corporation determines fair value in accordance with the fair value
measurements accounting standard (ASC 820 – Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures), which established a hierarchy that categorizes the sources of inputs, which generally range from quoted prices for identical instruments in a principal
trading market (Level 1) to estimates determined using related market data (Level 3).

When Level 1 inputs are available within
a particular market, those inputs are selected for determination of fair value over Level 2 or 3 inputs in the same market. To value derivatives that are characterized as Level 2 and 3, the Corporation uses observable inputs for similar instruments
that are available from exchanges, pricing services or broker quotes. These observable inputs may be supplemented with other methods, including internal extrapolation, that result in the most representative prices for instruments with similar
characteristics. Multiple inputs may be used to measure fair value, however, the level of fair value for each physical derivative and financial asset or liability presented below is based on the lowest significant input level within this fair value
hierarchy.

In addition to the financial assets and liabilities disclosed in the tables above, the Corporation had other short-term financial
instruments, primarily cash equivalents and accounts receivable and payable, for which the carrying value approximated their fair value at December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010. Outstanding long-term debt had a carrying value of
$6,040 million, compared with a fair value of $7,317 million at December 31, 2011, and a carrying value of $5,569 million, compared with a fair value of $6,353 million at December 31, 2010.

*Includes trading derivatives and derivatives used for risk management.

The Corporation generally enters into master netting arrangements to mitigate counterparty credit risk. Master netting
arrangements are standardized contracts that govern all specified transactions with the same counterparty and allow the Corporation to terminate all contracts upon occurrence of certain events, such as a counterparty’s default or bankruptcy.
Where these arrangements provide the right of offset and the Corporation’s intent and practice is to offset amounts in the case of contract terminations, the Corporation records fair value on a net basis.

Credit Risk:The Corporation is exposed to credit risks that may at times be concentrated with
certain counterparties, groups of counterparties or customers. Accounts receivable are generated from a diverse domestic and international customer base. The Corporation’s net receivables at December 31, 2011 are concentrated with the







HESS CORPORATION AND CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued)



following counterparty and customer industry segments: Integrated Oil Companies —29%, Government Entities — 10%, Services —9%, Trading Companies —8%, Real Estate —8% and
Manufacturing —7%. The Corporation reduces its risk related to certain counterparties by using master netting arrangements and requiring collateral, generally cash or letters of credit. The Corporation records the cash collateral received or
posted as an offset to the fair value of derivatives executed with the same counterparty. At December 31, 2011 and 2010, the Corporation held cash from counterparties of $121 million and $213 million, respectively. The Corporation posted cash
to counterparties at December 31, 2011 and 2010 of $117 million and $34 million, respectively.

At December 31, 2011,
the Corporation had outstanding letters of credit totaling $1,698 million, primarily issued to satisfy margin requirements. Certain of the Corporation’s agreements also contain contingent collateral provisions that could require the Corporation
to post additional collateral if the Corporation’s credit rating declines. As of December 31, 2011, the net liability related to derivatives with contingent collateral provisions was approximately $962 million before cash collateral posted
of $3 million. At December 31, 2011, all three major credit rating agencies that rate the Corporation’s debt had assigned an investment grade rating. If two of the three agencies were to downgrade the Corporation’s rating to below
investment grade, as of December 31, 2011, the Corporation would be required to post additional collateral of approximately $189 million.



18.Guarantees and Contingencies

The Corporation has $67 million in letters of credit for which it is contingently liable. The Corporation also has a
contingent purchase obligation to acquire the remaining interest in WilcoHess, a retail gasoline station joint venture. This contingent obligation, which expires in April 2014, was approximately $205 million at December 31, 2011.

The Corporation is subject to loss contingencies with respect to various lawsuits, claims and other proceedings, including
environmental matters. A liability is recognized in the Corporation’s consolidated financial statements when it is probable a loss has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. If the risk of loss is probable, but the amount
cannot be reasonably estimated or the risk of loss is only reasonably possible, a liability is not accrued; however, the Corporation discloses the nature of those contingencies.

The Corporation, along with many other companies engaged in refining and marketing of gasoline, has been a party to lawsuits and claims
related to the use of methyl tertiary butyl ether (MTBE) in gasoline. A series of similar lawsuits, many involving water utilities or governmental entities, were filed in jurisdictions across the United States against producers of MTBE and petroleum
refiners who produced gasoline containing MTBE, including the Corporation. The principal allegation in all cases was that gasoline containing MTBE is a defective product and that these parties are strictly liable in proportion to their share of the
gasoline market for damage to groundwater resources and are required to take remedial action to ameliorate the alleged effects on the environment of releases of MTBE. In 2008, the majority of the cases against the Corporation were settled. In 2010
and 2011, additional cases were settled including an action brought in state court by the State of New Hampshire. Two cases brought by the State of New Jersey and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico remain unresolved. In 2007, a pre-tax charge of $40
million was recorded to cover all of the known MTBE cases against the Corporation.

Over the last several years, many
refineries have entered into consent agreements to resolve the United States Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) assertions that refining facilities were modified or expanded without complying with the New Source Review regulations that
require permits and new emission controls in certain circumstances and other regulations that impose emissions control requirements. In January 2011, HOVENSA signed a consent decree with the EPA to resolve its claims. Under the terms of the Consent
Decree, HOVENSA agreed to pay a penalty of approximately $5 million and spend approximately $700 million over the next 10 years to install equipment and implement additional operating procedures at the HOVENSA refinery to reduce emissions. In
addition, the Consent Decree requires HOVENSA to spend approximately $5 million to fund an environmental project to be determined at a later date by the Virgin Islands and $500,000 to assist the Virgin Islands Water and Power Authority with
monitoring. However, as a result of HOVENSA’s decision to







HESS CORPORATION AND CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued)



shut down its refinery, which was announced in January 2012, HOVENSA believes that it will not be required to make material capital expenditures pursuant to this consent decree. The Corporation
believes that it will also enter into a consent decree with the EPA in the near future to resolve these matters as they relate to its Port Reading refinery facility, which is not expected to have a material adverse impact on the financial condition,
results of operations or cash flows of the Corporation. In addition, many states and localities are adopting requirements that mandate a low sulfur content of fuel oils and restrict the types of fuel sold within their jurisdictions. These proposals
could require capital expenditures by the Corporation for its Port Reading refining facility to meet the required sulfur content standards or other changes in the marketing of fuel oils and affect the profitability of that facility.

The United States Deep Water Royalty Relief Act of 1995 (the Act) implemented a royalty relief program that relieves eligible leases
issued between November 28, 1995 and November 28, 2000 from paying royalties on deepwater production in Federal Outer Continental Shelf lands. The Act does not impose any price thresholds in order to qualify for the royalty relief. The
U.S. Minerals Management Service (MMS, predecessor to the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Regulation and Enforcement) created regulations that included pricing requirements to qualify for the royalty relief provided in the Act. During the
period from 2003 to 2009, the Corporation accrued the royalties imposed by the MMS regulations. The legality of the thresholds imposed by the MMS was challenged in the federal courts and, in October 2009, the U.S. Supreme Court decided not to
review the appellate court’s decision against the MMS. As a result, the Corporation recognized a pre-tax gain of $143 million ($89 million after income taxes) in 2009 to reverse all previously recorded royalties. The pre-tax gain is reported in
Other, net in the Statement of Consolidated Income.

The Corporation is from time to time involved in other judicial and
administrative proceedings, including proceedings relating to other environmental matters. The Corporation cannot predict with certainty if, how or when such proceedings will be resolved or what the eventual relief, if any, may be, particularly for
proceedings that are in their early stages of development or where plaintiffs seek indeterminate damages. Numerous issues may need to be resolved, including through potentially lengthy discovery and determination of important factual matters before
a loss or range of loss can be reasonably estimated for any proceeding. Subject to the foregoing, in management’s opinion, based upon currently known facts and circumstances, the outcome of such proceedings is not expected to have a material
adverse effect on the financial condition, results of operations or cash flows of the Corporation.



19.Segment Information

The Corporation has two operating segments that comprise the structure used by senior management to make key operating
decisions and assess performance. These are (1) Exploration and Production and (2) Marketing and Refining. The Exploration and Production segment explores for, develops, produces, purchases, transports and sells crude oil and natural gas.
The Marketing and Refining segment manufactures refined petroleum products and purchases, markets and trades refined petroleum products, natural gas and electricity.

Oil and Gas Reserves

Risk Factors Related to Our Business and Operations

Internal Controls

The Corporation maintains internal controls over
its oil and gas reserve estimation process which are administered by the Corporation’s Senior Vice President of E&P Technology and its Chief Financial Officer. Estimates of reserves are prepared by technical staff that work directly with
the oil and gas properties using standard reserve estimation guidelines, definitions and methodologies. Each year, reserve estimates for a selection of the Corporation’s assets are subject to internal technical audits and reviews. In addition,
an independent third party reserve engineer reviews and audits a significant portion of the Corporation’s reported reserves (see below). Reserve estimates are reviewed by senior management and the Board of Directors.

Qualifications

The person primarily responsible for overseeing the preparation of the Corporation’s oil and gas reserves is Mr.Scott Heck, Senior Vice President of E&P Technology. Mr. Heck is
a member of the Society of Petroleum Engineers and has over 30 years of experience in the oil and gas industry with a BS degree in Petroleum Engineering. His experience includes over 15 years primarily focused on oil and gas subsurface understanding
and reserves estimation in both domestic and international areas. The Corporation’s upstream technology organization, which Mr. Heck manages, focuses on oil and gas industry subsurface and reservoir engineering technologies and evaluation
techniques. Mr. Heck is also responsible for the Corporation’s Global Reserves group, which is the internal organization responsible for establishing the policies and processes used within the operating units to estimate reserves and
perform internal technical reserve audits and reviews.

Reserves Audit

The Corporation engaged the consulting firm of DeGolyer and MacNaughton (D&M) to perform an audit of the internally prepared reserve
estimates on certain fields aggregating 81% of 2011 year-end reported reserve quantities on a barrel of oil equivalent basis (76% in 2010). The purpose of this audit was to provide additional assurance on the reasonableness of internally prepared
reserve estimates and compliance with SEC regulations. The D&M letter report, dated January 31, 2012, on the Corporation’s estimated oil and gas reserves was prepared using standard geological and engineering methods generally
recognized in the petroleum industry. D&M is an independent petroleum engineering consulting firm that has been providing petroleum consulting services throughout the world for over 70 years. D&M’s letter report on the
Corporation’s December 31, 2011 oil and gas reserves is included as an exhibit to this Form 10-K. While the D&M report should be read in its entirety, the report concludes that for the properties reviewed by D&M, the total net
proved reserve estimates prepared by Hess and audited by D&M, in the aggregate, differed by approximately 3% of total audited net proved reserves on a barrel of oil equivalent basis. The report also includes among other information, the
qualifications of the technical person primarily responsible for overseeing the reserve audit.

Proved undeveloped reserves

The December 31, 2011 oil and gas reserve estimates disclosed above include 548 million barrels of liquid hydrocarbons and 1,211 million mcf of natural gas, or an aggregate of
750 million barrels of oil equivalent (mmboe), classified as proved undeveloped reserves. Overall volumes of proved undeveloped reserves increased by 59 mmboe compared with year-end 2010. Additions and revisions in proved undeveloped reserves
from existing fields amounted to 146 mmboe, primarily in the United States, Norway and the United Kingdom. These increases resulted from ongoing technical assessments, performance evaluations and development activities. In 2011, 85 mmboe were
converted from proved undeveloped reserves to proved developed reserves resulting from continuing development activity and new wells mainly in Indonesia, Norway, Russia, the United Kingdom and North Dakota in the United States. The Corporation
estimates that capital expenditures of $1,080 million were incurred to convert proved undeveloped reserves to proved developed reserves during 2011. Acquisitions and dispositions of assets in 2011 further reduced proved undeveloped reserves by a net
2 mmboe.

The Corporation is involved in multiple long-term projects that have staged developments. Certain of these projects
have proved reserves, which have been classified as undeveloped for a period in excess of five years, totaling 85 mmboe or 5% of total 2011 proved reserves. Substantially all of the proved undeveloped reserves in excess of five years relate to four
offshore producing assets. Three natural gas projects in the Joint Development Area of Malaysia/Thailand (JDA) and Indonesia are being developed in phases to satisfy long-term natural gas sales contracts and an oil project in Azerbaijan is
continuing to be developed in phases. A summary of the development status of each of the four projects follows:



•JDA — This natural gas project in the Gulf of Thailand currently has a central processing platform and seven wellhead platforms. Three additional
wellhead platforms are currently under construction and the eleventh is in the process of being sanctioned. In addition, a major investment in compression equipment is in the field development plan.



•Pangkah — This natural gas and oil project offshore Java, Indonesia currently has two producing offshore wellhead platforms and onshore production
facilities. In addition, a central processing platform and accommodation utility platform has been installed and utilized from mid-2011. Further development drilling is on-going.



•Natuna A — This natural gas project offshore Sumatra, Indonesia currently has two wellhead platforms, two central processing facilities and a
floating storage and offloading vessel. Additional wellhead platforms and subsea well tie-backs are planned to satisfy gas sales contracts.







•Azeri-Chirag-Guneshli (ACG) — This oil project offshore Azerbaijan in the Caspian Sea has seven operational platforms that have been completed
over multiple phases of development. The operator began construction on another production platform in 2010.

At December 31, 2011, the Corporation had approximately 5 mmboe of proved undeveloped reserves in excess of five years relating to
the Snohvit Field, offshore Norway. In January 2012, the Corporation completed the sale of its interest in this field.

Production sharing contracts

The Corporation’s proved reserves include crude oil and natural gas reserves relating to long-term agreements with governments or authorities in which the Corporation has the legal right to produce
or has a revenue interest in the production. Proved reserves from these production sharing contracts for each of the three years ended December 31, 2011 are presented separately below, as well as volumes produced and received during 2011, 2010
and 2009 from these production sharing contracts.

Standardized Measure of Discounted Future Net Cash Flows Relating to Proved Oil and Gas Reserves

Future net cash flows are calculated by applying prescribed oil and gas selling prices used in determining year-end reserve estimates
(adjusted for price changes provided by contractual arrangements) to estimated future production of proved oil and gas reserves, less estimated future development and production costs, which are based on year-end costs and existing economic
assumptions. Future income tax expenses are computed by applying the appropriate year-end statutory tax rates to the pre-tax net cash flows relating to the Corporation’s proved oil and gas reserves. Future net cash flows are discounted at the
prescribed rate of 10%. The discounted future net cash flow estimates do not include exploration expenses, interest expense or corporate general and administrative expenses. The selling prices of crude oil and natural gas are highly volatile. The
prices which are required to be used for the discounted future net cash flows do not include the effects of hedges and may not be representative of future selling prices. The future net cash flow estimates could be materially different if other
assumptions were used.

Report of Independent Auditors

The Members

HOVENSA
L.L.C.

We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of HOVENSA L.L.C. (“the Company”) as of December 31,
2011 and 2010, and the related statements of operations, comprehensive loss and (accumulated deficit) retained earnings, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2011. These financial statements are the
responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. We were not engaged to perform an audit of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Our audits included consideration of internal control over financial
reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we
express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of HOVENSA
L.L.C. at December 31, 2011 and 2010, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2011 in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

As discussed in Note 1 to the financial statements, the Company’s decision to shut down refining operations and operate as an oil
storage terminal raises substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. The Company’s plans as to these matters are described in Note 1. The 2011 financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the
outcome of this uncertainty.

HOVENSA L.L.C.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(Dollars in Thousands)

1.     Basis of Financial Statements and Significant Accounting Policies

Nature of Business

Background:HOVENSA L.L.C. (the “Company” or “HOVENSA”) was formed as a 50/50 joint venture between subsidiaries of Petroleos de
Venezuela, SA. (“PDVSA”) and Hess Corporation (“Hess”), to own and operate the Company’s refinery located in St. Croix, United States (U.S.) Virgin Islands. The Company’s members are PDVSA V.I., Inc., a subsidiary of
PDVSA, and Hess Oil Virgin Islands Corp. (“HOVIC”), a subsidiary of Hess. The Company purchases crude oil from PDVSA, Hess and third parties. It manufactures and sells petroleum products primarily to PDVSA and Hess.

HOVENSA operates under a Concession Agreement with the Government of the U.S. Virgin Islands. The original Concession Agreement was
entered into on September 1, 1965 and the Third Amendment to the Concession Agreement is due to expire on August 1, 2022. The Concession Agreement can be extended with Virgin Islands government approval which has occurred on two previous
occasions.

Recent Events – Shutdown of Refinery:In December 2011, the
Company’s members reached agreement to commence the shutdown of refining operations effective January 18, 2012, and operate as an oil storage terminal. As a result of this decision, the Company recorded non-cash charges totaling $2,072,600
in December 2011 to fully impair its property, plant and equipment and recognize certain other expenses related to the shutdown decision. In conjunction with the refinery shutdown, the Company plans to liquidate its refined product inventory, redeem
its outstanding debt, and settle or dispose of certain other liabilities.

Basis of Presentation and Going Concern

The accompanying financial statements of HOVENSA have been prepared in conformity with United States generally accepted accounting
principles (“U.S. GAAP”). These financial statements have been prepared assuming HOVENSA will continue as a going concern. As further explained in Notes 2 and 3 below, the Company has fully impaired its property, plant and equipment and
recorded certain refinery shutdown costs at December 31, 2011. Additional financial support from the members will be required to fund expenditures for the refinery shutdown and conversion to an oil storage terminal in 2012. There is no
assurance that any or all of the member financial support will be provided by the members. Absent member support it is unlikely HOVENSA’s operations would be able to continue.

Use of Estimates

In preparing financial statements in conformity with U.S.
GAAP, management makes estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities in the balance sheet and revenues and expenses in the statement of operations. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Among the
estimates made by management are asset impairments, refinery shutdown costs, inventory and other asset valuations, legal and environmental obligations and pension liabilities.

Revenue Recognition

The Company recognizes revenues from the sale of
petroleum products when title passes to the customer, which generally occurs when products are shipped or delivered in accordance with the terms of the respective sales agreements.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

Cash equivalents consist of highly liquid
investments, which are readily convertible into cash and have maturities of three months or less when acquired.







HOVENSA L.L.C.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued)

(Dollars in Thousands)



Debt Service Fund

The debt service fund is cash held by a trustee representing six months of interest and fees payable on the Company’s outstanding tax-exempt revenue bonds.

Inventories

Inventories
of crude oil and refined products are valued at the lower of last-in, first-out (“LIFO”) cost or market. Inventories of materials and supplies are valued at the lower of average cost or market.

Depreciation

Depreciation of refinery facilities is determined principally on the units-of-production method based on estimated production volumes.
Depreciation of all other equipment is determined on the straight-line method based on estimated useful lives.

Maintenance and Repairs

Maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred including costs of refinery turnarounds. Capital improvements are
recorded as additions to property, plant and equipment.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets

Long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets
may not be recoverable. The impairment recognized is the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the estimated fair market value of the assets.

Asset Retirement Obligations (ARO’s)

ARO’s must be recorded at
fair value in the period in which it is determined that a legal obligation exists and a reasonable estimate of the fair value of the liability can be made.

Environmental Expenditures

Liabilities for future remediation costs are
recorded when environmental assessments or remedial efforts are probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated. Other than for assessments, the timing and magnitude of these accruals generally are based on the completion of investigations or
other studies or a commitment to a formal plan of action. Environmental liabilities are based on best estimates of probable undiscounted future costs using currently available technology and applying current regulations. Such accruals are adjusted
as further information develops or circumstances change. Recoveries of environmental remediation costs from other parties are recorded as assets when their receipt is deemed probable. The Company capitalizes environmental expenditures that increase
the life of property or reduce or prevent environmental contamination.

Income Taxes

The Company is a limited liability company and, as a result, income taxes are the responsibility of the members. Accordingly, no effect of
income tax has been recognized in the accompanying financial statements.

Retirement Plans

The Company recognizes on its balance sheet the underfunded status of its defined benefit retirement plans measured as the difference
between the fair value of plan assets and the benefit obligations. The benefit obligation is the projected benefit obligation in the case of the non-contributory defined benefit pension plan and

the projected post-retirement benefit obligation for the post-retirement medical plan. The Company recognizes the net changes in the plan assets and benefit obligations of its defined benefit
retirement plans in the year in which such changes occur.

Prior service costs and gains and losses in excess of 10% of the
greater of the benefit obligation or the market value of assets are amortized over the average remaining service period of active employees.

The determination of the obligations and expenses related to these plans are based on several actuarial assumptions, the most significant of which relate to the discount rate for measuring the present
value of future plan obligations; expected long-term rates of return on plan assets and rate of future increases in compensation levels. These assumptions represent estimates made by the Company, some of which can be affected by external factors.

Subsequent Events

Subsequent events have been evaluated through February 27, 2012.

2.    Asset Impairment and Refinery Shutdown Related Charges

On January 18, 2012, HOVENSA announced the decision to shut down its refinery operations after recently
experiencing substantial operating losses due to global economic conditions and competitive disadvantages versus other refiners. Such losses were incurred despite efforts to improve operating performance by reducing refining capacity to 350,000 from
500,000 barrels per day in the first half of 2011. Operating losses were also projected to continue. The Company prepared an impairment analysis as of December 31, 2011, which indicated that undiscounted future cash flows would not recover the
carrying value of its assets. As a result, the Company recorded an impairment charge of $1,900,349 representing the difference between the carrying value and the estimated fair market value of property, plant and equipment at December 31, 2011.
Estimated fair value was determined based on discounted future cash flows (a Level 3 fair value measure). In addition, the Company recorded other charges related to the decision to shut down the refinery totaling $172,251, including recognition of
legally required employee and contractor severance costs and a reduction in carrying value of warehouse inventory and other assets.

3.    Future Refinery Shutdown Expenditures

The Company is expected to incur substantial additional refinery shutdown costs in excess of amounts that can be
accrued at December 31, 2011 under US GAAP, including costs related to the cleaning and preservation of refinery process equipment and tanks, tank bottom sludge disposal, enhanced employee and contractor severance and benefits, estimated
losses on long-term contracts and other costs. After liquidation of current assets and liabilities, the Company estimates total future cash funding of approximately $900,000 will be required to settle all obligations, with the substantial majority
to be incurred in 2012.

4.    Related Party Transactions

During 2011, HOVENSA received financial support from its members by delaying the normal timing of payments to PDVSA for
crude oil purchases, as well as accelerating payments from Hess for refined product sales. At December 31, 2011, interest bearing financial support from both members totaling $654,000 is recorded as a current liability in the balance sheet.

Through the shutdown of refining operations, the Company had long-term crude oil supply agreements with Petroleum Marketing
International (“Petromar”) a subsidiary of PDVSA, under which Petromar agreed to sell to HOVENSA a monthly average of 155,000 barrels per day of Mesa crude oil and 115,000 barrels per day of Merey crude oil. The Company also had a product
sales agreement with Hess and Petromar that required Hess

and Petromar each to purchase after any sales of refined products by HOVENSA to third parties, 50% of HOVENSA’s gasoline, distillate, residual fuel and other products at market prices.

A summary of all material transactions between the Company, its members and affiliates follows:

5.    Inventories

Inventories as of December 31 were as follows:



20112010Crude oil$183,345$261,130Refined and other finished products657,914670,684Less LIFO adjustment(734,177)(759,818)107,082171,996Materials and supplies52,51288,496Total$159,594$260,492





During 2011 and 2010, a reduction of inventory quantities resulted in a liquidation of LIFO inventories carried at below market costs,
which decreased net operating losses by approximately $268,397 and $110,432 respectively. During 2012, the Company intends to liquidate its remaining crude oil, refined and other finished products inventory.

6.    Tax Exempt Revenue Bonds and Other Long-term Debt

Outstanding borrowings at December 31 consist of the following:



20112010General Purpose Revolving Credit Facility$—$350,000Tax-exempt revenue bonds (issued in 2002) at 6.50%126,753126,753Tax-exempt revenue bonds (issued in 2003) at 6.125%74,17574,175Tax-exempt revenue bonds (issued in 2004) at 5.875%50,66050,660Tax-exempt revenue bonds (issued in 2007) at 4.70%104,095104,095Total long-term debt$355,683$705,683





On January 23, 2012, the Company commenced a cash tender offer for any and all of the $355,683 outstanding tax-exempt revenue bonds.
The terms of the tender offer include a purchase price at par value, plus

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued)

accrued but unpaid interest up to the purchase date, subject to the terms of the offering document. See Note 10, Subsequent Event, for the results of the tender.

HOVENSA had a 5-year $400,000 revolving credit facility until December 30, 2011, when it repaid outstanding borrowings and terminated
the revolving credit facility. There were $350,000 of outstanding borrowings on this facility at December 31, 2010. The agreement was collateralized by the physical assets and certain material contracts of the Company.

7.    Environmental Matters

In 2011, the Company signed a Consent Decree with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) which among other
things requires the Company to install equipment and implement additional operating procedures to reduce emissions over the next 10 years. The cost of installing this equipment is expected to be approximately $700,000. Since the refining facilities
will be shut down in 2012, with subsequent operation as an oil storage terminal, the Company believes it will not be required to make material expenditures as outlined in the Consent Decree. Under the terms of the Consent Decree, the Company paid a
penalty of $5,375 in 2011.

In the normal course of its business, the Company records liabilities for future environmental
remediation expenditures when such environmental obligations are probable and reasonably estimable.

The Company is required to
provide financial assurance to the EPA in connection with various forms of environmental compliance. The required financial assurance totals approximately $48,000 at December 31, 2011 and must be met by establishing a trust fund, posting a
letter of credit or similar measures. If the Company is unable to fulfill its financial assurance requirements, it anticipates its members will provide the necessary support.

8.    Contingencies

The Company is subject to loss contingencies with respect to various lawsuits, claims and other proceedings, including
environmental matters. A liability is recognized in the Company’s financial statements when it is probable a loss has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. If the risk of loss is probable, but the amount cannot be reasonably
estimated or the risk of loss is only reasonably possible, a liability is not accrued; however, the Company discloses the nature of those contingencies.In management’s opinion, based upon currently known facts and circumstances, the
outcome of such loss contingencies will not have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

9.    Retirement Plans

The Company has a funded non-contributory, defined benefit pension plan for substantially all of its employees. The
plan provides defined benefits based on years of service and final average salary. At December 31, 2011, the actuarial assumptions for the determination of the projected benefit obligation reflect the pending refinery shutdown. The
non-contributory defined benefit pension plan will remain in place and meet future obligations in accordance with terms of the plan, but terminated employees will cease to earn service toward future benefits.

The following table reconciles the projected benefit obligation and fair value of plan assets and shows the funded status of the pension
plan:



20112010Reconciliation of projected benefit obligation:Benefit obligation at January 1$116,572$100,703Service costs9,2438,964Interest costs6,3735,683Actuarial (gain) loss(1,403)3,057Benefit payments(2,218)(1,835)Projected benefit obligation at December 31128,567116,572Reconciliation of fair value of plan assets:Fair value of plan assets at January 172,40050,971Actual return on plan assets1,8097,444Employer contributions12,76015,820Benefit payments(2,218)(1,835)Fair value of plan assets at December 3184,75172,400Funded status (plan assets less benefit obligation)(43,816)(44,172)Unrecognized net actuarial loss36,36736,049Net amount recognized$(7,449)$(8,123)





The accumulated benefit obligation was $124,769 at December 31, 2011 and $93,208 at December 31, 2010.

Components of funded pension expense consist of the following:

The actuarial assumptions used in the Company’s pension plan were as follows:



201120102009Assumptions used to determine benefit obligations at December 31:Discount rate4.40%5.60%6.00%Rate of compensation increase4.204.204.20Assumptions used to determine net costs for years ended December 31:Discount rate5.606.006.00Expected return on plan assets7.007.007.50Rate of compensation increase4.204.204.20





The assumptions used to determine net periodic benefit cost for each year were established at the end of each previous year while the
assumptions used to determine benefit obligations were established at each year-end. The net periodic benefit cost and the actuarial present value of benefit obligations are based on actuarial assumptions that are reviewed on an annual basis. The
discount rate is developed based on a portfolio of high-quality fixed-income investments that matches the maturity of the plan obligations. The overall expected return on plan assets is developed from the expected future returns for each asset
category, weighted by the expected allocation of pension assets to that asset category. The Company engages an independent investment consultant to assist in the development of expected returns.

The Company’s pension plan assets by category are as follows:



20112010Asset categoryEquity securities56%57%Debt securities4443Total100%100%







The target investment allocations for the plan assets are 55% equity securities and 45% debt securities. Asset allocations are rebalanced
on a regular basis throughout the year to bring assets to within a 2-3% range of target levels. Target allocations take into account analyses performed by the Company’s pension consultant to optimize long-term risk/return relationships. All
assets are highly liquid and may be readily adjusted to provide liquidity for current benefit payment requirements.

For
purposes of valuing pension investments, a hierarchy for the inputs is used to measure fair value based on the source of the input, which generally range from quoted prices for identical instruments in a principal trading market (Level 1) to
estimates determined using related market data (Level 3). The following is a description of the valuation methodologies used for the investments measured at fair value, including the general classification of such instruments pursuant to the
valuation hierarchy.







HOVENSA L.L.C.

The following tables provide the fair value hierarchy of the financial assets of the
qualified pension plan as of December 31, 2011 and 2010:



Level 1Level 2Level 3December 31, 2011Cash and Short-term Investment Funds$—$329$—U.S. Equities (Domestic)38,872——International Equities (Non-U.S.)8,338——Debt Securities37,212——Total$84,422$329$—December 31, 2010Cash and Short-term Investment Funds$—$482$—U.S. Equities (Domestic)33,273——International Equities (Non-U.S.)7,413——Debt Securities31,275——Total$71,961$482$—





Cash and short-term investment funds consist of cash on hand, which is invested in a short-term investment fund that provides for daily
investments and redemptions and is valued and carried at a $1 net asset value (NAV) per fund share.

Equities consist of
registered mutual fund investments whose diversified holdings primarily include common stock securities issued by U.S. and non-U.S. corporations, respectively. Mutual fund shares are valued daily, with the NAV per fund share published at the close
of each business day. These investments are classified as Level 1.

Fixed income securities consist of registered mutual fund
investments whose diversified holdings primarily include U.S. Treasury securities, corporate bonds and mortgage backed securities.

HOVENSA has budgeted contributions of approximately $15,000 to its funded Pension Plan in 2012.

Estimated future pension benefit payments, which reflect expected future service, are as follows:



2012$4,04120134,91120145,03320155,11520165,174Years 2017 to 202127,199







The Company also maintains an unfunded post-retirement medical plan that provides health benefits to certain qualified retirees from ages
55 through 65. The projected benefit obligation for this plan was approximately $11,864 as of December 31, 2011 and $19,240 as of December 31, 2010. The decrease in the projected benefit obligation includes a change in actuarial
assumptions to reflect the pending refinery shutdown. This plan will also remain in place and meet future obligations in accordance with terms of the plan, but terminated employees will cease to earn service toward future benefits.

10.    Subsequent Event

On February 21, 2012, HOVENSA purchased $355,453 of its tax-exempt revenue bonds at par following the close of its
previously announced tender offer.
