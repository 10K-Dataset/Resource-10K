ITEM 1. BUSINESS



Overview



Maxim Integrated Products, Inc. ("Maxim Integrated" or the "Company" and also referred to as "we," "our" or "us") designs, develops, manufactures and markets a broad range of linear and mixed-signal integrated circuits, commonly referred to as analog circuits, for a large number of customers in diverse geographical locations. The analog market is fragmented and characterized by diverse applications, numerous product variations and, with respect to many circuit types, relatively long product life cycles. Our objective is to develop and market both proprietary and industry-standard analog integrated circuits that meet the increasingly stringent quality and performance standards demanded by customers.

The Mixed Signal Analog Integrated Circuit Market



All electronic signals generally fall into one of two categories, linear or digital. Linear (or analog) signals represent real world phenomena, such as temperature, pressure, sound, or speed, and are continuously variable over a wide range of values. Digital signals represent the "ones" and "zeros" of binary arithmetic and are either on or off.



Three general classes of semiconductor products arise from this distinction between linear and digital signals:



•digital devices, such as memories and microprocessors that operate primarily in the digital domain;

•linear devices, such as amplifiers, references, analog multiplexers and switches that operate primarily in the analog domain; and

•mixed-signal devices such as data converter devices that combine linear and digital functions on the same integrated circuit and interface between the analog and digital domains.



Our strategy has been to target both the linear and mixed-signal markets, often collectively referred to as the analog market. However, some of our products are exclusively or principally digital. While our focus continues to be on the linear and mixed signal market, our capabilities in the digital domain enable development of new mixed signal and other products with highly sophisticated digital characteristics.



We operate in one reportable segment - the design, development, marketing and manufacturing of a broad range of linear and mixed signal integrated circuits.



Our linear and mixed signal products serve four major end-markets. These major end-markets and their corresponding market are noted in the table below:

Product Quality



Based on industry standard requirements, we conduct reliability stress testing on the products we manufacture and sell. Through this testing, we can detect and accelerate the presence of defects that may arise over the life of a product. We employ a system addressing quality and reliability of our products from initial design through wafer fabrication, assembly, testing and final shipment. We have received ISO 9001/2, TS 16949 and ISO 14001 certifications for all wafer fabrication, assembly, final test and shipping facilities.



Manufacturing



We utilize our own wafer fabrication facilities as well as third party foundries for the production of our wafers. The majority of processed wafers are subject to parametric and functional testing at our facilities. The broad range of products demanded by the analog integrated circuit market requires multiple manufacturing process technologies. As a result, many different process technologies are currently used for wafer fabrication of our products. Historically, wafer fabrication of analog integrated circuits has not required state-of-the-art processing equipment, although newer processes do utilize and require such state-of-the-art facilities and equipment. In addition, hybrid and module products are manufactured using a complex multi-chip technology featuring thin-film, laser-trimmed resistors and other active or passive components. We are expanding our internal and external manufacturing and test capacity to meet our future technology requirements.



During fiscal years2013,2012and2011, a large portion of our own wafer production occurred at one of our three owned wafer fabrication facilities at the following locations:



Facility LocationFiscal Year AcquiredBeaverton, Oregon1994San Jose, California1998San Antonio, Texas2004












In fiscal year 2007, we entered into a supply agreement with Seiko Epson Corporation ("Epson").  In fiscal year 2010, we entered into a supply agreement with Powerchip Technology Corporation ("Powerchip") and Maxchip Electronics Corp. ("Maxchip") to provide 300mm and 200mm wafer capacity, respectively. Under these agreements, partner foundries (Epson, Powerchip and Maxchip) have manufactured some of our mixed-signal semiconductor products. These products are manufactured under rights and licenses using our proprietary technology at Epson's fabrication facility located in Sakata, Japan and at Powerchip and Maxchip's fabrication facilities in Hsinchu, Taiwan. In fiscal years2013,2012and2011, the products manufactured by our partner foundries represented47%,42%and32%, respectively, of our total wafer production.



Once wafer manufacturing has been completed, wafers may be sorted in order to determine which integrated circuits on each wafer are functional and which are defective. We currently perform the majority of wafer sorting, final testing and shipping activities at two facilities located in Cavite, the Philippines and Chonburi Province, Thailand, although we also utilize independent subcontractors for some wafer sorting.



Where required, our wafer bump manufacturing facility located in Dallas, Texas is used to process wafers for products that utilize chip scale packaging ("CSP") or wafer level packaging ("WLP"). CSP or WLP enables integrated circuits to be attached directly to a printed circuit board without the use of a traditional plastic package. In addition, we utilize independent subcontractors to perform wafer bump manufacturing to the extent we do not have the internal capacity or capabilities to perform such services. With the introduction of 300mm wafers into our manufacturing network, we have enabled subcontractors located in Taiwan to perform wafer bumping and testing of these wafers.



Integrated circuit assembly is performed by foreign assembly subcontractors, located in China, Japan, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan, Thailand, Singapore and South Korea, where wafers are separated into individual integrated circuits and assembled into a variety of packages.



After assembly has been completed, the majority of the assembled product is shipped back to our facilities located in Cavite, the Philippines or Chonburi Province, Thailand where the packaged integrated circuits undergo final testing and preparation for customer shipment. In addition, we utilize independent subcontractors to perform final testing.



We currently perform substantially all of our module assembly operations in our facility in Batangas, the Philippines. Our Philippines facility also performs wafer singulation and tape-and-reel of bumped (CSP or WLP) wafers.



Our finished products ship directly from either Cavite, the Philippines or Chonburi Province, Thailand to customers worldwide or to other Company locations for sale to end-customers or distributors.



Customers, Sales and Marketing



We market our products worldwide through a direct-sales and applications organization and through our own and other unaffiliated distribution channels to a broad range of customers in diverse industries. Our products typically require a sophisticated technical sales and marketing effort. Our sales organization is divided into domestic and international regions. Distributors and direct customers generally buy on an individual purchase order basis, rather than pursuant to long-term agreements.



Certain distributors have agreements with us which allow for certain sales price rebates, price protection on certain inventory if we lower the price of our products. Certain distributor agreements also generally permit distributors to exchange a portion of certain purchases on a periodic basis. As is customary in the semiconductor industry, our distributors may also market other products that compete with our products.



Sales to certain international distributors are made under agreements which permit limited stock return privileges but not sales price rebates or price protection. The agreements generally permit distributors to exchange a portion of their purchases on a periodic basis. See "Critical Accounting Policies" in Part II, Item 7 - Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report, which contains information regarding our revenue recognition policy.



We derived approximately31%of our fiscal year2013revenue from sales made through distributors. Our primary distributor is Avnet Electronics which accounted for14%,13%and14%of our revenues in fiscal years2013,2012and2011, respectively. Avnet, like our other distributors, is not an end customer, but rather serves as a channel of sale to many end users of the Company's products. Samsung, our largest single customer, accounted for approximately28%,20%and12%of net revenues in fiscal years2013,2012and2011, respectively. No single product accounted for more than10%of net revenues in fiscal years2013,2012and2011. Based on customers' ship-to locations, international sales accounted for approximately88%,88%and85%of net revenues










in fiscal years2013,2012and2011, respectively. See Note 12, "Segment Information" in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report.



Seasonality





Our revenue is generally influenced on a quarter to quarter basis by customer demand patterns and new product introductions. However, an increasing number of our products are being incorporated into consumer electronic products, which are subject to significant seasonality and fluctuations in demand, and tend to have stronger sales in the middle of the calendar year as manufacturers prepare for the major holiday selling seasons.



Foreign Operations





We conduct business in numerous countries outside of the United States ("U.S."). Our international business is subject to numerous risks, including fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and controls, import and export controls, and other laws, policies and regulations of foreign governments.



Backlog



AtJune 29, 2013andJune 30, 2012, our current quarter backlog was approximately$357 millionand$393 million, respectively. We include in backlog orders with customer request dates within the next three months. As is customary in the semiconductor industry, these orders may be canceled in most cases without penalty to customers. In addition, backlog includes orders from domestic distributors for which revenues are not recognized until the products are sold by the distributors. Accordingly, we believe that our backlog is not a reliable measure of future revenues. All backlog numbers have been adjusted for estimated future U.S. distribution ship and debit pricing adjustments.



Research and Development



We believe that research and development is critical to our future success. Objectives for the research and development function include:



•new product definition and development of differentiated products;

•design of products with performance differentiation that achieve high manufacturing yield and reliability;

•development of, and access to, manufacturing processes and advanced packaging;

•development of hardware and software to support the acceptance and design-in of our products in the end customer's system; and

•development of high-integration products across multiple end markets.



Our research and development plans require engineering talent and tools for process technologies, test development, packaging development, product definition, electronic design automation ("EDA"), circuit design, software development and applications support. Research and development expenses were$534.8 million,$552.4 millionand$525.3 millionin fiscal years2013,2012and2011, respectively.See "Research and Development" under Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, for more information.



Competition



The mixed signal analog integrated circuit industry is intensely competitive, and virtually all major semiconductor companies presently compete with, or conceivably could compete with, some portion of our business.



We believe the principal elements of competition include:



•technical innovation, service and support;

•time to market;

•differentiated product performance and features;

•quality and reliability;

•product pricing and delivery capabilities;

•customized design and applications;

•business relationship with customers;

•experience, skill and productivity of employees and management; and










•manufacturing competence and inventory management.



Our principal competitors include, but are not limited to, Analog Devices, Inc., Intersil Corporation, Linear Technology Corporation, NXP Semiconductors NV, Semtech Corporation and Texas Instruments Inc. In addition, we compete with digital chipset providers, including Broadcom Corporation, Samsung System LSI and Qualcomm Inc. We expect increased competition in the future from other emerging and established companies.



Patents, Licenses, and Other Intellectual Property Rights



We rely upon both know-how and patents to develop and maintain our competitive position.



It is our policy to seek patent protection for significant inventions that may be patented, though we may elect, in certain cases, not to seek patent protection even for significant inventions if other protection, such as maintaining the invention as a trade secret, is considered by us to be more advantageous. In addition, we have registered certain of our mask sets under the Semiconductor Chip Protection Act of 1984, as amended. We hold a number of patents worldwide with expiration dates ranging from 2013 to 2033. We have also registered several of our trademarks and copyrights with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office and in foreign jurisdictions.



Employees



As ofJune 29, 2013, we employed9,019persons.



Environmental Regulations



Our compliance with foreign, federal, state and local laws and regulations that have been enacted to regulate the environment has not had a material adverse effect on our capital expenditures, earnings, or competitive or financial position.



Executive Officers
