ITEM 1.    BUSINESS





GENERAL



We are a corporation incorporated under the laws of the state of Oklahoma, and our common stock is listed on the NYSE under the trading symbol “OKE.”  We are the sole general partner and, as of December 31, 2014, owned37.8 percentof ONEOK Partners (NYSE: OKS), one of the largest publicly traded master limited partnerships.  Our goal is to provide management and resources to ONEOK Partners, enabling it to execute its growth strategies and allowing us to grow our dividend.  ONEOK Partners applies its core capabilities of gathering, processing, fractionating, transporting, storing and marketing natural gas and NGLs through the rebundling of services across the energy value chains, primarily through vertical integration, to provide its customers with premium services at lower costs.  ONEOK Partners is a leader in the gathering, processing, storage and transportation of natural gas in the United States.  In addition, ONEOK Partners owns one of the nation’s premier natural gas liquids systems, connecting NGL supply in the Mid-Continent, Permian and Rocky Mountain regions with key market centers.



Separation of Natural Gas Distribution Business- In January 2014, ourboard of directors unanimously approved the separation of our former natural gas distribution business into a stand-alone publicly traded company, ONE Gas (NYSE: OGS), which was completed on January 31, 2014.  ONEOK shareholders of record at the close of business on January 21, 2014, retained their current shares of ONEOK stock and received one share of ONE Gas stock for every four shares of ONEOK stock owned in a transaction that was tax-free to ONEOK and its shareholders.  In connection with the separation, we received a cash payment of approximately $1.13 billion from ONE Gas and utilized the proceeds to repay outstanding commercial paper and approximately $550 million of long-term debt.



Wind Down of Energy Services- We completed the wind down of our former energy services business on March 31, 2014.  See additional discussion in the Note B to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report.



EXECUTIVE SUMMARY



Commodity Price Environment- The global demand for crude oil has continued to increase, but significantly higher supply has led to a dramatic fall in crude oil prices.  Commodity prices declined sharply in the fourth quarter 2014 and continued to decline into early 2015.  WTI crude oil prices declined to less than $50.00 per barrel in early 2015, compared with approximately $90.00 per barrel in September 2014.  NYMEX natural gas prices also declined to approximately $3.00 per MMBtu in early 2015, compared with prices in excess of $4.00 per MMBtu in September 2014.  The decline in crude oil prices has also contributed to lower NGL product prices and narrow NGL product price differentials.



We expect lower commodity prices to persist throughout 2015.  In response, producer capital investment for crude oil and natural gas exploration is expected to decrease, and declines in crude oil and natural gas production and reduced drilling activity are expected to slow crude oil, natural gas and NGL supply growth.  We expect crude oil and natural gas producers to focus capital spending and drilling activities on core locations that are most economical to develop.



We also expect narrow NGL price differentials with periods of volatility for certain NGL products between the Conway, Kansas, and Mont Belvieu, Texas, market centers to persist as new fractionators and pipelines from the various NGL-rich shale areas throughout the country, including ONEOK Partners’ growth projects discussed below, continue to add supply to the market.



In the future, we expect commodities prices to recover; however, the timing of this recovery is uncertain.  We do not expect commodities prices to return in the near term to the levels experienced in the first half of 2014.



The lower commodity price environment is expected to have an adverse impact on our and ONEOK Partners’ financial results in 2015.  ONEOK Partners is responding by aligning its operating costs and capital-growth projects with the needs of crude oil and natural gas producers, which includes suspending, reducing or eliminating certain capital-growth projects; limiting increases of distributions to its partners, including us; and negotiating various contract enhancements.  These actions are expected to impact our financial results and cash distributions received from ONEOK Partners in 2015.



Supply- Because crude oil and natural gas producers received higher market prices on a heating-value basis for crude oil and NGLs compared with natural gas, many producers in North America focused their drilling activity in NGL-rich shale areas throughout the country that produce crude oil and NGL-rich natural gas rather than areas that produce dry natural gas.  This resulted in crude oil, natural gas and NGL production increasing at a rate faster than demand.











The recent decline in crude oil, natural gas and NGL prices, along with announced reductions in producer drilling activities, are expected to slow supply growth in the United States in 2015.  However, we continue to expect demand for midstream infrastructure development to be driven by producers who need to connect production with end-use markets where current infrastructure is insufficient or nonexistent.



The significant drilling activity in the Williston Basin has caused natural gas production to exceed the capacity of existing natural gas gathering and processing infrastructure, which results in the flaring of natural gas (the controlled burning of natural gas at the wellhead) by producers.  We expect ONEOK Partners’ natural gas gathered and processed volumes in the Williston Basin to continue to grow in 2015, despite expected reductions in producer drilling activity.  We expect ONEOK Partners to capture a substantial amount of natural gas currently being flared by producers and production from wells that have been drilled but not yet completed or connected to its system.  We expect additional volume from new wells focused in core areas, which typically produce at higher initial production rates compared with noncore areas.  We also expect supply growth to continue in 2016 and 2017, although not as rapidly as growth experienced in 2014.



Due to success in extracting NGLs, ethane production has increased more rapidly than the petrochemical industry’s current demand for ethane.  We believe similar market conditions may generally persist until ethylene producers increase their capacity, with the largest number of additions expected to be completed over the next two to four years, to consume additional ethane feedstock volumes through plant modifications and expansions, and the completion of announced new world-scale ethylene production capacity.  As a result, natural gas processors continue to limit the recovery of the ethane component of the natural gas stream, also known as ethane rejection.  Instead, natural gas processors leave much of the ethane component in the natural gas stream sold at the tailgate of natural gas processing plants.  Low or unprofitable price differentials between ethane and natural gas resulted in ethane rejection at most of ONEOK Partners’ natural gas processing plants and most of its customers’ natural gas processing plants connected to its natural gas liquids gathering system in the Mid-Continent and Rocky Mountain regions during 2013 and 2014, which reduced natural gas liquids volumes gathered, fractionated and transported in the Natural Gas Liquids segment and our and ONEOK Partners’ results of operations.



We expect ethane rejection to persist until new world-scale ethylene production capacity begins coming on line, which we anticipate to occur in 2017 and is expected to increase ethane demand.  Ethane rejection is expected to continue to have a significant impact on our financial results through 2017.  However, the Natural Gas Liquids segment’s integrated assets enable it to mitigate partially the impact of ethane rejection through minimum volume commitments and its ability to utilize the transportation capacity made available due to ethane rejection to capture additional NGL location price differentials in its optimization activities.  See additional discussion in the “Financial Results and Operating Information” section.



Growth Projects- In response to increased production of crude oil, natural gas and NGLs, and higher demand for NGL products, ONEOK Partners completed approximately$5.9 billionin growth projects and acquisitions from 2010 through 2014 and has approximately$2.1 billionto$3.0 billionof projects in various stages of construction, including approximately$2.2 billionin new projects and acquisitions announced in 2014, to meet the needs of natural gas producers and processors, as well as enhance its natural gas liquids fractionation, distribution and storage infrastructure in the Gulf Coast region.  This infrastructure also will enhance the distribution of NGL products to meet the increasing petrochemical industry and NGL export demand.  ONEOK Partners is responding to changes in producer drilling activity by suspending capital expenditures of several projects.  ONEOK Partners expects to resume its suspended capital-growth projects as soon as market conditions improve.  When completed, ONEOK Partners expects these projects to increase volumes in its businesses and generate additional earnings and cash flows, particularly from fee-based revenues in the Natural Gas Liquids segment, while also increasing commodity price sensitivity in the Natural Gas Gathering and Processing segment.  If the current commodity price environment persists for a prolonged period, it may further impact the timing or demand for additional infrastructure projects or growth opportunities in the future.



Liquidity -During 2014, we relied primarily on distributions from ONEOK Partners to fund our short-term liquidity and capital requirements.  Our cash flow sources and requirements changed significantly following the separation of our former natural gas distribution business and the wind down of our former energy services business.  Our primary source of cash inflows are distributions from ONEOK Partners, and our primary cash outflows are dividends to our shareholders.  We also have access to our $300 million ONEOK Credit Agreement, which we amended in January 2014, extending its maturity to January 2019.  We do not expect any principal debt-service requirements until our next long-term debt maturity in 2022.



ONEOK Partners anticipates that its cash flows generated from operations, existing capital resources and ability to obtain financing will enable it to maintain its current and planned levels of operations.  ONEOK Partners relies heavily on capital markets to finance its capital-growth projects.  Its ability to continue to access capital markets for debt and equity financing under reasonable terms depends on its financial condition, credit ratings and market conditions.  ONEOK Partners expects to









fund its future capital expenditures with short- and long-term debt, the issuance of equity and operating cash flows.  The recent decline in commodity prices has contributed to a decrease in ONEOK Partners’ unit price.  While lower commodity prices and industry uncertainty may continue to increase its debt and equity financing costs, ONEOK Partners expects to have sufficient liquidity to finance its announced capital-growth projects.



During2014, we paid cash dividends of$2.125per share, an increase of approximately44 percentfrom the$1.48per share paid during2013.  In January2015, we declared a dividend of$0.605per share ($2.42per share on an annualized basis), an increase of approximately51 percentfrom the$0.40declared in January2014.



In December 2013, ONEOK Partners amended and restated its credit agreement, effective January 31, 2014, to increase the capacity of the facility to $1.7 billion from $1.2 billion and extended the maturity to January 2019.  In February 2015, ONEOK Partners notified its lenders of its intent to exercise its option to increase the capacity of the facility to $2.4 billion by increased commitments from existing lenders and/or commitments from one or more new lenders, which is pending lenders’ approval.  The facility is available to provide liquidity for working capital, capital expenditures and other general partnership purposes.



During2014, ONEOK Partners paid cash distributions to its limited partners of$3.01per unit, an increase of approximately5percent compared with the$2.87per unit paid during2013.  In January2015, ONEOK Partners GP declared a cash distribution to ONEOK Partners’ limited partners of$0.79per unit ($3.16per unit on an annualized basis) for the fourth quarter2014, an increase of approximately8 percentcompared with the$0.73declared in January2014.



In2014, ONEOK Partners issued approximately21.8 millioncommon units through an underwritten public offering and its “at-the-market” equity program, generating net proceeds of approximately$1.1 billion, including ONEOK Partners GP’s contribution to maintain its 2 percent general partner interest in ONEOK Partners.  ONEOK Partners utilized proceeds from these equity issuances, cash from operations and short-term borrowings under its commercial paper program to meet its short-term liquidity needs, repay amounts outstanding under its commercial paper program, fund its capital projects and acquisitions and for general partnership purposes.



See Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation, for more information on our growth projects, results of operations, liquidity and capital resources.



BUSINESS STRATEGY



Our primary business strategy is to maximize dividend payout while maintaining prudent financial strength and flexibility, with a focus on safe, reliable and environmentally responsible operations for our customers, employees, contractors and the public through the following:

•Provide reliable energy and energy-related services in a safe and environmentally responsible manner to our stakeholders through our ownership in ONEOK Partners- environmental, safety and health issues continue to be a primary focus for us, and our emphasis on personal and process safety has produced improvements in the key indicators we track.  We also continue to look for ways to reduce our environmental impact by conserving resources and utilizing more efficient technologies;

•Maximize dividend payout while maintaining prudent financial strength and flexibility- during 2014, cash dividends paid per share increased44 percentcompared with the prior year.  During 2014, ONEOK Partners’ cash distributions increased by 14 cents per unit, an increase of approximately5 percentcompared with 2013.  ONEOK Partners announced new capital projects and acquisitions of$2.2 billion, increasing its total growth program, which began in 2010, to approximately$8.0 billionto$8.9 billion.  These projects are expected to meet the needs of NGL and natural gas producers in the Williston Basin and NGL-rich areas of the Powder River Basin in the Rocky Mountain region; the Cana-Woodford Shale, Springer Shale, Stack and SCOOP areas in Oklahoma, and the Permian Basin in Texas and New Mexico; and provide additional natural gas liquids infrastructure in the Mid-Continent and Gulf Coast areas, which will enhance the distribution of NGL products to meet the increasing petrochemical industry and NGL export demand.  When completed, these projects are anticipated to provide additional earnings and cash flows.  Our strategy is to distribute the majority of our cash flows in excess of debt service, income taxes and other operating needs in the form of dividends.  ONEOK Partners’ balance sheet remains strong, and ONEOK Partners will seek to maintain investment-grade credit ratings; and

•Attract, select, develop and retain a diverse group of employees to support strategy execution- we continue to execute on our recruiting strategy that targets professional and field personnel in our operating areas.  We also continue to focus on employee development efforts with our current employees and monitor our benefits and compensation package to remain competitive.











NARRATIVE DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS



At December 31, 2014, we report operations in the following business segments:

•Natural Gas Gathering and Processing;

•Natural Gas Liquids; and

•Natural Gas Pipelines.





Natural Gas Gathering and Processing



Overview-The Natural Gas Gathering and Processing segment provides nondiscretionary services to producers that include gathering and processing of natural gas produced from crude oil and natural gas wells.  Unprocessed natural gas is compressed and gathered through pipelines and transported to processing facilities where volumes are aggregated, treated and processed to remove water vapor, solids and other contaminants and to extract NGLs in order to provide marketable natural gas, commonly referred to as residue gas.  The residue gas, which consists primarily of methane, is compressed and delivered to natural gas pipelines for transportation to end users.  When the NGLs are separated from the unprocessed natural gas at the processing plants, the NGLs are in the form of a mixed, unfractionated NGL stream that is delivered to natural gas liquids gathering pipelines for transportation to natural gas liquids fractionators.



This segment gathers and processes natural gas in the Mid-Continent region, which includes the NGL-rich Cana-Woodford Shale, Woodford Shale, Stack, SCOOP, Springer Shale and the Mississippian Lime formation of Oklahoma and Kansas, and the Hugoton and Central Kansas Uplift Basins of Kansas.  It also gathers and/or processes natural gas in two producing basins in the Rocky Mountain region:  the Williston Basin, which spans portions of Montana and North Dakota, and includes the oil-producing, NGL-rich Bakken Shale and Three Forks formations; and the Powder River Basin of Wyoming, which includes the NGL-rich Frontier, Turner, Sussex, and Niobrara Shale formations.  Coal-bed methane, or dry natural gas, in the Powder River Basin does not require processing or NGL extraction in order to be marketable; dry natural gas is gathered, compressed and delivered into a downstream pipeline or marketed for a fee.



The significant growth in the development of crude oil and NGL-rich natural gas in the Williston Basin has caused natural gas production to exceed the capacity of existing natural gas gathering and processing infrastructure, which results in the flaring of natural gas (the controlled burning of natural gas at the wellhead) by producers.  In July 2014, the North Dakota Industrial Commission approved a policy designed to limit flaring at existing and future crude oil wells in the Williston Basin.  The policy establishes crude oil production limits that will take effect if a producer fails to meet requirements to capture natural gas at the wellhead.  ONEOK Partners is constructing additional natural gas gathering pipelines, compression and processing plants, and natural gas liquids pipeline capacity that are expected to help alleviate capacity constraints.  We expect ONEOK Partners’ natural gas gathered and processed volumes in the Williston Basin to continue to grow in 2015, despite expected reductions in producer drilling activity, as it captures natural gas currently being flared by producers and natural gas produced with new drilling focused in core areas, which typically produce at higher initial production rates compared with noncore areas.



Revenues for this segment are derived primarily from commodity and fee-based contracts.  ONEOK Partners generally gathers and processes natural gas under the following types of contracts:

•POP with fee - ONEOK Partners retains a percentage of the proceeds from the sale of residue gas, condensate and/or NGLs, and charges fees for gathering, treating, compressing and/or processing the producer’s natural gas.  POP with fee contracts expose ONEOK Partners to commodity price risk.  This type of contract represented approximately 87 percent and 85 percent of contracted volumes in this segment for 2014 and 2013, respectively.  There are a variety of factors that directly affect ONEOK Partners’ POP revenues, including:

–the natural gas, crude oil and NGL prices received for its retained products;

–the percentage of NGL, condensate and residue natural gas sales proceeds retained by ONEOK Partners that it receives as payment for the services it provides;

–the composition of the NGLs produced;

–volume produced that affects its fee revenue; and

–transportation and fractionation costs incurred on the NGLs, condensate and natural gas it retains.

•Fee - ONEOK Partners is paid a fee for the services it provides, based on volumes gathered, processed, treated and/or compressed.  ONEOK Partners’ fee-based contracts represented approximately 13 percent and 15 percent of contracted volumes in this segment for 2014 and 2013, respectively.



We expect ONEOK Partners’ capital projects will continue to generate additional revenues, earnings and cash flows as they are completed.  ONEOK Partners’ natural gas liquids and natural gas commodity price sensitivity within this segment may increase in the future as its capital projects are completed and volumes increase under POP contracts with a fee-based component with









its customers.  ONEOK Partners uses commodity derivative instruments and physical-forward contracts to reduce its near-term sensitivity to fluctuations in the natural gas, crude oil and NGL prices received for its share of volumes.  ONEOK Partners continues to seek opportunities to convert certain of its POP contracts to fee-based contracts or increase the fee component in its POP contracts.



Unconsolidated Affiliates- The Natural Gas Gathering and Processing segment includes the following unconsolidated affiliates:

•49 percent ownership interest in Bighorn Gas Gathering, which operates a major coal-bed methane gas gathering system serving a broad production area in northeast Wyoming;

•37 percent ownership interest in Fort Union Gas Gathering, which gathers coal-bed methane gas produced in the Powder River Basin and delivers it into the interstate pipeline grid;

•35 percent ownership interest in Lost Creek Gathering Company, which gathers natural gas produced from conventional wells in the Wind River Basin of central Wyoming and delivers natural gas into the interstate pipeline grid; and

•10 percent ownership interest in Venice Energy Services Co., a natural gas processing complex near Venice, Louisiana.



See Note P of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report for additional discussion of ONEOK Partners’ unconsolidated affiliates.



Market Conditions and Seasonality-Supply- Natural gas supply is affected by producer drilling activity, which is sensitive to commodity prices, drilling rig availability, exploration success, operating capability, access to capital and regulatory control.  In recent years, higher crude oil prices and advances in horizontal drilling and completion technology have had a positive impact on drilling activity, which has provided an offset to the less favorable supply projections in some of the conventional resource areas.  However, the recent decrease in crude oil prices has resulted in a decline in drilling activity in the shale formations, and further reductions are expected in 2015.



Extreme weather conditions can impact the volumes of natural gas gathered and processed and NGL volumes gathered, transported and fractionated.  Freeze-offs are a phenomenon where water produced from natural gas freezes at the wellhead or within the gathering system.  This causes a temporary interruption in the flow of natural gas.  This is more prevalent in the Rocky Mountain region where temperatures tend to be colder than in the Mid-Continent region but can occur throughout ONEOK Partners’ systems.  All of the operations may be affected by other weather conditions that may cause a loss of electricity or prevent access to certain locations that affect a producer’s ability to complete wells or ONEOK Partners’ ability to connect these wells to its systems.





In the Mid-Continent region, ONEOK Partners has significant natural gas gathering and processing assets in Oklahoma and Kansas.  During 2015, we expect drilling activity in the Cana-Woodford Shale, Woodford Shale, Stack and SCOOP areas in Oklahoma to offset partially the volumetric declines from existing wells that supply ONEOK Partners’ natural gas gathering and processing facilities.  If the current energy commodity price environment persists for a prolonged period or declines further, ONEOK Partners’ natural gas gathered and processed volumes for this region may further decline.



Demand-Demand for natural gas gathering and processing services is aligned typically with the production of natural gas from natural gas resource areas or the associated natural gas from wells drilled in crude oil resource areas.  Gathering and processing are nondiscretionary services that producers require to market their natural gas and NGL production.  Due to the recent decline









in crude oil prices, we expect producer capital investment to decrease, which combined with decline rates and lower drilling activity is expected to slow crude oil, natural gas and NGL supply growth.  This may result in decreased demand for ONEOK Partners’ gathering and processing services if there is not sufficient natural gas production from new drilling activity to offset the natural decline in production volumes.



Commodity Prices- Crude oil, natural gas and NGL prices historically have been volatile and may be subject to significant fluctuations in the future as market conditions change.  For example, WTI crude oil prices declined to less than $50.00 per barrel in early 2015, compared with approximately $90.00 per barrel in September 2014.  NYMEX natural gas prices also declined to approximately $3.00 per MMBtu in early 2015, compared with prices in excess of $4.00 per MMBtu in September 2014.  The decline in crude oil prices has also contributed to lower NGL product prices and narrow NGL product price differentials.



ONEOK Partners is exposed to commodity price risk and the cost of NGL transportation to various market locations as a result of receiving commodities through its POP contracts in exchange for its services.  ONEOK Partners uses commodity derivative financial instruments and physical-forward contracts to reduce the near-term impact of price fluctuations related to natural gas, NGLs and condensate.



The price differential between the typically higher valued NGL products and the value of natural gas, particularly the price differential between ethane and natural gas, may influence the volume of NGLs recovered from natural gas processing plants. When economic conditions warrant, natural gas processors may elect to reduce the recovery of the ethane component of the natural gas stream, also known as ethane rejection, and instead leave much of the ethane component in the natural gas stream sold at the tailgate of natural gas processing plants.  ONEOK Partners’ natural gas processing plant operations can be adjusted to respond to market conditions, such as demand for ethane.  By changing operating parameters at certain plants, ONEOK Partners can reduce the amount of ethane recovered if the price differential is unfavorable.



Seasonality- Certain products of this segment are subject to weather-related seasonal demand.  Cold temperatures typically increase demand for natural gas and propane, which are used to heat homes and businesses.  Warm temperatures typically drive demand for natural gas used for natural gas-fired electric generation needed to meet the demand required to cool residential and commercial properties.  Demand for butanes and natural gasoline, which are used primarily by the refining industry as blending stocks for motor fuel, also may be subject to some variability as automotive travel increases and seasonal gasoline formulation standards are implemented.  During periods of peak demand for a certain commodity, prices for that product typically increase.



Competition- The natural gas gathering and processing business remains relatively fragmented despite significant consolidation in the industry.  ONEOK Partners competes for natural gas supplies with major integrated oil companies, independent exploration and production companies that have gathering and processing assets, pipeline companies and their affiliated marketing companies, national and local natural gas gatherers and processors, and marketers in the Mid-Continent and Rocky Mountain regions.  The factors that typically affect ONEOK Partners’ ability to compete for natural gas supplies are:

•quality of services provided;

•producer drilling activity;

•products retained and/or fees charged under its gathering and processing contracts;

•location of its gathering systems relative to those of its competitors;

•location of its gathering systems relative to drilling activity;

•operating pressures maintained on its gathering systems;

•efficiency and reliability of its operations;

•delivery capabilities for natural gas and natural gas liquids that exist in each system and plant location; and

•cost of capital.



Competition for natural gas gathering and processing services continues to increase as new infrastructure projects are completed to address increased production from shale and other resource areas.  In response to these changing industry conditions, ONEOK Partners is evaluating opportunities to increase earnings and cash flows, and reduce risk by:

•investing capital to construct and expand its assets;

•improving natural gas processing efficiency;

•reducing operating costs;

•consolidating assets;

•decreasing commodity price exposure; and

•renegotiating low-margin contracts.











Government Regulation-The FERC traditionally has maintained that a natural gas processing plant is not a facility for the transportation or sale for resale of natural gas in interstate commerce and, therefore, is not subject to jurisdiction under the Natural Gas Act.  Although the FERC has made no specific declaration as to the jurisdictional status of ONEOK Partners’ natural gas processing operations or facilities, its natural gas processing plants are primarily involved in extracting NGLs and, therefore, are exempt from FERC jurisdiction.  The Natural Gas Act also exempts natural gas gathering facilities from the jurisdiction of the FERC.  ONEOK Partners believes its natural gas gathering facilities and operations meet the criteria used by the FERC for nonjurisdictional natural gas gathering facility status.  Interstate transmission facilities remain subject to FERC jurisdiction.  The FERC has historically distinguished between these two types of facilities, either interstate or intrastate, on a fact-specific basis.  ONEOK Partners transports residue natural gas from its natural gas processing plants to interstate pipelines in accordance with Section 311(a) of the Natural Gas Policy Act.



Oklahoma, Kansas, Wyoming, Montana and North Dakota also have statutes regulating, to various degrees, the gathering of natural gas in those states.  In each state, regulation is applied on a case-by-case basis if a complaint is filed against the gatherer with the appropriate state regulatory agency.



See further discussion in the “Regulatory, Environmental and Safety Matters” section.





Natural Gas Liquids



Overview

-





Most natural gas produced at the wellhead contains a mixture of NGL components, such as ethane, propane, iso-butane, normal butane and natural gasoline.  The NGLs that are separated from the natural gas stream at the natural gas processing plants remain in a mixed, unfractionated form until they are gathered, primarily by pipeline, and delivered to fractionators where the NGLs are separated into NGL products.  These NGL products are then stored or distributed to ONEOK Partners’ customers, such as petrochemical manufacturers, heating fuel users, ethanol producers, refineries and propane distributors.  The Natural Gas Liquids segment also purchases NGLs and condensate from third parties, as well as from the Natural Gas Gathering and Processing segment.



Revenues for the Natural Gas Liquids segment are derived primarily from nondiscretionary fee-based services that ONEOK Partners provides to its customers and from the physical optimization of its assets.  The segment’s fee-based services have increased due primarily to new supply connections; expansion of existing connections; its previously completed capital projects, including the Bakken NGL Pipeline and Sterling III Pipeline; the West Texas LPG acquisition; and expansion of its NGL fractionation capacity, including the completion of its MB-2 and MB-3 fractionators.  The segment’s sources of revenue are categorized as exchange services, optimization and marketing, pipeline transportation, and isomerization and storage, which are defined as follows:

•ONEOK Partners’ exchange-services activities utilize its assets to gather, fractionate and/or treat unfractionated NGLs for a fee, thereby converting them into marketable NGL products that are stored and shipped to a market center or customer-designated location.  Many of these exchange volumes are under contracts with minimum volume commitments.

•ONEOK Partners’ optimization and marketing activities utilize its assets, contract portfolio and market knowledge to capture location, product and seasonal price differentials.  It transports NGL products between Conway, Kansas, and Mont Belvieu, Texas, to capture the location price differentials between the two market centers.  Its natural gas liquids









storage facilities are also utilized to capture seasonal price variances.  A growing portion of its marketing activities serves truck and rail markets.

•ONEOK Partners’ pipeline transportation services transport unfractionated NGLs, NGL products and refined petroleum products, primarily under FERC-regulated tariffs.  Tariffs specify the maximum rates it charges customers and the general terms and conditions for NGL transportation service on its pipelines.

•ONEOK Partners’ isomerization activities capture the price differential when normal butane is converted into the more valuable iso-butane at its isomerization unit in Conway, Kansas.  Iso-butane is used in the refining industry to increase the octane of motor gasoline.

•ONEOK Partners’ storage activities consist primarily of fee-based NGL storage services at its Mid-Continent and Gulf Coast storage facilities.



Since late 2012, NGL location price differentials have generally remained narrow between the Mid-Continent and Gulf Coast market centers.  We expect these narrow NGL price differentials, with periods of volatility for certain NGL products, to continue as new fractionators and pipelines, including its growth projects discussed below, have alleviated constraints between the Conway, Kansas, and Mont Belvieu, Texas, natural gas liquids market centers.  In addition, new natural gas liquids pipeline projects constructed by third parties are expected to bring incremental NGL supply from the Rocky Mountain, Marcellus and Utica regions to the Mont Belvieu, Texas, market center that may affect NGL prices, as well as compete with or displace NGL supply volumes from the Mid-Continent and Rocky Mountain regions where its assets are located.  The Natural Gas Liquids segment’s capital-growth projects are supported by fee-based contractual commitments that it expects will fill much of its optimization capacity used historically to capture NGL location price differentials between the two market centers.



Market Conditions and Seasonality

-



Supply



-





The Natural Gas Liquids segment also is affected by operational or market-driven changes that affect the output of natural gas processing plants to which ONEOK Partners is connected.  The price differential between the typically higher valued NGL products and the value of natural gas, particularly the price differential between ethane and natural gas, has influenced the volume of ethane natural gas processing plants make available to be gathered in the Natural Gas Liquids segment.  The recent economic conditions caused certain natural gas processors to reduce the recovery of the ethane component of the natural gas stream, also known as ethane rejection, and instead leave much of the ethane component in the natural gas stream sold at the tailgate of natural gas processing plants.  Price differentials between ethane and natural gas resulted in ethane rejection at most of ONEOK Partners’ natural gas processing plants and its customers’ natural gas processing plants connected to its natural gas liquids gathering system in the Mid-Continent and Rocky Mountain regions during 2013 and 2014, which reduced natural gas liquids volumes gathered, fractionated and transported in the Natural Gas Liquids segment and its results of operations.



We expect ethane rejection to persist until new world-scale ethylene production capacity, which is anticipated to begin coming on line in 2017, significantly increases ethane demand.  Ethane rejection is expected to continue to have a significant impact on our and ONEOK Partners’ financial results through 2017.  However, the Natural Gas Liquids segment’s integrated assets enable it to mitigate partially the impact of ethane rejection through minimum volume commitments and its ability to utilize the transportation capacity made available due to ethane rejection to capture additional NGL location price differentials in its optimization activities.  See additional discussion in the “Financial Results and Operating Information” section in the Natural Gas Liquids segment.



Natural gas, natural gas liquids and crude oil transportation constraints may also impact the output of natural gas processing plants in total or for specific NGL products.  These constraints are currently being alleviated by the addition of new









infrastructure and the projected slower growth in crude oil and natural gas production resulting from the recent decrease in prices.



Demand



Commodity Prices- In recent years, market conditions have occasionally produced periods of volatility, higher prices and wider NGL location and product price differentials.  The abundance of NGLs produced from the development of shale and other resource areas has made NGL feedstocks to the petrochemical industry less costly.  Ethane production has increased more rapidly than the petrochemical industry’s current capability to consume the increase in supplies.  This oversupply has contributed to low ethane prices since 2013.  While petrochemical demand has remained strong since 2013, ONEOK Partners expects the oversupply of ethane to persist until ethylene producers increase their capacity to consume additional ethane feedstock volumes through plant modifications and expansions, and the completion of announced new world-scale ethylene capacity is completed and ethane exports increase.  In the near term, this ethane oversupply situation may result in low ethane prices and continued ethane rejection to balance supply and demand.



ONEOK Partners is exposed to market risk associated with changes in the price of NGLs; the location differential between the Mid-Continent, Chicago, Illinois, and Gulf Coast regions; and the relative price differential between natural gas, NGLs and individual NGL products, which affect its NGL purchases and sales, and its exchange, storage, transportation and optimization margins.  When natural gas prices are higher relative to NGL prices, NGL production declines due to ethane rejection, which affects negatively ONEOK Partners’ exchange services and transportation revenues.  When the NGL location price differential between the Mid-Continent and Gulf Coast market centers is narrow, optimization opportunities and NGL shipments may decline, resulting in a decline in earnings from ONEOK Partners’ NGL optimization and marketing activities.  Since 2013, strong production and supply growth from the development of NGL-rich areas, increased demand in the Mid-Continent region and increased capacity available on pipelines that connect the Mid-Continent and Gulf Coast market centers resulted in NGL price differentials remaining narrow between the Mid-Continent market center at Conway, Kansas, and the Gulf Coast market center at Mont Belvieu, Texas.  NGL storage revenue may be affected by price volatility and forward pricing of NGL physical contracts versus the price of NGLs on the spot market.



ONEOK Partners is also exposed to volumetric risk associated with producer drilling activity that is influenced by commodity prices.  However, ONEOK Partners is able to mitigate partially the impact of volume decreases through minimum volume commitments with customers.



Seasonality-ONEOK Partners’ natural gas liquids fractionation and pipeline operations typically experience some seasonal variation.  Some NGL products stored and transported through its assets are subject to weather-related seasonal demand, such as propane, which can be used to heat homes during the winter heating season and for agricultural purposes such as crop drying in the fall.  Demand for butanes and natural gasoline, which are primarily used by the refining industry as blending stocks for motor fuel, denaturant for ethanol and diluents for crude oil, may also be subject to some variability during seasonal periods when certain government restrictions on motor fuel blending products change.  The ability of natural gas processors to produce NGLs is also affected by weather.  In periods of cold weather, the processors ability to gather the raw gas is affected by freeze-offs or treating, limiting the amount of natural gas processed and thus NGL recovery.  Conversely, in periods of hot weather, the natural gas processing plants become less efficient in NGL recovery, and thus NGL recovery during the summer typically decreases.











Competition-The Natural Gas Liquids segment competes with other fractionators; intrastate and interstate pipeline companies; storage providers and gatherers and transporters for NGL supply in the Rocky Mountain, Permian, Mid-Continent and Gulf Coast regions.  The factors that typically affect ONEOK Partners’ ability to compete for NGL supply are:

•quality of services provided;

•producer drilling activity;

•the petrochemical industry’s level of capacity utilization and feedstock requirements;

•fees charged under its contracts;

•current and forward NGL prices;

•location of its gathering systems relative to its competitors;

•location of its gathering systems relative to drilling activity;

•proximity to NGL supply areas and markets;

•efficiency and reliability of its operations;

•receipt and delivery capabilities that exist in each pipeline system, plant, fractionator and storage location; and

•cost of capital.



ONEOK Partners is responding to these factors by making capital investments to access new supplies; increasing gathering, fractionation and distribution capacity; increasing storage, withdrawal and injection capabilities; and reducing operating costs so that it may compete effectively.  ONEOK Partners’ competitors are constructing or have completed new natural gas liquids pipeline and fractionation projects to address the growing NGL supply and petrochemical demand.  As ONEOK Partners’ growth projects and those of its competitors have alleviated constraints between the Conway, Kansas, and Mont Belvieu, Texas, natural gas liquids market centers, it expects the narrow location price differentials between the Mid-Continent and Gulf Coast market centers to continue.  In addition, new natural gas liquids pipeline projects are expected to bring incremental NGL supply from the Rocky Mountain, Marcellus and Utica basins to the Mont Belvieu, Texas, market center that may affect NGL prices, as well as compete with or displace NGL supply volumes from the Mid-Continent and Rocky Mountain regions where ONEOK Partners’ assets are located.  ONEOK Partners believes its natural gas liquids fractionation, pipelines and storage assets are located strategically, connecting diverse supply areas to market centers.



Government Regulation- The operations and revenues of ONEOK Partners’ natural gas liquids pipelines are regulated by various state and federal government agencies.  Its interstate natural gas liquids pipelines are regulated by the FERC, which has authority over the terms and conditions of service, rates, including depreciation and amortization policies, and initiation of service.  In Kansas and Texas, certain aspects of ONEOK Partners’ intrastate natural gas liquids pipelines that provide common carrier service are subject to the jurisdiction of the KCC and RRC, respectively.



PHMSA has asserted jurisdiction over certain portions of ONEOK Partners’ fractionation facilities in Bushton, Kansas, that it believes are subject to its jurisdiction.  ONEOK Partners has objected to the scope of PHMSA’s jurisdiction and is seeking resolution of this matter.  ONEOK Partners does not anticipate that the cost of compliance will have a material adverse effect on its consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows.



See further discussion in the “Regulatory, Environmental and Safety Matters” section.





Natural Gas Pipelines



Overview- The Natural Gas Pipelines segment owns and operates regulated natural gas transmission pipelines and natural gas storage facilities.  It also provides interstate natural gas transportation and storage service in accordance with Section 311(a) of the Natural Gas Policy Act.



The segment’s FERC-regulated interstate natural gas pipeline assets transport natural gas through pipelines in North Dakota, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Tennessee, Oklahoma, Texas and New Mexico.  Its interstate pipeline companies include:

•Midwestern Gas Transmission, which is a bi-directional system that interconnects with Tennessee Gas Transmission Company’s pipeline near Portland, Tennessee, and with several interstate pipelines at the Chicago Hub near Joliet, Illinois;

•Viking Gas Transmission, which is a bi-directional system, interconnects with a TransCanada pipeline near Emerson, Manitoba, and ANR Pipeline Company near Marshfield, Wisconsin;

•Guardian Pipeline, which interconnects with several pipelines at the Chicago Hub near Joliet, Illinois, and with local natural gas distribution companies in Wisconsin; and

•OkTex Pipeline, which has interconnects in Oklahoma, Texas and New Mexico.











This segment’s intrastate natural gas pipeline assets in Oklahoma transport natural gas through the state and have access to the major natural gas producing formations, including the Cana-Woodford Shale, Woodford Shale, Springer Shale, Granite Wash, Stack, SCOOP and Mississippian Lime.  In Texas, its intrastate natural gas pipelines are connected to the major natural gas producing formations in the Texas Panhandle, including the Granite Wash formation and Delaware and Cline producing formations in the Permian Basin; and transport natural gas throughout the western portion of Texas, including the Waha Hub where other pipelines may be accessed for transportation to western markets, the Houston Ship Channel market to the east and the Mid-Continent market to the north.  ONEOK Partners also has access to the major natural gas producing formations, including the Mississippian Lime formation in south central Kansas.



The segment owns underground natural gas storage facilities in Oklahoma and Texas that are connected to its intrastate natural gas pipeline assets.  It also has underground natural gas storage facilities in Kansas.



The segment’s transportation contracts for its regulated natural gas activities are based upon rates stated in its tariffs.  Tariffs specify the maximum rates that customers may be charged, which may be discounted to meet competition if necessary, and the general terms and conditions for pipeline transportation service, which are established at FERC or appropriate state jurisdictional agency proceedings known as rate cases.  In Texas and Kansas, natural gas storage service is a fee business that may be regulated by the state in which the facility operates and by the FERC for certain types of services.  In Oklahoma, natural gas storage operations are also a fee business but are not subject to rate regulation by the state and have market-based rate authority from the FERC for certain types of services.



The Natural Gas Pipelines segment’s revenues are derived primarily from fee-based services.  Revenues are generated from the following types of fee-based contracts:

•Firm service - Customers can reserve a fixed quantity of pipeline or storage capacity for the term of their contract.  Under this type contract, the customer pays a fixed fee for a specified quantity regardless of their actual usage.  The customer then typically pays incremental fees, known as commodity charges, that are based upon the actual volume of natural gas they transport or store, and/or ONEOK Partners may retain a specified volume of natural gas in-kind for fuel.  Under the firm-service contract, the customer generally is guaranteed access to the capacity they reserve; and

•Interruptible service - Customers with interruptible service transportation and storage agreements may utilize available capacity after firm-service requests are satisfied or on an as-available basis.  Interruptible service customers typically are assessed fees, such as a commodity charge, based on their actual usage, and/or ONEOK Partners may retain a specified volume of natural gas in-kind for fuel.  Under the interruptible service contract, the customer is not guaranteed use of ONEOK Partners’ pipelines and storage facilities unless excess capacity is available.



Unconsolidated Affiliates- The Natural Gas Pipelines segment includes ONEOK Partners’ 50 percent interest in Northern Border Pipeline, which owns a FERC-regulated interstate pipeline that transports natural gas from the Montana-Saskatchewan border near Port of Morgan, Montana, to a terminus near North Hayden, Indiana.



See Note P of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report for additional discussion of unconsolidated affiliates.



Market Conditions and Seasonality-Supply- The development of natural gas produced from shale resource areas has continued to increase available supply across North America and has caused location and seasonal price differentials to narrow in the regions where ONEOK Partners operates.  As new supply is developed, ONEOK Partners’ customers may want access to this new shale supply, requiring new or additional services, to transport their production to the market.ONEOK Partners’ intrastate pipelines and storage assets could be impacted by the pace of natural gas drilling activity by producers and the decline rate of existing production in the major natural gas production areas in the Mid-Continent region.



Guardian Pipeline, Midwestern Gas Transmission and Viking Gas Transmission access supply from the major producing regions of the Mid-Continent, Rocky Mountains, Canada, Gulf Coast and the Northeast.  The current supply of natural gas for Northern Border Pipeline is primarily sourced from Canada; however, as the Williston Basin supply area, which contains the Bakken Shale and Three Forks formations, continues to develop, more natural gas supply from this area is expected to be transported on Northern Border Pipeline to markets near Chicago.  In addition, supply volumes from nontraditional natural gas production areas, such as the Northeast, may compete with and displace volumes from the Mid-Continent, Rocky Mountain and Canadian supply sources in ONEOK Partners’ markets.  Significant factors that can impact the supply of Canadian natural gas transported by its pipelines are the availability of United States supply, Canadian natural gas available for export, Canadian storage capacity and demand for Canadian natural gas in Canada and United States consumer markets.











Demand





Commodity Prices- The high level of natural gas supply from the development of shale resource areas throughout the country has caused natural gas prices to remain low, and natural gas location and seasonal price differentials to generally narrow across the regions where ONEOK Partners operates.  ONEOK Partners is exposed to market risk through interruptible contracts or when existing firm contracts expire and are subject to renegotiation with customers that have competitive alternatives and analyze the market price differential between receipt and delivery points along the pipeline, also known as location differential, to determine their expected gross margin.  The anticipated margin and its variability are important determinants of the transportation rate customers are willing to pay.  Natural gas storage revenue is impacted by the differential between forward pricing of natural gas physical contracts and the price of natural gas on the spot market.  ONEOK Partners’ fuel costs and the value of the retained fuel in-kind received for its services also are impacted by changes in the price of natural gas.



Seasonality-Demand for natural gas is seasonal.  Weather conditions throughout North America may significantly impact regional natural gas supply and demand.  High temperatures may increase demand for natural gas-fired electric generation needed to meet the electricity demand required to cool residential and commercial properties.  Cold temperatures may lead to greater demand for ONEOK Partners’ transportation services due to increased demand for natural gas to heat residential and commercial properties.  Low precipitation levels may impact the demand for natural gas that is used to fuel irrigation activity in the Mid-Continent region.



To the extent that pipeline capacity is contracted under firm-service transportation agreements, revenue, which is generated primarily from demand charges, is not significantly impacted by seasonal throughput variations.  However, when transportation agreements expire, seasonal demand may affect the value of firm-service transportation capacity.



Natural gas storage is necessary to balance the relatively steady natural gas supply with the seasonal demand of residential, commercial and electric-generation users.  The majority of the Natural Gas Pipeline segment’s storage capacity is contracted under firm-service agreements; however, contracted capacity declined in 2014 as a result of a contract with our former energy services business, which expired in the first quarter 2014.  Due to the current storage capacity market, this segment has elected to use that capacity to provide park-and-loan services to its customers rather than recontracting it under long-term firm-service agreements.  The segment also retains a small portion of its storage capacity for operational purposes.



Competition- This segment’s natural gas pipelines and storage facilities compete directly with other intrastate and interstate pipeline companies and other storage facilities providing natural gas transportation and storage services.  Its natural gas assets primarily serve local natural gas distribution companies, electric-generation facilities, large industrial companies, municipalities, irrigation customers and marketing companies.  Competition among pipelines and natural gas storage facilities is based primarily on fees for services, quality of services provided, current and forward natural gas prices, and proximity to natural gas supply areas and markets.  Competition for natural gas transportation services continues to increase as new infrastructure projects are completed and the FERC and state regulatory bodies continue to encourage more competition in the natural gas markets.  Regulatory bodies also are encouraging the use of natural gas for electric generation that has traditionally been fueled by coal.  The cost of coal and the associated rail transportation continues to compete with natural gas for this market; however, the clean-burning aspects of natural gas and abundance of supply make it an economically competitive and environmentally advantaged alternative.  ONEOK Partners believes that its pipelines and storage assets compete effectively due to their strategic locations connecting supply areas to market centers and other pipelines.



Government Regulation- This segment’s interstate natural gas pipelines are regulated under the Natural Gas Act and Natural Gas Policy Act, which give the FERC jurisdiction to regulate virtually all aspects of this business segment, such as









transportation of natural gas, rates and charges for services, construction of new facilities, depreciation and amortization policies, acquisition and disposition of facilities, and the initiation and discontinuation of services.



Likewise, ONEOK Partners’ intrastate natural gas pipelines in Oklahoma, Kansas and Texas are regulated by the OCC, KCC and RRC, respectively.  While ONEOK Partners has flexibility in establishing natural gas transportation rates with customers, there is a maximum rate that it can charge its customers in Oklahoma and Kansas.  In Kansas and Texas, natural gas storage may be regulated by the state and by the FERC for certain types of services.  In Oklahoma, natural gas storage is not subject to rate regulation, but certain types of services may be regulated by the FERC.



Recent EPA regulations on emissions from coal-fired electric-generation plants, including the Maximum Achievable Control Technology Standards and the Mercury and Air Toxics Standards, have increased the demand for the use of natural gas for electric generation, as well as related transportation and storage services.  The demand for natural gas and related transportation and storage services is expected to increase over the next several years as these regulations continue to be implemented.



In November 2012, the FERC initiated a review of Viking Gas Transmission’s rates pursuant to Section 5 of the Natural Gas Act.  The parties reached agreement on the terms of a settlement that provides for a 2 percent reduction in transportation rates.  The settlement was approved by the FERC in December 2013, and the revised rates became effective January 1, 2014.



In August 2014, Viking Gas Transmission filed a “Stipulation and Agreement in Resolutions of All Issues Concerning Adjustment in Rates of Viking Gas Transmission Company” (settlement) with the FERC.  The settlement was approved on October 1, 2014, and became final on October 31, 2014.  Rates under the settlement became effective January 1, 2015, and we do not expect the settlement to materially impact ONEOK Partners.

REGULATORY, ENVIRONMENTAL AND SAFETY MATTERS



Additional information about ONEOK Partners’ environmental matters is included in Note R of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report.



Environmental Matters

-















Pipeline Safety- ONEOK Partners is subject to PHMSA regulations, including pipeline asset integrity-management regulations.  The Pipeline Safety Improvement Act of 2002 requires pipeline companies operating high-pressure pipelines to perform integrity assessments on pipeline segments that pass through densely populated areas or near specifically designated high-consequence areas.  In January 2012, The Pipeline Safety, Regulatory Certainty and Job Creation Act of 2011 was signed into law.  The law increased maximum penalties for violating federal pipeline safety regulations and directs the DOT and Secretary of Transportation to conduct further review or studies on issues that may or may not be material to ONEOK Partners.  These issues include, but are not limited to, the following:

•an evaluation on whether hazardous natural gas liquids and natural gas pipeline integrity-management requirements should be expanded beyond current high-consequence areas;

•a review of all natural gas and hazardous natural gas liquids gathering pipeline exemptions;

•a verification of records for pipelines in Class 3 and 4 locations and high-consequence areas to confirm maximum allowable operating pressures; and

•a requirement to test previously untested pipelines operating above 30 percent yield strength in high-consequence areas.



The potential capital and operating expenditures related to this legislation, the associated regulations or other new pipeline safety regulations are unknown.



Air and Water Emissions- The Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, analogous state laws and/or regulations promulgated thereunder, impose restrictions and controls regarding the discharge of pollutants into the air and water in the United States.  Under the Clean Air Act, a federally enforceable operating permit is required for sources of significant air emissions.  ONEOK Partners may be required to incur certain capital expenditures for air pollution-control equipment in connection with obtaining or maintaining permits and approvals for sources of air emissions.  The Clean Water Act imposes substantial potential liability for the removal of pollutants discharged to waters of the United States and remediation of waters affected by such discharge.



Federal, state and regional initiatives to measure and regulate greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are underway.  ONEOK Partners monitors all relevant federal and state legislation to assess the potential impact on its operations.  The EPA’s Mandatory Greenhouse Gas Reporting Rule requires annual GHG emissions reporting from affected facilities and the carbon dioxide emission equivalents for the natural gas delivered by ONEOK Partners and the emission equivalents for all NGLs produced by ONEOK Partners as if all of these products were combusted, even if they are used otherwise.



ONEOK Partners’ 2013 total reported emissions were approximately 46.7 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalents.  The 2013 total reportable emissions related to our former natural gas distribution business were approximately 14.0 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalents.  These totals include direct emissions from the combustion of fuel in ONEOK Partners’ equipment, such as compressor engines and heaters, as well as carbon dioxide equivalents from natural gas and NGL products delivered to customers and produced as if all such fuel and NGL products were combusted.  The additional cost to gather and report this emission data did not have, and we do not expect it to have a material impact on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows.  In addition, Congress has considered, and may consider in the future, legislation to reduce GHG emissions, including carbon dioxide and methane.  Likewise, the EPA may institute additional regulatory rule-making associated with GHG emissions from the oil and natural gas industry.  At this time, no rule or legislation has been enacted that assesses any costs, fees or expenses on any of these emissions.



In April 2014, the EPA and the United States Army Corps of Engineers proposed a joint rule-making to redefine the definition of “Waters of the United States” under the Clean Water Act.  The public comment period on the proposed rule-making remains









pending and, as a result, the impact of any such proposed regulatory actions on ONEOK Partners’ projects, facilities and operations is unknown.



The EPA’s “Tailoring Rule” regulates GHG emissions at new or modified facilities that meet certain criteria.  Affected facilities are required to review best available control technology (BACT), conduct air-quality, impact analysis and public reviews with respect to such emissions.  At current emission threshold levels, this rule has had a minimal impact on ONEOK Partners’ existing facilities.  In addition, on June 23, 2014, the Supreme Court of the United States, in a case styled,

Utility Air Regulatory Group v. EPA

, 530 U.S. (2014), held that an industrial facility’s potential to emit GHG emissions alone cannot subject a facility to the permitting requirements for major stationary source provisions of the Clean Air Act.  The decision invalidated the EPA’s current Triggering and Tailoring Rule for GHG Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) and Title V requirements as applied to facilities considered major sources only for GHGs.  However, the Court also ruled that to the extent a source pursues a capital project (new construction or expansion of existing facility), which otherwise subjects the source to major source PSD permitting for conventional criteria pollutants, the permitting authorities may impose BACT analysis and emission limits for GHGs from those sources.  ONEOK Partners is in the process of evaluating the effects the decision and related pending judicial proceedings at the lower court level may have on its existing operations and the opportunities it creates for design decisions for new project applications.



In July 2011, the EPA issued a proposed rule that would change the air emission New Source Performance Standards, also known as NSPS, and Maximum Achievable Control Technology requirements applicable to the oil and natural gas industry, including natural gas production, processing, transmission and underground storage sectors.  In April 2012, the EPA released the final rule, which includes new NSPS and air toxic standards for a variety of sources within natural gas processing plants, oil and natural gas production facilities and natural gas transmission stations.  The rule also regulates emissions from the hydraulic fracturing of wells for the first time.  The EPA’s final rule reflects significant changes from the proposal issued in 2011 and allows for more manageable compliance options.  The NSPS final rule became effective in October 2012, but the dates for compliance vary and depend in part upon the type of affected facility and the date of construction, reconstruction or modification.



The rule was most recently amended in December 2014.  The EPA has indicated that further amendments may be issued in 2015.  Based on the amendments, ONEOK Partners’ understanding of pending stakeholder responses to the NSPS rule and the proposed rule-making, ONEOK Partners does not anticipate a material impact to its anticipated capital, operations and maintenance costs resulting from compliance with the regulation.  However, the EPA may issue additional responses, amendments and/or policy guidance on the final rule, which could alter its present expectations.  Generally, the NSPS rule will require expenditures for updated emissions controls, monitoring and record-keeping requirements at affected facilities in the crude oil and natural gas industry.  We do not expect these expenditures will have a material impact on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows.



CERCLA- The federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA), also commonly known as Superfund, imposes strict, joint and several liability, without regard to fault or the legality of the original act, on certain classes of “persons” (defined under CERCLA) who caused and/or contributed to the release of a hazardous substance into the environment.  These persons include, but are not limited to, the owner or operator of a facility where the release occurred and/or companies that disposed or arranged for the disposal of the hazardous substances found at the facility.  Under CERCLA, these persons may be liable for the costs of cleaning up the hazardous substances released into the environment, damages to natural resources and the costs of certain health studies.  We do not expect ONEOK Partners’ responsibilities under CERCLA will have a material impact on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows.



Chemical Site Security-The United States Department of Homeland Security (Homeland Security) released an interim rule in April 2007 that requires companies to provide reports on sites where certain chemicals, including many hydrocarbon products, are stored.  ONEOK Partners completed the Homeland Security assessments, and its facilities subsequently were assigned one of four risk-based tiers ranging from high (Tier 1) to low (Tier 4) risk, or not tiered at all due to low risk.  To date, four of its facilities have been given a Tier 4 rating.  Facilities receiving a Tier 4 rating are required to complete Site Security Plans and possible physical security enhancements.  We do not expect the Site Security Plans and possible security enhancement costs to have a material impact on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows.



Pipeline Security- The United States Department of Homeland Security’s Transportation Security Administration and the DOT have completed a review and inspection of ONEOK Partners’ “critical facilities” and identified no material security issues.  Also, the Transportation Security Administration has released new pipeline security guidelines that include broader definitions for the determination of pipeline “critical facilities.”  ONEOK Partners has reviewed its pipeline facilities according to the new guideline requirements, and there have been no material changes required to date.











Environmental Footprint- ONEOK Partners’ environmental and climate change strategy focuses on minimizing the impact of its operations on the environment.  These strategies include:  (i) developing and maintaining an accurate GHG emissions inventory according to current rules issued by the EPA; (ii) improving the efficiency of its various pipelines, natural gas processing facilities and natural gas liquids fractionation facilities; (iii) following developing technologies for emissions control and the capture of carbon dioxide to keep it from reaching the atmosphere; and (iv) utilizing practices to reduce the loss of methane from its facilities.



ONEOK Partners participates in the EPA’s Natural Gas STAR Program to reduce voluntarily methane emissions.  ONEOK Partners continues to focus on maintaining low rates of lost-and-unaccounted-for methane gas through expanded implementation of best practices to limit the release of natural gas during pipeline and facility maintenance and operations.
