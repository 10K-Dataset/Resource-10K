ITEM 1.Business.



OVERVIEW



We are a diversified, multi-line healthcare enterprise that provides programs and services to government sponsored healthcare programs, focusing on under-insured and uninsured individuals.  We provide member-focused services through locally based staff by assisting in accessing care, coordinating referrals to related health and social services and addressing member concerns and questions.  We also provide education and outreach programs to inform and assist members in accessing quality, appropriate healthcare services.  We believe our local approach, including member and provider services, enables us to provide accessible, quality, culturally-sensitive healthcare coverage to our communities.  Our health management, educational and other initiatives are designed to help members best utilize the healthcare system to ensure they receive appropriate, medically necessary services and effective management of routine, severe and chronic health problems, resulting in better health outcomes.  We combine our decentralized local approach for care with a centralized infrastructure of support functions such as finance, information systems and claims processing.



We operate in two segments: Managed Care and Specialty Services.  Our Managed Care segment provides health plan coverage to individuals through government subsidized programs, including Medicaid, the State Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP), Long Term Care (LTC), Foster Care, dual-eligible individuals in Medicare Special Needs Plans and the Supplemental Security Income Program, also known as the Aged, Blind or Disabled Program, or collectively ABD.  Beginning in 2014, our Managed Care segment also provides health plan coverage to individuals covered through federally-facilitated and state-based Marketplaces.  Our Specialty Services segment consists of our specialty companies offering diversified healthcare services and products to state programs, correctional facilities, healthcare organizations, employer groups and other commercial organizations, as well as to our own subsidiaries.  As ofDecember 31, 2013, Medicaid accounted for75%of our at-risk membership, while CHIP (also including Foster Care) and ABD (also including Medicare) accounted for10%and11%, respectively.  Hybrid programs, LTC and correctional services represent the remaining4%at-risk membership.



Our subsidiary, Kentucky Spirit Health Plan (KSHP), ceased serving Medicaid members in Kentucky as of July 6, 2013.  Accordingly, the results of operations for KSHP are classified as discontinued operations for all periods presented in our consolidated financial statements.  The following discussion and analysis, with the exception of cash flow information, is presented in the context of continuing operations unless otherwise identified.



Our at-risk managed care membership totaled2.7 millionas ofDecember 31, 2013.  For the year endedDecember 31, 2013, our premium and service revenues and net earnings from continuing operations attributable to Centene were$10.5 billionand$161.2 million, respectively, and our total cash flow from operations was$382.5 million.



Our initial health plan commenced operations in Wisconsin in 1984.  We were organized in Wisconsin in 1993 as a holding company for our initial health plan and reincorporated in Delaware in 2001.  Our corporate office is located at 7700 Forsyth Boulevard, St. Louis, Missouri 63105, and our telephone number is (314) 725-4477.  Our stock is publicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol “CNC.”



INDUSTRY



We provide our services primarily through Medicaid, CHIP, LTC, Foster Care, ABD, Medicare and other state and federal programs for the uninsured.  The federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, estimated the total Medicaid and CHIP market was approximately $408 billion in 2011, and estimate the market will grow to $839 billion by 2022.  According to the most recent information provided by the Kaiser Commission on Medicaid and the Uninsured, Medicaid spending increased by 3.8% in fiscal2013and states appropriated an increase of 10.3% for Medicaid in fiscal2014budgets.



Established in 1965, Medicaid is the largest publicly funded program in the United States, and provides health insurance to low-income families and individuals with disabilities.  Authorized by Title XIX of the Social Security Act, Medicaid is an entitlement program funded jointly by the federal and state governments and administered by the states.  The majority of funding is provided at the federal level.  Each state establishes its own eligibility standards, benefit packages, payment rates and program administration within federal standards.  As a result, there are 56 Medicaid programs - one for each U.S. state, each U.S. territory and the District of Columbia.  Eligibility is based on a combination of household income and assets, often determined by an income level relative to the federal poverty level.  Historically, children have represented the largest eligibility group. Many states have selected Medicaid managed care as a means of delivering quality healthcare and controlling costs.  We refer to these states as mandated managed care states.











Established in 1972, and authorized by Title XVI of the Social Security Act, ABD covers low-income persons with chronic physical disabilities or behavioral health impairments.  ABD beneficiaries represent a growing portion of all Medicaid recipients.  In addition, ABD recipients typically utilize more services because of their critical health issues.



The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 created CHIP to help states expand coverage primarily to children whose families earned too much to qualify for Medicaid, yet not enough to afford private health insurance.  Some states include the parents of these children in their CHIP programs.  Costs related to the largest eligibility group, children, are primarily composed of pediatrics and family care.  These costs tend to be more predictable than those associated with other healthcare issues which predominantly affect the adult population.



A portion of Medicaid beneficiaries are dual-eligible, low-income seniors and people with disabilities who are enrolled in both Medicaid and Medicare.  According to the Kaiser Commission on Medicaid and the Uninsured, there were approximately 9 million dual-eligible enrollees in2013.  These dual-eligible members may receive assistance from Medicaid for Medicaid benefits, such as nursing home care and/or assistance with Medicare premiums and cost sharing.  Dual-eligibles also use more services due to their tendency to have more chronic health issues.  We serve dual-eligibles through our ABD and LTC programs and through Medicare Special Needs Plans.



While Medicaid programs have directed funds to many individuals who cannot afford or otherwise maintain health insurance coverage, they did not initially address the inefficient and costly manner in which the Medicaid population tends to access healthcare.  Medicaid recipients in non-managed care programs typically have not sought preventive care or routine treatment for chronic conditions, such as asthma and diabetes.  Rather, they have sought healthcare in hospital emergency rooms, which tends to be more expensive.  As a result, many states have found that the costs of providing Medicaid benefits have increased while the medical outcomes for the recipients remained unsatisfactory.



We expect that continued pressure on state Medicaid budgets will cause public policy to recognize the value of managed care as a means of delivering improved health outcomes for Medicaid beneficiaries and effectively controlling costs.  A growing number of states have mandated that their Medicaid recipients enroll in managed care plans.  Other states are considering moving to a mandated managed care approach.  As a result, we believe a significant market opportunity exists for managed care organizations with operations and programs focused on the distinct socio-economic, cultural and healthcare needs of the uninsured population and the Medicaid, CHIP, LTC, Foster Care and ABD populations.



In March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the accompanying Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act collectively referred to as the Affordable Care Act (ACA), were enacted. While the constitutionality of the ACA was subsequently challenged in a number of legal actions, in June 2012, the Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the ACA, with one limited exception relating to the Medicaid expansion provision. The Supreme Court held that states could not be required to expand Medicaid and risk losing all federal money for their existing Medicaid programs. Under the ACA, Medicaid coverage was expanded to all individuals under age 65 with incomes up to 138% of the federal poverty level beginning January 1, 2014, subject to the states' elections.  The federal government will pay the entire costs for Medicaid coverage for newly eligible beneficiaries for 3 years, from 2014 through 2016. In 2017, the federal share declines to 95%; in 2018 it is 94%; in 2019 it is 93%; and it will be 90% in 2020 and subsequent years. States may delay Medicaid expansion after 2014.



Health Insurance Marketplaces are a key component of the ACA and provide an opportunity for individuals and small businesses to obtain health insurance.  States have the option of operating their own Marketplace or partnering with the federal government.  States choosing neither option will default to a federally-facilitated Marketplace.  Premium and cost-sharing subsidies are available to make coverage more affordable and access to Marketplaces is limited to U.S. citizens and legal immigrants.  Insurers are required to offer a minimum level of benefits with three levels of coverage that vary based on premiums and out-of-pocket costs.  Premium subsidies will be provided to families without access to other coverage and with incomes between 100-400% of the federal poverty level to help them purchase insurance through the Marketplaces. These subsidies are offered on a sliding scale basis.  In May 2013, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimated approximately 7 million individuals would enroll through Marketplaces by 2014 with the number increasing to 25 million by 2025.  However, recent reports have indicated lower than anticipated enrollment for 2014.











OUR COMPETITIVE STRENGTHS



Our multi-line managed care approach is based on the following key attributes:



•Strong Historic Operating Performance.We have increased revenues as we have grown in existing markets, expanded into new markets and broadened our product offerings.  We entered the Wisconsin market in 1984 as a single health plan and have grown to serve 20 states with at-risk membership totaling2.7 millionin2013.  For the year endedDecember 31, 2013, we had premium and service revenues from continuing operations of$10.5 billion, representing a five year Compound Annual Growth Rate, of 26.3% and generated total cash flow from operations of$382.5 million.



•Innovative Technology and Scalable Systems.The ability to access data and translate it into meaningful information is essential to operating across a multi-state service area in a cost-effective manner.  Our centralized information systems support our core processing functions under a set of integrated databases and are designed to be both replicable and scalable to accommodate organic growth and growth from acquisitions.  We continue to enhance our systems in order to leverage the platform we have developed for our existing states for configuration into new states or health plan acquisitions.  Our predictive modeling technology enables our medical management operations to proactively case and disease manage specific high risk members.  It can recommend medical care opportunities using a mix of company defined algorithms and evidence based medical guidelines.  Interventions are determined by the clinical indicators, the ability to improve health outcomes, and the risk profile of members.  Our integrated approach helps to assure that consistent sources of claim and member information are provided across all of our health plans.  Our membership and claims processing system is capable of expanding to support additional members in an efficient manner.



•Medicaid Expertise.For more than 25 years, we have developed a specialized Medicaid expertise that has helped us establish and maintain relationships with members, providers and state governments.  We have implemented programs developed to achieve savings for state governments and improve medical outcomes for members by reducing inappropriate emergency room use, inpatient days and high cost interventions, as well as by managing care of chronic illnesses.  We work with state agencies in order to maximize the effectiveness of their programs.  Our approach is to accomplish this while maintaining adequate levels of provider compensation and protecting our profitability.



•Diversified Business Lines.We continue to broaden our service offerings to address areas that we believe have been traditionally under-served by Medicaid managed care organizations.  In addition to our Medicaid and Medicaid-related managed care services, our service offerings include behavioral health, care management software, correctional services managed care, Health Insurance Marketplaces, in-home health services, individual health insurance, life and health management, managed vision, telehealth services, pharmacy benefits management and specialty pharmacy.  Through the utilization of a multi-business line approach, we are able to improve the quality of care, improve outcomes, diversify our revenues and help control our medical costs.



•Localized Approach with Centralized Support Infrastructure.We take a localized approach to managing our subsidiaries, including provider and member services.  This approach enables us to facilitate access by our members to high quality, culturally sensitive healthcare services.  Our systems and procedures have been designed to address these community-specific challenges through outreach, education, transportation and other member support activities.  For example, our community outreach programs work with our members and their communities to promote health and self-improvement through employment and education on how best to access care.  We complement this localized approach with a centralized infrastructure of support functions such as finance, information systems and claims processing, which allows us to minimize general and administrative expenses and to integrate and realize synergies from acquisitions.  We believe this combined approach allows us to efficiently integrate new business opportunities in both Medicaid and specialty services while maintaining our local accountability and improved access.











OUR BUSINESS STRATEGY



Our objective is to become the leading multi-line healthcare enterprise focusing on the uninsured and under-insured population through government sponsored healthcare initiatives.  We intend to achieve this objective by implementing the following key components of our strategy:





•Increase Penetration of Existing State Markets.We seek to continue to increase our Medicaid membership in states in which we currently operate through alliances with key providers, outreach efforts, development and implementation of community-specific products and acquisitions.  For example, in 2013, we expanded our health plan in Florida with an expanded Medicaid managed care LTC contract.



•Diversify Business Lines.We seek to broaden our business lines into areas that complement our existing business to enable us to grow and diversify our revenue.  We are constantly evaluating new opportunities for expansion both domestically and abroad.  For instance, in 2013, we began operating through a joint venture subsidiary, Centurion, to provide managed care in correctional facilities and also acquired AcariaHealth, an independent, comprehensive specialty pharmacy company.  In 2014, we acquired U.S. Medical Management, a management services organization and provider of in-home health services for high acuity populations.  We employ a disciplined acquisition strategy that is based on defined criteria including internal rate of return, accretion to earnings per share, market leadership and compatibility with our information systems.  We engage our executives in the relevant operational units or functional areas to ensure consistency between the diligence and integration process.



•Address Emerging State Needs.We work to assist the states in which we operate in addressing the operating challenges they face. We seek to assist the states in balancing premium rates, benefit levels, member eligibility, policies and practices, provider compensation and minimizing fraud and abuse.  By helping states structure an appropriate level and range of Medicaid, CHIP and specialty services, we seek to ensure that we are able to continue to provide those services on terms that achieve targeted gross margins, provide an acceptable return and grow our business.



•Develop and Acquire Additional State Markets.We continue to leverage our experience to identify and develop new markets by seeking both to acquire existing business and to build our own operations. We focus expansion in states where Medicaid recipients are mandated to enroll in managed care organizations because we believe member enrollment levels are more predictable in these states.  In addition, we focus on states where managed care programs can help address states' financial needs.  For example, in 2013, we began managing care for Medicaid members in California, Kansas and New Hampshire.



•Leverage Established Infrastructure to Enhance Operating Efficiencies.  We intend to continue to invest in infrastructure to further drive efficiencies in operations and to add functionality to improve the service provided to members and other organizations at a low cost. Information technology, or IT, investments complement our overall efficiency goals by increasing the automated processing of transactions and growing the base of decision-making analytical tools.  Our centralized functions and common systems enable us to add members and markets quickly and economically.



•Maintain Operational Discipline.We seek to operate in markets that allow us to meet our internal metrics including membership growth, plan size, market leadership and operating efficiency.  We use multiple techniques to monitor and reduce our medical costs, including on-site hospital review by staff nurses and involvement of medical management in significant cases. Our executive dashboard is utilized to quickly identify cost drivers and medical trends.  Our management team regularly evaluates the financial impact of proposed changes in provider relationships, contracts, changes in membership and mix of members, potential state rate changes and cost reduction initiatives.  We may divest contracts or health plans in markets where the state's Medicaid environment, over a long term basis, does not allow us to meet our targeted performance levels.  For example, as a result of lower than anticipated financial performance, in July 2013, we terminated our Kentucky Medicaid managed care contract with the Commonwealth of Kentucky.

Substantially all of our revenue is derived from operations within the United States and its territories, and all of the Company's long lived assets are based in the United States and its territories.  We generally receive a fixed premium per member per month pursuant to our state contracts.  Our medical costs have a seasonality component due to cyclical illness, for example cold and flu season, resulting in higher medical expenses beginning in the fourth quarter and continuing throughout the first quarter of the following year.  Our managed care subsidiaries in Texas had revenues from the state government that represent 37% of our consolidated total revenues from continuing operations in2013.











MANAGED CARE



Benefits to States



Our ability to establish and maintain a leadership position in the markets we serve results primarily from our demonstrated success in providing quality care while reducing and managing costs, and from our specialized programs in working with state governments.  Among the benefits we are able to provide to the states with which we contract are:



•Significant cost savings and budget predictability compared to state paid reimbursement for services.We bring bottom-line management experience to our health plans.  On the administrative and management side, we bring experience including quality of care improvement methods, utilization management procedures, an efficient claims payment system, and provider performance reporting, as well as managers and staff experienced in using these key elements to improve the quality of and access to care.  We generally receive a contracted premium on a per member basis and are responsible for the medical costs and as a result, provide budget predictability.



•Data-driven approaches to balance cost and verify eligibility.We seek to ensure effective outreach procedures for new members, then educate them and ensure they receive needed services as quickly as possible.  Our IT department has created mapping/translation programs for loading membership and linking membership eligibility status to all of Centene's subsystems.  We utilize predictive modeling technology to proactively case and disease manage specific high risk members.  In addition, we have developed Centelligence, our enterprise data warehouse system to provide a seamless flow of data across our organization, enabling providers and case managers to access information, apply analytical insight and make informed decisions.



•Establishment of realistic and meaningful expectations for quality deliverables.We have collaborated with state agencies in redefining benefits, eligibility requirements and provider fee schedules with the goal of maximizing the number of individuals covered through Medicaid.



•Managed care expertise in government subsidized programs.Our expertise in Medicaid has helped us establish and maintain strong relationships with our constituent communities of members, providers and state governments.  We provide access to services through local providers and staff that focus on the cultural norms of their individual communities.  To that end, systems and procedures have been designed to address community-specific challenges through outreach, education, transportation and other member support activities.



•Improved quality and medical outcomes.We have implemented programs developed to improve the quality of healthcare delivered to our members including Smart Start for your Baby, Living Well With Sickle Cell and The CentAccount Program.



•Timely payment of provider claims.We are committed to ensuring that our information systems and claims payment systems meet or exceed state requirements.  We continuously endeavor to update our systems and processes to improve the timeliness of our provider payments.



•Provider outreach and programs.Our health plans have adopted a physician-driven approach where network providers are actively engaged in developing and implementing healthcare delivery policies and strategies. We prepare provider comparisons on a severity adjusted basis.  This approach is designed to eliminate unnecessary costs, improve services to members and simplify the administrative burdens placed on providers.



•Responsible collection and dissemination of utilization data.We gather utilization data from multiple sources, allowing for an integrated view of our members' utilization of services.  These sources include medical, vision and behavioral health claims and encounter data, pharmacy data, dental vendor claims and authorization data from the authorization and case management system utilized by us to coordinate care.



•Timely and accurate reporting.Our information systems have reporting capabilities which have been instrumental in identifying the need for new and/or improved healthcare and specialty programs.  For state agencies, our reporting capability is important in demonstrating an auditable program.



•Fraud and abuse prevention.We have several systems in place to help identify, detect and investigate potential waste, abuse and fraud including pre and post payment review software.  We collaborate with state and federal agencies and assist with investigation requests.  We use nationally recognized standards to benchmark our processes.











Member Programs and Services



We recognize the importance of member-focused delivery of quality managed care services.  Our locally-based staff assists members in accessing care, coordinating referrals to related health and social services and addressing member concerns and questions.  While covered healthcare benefits vary from state to state, our health plans generally provide the following services:



•primary and specialty physician care•inpatient and outpatient hospital care•emergency and urgent care•prenatal care•laboratory and x-ray services•home health and durable medical equipment•behavioral health and substance abuse services•24-hour nurse advice line•transportation assistance•vision care•dental care•immunizations•prescriptions and limited over-the-counter drugs•therapies•social work services•care coordination





We also provide the following education and outreach programs to inform, assist and incentivize members in accessing quality, appropriate healthcare services in an efficient manner.  Many of these programs have been recognized with awards for their excellence in education, outreach and/or case management techniques including Case In Point, Hermes Awards, and National Health Information Awards.



•Start Smart For Your Baby,or Smart Start,is our award winning prenatal and infant health program designed to increase the percentage of pregnant women receiving early prenatal care, reduce the incidence of low birth weight babies, identify high-risk pregnancies, increase participation in the federal Women, Infant and Children program, prevent hospital admissions in the first year of life and increase well-child visits.



•Connections Plusis a cell phone program developed for high-risk members who have limited or no access to a safe, reliable telephone.  This program seeks to eliminate lack of safe, reliable access to a telephone as a barrier to coordinating care, thus reducing avoidable adverse events such as inappropriate emergency room utilization, hospital admissions and premature birth.



•MemberConnectionsis a community face-to-face outreach and education program designed to create a link between the member and the provider and help identify potential challenges or risk elements to a member's health, such as nutritional challenges and health education shortcomings.



•Health Initiatives for Childrenis aimed at educating child members on a variety of health topics.  In order to empower and educate children, we have partnered with a nationally recognized children's author to develop our own children's book series on topics such as obesity prevention and healthy eating, asthma, diabetes, foster care, the ills of smoking, anti-bullying and heart healthy.



•Health Initiatives for Teensis aimed at empowering, educating and reinforcing life skills with our teenage members.  We have developed an educational series that addresses health issues, dealing with chronic diseases including diabetes and asthma, as well as teen pregnancy.



•Living Well with Sickle Cellis our innovative program that assists with coordination of care for our sickle cell members.  Our program ensures that sickle cell members have established a medical home and work on strategies to reduce unnecessary emergency department (ED) visits through proper treatment to control symptoms and chronic complications, as well as promote self-management.



•My Route for Healthis our adult educational series used with our case management and disease management programs. The topics of this series include how to manage asthma, COPD, diabetes, heart disease and HIV.



•Nurtur Diabetes Programis an innovative program that is a collaboration with our life and health management subsidiary, Nurtur Health, Inc., and our health plans that targets diabetic patients and educates them on their disease state.



•Community Health Record,our patient-centric electronic database, collects patient demographic data, clinician visit records, dispensed medications, vital sign history, lab results, allergy charts, and immunization data.  Providers can directly input additional or updated patient data and documentation into the database.  All information is accessible









anywhere, anytime to all authorized users, including health plan staff, greatly facilitating coordinated care among providers.



•The CentAccount Programoffers members financial incentives for performing certain healthy behaviors.  The incentives are delivered through a restricted-use prepaid debit card redeemable for health-related items only.  This incentive-based approach effectively increases the utilization of preventive services while strengthening the relationships between members and their primary care providers.



•The Asthma Management Programintegrates a hands-on approach with a flexible outreach methodology that can be customized to suit different age groups and populations affected by asthma.  Working through Nurtur, we provide proactive identification of members, stratification into appropriate levels of intervention including home visits, culturally sensitive education, and robust outcome reporting.  The program also includes aggressive care coordination to ensure patients have basic services such as transportation to the doctor, electricity to power the nebulizer, and a clean, safe home environment.



•Fluventionis an outreach program aimed at educating members on preventing the transmission of the influenza virus by encouraging members to get the seasonal influenza vaccines and take everyday precautions to prevent illness.



•Preventive Care Programsare designed to educate our members on the benefits of Early and Periodic Screening, Diagnosis and Treatment, or EPSDT, services.  We have a systematic program of communicating, tracking, outreach, reporting and follow-through that promotes state EPSDT programs.



•Life and Health ManagementProgramsare designed to help members understand their disease and treatment plans and improve their wellness in a cost effective manner.  These programs address medical conditions that are common within the Medicaid population such as asthma, diabetes and pregnancy.



Providers



For each of our service areas, we establish a provider network consisting of primary and specialty care physicians, hospitals and ancillary providers.  As ofDecember 31, 2013, we contracted with over 50,000 primary care physicians, 165,000 specialty care physicians and 2,000 hospitals.



Our network of primary care physicians is a critical component in care delivery, management of costs and the attraction and retention of new members.  Primary care physicians include family and general practitioners, pediatricians, internal medicine physicians and obstetricians and gynecologists.  Specialty care physicians provide medical care to members generally upon referral by the primary care physicians.  Specialty care physicians include, but are not limited to, orthopedic surgeons, cardiologists and otolaryngologists.  We also provide education and outreach programs to inform and assist members in accessing quality, appropriate healthcare services.



Our health plans facilitate access to healthcare services for our members primarily through contracts with our providers.  Our contracts with primary and specialty care physicians and hospitals usually are for one to two-year periods and renew automatically for successive one-year terms, but generally are subject to termination by either party upon 90 to 120 days prior written notice.  In the absence of a contract, we typically pay providers at state Medicaid reimbursement levels.  We pay hospitals under a variety of methods, including fee-for-service, capitation arrangements, per diems, diagnostic related grouping and case rates.  We pay physicians under a fee-for-service, capitation arrangement, or risk-sharing arrangement.  In addition, we are governed by state prompt payment policies.



•Under our fee-for-service contracts with physicians, particularly specialty care physicians, we pay a negotiated fee for covered services.  This model is characterized as having no financial risk for the physician.  In addition, this model requires management oversight because our total cost may increase as the units of services increase or as more expensive services replace less expensive services.  We have prior authorization procedures in place that are intended to make sure that certain high cost diagnostic and other services are medically appropriate.



•Under our capitated contracts, primary care physicians are paid a monthly fee for each of our members assigned to his or her practice for all ambulatory care.  In return for this payment, these physicians provide all primary care and preventive services, including primary care office visits and EPSDT services, and are at risk for all costs associated with such services.  If these physicians also provide non-capitated services to their assigned members, they may receive payment under fee-for-service arrangements at standard Medicaid rates.











•Under risk-sharing arrangements, physicians are paid under a capitated or fee-for-service arrangement.  The arrangement, however, contains provisions for additional bonus to the physicians or reimbursement from the physicians based upon cost and quality measures.



We work with physicians to help them operate efficiently by providing financial and utilization information, physician and patient educational programs and disease and medical management programs.  Our programs are also designed to help the physicians coordinate care outside of their offices.



We believe our collaborative approach with physicians gives us a competitive advantage in entering new markets.  Our physicians serve on local committees that assist us in implementing preventive care programs, managing costs and improving the overall quality of care delivered to our members, while also simplifying the administrative burdens on our providers.  This approach has enabled us to strengthen our provider networks through improved physician recruitment and retention that, in turn, have helped to increase our membership base.  The following are among the services we provide to support physicians:



•Customized Utilization Reportsprovide certain of our contracted physicians with information that enables them to run their practices more efficiently and focuses them on specific patient needs.  For example, quarterly detail reports update physicians on their status within their risk pools.  Equivalency reports provide physicians with financial comparisons of capitated versus fee-for-service arrangements.



•Case Management Supporthelps the physician coordinate specialty care and ancillary services for patients with complex conditions and direct members to appropriate community resources to address both their health and socio-economic needs.



•Web-based Claims and Eligibility Resourceshave been implemented to provide physicians with on-line access to perform claims and eligibility inquiries.



Our contracted physicians also benefit from several of the services offered to our members, including the MemberConnections, EPSDT case management and health management programs.  For example, the MemberConnections staff facilitates doctor/patient relationships by connecting members with physicians, the EPSDT programs encourage routine checkups for children with their physicians and the health management programs assist physicians in managing their patients with chronic disease.



Where appropriate, our health plans contract with our specialty services organizations to provide services and programs such as behavioral health, life and health management, managed vision, telehealth services, pharmacy benefits management and specialty pharmacy.  When necessary, we also contract with third-party providers on a negotiated fee arrangement for physical therapy, home healthcare, dental, diagnostic laboratory tests, x-ray examinations, transportation, ambulance services and durable medical equipment.



Quality Management



Our medical management programs focus on improving quality of care in areas that have the greatest impact on our members.  We employ strategies, including health management and complex case management, that are adjusted for implementation in our individual markets by a system of physician committees chaired by local physician leaders.  This process promotes physician participation and support, both critical factors in the success of any clinical quality improvement program.



We have implemented specialized information systems to support our medical quality management activities.  Information is drawn from our data warehouse, clinical databases and our membership and claims processing system to identify opportunities to improve care and to track the outcomes of the interventions implemented to achieve those improvements.  Some examples of these intervention programs include:



•appropriate leveling of care for neonatal intensive care unit hospital admissions, other inpatient hospital admissions, and observation admissions, in accordance with Interqual criteria



•tightening of our pre-authorization list and more stringent review of durable medical equipment and injectibles



•emergency department, or ED, program designed to collaboratively work with hospitals to steer non-emergency care away from the costly ED setting (through patient education, on-site alternative urgent care settings, etc.)











•increase emphasis on case management and clinical rounding where case managers are nurses or social workers who are employed by the health plan to assist selected members with the coordination of healthcare services in order to meet a member's specific healthcare needs



•incorporation of disease management, which is a comprehensive, multidisciplinary, collaborative approach to chronic illnesses such as asthma and diabetes



•Start Smart For Your Baby, a prenatal case management program aimed at helping women with high-risk pregnancies deliver full-term, healthy infants



We provide reporting on a regular basis using our data warehouse.  State and Health Employer Data and Information Set, or HEDIS, reporting constitutes the core of the information base that drives our clinical quality performance efforts.  This reporting is monitored by Plan Quality Improvement Committees and our corporate medical management team.



In an effort to ensure the quality of our provider networks, we undertake to verify the credentials and background of our providers using standards that are supported by the National Committee for Quality Assurance, or NCQA.



It is our objective to provide access to the highest quality of care for our members.  As a validation of that objective, we often pursue accreditation by independent organizations that have been established to promote healthcare quality.  The NCQA Health Plan Accreditation and URAC Health Plan Accreditation programs provide unbiased, third party reviews to verify and publicly report results on specific quality care metrics.  While we have achieved or are pursuing accreditation for all of our plans, accreditation is only one measure of our ability to provide access to quality care for our members. We currently have nine health plans and three specialty companies with NCQA accreditation.



SPECIALTY SERVICES



Our specialty services are a key component of our healthcare enterprise and complement our core Managed Care business.  Specialty services diversify our revenue stream, provide higher quality health outcomes to our membership and others, and assist in controlling costs.  Our specialty services are provided primarily through the following businesses:



•Behavioral Health.Cenpatico Behavioral Health, or Cenpatico, manages behavioral healthcare for members via a contracted network of providers.  Cenpatico works with providers to determine the best services to help people overcome mental illness and lead productive lives.  Our networks feature a full range of services and levels of care to help people with mental illness reach their recovery and wellness goals.  In addition, we operate school-based programs in Arizona that focus on students with special needs and also provide speech and other therapy services.



•Correctional Services.Centurion, our joint venture subsidiary with MHM Services Inc., provides comprehensive healthcare services to individuals incarcerated in Massachusetts and Tennessee state correctional facilities.  Beginning in January 2014, Centurion also began operating under a new contract with the Minnesota Department of Corrections.

•Managed Vision.OptiCare Managed Vision, Inc., or OptiCare, administers routine and medical surgical eye care benefits via its own contracted national network of eye care providers.  OptiCare clients include Medicaid, Medicare, and commercial health plans, as well as employer groups. OptiCare has been providing vision network services for over 25 years and offers a variety of plan designs to meet the individual needs of its clients and members.



•Telehealth Services.NurseWise LP provides a toll-free nurse triage line 24 hours per day, 7 days per week, 52 weeks per year.  Our members call one number and reach bilingual customer service representatives and nursing staff who provide health education, triage advice and offer continuous access to health plan functions.  Additionally, our representatives verify eligibility, confirm primary care provider assignments and provide benefit and network referral coordination for members and providers after business hours.  Our staff can arrange for urgent pharmacy refills, transportation and qualified behavioral health professionals for crisis stabilization assessments.

In April 2013, we acquired AcariaHealth, a comprehensive specialty pharmacy company.  With this transaction, we expanded our specialized pharmacy benefit services for complex diseases, including Hepatitis C, Hemophilia, Multiple Sclerosis, Rheumatoid Arthritis and Oncology.



•Care Management Software.Casenet, LLC, or Casenet, is a software provider of innovative care management solutions that automate the clinical, administrative and technical components of care management programs.  During 2012, we acquired the remaining minority interest in Casenet and implemented this new software platform, which is available for sale to third parties and used by our health plans.



CORPORATE COMPLIANCE



Our Corporate Ethics and Compliance Program provides controls by which we assure that our values are reflected in everything we do, further enhance operations, improve access to quality care and safeguard against fraud and abuse.



The two primary standards by which corporate compliance programs in the healthcare industry are measured are the Federal Organizational Sentencing Guidelines and Compliance Program Guidance series issued by the Department of Health and Human Services' Office of the Inspector General, or OIG.  Our program contains each of the seven elements suggested by the Sentencing Guidelines and the OIG guidance.  These key components are:



•written standards of conduct

•designation of a corporate compliance officer and compliance committee

•effective training and education

•effective lines for reporting and communication

•enforcement of standards through disciplinary guidelines and actions

•internal monitoring and auditing

•prompt response to detected offenses and development of corrective action plans



The goal of the program is to build a culture of ethics and compliance, which is assessed periodically using a diagnostic survey to measure the integrity of the organization.  Our internal Corporate Compliance intranet site, accessible to all employees, contains our Business Ethics and Conduct Policy (Code of Conduct), Compliance Program description and various resources for employees to report concerns or ask questions.  If needed, employees have access to the contact information for the members of our Board of Directors' Audit Committee to report concerns.  Our Ethics and Compliance Helpline is a toll-free number and web-based reporting tool operated by a third party independent of the Company and allows employees or other persons to report suspected incidents of misconduct, fraud, abuse or other compliance violations.  Furthermore, the Board of Directors reviews an ethics and compliance report on a quarterly basis.



COMPETITION



We continue to face varying and increasing levels of competition as we expand in our existing service areas or enter new markets.  Federal regulations require at least two competitors in each service area.  Healthcare reform may cause a number of commercial managed care organizations to decide to enter or exit the Medicaid market.











In our business, our principal competitors for state contracts, members and providers consist of the following types of organizations:



•Medicaid Managed Care Organizationsfocus on providing healthcare services to Medicaid recipients.  These organizations consist of national and regional organizations, as well as not-for-profits and smaller organizations that operate in one city or state and are owned by providers, primarily hospitals.



•National and Regional Commercial Managed Care Organizationshave Medicaid members in addition to members in private commercial plans.  Some of these organizations offer a range of specialty services including pharmacy benefits management, behavioral health management, health management, and nurse triage call support centers.



•Primary Care Case Management Programsare programs established by the states through contracts with primary care providers.  Under these programs, physicians provide primary care services to Medicaid recipients, as well as limited medical management oversight.



We compete with other managed care organizations and specialty companies for state contracts.  In order to grant a contract, state governments consider many factors.  These factors include quality of care, financial requirements, an ability to deliver services and establish provider networks and infrastructure.  In addition, our specialty companies also compete with other providers, such as disease management companies, individual health insurance companies, and pharmacy benefits managers for non-governmental contracts.



We also compete to enroll new members and retain existing members.  People who wish to enroll in a managed healthcare plan or to change healthcare plans typically choose a plan based on the quality of care and services offered, ease of access to services, a specific provider being part of the network and the availability of supplemental benefits.



We also compete with other managed care organizations to enter into contracts with physicians, physician groups and other providers.  We believe the factors that providers consider in deciding whether to contract with us include existing and potential member volume, reimbursement rates, medical management programs, speed of reimbursement and administrative service capabilities.  See “Risk Factors - Competition may limit our ability to increase penetration of the markets that we serve.”



REGULATION



Our operations are regulated at both state and federal levels.  Government regulation of the provision of healthcare products and services is a changing area of law that varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction.  Regulatory agencies generally have discretion to issue regulations and interpret and enforce laws and rules.  Changes in applicable laws and rules also may occur periodically.



Our regulated subsidiaries are licensed to operate as health maintenance organizations, third party administrators, utilization review and/or insurance companies in their respective states.  In each of the jurisdictions in which we operate, we are regulated by the relevant insurance, health and/or human services departments that oversee the activities of managed care organizations providing or arranging to provide services to Medicaid, Medicare and Health Insurance Marketplace enrollees.



The process for obtaining authorization to operate as a managed care organization is complex and requires us to demonstrate to the regulators the adequacy of the health plan's organizational structure, financial resources, utilization review, quality assurance programs, complaint procedures, provider network and procedures for covering emergency medical conditions.  Under both state managed care organization statutes and insurance laws, our health plan subsidiaries, as well as our applicable specialty companies, must comply with minimum statutory capital and other financial solvency requirements, such as deposit and surplus requirements.  Insurance regulations may also require prior state approval of acquisitions of other managed care organization businesses and the payment of dividends, as well as notice for loans or the transfer of funds.  Our subsidiaries are also subject to periodic state and federal reporting requirements.  In addition, each health plan and individual health insurance provider must meet criteria to secure the approval of state regulatory authorities before implementing operational changes, including the development of new product offerings and, in some states, the expansion of service areas.



States have adopted a number of regulations that may affect our business and results of operations.  These regulations in certain states include:



•premium taxes or similar assessments

•stringent prompt payment laws









•disclosure requirements regarding provider fee schedules and coding procedures

•programs to monitor and supervise the activities and financial solvency of provider groups



We are regulated as an insurance holding company and are subject to the insurance holding company acts of the states in which our insurance company and HMO subsidiaries are domiciled. These acts contain certain reporting requirements as well as restrictions on transactions between an insurer or HMO and its affiliates. These holding company laws and regulations generally require insurance companies and HMOs within an insurance holding company system to register with the insurance department of each state where they are domiciled and to file with those states' insurance departments reports describing capital structure, ownership, financial condition, intercompany transactions and general business operations. In addition, depending on the size and nature of the transaction, there are various notice and reporting requirements that generally apply to transactions between insurance companies and HMOs and their affiliates within an insurance holding company structure. Some insurance holding company laws and regulations require prior regulatory approval or, in certain circumstances, prior notice of certain material intercompany transfers of assets as well as certain transactions between insurance companies, HMOs, their parent holding companies and affiliates. Among other provisions, state insurance and HMO laws may restrict the ability of our regulated subsidiaries to pay dividends.



Additionally, the holding company acts of the states in which our subsidiaries are domiciled restrict the ability of any person to obtain control of an insurance company or HMO without prior regulatory approval. Under those statutes, without such approval or an exemption, no person may acquire any voting security of an insurance holding company, which controls an insurance company or HMO, or merge with such a holding company, if as a result of such transaction such person would “control” the insurance holding company. “Control” is generally defined as the direct or indirect power to direct or cause the direction of the management and policies of a company and is presumed to exist if a person directly or indirectly owns or controls 10% or more of the voting securities of a company.



Our mail order pharmacies must be licensed to do business as pharmacies in the states in which they are located. Our mail order pharmacies must also register with the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration and individual state controlled substance authorities to dispense controlled substances.  In many of the states where our mail order pharmacies deliver pharmaceuticals, there are laws and regulations that require out-of-state mail order pharmacies to register with that state’s board of pharmacy or similar regulatory body.  These states generally permit the pharmacy to follow the laws of the state in which the mail order pharmacy is located, although some states require that we also comply with certain laws in that state.



State Contracts



In addition to being a licensed insurance company or health maintenance organization, in order to be a Medicaid managed care organization in each of the states in which we operate, we must operate under a contract with the state's Medicaid agency.  States generally use either a formal proposal process, reviewing a number of bidders, or award individual contracts to qualified applicants that apply for entry to the program.  We receive monthly payments based on specified capitation rates determined on an actuarial basis.  These rates differ by membership category and by state depending on the specific benefits and policies adopted by each state.



Our state contracts and the regulatory provisions applicable to us generally set forth the requirements for operating in the Medicaid sector, including provisions relating to:



•eligibility, enrollment and dis-enrollment processes•covered services•eligible providers•subcontractors•record-keeping and record retention•periodic financial and informational reporting•quality assurance•accreditation•health education and wellness and prevention programs•timeliness of claims payment•financial standards•safeguarding of member information•fraud and abuse detection and reporting•grievance procedures•organization and administrative systems





A health plan or individual health insurance provider's compliance with these requirements is subject to monitoring by state regulators and by CMS.  A health plan is also subject to periodic comprehensive quality assurance evaluations by a third-party reviewing organization and generally by the insurance department of the jurisdiction that licenses the health plan.  A health plan or individual health insurance provider must also submit reports to various regulatory agencies, including quarterly and annual statutory financial statements and utilization reports.

Marketplace Contracts



Beginning in 2014, we began operating under federally facilitated Marketplace contracts with CMS in seven states: Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Indiana, Mississippi, Ohio and Texas.  These contracts expire annually and are renewable upon mutual consent.



In 2014, we also began operating under two state based Marketplaces in Massachusetts and Washington that expire annually.  The Massachusetts contract may be extended for up to two additional one-year terms.  The Washington contract is renewable annually through the state's recertification process.



In addition, we began operating under a contract with the Arkansas division of Medical Services and the Arkansas Insurance Department to participate in the Medicaid expansion model that Arkansas has adopted (referred to as the "private option") in January 2014.  This contract expires December 31, 2014 and may be extended for subsequent and consecutive one year terms.



HIPAA Omnibus Rule and HITECH





The Privacy and Security Rules and HITECH/Omnibus enhancements establish requirements to protect the privacy of medical records and safeguard personal health information maintained and used by healthcare providers, health plans, healthcare clearinghouses, and their business associates.



The Security Rule requires healthcare providers, health plans, healthcare clearinghouses, and their business associates to implement administrative, physical and technical safeguards to ensure the privacy and confidentiality of health information when it is electronically stored, maintained or transmitted.  The HITECH Act and Omnibus Rule established a federal requirement for notification when the security of protected health information is breached.  In addition, there are state laws that have been adopted to provide for, among other things, private rights of action for breaches of data security and mandatory notification to persons whose identifiable information is obtained without authorization.



The requirements of the Transactions Standards apply to certain healthcare related transactions conducted using “electronic media.” Since “electronic media” is defined broadly to include “transmissions that are physically moved from one location to another using magnetic tape, disk or compact disk media,” many communications are considered to be electronically transmitted.  Under HIPAA, health plans are required to have the capacity to accept and send all covered transactions in a standardized electronic format.  Penalties can be imposed for failure to comply with these requirements.  The transaction standards have been modified to version 5010 to prepare for the implementation of the ICD-10 coding system.  We are planning for an expected transition to ICD-10 in October 2014.



We have implemented processes, policies and procedures to comply with  HIPAA, HITECH and the Omnibus Rule, including administrative, technical and physical safeguards to prevent against electronic data breach.  We provide education and training for employees specifically designed to help prevent any unauthorized use or access to health information and enhance the reporting of suspected breaches.  In addition, our corporate privacy officer and health plan privacy officials handle privacy complaints and serve as resources to employees to address questions or concerns they may have.











Other Fraud and Abuse Laws



Investigating and prosecuting healthcare fraud and abuse continues to be a top priority for state and federal law enforcement entities.  The focus of these efforts has been directed at participants in public government healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid.  The laws and regulations relating to fraud and abuse and the contractual requirements applicable to health plans participating in these programs are complex and regularly changing and compliance with them may require substantial resources.  We are constantly looking for ways to improve our waste, fraud and abuse detection methods.  While we have both prospective and retrospective processes to identify abusive patterns and fraudulent billing, we continue to increase our capabilities to proactively detect inappropriate billing prior to payment.



EMPLOYEES



As ofDecember 31, 2013, we had approximately8,800employees.  None of our employees are represented by a union.  We believe our relationships with our employees are positive.
