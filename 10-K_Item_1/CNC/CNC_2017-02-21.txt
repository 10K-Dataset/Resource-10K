ITEM 1.Business



OVERVIEW



We are a diversified, multi-national healthcare enterprise that provides a portfolio of services to government sponsored healthcare programs, focusing on under-insured and uninsured individuals. We provide member-focused services through locally based staff by assisting in accessing care, coordinating referrals to related health and social services and addressing member concerns and questions. We also provide education and outreach programs to inform and assist members in accessing quality, appropriate healthcare services. We believe our local approach, including member and provider services, enables us to provide accessible, quality, culturally-sensitive healthcare coverage to our communities. Our health management, educational and other initiatives are designed to help members best utilize the healthcare system to ensure they receive appropriate, medically necessary services and effective management of routine, severe and chronic health problems, resulting in better health outcomes. We combine our decentralized local approach for care with a centralized infrastructure of support functions such as finance, information systems and claims processing.



On March 24, 2016, we acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of Health Net, Inc. (Health Net) a publicly traded managed care organization that delivers healthcare services through health plans and government-sponsored managed care plans. The transaction was valued at approximately$5,990 million, including the assumption of$703 millionof outstanding debt. The acquisition allows us to offer a more comprehensive and scalable portfolio of solutions and provides opportunity for additional growth across the combined company's markets.

INDUSTRY



We provide a full spectrum of managed healthcare products and services, primarily through Medicaid, which includes CHIP, LTC, Foster Care, Duals, and ABD, Medicare, Health Insurance Marketplace, TRICARE, and other state and federal programs, including programs for the uninsured. We also offer a variety of individual, small group, and large group commercial health care products, both to employers and directly to members.



Medicaid



Established in 1965, Medicaid is the largest publicly funded program in the United States, and provides health insurance to low-income families and individuals with disabilities. Authorized by Title XIX of the Social Security Act, Medicaid is an entitlement program funded jointly by the federal and state governments and administered by the states. The majority of funding is provided at the federal level. Each state establishes its own eligibility standards, benefit packages, payment rates and program administration within federal standards. As a result, there are 56 Medicaid programs - one for each U.S. state, each U.S. territory and the District of Columbia. Eligibility is based on a combination of household income and assets, often determined by an income level relative to the federal poverty level. Historically, children have represented the largest eligibility group. Many states have selected Medicaid managed care as a means of delivering quality healthcare and controlling costs. We refer to these states as mandated managed care states.



Established in 1972, and authorized by Title XVI of the Social Security Act of 1935, as amended, ABD covers low-income persons with chronic physical disabilities or behavioral health impairments. ABD beneficiaries represent a growing portion of all Medicaid recipients. In addition, ABD recipients typically utilize more services because of their critical health issues.



The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 created CHIP to help states expand coverage primarily to children whose families earned too much to qualify for Medicaid, yet not enough to afford private health insurance. Some states include the parents of these children in their CHIP programs. Costs related to the largest eligibility group, children, are primarily composed of pediatrics and family care. These costs tend to be more predictable than those associated with other healthcare issues which predominantly affect the adult population.



CMS estimated the total Medicaid market was approximately $545 billion in 2015, and estimate the market will grow to $973 billion by 2025. Medicaid spending increased by 9.7% in 2015 and is projected to increase at an average annual rate of 5.9% between 2016 and 2025.



LTC is a Medicaid product that covers Institutional/Residential Care (Nursing Facilities, Intermediate Care Facilities) and Home and Community Based Services (HCBS) for beneficiaries requiring assistance with their activities of daily living, such as bathing, dressing and transferring. The most common HCBS services include personal care, adult day care, non-emergent transportation, home-delivered meals and personal emergency response systems. LTC services are provided for individuals requiring nursing home level of care, receiving waiver services, or who are entitled to state Medicaid LTC benefits. The largest group receiving LTC, by spending, are older individuals and individuals with physical disabilities ($93 billion in 2014), followed by individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities ($42 billion in 2014), those with serious mental illness and/or serious emotional disturbance ($9 billion in 2014) and other populations ($8 billion in 2014). States are increasingly turning to managed care as a solution to provide coordinated, holistic care to their LTC beneficiaries. According to the National Association of States United for Aging and Disabilities, 22 states utilize some form of LTC up from eight in 2004.



While Medicaid programs have directed funds to many individuals who cannot afford or otherwise maintain health insurance coverage, they did not initially address the inefficient and costly manner in which the Medicaid population tends to access healthcare. Medicaid recipients in non-managed care programs typically have not sought preventive care or routine treatment for chronic conditions, such as asthma and diabetes. Rather, they have sought healthcare in hospital emergency rooms, which tends to be more expensive. As a result, many states have found that the costs of providing Medicaid benefits have increased while the medical outcomes for the recipients remained unsatisfactory.



We believe recognition of the value of managed care as a means of delivering improved health outcomes for Medicaid beneficiaries and effectively controlling costs will continue to strengthen. A growing number of states have mandated that their Medicaid recipients enroll in managed care plans. Other states are considering moving to a mandated managed care approach. As a result, we believe a significant market opportunity exists for managed care organizations with operations and programs focused on the distinct socio-economic, cultural and healthcare needs of the uninsured population and the Medicaid, CHIP, LTC, Foster Care and ABD populations.












Medicare





We contract with CMS under the Medicare Advantage program to provide Medicare Advantage products directly to Medicare beneficiaries as well as through employer and union groups. We provide or arrange health care benefits for services normally covered by Medicare, plus a broad range of health care benefits for services not covered by traditional Medicare, usually in exchange for a fixed monthly premium per member from CMS that varies based upon the county in which the member resides, demographic factors of the member such as age, gender and institutionalized status, and the health status of the member. Any benefits that are not covered by Medicare may result in an additional monthly premium charged to the enrollee or through portions of payments received from CMS that may be allocated to these benefits, according to CMS regulations and guidance. Many of our Medicare Advantage members pay no monthly premium to us for these additional benefits.



We provide a wide range of Medicare products, including Medicare Advantage plans with and without prescription drug coverage and Medicare supplement products that supplement traditional fee-for-service Medicare coverage. Our subsidiaries have a number of contracts with CMS under the Medicare Advantage program authorized under Title XVIII of the Social Security Act of 1935, as amended.



A portion of Medicaid beneficiaries are dual-eligible, low-income seniors and people with disabilities who are enrolled in both Medicaid and Medicare. According to CMS, there were approximately 10.4 million dual-eligible enrollees in2016. These dual-eligible members may receive assistance from Medicaid for benefits, such as nursing home care, HCBS, and/or assistance with Medicare premiums and cost sharing. Dual-eligibles also use more services due to their tendency to have more chronic health issues. We serve dual-eligibles through our ABD, LTC, Medicare-Medicaid Plan (MMP) and Medicare Advantage Dual Special Needs Plan lines of business.



CMS developed the Medicare Advantage Star Ratings system to help consumers choose among competing plans, awarding between 1.0 and 5.0 stars to Medicare Advantage plans based on performance in certain measures of quality. The Star Ratings are used by CMS to award quality bonus payments to Medicare Advantage plans. Beginning with the 2014 Star Rating (calculated in 2013), Medicare Advantage plans were required to achieve a minimum of 4.0 Stars to qualify for a quality bonus payment in 2016. The methodology and measures included in the Star Ratings system can be modified by CMS annually and Star Ratings thresholds are based on performance of Medicare Advantage plans nationally.



CMS estimated the total Medicare market was approximately $646 billion in 2015, and estimate the market will grow to $1.3 trillion by 2025. Medicare spending increased 4.5% in fiscal 2015 and is projected to increase at an average annual rate of 7.1% between 2016 and 2025.



Commercial



W












In 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the accompanying Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act collectively referred to as the Affordable Care Act (ACA), were enacted. While the constitutionality of the ACA was subsequently challenged in a number of legal actions, in June 2012, the Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the ACA, with one limited exception relating to the Medicaid expansion provision (Medicaid Expansion). The Supreme Court held that states could not be required to expand Medicaid and risk losing all federal money for their existing Medicaid programs. Under the ACA, Medicaid coverage was expanded to all individuals under age 65 with incomes up to 138% of the federal poverty level beginning January 1, 2014, subject to the states' elections. The federal government will pay the entire costs for Medicaid Expansion coverage for newly eligible beneficiaries from 2014 through 2016. Assuming that the current program remains in effect unchanged, in 2017 the federal share is scheduled to decline to 95%; in 2018 it would be 94%; in 2019 it would be 93%; and it would be 90% in 2020 and subsequent years.



Health Insurance Marketplaces are a key component of the ACA and provide an opportunity for individuals and small businesses to obtain health insurance. States have the option of operating their own Marketplace or partnering with the federal government. States choosing neither option currently default to a federally-facilitated Marketplace. Premium and cost-sharing subsidies are available to make coverage more affordable and access to Marketplaces is limited to U.S. citizens and legal immigrants. Insurers are required to offer a minimum level of benefits with three levels of coverage that vary based on premiums and out-of-pocket costs. Premium subsidies are provided to families without access to other coverage and with incomes between 100-400% of the federal poverty level to help them purchase insurance through the Marketplaces. These subsidies are offered on a sliding scale basis.












OUR COMPETITIVE STRENGTHS



Our approach is based on the following key attributes:



•Strong Historic Operating Performance.We have increased revenues as we have grown in existing markets, expanded into new markets and broadened our product offerings. We entered the Wisconsin market in 1984 as a single health plan and have grown to serve 29 states. Our operating performance has been demonstrated by the following:

20162015% Change2015 - 2016Total membership (in millions)11.45.1124%Total revenues ($ in billions)$40.6$22.878%Net earnings from continuing operations attributable to Centene Corporation ($ in millions)$559$35657%Diluted earnings per share (EPS)$3.41$2.8918%Adjusted Diluted EPS$4.43$3.1441%Adjusted EBITDA$1,804$92196%



For the year endedDecember 31, 2016, total revenues of$40.6 billionproduced a five year Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 51%.



•Innovative Technology and Scalable Systems.The ability to access data and translate it into meaningful information is essential to operating across a multi-state service area in a cost-effective manner. Our centralized information systems support our core processing functions under a set of integrated databases and are designed to be both replicable and scalable to accommodate organic growth and growth from acquisitions. We continue to enhance our systems in order to leverage the platform we have developed for our existing states for configuration into new states or health plan acquisitions. We believe our predictive modeling technology enables our medical management operations to proactively case and disease manage specific high risk members. It can recommend medical care opportunities using a mix of company defined algorithms and evidence based medical guidelines. Interventions are determined by the clinical indicators, the ability to improve health outcomes, and the risk profile of members. We believe our integrated approach helps to assure that consistent sources of claim and member information are provided across all of our health plans. Our membership and claims processing system is capable of expanding to support additional members in an efficient manner.



•Expertise in Government Sponsored Programs.For more than 30 years, we have developed a specialized government services expertise that has helped us establish and maintain relationships with members, providers and state governments. We have implemented programs developed to achieve savings for state governments and improve medical outcomes for members by reducing inappropriate emergency room use, inpatient days and high cost interventions, as well as by managing care of chronic illnesses. We work with state agencies in order to maximize the effectiveness of their programs. Our approach is to accomplish this while maintaining adequate levels of provider compensation and protecting our profitability.



•Diversified Business Lines.We continue to broaden our service offerings to address areas that we believe have been traditionally under-served by Medicaid managed care organizations. In addition to our Medicaid and Medicaid-related managed care services, our service offerings include behavioral health management, care management software, correctional healthcare services, dental benefits management, Commercial, in-home health services, life and health management, managed vision, pharmacy benefits management, specialty pharmacy and telehealth services. With the acquisition of Health Net, we further broadened our service offerings in 2016, which added government-sponsored care under its federal contracts with the Department of Defense and the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), as well as Medicare Advantage. Through the utilization of a multi-business line approach, we are able to improve the quality of care, improve outcomes, diversify our revenues and help control our medical costs.












•Localized Approach with Centralized Support Infrastructure.We take a localized approach to managing our subsidiaries, including provider and member services. This approach enables us to facilitate access by our members to high quality, culturally sensitive healthcare services. Our systems and procedures have been designed to address these community-specific challenges through outreach, education, transportation and other member support activities. For example, our community outreach programs work with our members and their communities to promote health and self-improvement through education on how best to access care. We complement this localized approach with a centralized infrastructure of support functions such as finance, information systems and claims processing, which allows us to minimize selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses and to integrate and realize synergies from acquisitions. We believe this combined approach allows us to efficiently integrate new business opportunities in both Medicaid and specialty services while maintaining our local accountability and improved access.



•Quality and Innovation.Our innovative medical management programs focus on improving quality of care in areas that have the greatest impact on our members. We concentrate on serving the whole person to impact outcomes and costs. We recognize the importance of member-focused delivery of quality managed care services and have developed award winning education and outreach programs including the CentAccount program, Start Smart For Your Baby, and MemberConnections.



OUR BUSINESS STRATEGY



Key components of our current business strategy include:



•Increase Penetration of Existing State Markets.We seek to continue to increase our Medicaid and Medicare membership in states in which we currently operate through alliances with key providers, outreach efforts, development and implementation of community-specific products and acquisitions. For example, in 2016, we began serving the STAR Kids Medicaid population in seven delivery areas in Texas. In 2017, we expect to expand our Medicare Advantage footprint into four of our existing states.



•Diversify Business Lines.We seek to broaden our business lines into areas that complement our existing business to enable us to grow and diversify our revenue. In 2016, we served managed care members in 24 states through over 250 product solutions. We are constantly evaluating new opportunities for expansion both domestically and abroad. For example, in 2016, we acquired Health Net, which broadened our service offerings and added government-sponsored care. We employ a disciplined acquisition strategy that is based on defined criteria including internal rate of return, accretion to earnings per share, market leadership and compatibility with our information systems. We engage our executives in the relevant operational units or functional areas to ensure consistency between the diligence and integration process.



•Address Emerging State Needs.We work to assist the states in which we operate in addressing the operating challenges they face. We seek to assist the states in balancing premium rates, benefit levels, member eligibility, policies and practices, provider compensation and minimizing fraud, waste, and abuse. By helping states structure appropriate programs to cover a wide range of populations including Medicaid, CHIP, LTC, ABD, IDD, and specialty services, among others. We seek to ensure that we are able to continue to provide those services on terms that achieve targeted gross margins, provide an acceptable return and grow our business.



•Develop and Acquire Additional Markets.We continue to leverage our experience to identify and develop new domestic and international markets by seeking both to acquire existing business and to build our own operations. Domestically, we focus expansion in states where Medicaid recipients are mandated to enroll in managed care organizations because we believe member enrollment levels are more predictable in these states. In addition, we provide solutions to states looking to deliver the highest quality of care within their budgetary constraints. In 2014, we entered the international market with our investment in Ribera Salud, S.A. (Ribera Salud), a Spanish health management group. In 2015, we began managing care for Medicaid members in Oregon and also began managing care for members who are dually eligible for Medicare and Medicaid in Michigan. In 2016, we increased our ownership interest to 75% in The Practice (Group) Limited (TPG), one of the largest provider networks for NHS England.












•Leverage Established Infrastructure to Enhance Operating Efficiencies. We intend to continue to invest in infrastructure to further drive efficiencies in operations and to add functionality to improve the service provided to members and other organizations at a low cost. Information technology, or IT, investments complement our overall efficiency goals by increasing the automated processing of transactions and growing the base of decision-making analytical tools. We believe that our centralized functions and common systems enable us to add members and markets quickly and economically.



•Maintain Operational Discipline.We seek to operate in markets that allow us to meet our internal metrics including membership growth, plan size, market leadership and operating efficiency. We use multiple techniques to monitor and reduce our medical costs, including on-site hospital review by staff nurses and involvement of medical management in significant cases. Our executive dashboard is utilized to quickly identify cost drivers and medical trends. Our management team regularly evaluates the financial impact of proposed changes in provider relationships, contracts, changes in membership and mix of members, potential state rate changes and cost reduction initiatives. We may divest contracts or health plans in markets where the environment, over a long term basis, does not allow us to meet our targeted performance levels.  For example, due to under performance, we exited the Arizona individual PPO business, effective January 1, 2017. In addition, in 2016, we took various rate and product design actions for 2017 to address issues and improve profitability in connection with certain lines of business acquired with the Health Net acquisition.



We have subsidiaries offering healthcare services in each state we serve. The table below provides summary data for the state markets we currently serve:

Substantially all of our revenue is derived from operations within the United States and its territories, and all of the Company's long lived assets are based in the United States and its territories. We generally receive a fixed premium per member per month pursuant to our state contracts. Our medical costs have a seasonality component due to cyclical illness, for example cold and flu season, resulting in higher medical expenses beginning in the fourth quarter and continuing throughout the first quarter of the following year. Our managed care subsidiaries in California and Texas had revenues from their respective state governments that each exceeded 10% of our consolidated total revenues in2016. In addition, the federal government is a significant customer to our Specialty Services segment due to our Federal Services business.












MANAGED CARE



Benefits to Customers



We feel that our ability to establish and maintain a leadership position in the markets we serve results primarily from our demonstrated success in providing quality care while reducing and managing costs, and from our specialized programs in working with state governments. Among the benefits we are able to provide to the states with which we contract are:



•Significant cost savings and budget predictability compared to state paid reimbursement for services.We bring experience relating to quality of care improvement methods, utilization management procedures, an efficient claims payment system, and provider performance reporting, as well as managers and staff experienced in using these key elements to improve the quality of and access to care. We generally receive a contracted premium on a per member basis and are responsible for the medical costs and as a result, provide budget predictability.



•Data-driven approaches to balance cost and verify eligibility.We seek to ensure effective outreach procedures for new members, then educate them and ensure they receive needed services as quickly as possible. Our IT department has created mapping/translation programs for loading membership and linking membership eligibility status to all of Centene's subsystems. We utilize predictive modeling technology to proactively case and disease manage specific high risk members. In addition, we have developed Centelligence, our enterprise data warehouse system to provide a seamless flow of data across our organization, enabling providers and case managers to access information, apply analytical insight and make informed decisions.



•Establishment of realistic and meaningful expectations for quality deliverables.We have collaborated with state agencies in redefining benefits, eligibility requirements and provider fee schedules with the goal of maximizing the number of individuals covered through Medicaid.



•Managed care expertise in government subsidized programs.Our expertise in Medicaid has helped us establish and maintain strong relationships with our constituent communities of members, providers and state governments. We provide access to services through local providers and staff that focus on the cultural norms of their individual communities. To that end, systems and procedures have been designed to address community-specific challenges through outreach, education, transportation and other member support activities.



•Improved quality and medical outcomes.We have implemented programs to enhance the ability of providers to improve the quality of healthcare delivered to our members including Start Smart for your Baby, Living Well With Sickle Cell and The CentAccount Program.



•Timely payment of provider claims.We are committed to ensuring that our information systems and claims payment systems meet or exceed state requirements. We continuously endeavor to update our systems and processes to improve the timeliness of our provider payments.



•Provider outreach and programs.Our health plans have adopted a physician-driven approach where network providers are actively engaged in developing and implementing healthcare delivery policies and strategies. We prepare provider comparisons on a severity adjusted basis. This approach is designed to eliminate unnecessary costs, improve services to members and simplify the administrative burdens placed on providers.



•Care management for complex populations.Through our experience with Medicaid populations and long-time presence in states with experience in long term care for children and adolescents in the foster care system, we have developed care management, service coordination and crisis prevention/response programs that increase opportunities for successful outcomes for members. This experience has led to partnerships with specialized networks and community advocates as states transition to managed care programs for vulnerable and complex populations.



•Responsible collection and dissemination of utilization data.We gather utilization data from multiple sources, allowing for an integrated view of our members' utilization of services. These sources include medical, vision and behavioral health claims and encounter data, pharmacy data, dental vendor claims and authorization data from the authorization and case management system utilized by us to coordinate care.



•Timely and accurate reporting.Our information systems have reporting capabilities which have been instrumental in identifying the need for new and/or improved healthcare and specialty programs. For state agencies, our reporting capability is important in demonstrating an auditable program.












•Fraud, waste and abuse prevention.We have several systems in place to help identify, detect and investigate potential waste, abuse and fraud including pre and post payment review software.  We collaborate with state and federal agencies and assist with investigation requests. We use nationally recognized standards to benchmark our processes.



Member Programs and Services



We recognize the importance of member-focused delivery of quality managed care services. Our locally-based staff assists members in accessing care, coordinating referrals to related health and social services and addressing member concerns and questions.

Providers



For each of our service areas, we establish a provider network consisting of primary and specialty care physicians, hospitals and ancillary providers. Our network of primary care physicians is a critical component in care delivery, management of costs and the attraction and retention of new members. Primary care physicians include family and general practitioners, pediatricians, internal medicine physicians and obstetricians and gynecologists. Specialty care physicians provide medical care to members generally upon referral by the primary care physicians. Specialty care physicians include, but are not limited to, orthopedic surgeons, cardiologists and otolaryngologists. We also provide education and outreach programs to inform and assist members in accessing quality, appropriate healthcare services.



Our health plans facilitate access to healthcare services for our members primarily through contracts with our providers. Our contracts with primary and specialty care physicians and hospitals usually are for one to two-year periods and renew automatically for successive one-year terms, but generally are subject to termination by either party upon 90 to 120 days prior written notice. In the absence of a contract, we typically pay providers at applicable state or federal reimbursement levels, depending on the product timeline (e.g., Medicaid or Medicare). We pay providers under a variety of methods, including fee-for-service, capitation arrangements, or risk-sharing performance-based arrangements.



•Under our fee-for-service contracts with providers, we pay a negotiated fee for covered services. This model is characterized as having no financial risk for the provider.



•Under our capitated contracts, providers can be paid a set amount for their services as outlined in their respective provider agreements. A provider group's financial instability or failure to pay secondary providers for services rendered could lead secondary providers to demand payment from us, even though we have made our regular capitated payments to the provider group. Depending on state law and the regulatory environment, it may be necessary for us to pay such claims.



•Under risk-sharing performance-based arrangements, providers are paid under a capitated or fee-for-service arrangement. The arrangement, however, contains provisions for additional payments to the providers or reimbursement from the providers based upon cost and quality measures.



In addition, we maintain a network of qualified physicians, facilities, and ancillary providers in the prime service areas of our T-3 contract for the TRICARE North Region. Services are provided on a fee-for-service basis. We also maintain a provider network in Regions 1, 2, and 4 in support of VA's PC3 program.



We work with physicians to help them operate efficiently by providing financial and utilization information, physician and patient educational programs and disease and medical management programs. Our programs are also designed to help the physicians coordinate care rendered by other providers.



We believe our local and collaborative approach with physicians and other providers gives us a competitive advantage in entering new markets. Our physicians serve on local committees that assist us in implementing preventive care programs, managing costs and improving the overall quality of care delivered to our members, while also simplifying the administrative burdens on our providers. This approach has enabled us to strengthen our provider networks through improved physician recruitment and retention that, in turn, have helped to increase our membership base. The following are among the services we provide to support physicians:



•Customized Utilization Reportsprovide certain of our contracted physicians with information that enables them to run their practices more efficiently and focuses them on specific patient needs. For example, quarterly detail reports update physicians on their status within their risk pools. Equivalency reports provide physicians with financial comparisons of capitated versus fee-for-service arrangements.



•Case Management Supporthelps the physician coordinate specialty care and ancillary services for patients with complex conditions and direct members to appropriate community resources to address both their health and socio-economic needs.



•Web-based Claims and Eligibility Resourceshave been implemented to provide physicians with on-line access to perform claims and eligibility inquiries.












Our contracted physicians also benefit from several of the services offered to our members, including the MemberConnections, EPSDT case management and health management programs. For example, the MemberConnections staff facilitates doctor/patient relationships by connecting members with physicians, the EPSDT programs encourage routine checkups for children with their physicians and the health management programs assist physicians in managing their patients with chronic disease.



Where appropriate, our health plans contract with our specialty services organizations to provide services and programs such as behavioral health management, care management software, dental benefits management, in-home health services, life and health management, managed vision, pharmacy benefits management, specialty pharmacy and telehealth services. When necessary, we also contract with third-party providers on a negotiated fee arrangement for physical therapy, home healthcare, dental, diagnostic laboratory tests, x-ray examinations, transportation, ambulance services and durable medical equipment.



Quality Management



Our medical management programs focus on improving quality of care in areas that have the greatest impact on our members. We employ strategies, including health management and complex case management, which are adjusted for implementation in our individual markets by a system of physician committees chaired by local physician leaders. This process promotes physician participation and support, both critical factors in the success of any clinical quality improvement program.



We have implemented specialized information systems to support our medical quality management activities. Information is drawn from our data warehouse, clinical databases and our membership and claims processing system to identify opportunities to improve care and to track the outcomes of the interventions implemented to achieve those improvements. Some examples of these intervention programs include:



•appropriate leveling of care for neonatal intensive care unit hospital admissions, other inpatient hospital admissions, and observation admissions, in accordance with Interqual or Milliman criteria.



•tightening of our pre-authorization list and more stringent review of durable medical equipment and injectibles.



•Emergency room program designed to collaboratively work with hospitals to steer non-emergency care away from the costly emergency room setting (through patient education, on-site alternative urgent care settings, etc.).



•increase emphasis on case management and clinical rounding where case managers are nurses or social workers who are employed by the health plan to assist selected members with the coordination of healthcare services in order to meet a member's specific healthcare needs.



•incorporation of disease management, which is a comprehensive, multidisciplinary, collaborative approach to chronic illnesses such as asthma and diabetes.



•Start Smart For Your Baby, a prenatal case management program aimed at helping women with high-risk pregnancies deliver full-term, healthy infants.



•Pharmacy treatment compliance programs driven by clinical policy and focused on identifying the appropriate medication in the correct dose, delivered in an efficient format and utilized for the correct duration.



We provide reporting on a regular basis using our data warehouse. State and Health Employer Data and Information Set, or HEDIS, reporting constitutes the core of the information base that drives our clinical quality performance efforts. This reporting is monitored by Plan Quality Improvement Committees and our corporate medical management team.



In an effort to ensure the quality of our provider networks, we undertake to verify the credentials and background of our providers using standards that are supported by the National Committee for Quality Assurance, or NCQA.



It is our objective to provide access to the highest quality of care for our members.  As a validation of that objective, we often pursue accreditation by independent organizations that have been established to promote healthcare quality. The NCQA Health Plan Accreditation and URAC Health Plan Accreditation programs provide unbiased, third party reviews to verify and publicly report results on specific quality care metrics. While we have achieved or are pursuing accreditation for all of our plans, accreditation is only one measure of our ability to provide access to quality care for our members. We currently have 19 of 26 eligible health plans with NCQA accreditation.












CMS developed the Medicare Advantage Star Ratings system to help consumers choose among competing plans, awarding between 1.0 and 5.0 stars to Medicare Advantage plans based on performance in certain measures of quality. For the 2017 Star rating (calculated in 2016 for the quality bonus payment in 2018), our Oregon HMO contract received 4.5 out of 5.0 Stars. The Arizona Bridgeway, California HMO, California PPO, Texas Superior and Wisconsin MHS contracts were measured at 4.0 Stars, our Oregon PPO contract was measured at 3.5 Stars and our Arizona HMO, Ohio Buckeye and Oregon Trillium contracts received 3.0 Stars. In addition, we carry a 4 Star parent organization rating.



SPECIALTY SERVICES



Our specialty services are a key component of our healthcare strategy and complement our core Managed Care business. Our provision of specialty services diversifies our revenue stream, enhances the quality of health outcomes for our members and others, and allows Centene to manage costs. In 2015, we launched Envolve, a new brand that brings together our extensive portfolio of specialty healthcare solutions. Envolve leverages our collective expertise in pharmacy solutions; health, triage, wellness and disease management; and vision and dental services, to provide integrated and comprehensive healthcare for members. Our specialty services are provided primarily as follows:





•

Pharmacy Solutions.





•

Health, Triage, Wellness, and Disease Management Services



•Vision and Dental Services.Envolve Benefit Options coordinates benefits beyond traditional medical benefits to offer fully integrated vision and dental health services. Our vision benefit program administers routine and medical surgical eye care benefits through a contracted national network of eye care providers. Through the dental benefit, we are dedicated to improving oral health through a contracted network of dental healthcare providers.












•Care Management Software.Casenet is a software provider of innovative care management solutions that automate the clinical, administrative and technical components of care management programs, which is used by our health plans and available for sale to third parties.



•Correctional Healthcare Services.Centurion, our joint venture subsidiary with MHM Services Inc., provides comprehensive healthcare services to individuals incarcerated in Massachusetts, Minnesota, Mississippi, Tennessee and Vermont state correctional facilities. In 2016, we began providing healthcare services to individuals incarcerated in Florida and New Mexico.

•Integrated Long-Term Care.LifeShare provides home and community-based support for people with intellectual and developmental disabilities, children in the child welfare system and people of all ages and abilities, with a focus on those that are often marginalized by society. In addition, LifeShare operates school-based programs that focus on students with special needs.





•

Federal Services



We currently have NCQA accreditation and URAC accreditation for several of our specialty companies.



CORPORATE COMPLIANCE



Our Corporate Ethics and Compliance Program provides controls to help us assure that our values are reflected in everything we do, further enhancing operations, improving access to quality care and helping to safeguard against fraud, waste and abuse.



Three standards by which corporate compliance programs in the healthcare industry are measured are the Federal Organizational Sentencing Guidelines, the CMS Chapter Guidance and the Compliance Program Guidance series issued by the Department of Health and Human Services' Office of the Inspector General (OIG). Our program contains each of the seven elements suggested by the Sentencing Guidelines and the OIG guidance. These key components are:



•written standards of conduct

•designation of a corporate compliance officer and compliance committee

•effective training and education

•effective lines for reporting and communication

•enforcement of standards through well publicized disciplinary guidelines and actions

•internal monitoring and auditing

•prompt response to detected offenses and development of corrective action plans










The goal of our program is to build a culture of ethics and compliance, which is assessed periodically to measure the integrity of the organization. Our internal Corporate Compliance intranet site, accessible to all employees, contains our Business Ethics and Conduct Policy (Code of Conduct), Compliance Program description and resources for employees to report concerns or ask questions. If needed, employees have access to the contact information for the members of our Board of Directors' Audit Committee to report concerns. Our Ethics and Compliance Helpline is a toll-free number and web-based reporting tool operated by a third party independent of the Company and allows employees or other persons to report suspected incidents of misconduct, fraud, waste, abuse or other compliance violations anonymously. Furthermore, the Board of Directors has established a Corporate Compliance committee that, among other things, reviews ethics and compliance reports on a quarterly basis.



COMPETITION



We operate in a highly competitive environment in an industry subject to ongoing significant changes resulting from the ACA, business consolidations, new strategic alliances, market pressures, and regulatory and legislative reform including but not limited to the federal and state health care reform legislation described under the heading "Regulation." In addition, changes to the political environment, including recent changes resulting from the 2016 election cycle and related uncertainties, may drive additional changes to the competitive landscape.



In our business, our principal competitors for customers, members, and providers consist of the following types of organizations:



•Medicaid Managed Care Organizationsfocus on providing healthcare services to Medicaid recipients. These organizations consist of national and regional organizations, as well as not-for-profits and smaller organizations that operate in one city or state and are owned by providers, primarily hospitals.



•National and Regional Commercial Managed Care Organizationshave Medicaid and Medicare members in addition to members in private commercial plans. Some of these organizations offer a range of specialty services including pharmacy benefits management, behavioral health management, health management, and nurse triage call support centers.



•Primary Care Case Management Programsare programs established by the states through contracts with primary care providers. Under these programs, physicians provide primary care services to Medicaid recipients, as well as limited medical management oversight.



•Accountable Care Organizationsare groups of doctors, hospitals, and other health care providers, who come together to give coordinated high quality care to their patients.



We compete with other managed care organizations and specialty companies for state, federal, and commercial contracts. Before granting a contract, state and federal government agencies consider many factors. These factors include quality of care, financial condition, stability and resources and established or scalable infrastructure with a demonstrated ability to deliver services and establish adequate provider networks. Our specialty companies compete with other providers, such as disease management companies, individual health insurance companies, and pharmacy benefits managers for non-governmental contracts.



We also compete to enroll new members and retain existing members. People who wish to enroll in a managed healthcare plan or to change healthcare plans typically choose a plan based on the quality of care and services offered, ease of access to services, a specific provider being part of the network and the availability of supplemental benefits. We believe that the principal competitive features affecting our ability to retain and increase membership include the range and prices of benefit plans offered, size and quality of provider network, quality of service, responsiveness to customer demands, financial stability, comprehensiveness of coverage, diversity of product offerings, market presence and reputation. The relative importance of each of these factors and the identity of our key competitors varies by market and product. We believe that we compete effectively against other health care industry participants.



We also compete with other managed care organizations in establishing provider networks. When contracting with various health plans, we believe that providers consider existing and potential member volume, reimbursement rates, medical management programs, speed of reimbursement and administrative service capabilities. See “Risk Factors - Competition may limit our ability to increase penetration of the markets that we serve.”












The relative importance of each of the aforementioned competitive factors and the identity of our key competitors varies by market, including by geography and by product.





REGULATION



Our operations are comprehensively regulated at both state and federal levels. Government regulation of the provision of healthcare products and services is a changing area of law that varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Regulatory agencies generally have substantial discretion to issue regulations and interpret and enforce laws and rules. Changes in the regulatory environment and applicable laws and rules also may occur periodically, including in connection with changes in political party or administration at the state, federal or national level. For example, the new administration and certain members of Congress have affirmatively indicated that they will pursue full repeal of or significant amendment to the ACA. Even if the ACA is not amended or repealed, the new administration could propose changes impacting implementation of the ACA. The ultimate content and timing of any legislation enacted under the new administration that would impact the current implementation of the ACA remains uncertain.



The ACA transformed the U.S. health care system through a series of complex initiatives. Some of the ACA's most significant provisions include the imposition of significant fees, assessments and taxes, including the non-deductible tax (technically called a "fee") on health insurers based on prior year net premiums written (the "health insurer fee" or "HIF"); the establishment of federally-facilitated and state-based Health Insurance Marketplaces where individuals and small groups may purchase health coverage; the implementation of certain premium stabilization programs designed to apportion risk amongst insurers; and the optional Medicaid Expansion. State and federal regulators have continued to provide additional guidance and specificity to the ACA, and we continue to monitor this new information and evaluate its potential impact on our business. For a further discussion of the implementation of the ACA, as well as the potential repeal of, or changes to, the ACA, see the risk factor below entitled “The implementation of Health Reform Legislation, as well as potential repeal of or changes to Health Reform Legislation, could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.”



Our regulated subsidiaries are licensed to operate as health maintenance organizations (HMOs), preferred provider organizations (PPOs), third party administrators, utilization review organizations, pharmacies, direct care providers and/or insurance companies in their respective states. In each of the jurisdictions in which we operate, we are regulated by the relevant insurance, health and/or human services departments, departments of insurance, boards of pharmacy and other health care providers, and departments of health that oversee the activities of managed care organizations and health plans providing or arranging to provide services to enrollees.



The process for obtaining authorization to operate as a managed care organization, health insurance plan and provider organizations is complex and requires us to demonstrate to the regulators the adequacy of the health plan's organizational structure, financial resources, utilization review, quality assurance programs, complaint procedures, provider network and procedures for covering emergency medical conditions. Under both state managed care organization statutes and insurance laws, our health plan subsidiaries, as well as our applicable specialty companies, must comply with minimum statutory capital and other financial solvency requirements, such as deposit and surplus requirements. Insurance regulations may also require prior state approval of acquisitions of other managed care organization businesses and the payment of dividends, as well as notice for loans or the transfer of funds. Our subsidiaries are also subject to periodic state and federal reporting requirements. In addition, each health plan and individual health care provider must meet criteria to secure the approval of state regulatory authorities before implementing certain operational changes, including without limitation changes to existing offerings, the development of new product offerings, certain organizational restructurings and, in some states, the expansion of service areas.



States have adopted a number of regulations that may affect our business and results of operations. These regulations in certain states include:



•premium taxes or similar assessments imposed on us;

•stringent prompt payment laws requiring us to pay claims within a specified period of time;

•disclosure requirements regarding provider fee schedules and coding procedures; and

•programs to monitor and supervise the activities and financial solvency of provider groups.










Federal law has also implemented other health programs that are partially funded by the federal government, such as the Medicaid program. Our Medicaid programs are regulated and administered by various state regulatory bodies. Federal funding remains critical to the viability of these programs. Federal law permits the federal government to oversee and, in some cases, to enact, regulations and other requirements that must be followed by states with respect to these programs. Medicaid is administered at the federal level by CMS. Comprehensive legislation, specifically Title XVIII of the Social Security Act of 1935, as amended, governs our Medicare program. In addition, our Medicare contracts are subject to regulation by CMS. CMS has the right to audit Medicare contractors and the health care providers and administrative contractors who provide certain services on their behalf to determine the quality of care being rendered and the degree of compliance with CMS contracts and regulations.



We are regulated as an insurance holding company and are subject to the insurance holding company acts of the states in which our insurance company and HMO subsidiaries are domiciled. These acts contain certain reporting requirements as well as restrictions on transactions between an insurer or HMO and its affiliates. These holding company laws and regulations generally require insurance companies and HMOs within an insurance holding company system to register with the insurance department of each state where they are domiciled and to file with those states' insurance departments reports describing capital structure, ownership, financial condition, intercompany transactions and general business operations. In addition, depending on the size and nature of the transaction, there are various notice and reporting requirements that generally apply to transactions between insurance companies and HMOs and their affiliates within an insurance holding company structure. Some insurance holding company laws and regulations require prior regulatory approval or, in certain circumstances, prior notice of certain material intercompany transfers of assets as well as certain transactions between insurance companies, HMOs, their parent holding companies and affiliates. Among other provisions, state insurance and HMO laws may restrict the ability of our regulated subsidiaries to pay dividends.



Additionally, the holding company acts of the states in which our subsidiaries are domiciled restrict the ability of any person to obtain control of an insurance company or HMO without prior regulatory approval. Under those statutes, without such approval or an exemption, no person may acquire any voting security of an insurance holding company, which controls an insurance company or HMO, or merge with such a holding company, if as a result of such transaction such person would “control” the insurance holding company. “Control” is generally defined as the direct or indirect power to direct or cause the direction of the management and policies of a company and is presumed to exist if a person directly or indirectly owns or controls 10% or more of the voting securities of a company.



PPO regulation also varies by state and covers all or most of the subject area referred to above.



Our pharmacies must be licensed to do business as pharmacies in the states in which they are located. Our pharmacies must also register with the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration and individual state controlled substance authorities to dispense controlled substances. In many of the states where our pharmacies deliver pharmaceuticals, there are laws and regulations that require out-of-state mail order pharmacies to register with that state’s board of pharmacy or similar regulatory body. These states generally permit the pharmacy to follow the laws of the state in which the mail order pharmacy is located, although some states require that we also comply with certain laws in that state.



Our health care providers must be licensed to practice medicine and do business as care providers in the state in which they are located. In addition, they must be in good standing with the applicable medical board, board of nursing or other applicable entity. Furthermore, they cannot be excluded from participation at both the state and federal levels. Our facilities are periodically reviewed by state departments of health and other regulatory agencies to ensure the environment is safe to provide care.



We must also comply with, and are faceted by, laws and regulations related to the award, administration and performance of U.S. Government contracts. Government contract laws and regulations affect how we do business with our customers and, in some instances, impose added costs on our business. In addition, as a result of our international operations, we are also subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) and similar worldwide anti-corruption laws, including the U.K. Bribery Act of 2010, which generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to non-U.S. officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. A violation of specific laws and regulations by us and/or our agents could result in among other things, the imposition of fines and penalties on us, changes to our business practices, the termination of our contracts or debarment from bidding on contracts.












State and Federal Contracts



In addition to being a licensed insurance company or HMO, in order to be a Medicaid managed care organization in each of the states in which we operate, we generally must operate under a contract with the state's Medicaid agency. States generally use either a formal proposal process, reviewing a number of bidders, or award individual contracts to qualified applicants that apply for entry to the program. Under these state Medicaid program contracts, we receive monthly payments based on specified capitation rates determined on an actuarial basis. These rates differ by membership category and by state depending on the specific benefits and policies adopted by each state. In addition, several of our Medicaid contracts require us to maintain Medicare Advantage special needs plans, which are regulated by CMS, for dual eligible individuals within the state. We also contract with states to provide healthcare services to correctional facilities.



We provide Medicare Advantage, Dual Eligible Special Needs Plans (D-SNPs), and Medicare-Medicaid Plans (MMP) which are provided under contracts with CMS and subject to federal regulation regarding the award, administration and performance of such contracts.  CMS also has the right to audit our performance to determine our compliance with these contracts, as well as other CMS regulations and the quality of care we provide to Medicare beneficiaries under these contracts.  We additionally provide behavioral and other healthcare services to correctional systems under contracts in certain states which are also subject to state regulation.



Our government contracts include government-sponsored managed care and administrative services contracts through the TRICARE program, the Department of Defense Military and Family Life Counseling program, the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs Patient Centered Community Care program and certain other health care-related government contracts.



Our state and federal contracts and the regulatory provisions applicable to us generally set forth the requirements for operating in the Medicaid and Medicare sectors, including provisions relating to:



•eligibility, enrollment and dis-enrollment processes•covered services•eligible providers•subcontractors•record-keeping and record retention•periodic financial and informational reporting•quality assurance•accreditation•health education and wellness and prevention programs•timeliness of claims payment•financial standards•safeguarding of member information•fraud, waste and abuse detection and reporting•grievance procedures•organization and administrative systems





A health plan or individual health insurance provider's compliance with these requirements is subject to monitoring by state regulators and by CMS. A health plan is also subject to periodic comprehensive quality assurance evaluations by a third-party reviewing organization and generally by the insurance department of the jurisdiction that licenses the health plan. A health plan or individual health insurance provider must also submit reports to various regulatory agencies, including quarterly and annual statutory financial statements and utilization reports.



The table below sets forth certain terms of our contracts and provides details regarding related renewal or extension and termination provisions. The contracts generally are subject to termination for cause, an event of default or lack of funding, among other things.

Marketplace Contracts



We operate in 15 states under federally facilitated and state-based Marketplace contracts with CMS that expire annually.  In 2016, we began operating in a federally facilitated Marketplace in New Hampshire, as well as Arizona and California that were added with the Health Net Acquisition.



In addition, we operate under a contract with the Arkansas Department of Human Services Division of Medical Services and the Arkansas Insurance Department to participate in the Medicaid expansion model that Arkansas has adopted (referred to as "Arkansas Works"). In 2016, we started operating under a contract with the New Hampshire Department of Health and Human Services to participate in the Medicaid expansion model that New Hampshire has adopted (referred to as the “Premium Assistance Program”).



Privacy Regulations



We are subject to various federal, state and local laws and rules regarding the use, security and disclosure of protected health information, personal information, and other categories of confidential or legally protected data that our businesses handle. Such laws and rules include, without limitation, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), the Federal Trade Commission Act, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Financial Modernization Act of 1999 (Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act), state privacy and security laws such as the California Confidentiality of Medical Information Act and the California Online Privacy Protection Act. Privacy and security laws and regulations often change due to new or amended legislation, regulations or administrative interpretation. A variety of state and federal regulators enforce these laws, including but not limited to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), the Federal Trade Commission, state attorneys general and other state regulators.














The Privacy and Security Rules and HITECH/Omnibus enhancements established requirements to protect the privacy of medical records and safeguard personal health information maintained and used by healthcare providers, health plans, healthcare clearinghouses, and their business associates.



The Security Rule requires healthcare providers, health plans, healthcare clearinghouses, and their business associates to implement administrative, physical and technical safeguards to ensure the privacy and confidentiality of health information electronically stored, maintained or transmitted. The HITECH Act and Omnibus Rule enhanced a federal requirement for notification when the security of protected health information is breached. In addition, there are state laws that have been adopted to provide for, among other things, private rights of action for breaches of data security and mandatory notification to persons whose identifiable information is obtained without authorization.



The requirements of the Transactions Standards apply to certain healthcare related transactions conducted using "electronic media." Since "electronic media" is defined broadly to include "transmissions that are physically moved from one location to another using portable data, magnetic tape, disk or compact disk media," many communications are considered to be electronically transmitted. Under HIPAA, health plans and providers are required to have the capacity to accept and send all covered transactions in a standardized electronic format. Penalties can be imposed for failure to comply with these requirements. The transaction standards were modified on October 1, 2015 with the implementation of the ICD-10 coding system.



In addition, we process and maintain personal card data, particularly in connection with our Marketplace business. As a result, we are subject to the requirements under the Payment Card Industry (PCI) Data Security Standard, which is a multifaceted security standard that is designed to protect credit card account data as mandated by payment card industry entities.



Other Fraud, Waste and Abuse Laws



Investigating and prosecuting healthcare fraud, waste and abuse continues to be a top priority for state and federal law enforcement entities. The focus of these efforts has been directed at participants in public government healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. The fraud, waste and abuse laws include the federal False Claims Act, which prohibits the known filing of a false claim or the known use of false statements to obtain payment from the federal government. Many states have false claim act statutes that closely resemble the federal False Claims Act. The laws and regulations relating to fraud, waste and abuse and the requirements applicable to health plans and providers participating in these programs are complex and change regularly. Compliance with these laws may require substantial resources. We are constantly looking for ways to improve our waste, fraud and abuse detection methods. While we have both prospective and retrospective processes to identify abusive patterns and fraudulent billing, we continue to increase our capabilities to proactively detect inappropriate billing prior to payment.



EMPLOYEES



As ofDecember 31, 2016, we had approximately30,500employees. None of our employees are represented by a union. We believe our relationships with our employees are positive.
