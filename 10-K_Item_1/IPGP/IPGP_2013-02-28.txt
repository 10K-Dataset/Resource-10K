Industry Background

Conventional Laser Technologies

Since the laser was invented over 50 years ago, laser technology has revolutionized a broad range of applications and products in various industries, including general manufacturing, automotive, medical,
research, consumer products, electronics, semiconductors and communications. Lasers provide flexible, non-contact and high-speed ways to process and treat various materials. They are widely used to transmit large volumes of data in optical
communications systems, various medical applications and test and measurement systems. They are also incorporated into manufacturing, medical and other systems by OEMs, system integrators and end users. For a wide variety of applications, lasers
provide superior performance and a more cost-effective solution than non-laser technologies.

Lasers emit an intense light
beam that can be focused on a small area, causing metals and other materials to melt, vaporize or change their character. These properties are utilized in applications requiring very high-power densities, such as marking, printing, welding, cutting,
drilling, cladding and other materials processing procedures. Lasers are well-suited for imaging and inspection applications, and the ability to confine laser light to narrow wavelengths makes them particularly effective in medical and sensing
applications. A laser works by converting electrical energy to optical energy. In a laser, an energy source excites or pumps a lasing medium, which converts the energy from the source into an emission consisting of particles of light, called
photons, at a particular wavelength.

Historically, carbon dioxide (“CO2”) gas lasers and crystal lasers have been the two principal laser
types used in materials processing and many other applications. They are named for the materials used to create the lasing action. A CO2laser produces light by electrically stimulating a gas-filled tube and delivers the beam through free space using mirrors
to provide direction. A crystal laser uses an arc lamp, pulsed flash lamp or diode stack or array to optically pump a special crystal. The most common crystal lasers use yttrium aluminum garnet (“YAG”) crystals infused with neodymium or
ytterbium. Some crystal lasers also use mirrors in free space to deliver the beam or direct the beam through fiber optics.

Introduction of Fiber Lasers

Fiber lasers use semiconductor diodes as the light source to pump specialty optical fibers, which are infused with rare earth ions. These fibers are called active fibers and are comparable in diameter to
a human hair. The laser emission is created within optical fibers and delivered through a flexible optical fiber cable. As a result of their different design and components, fiber lasers are more reliable, efficient, robust and portable, and easier
to operate than conventional lasers. In addition, fiber lasers free the end users from fine mechanical adjustments and the high maintenance costs that are typical for conventional lasers.

Although low-power fiber lasers have existed for approximately four decades, their increased recent adoption has been driven primarily by
our improvements in their output power levels and cost as well as their superior performance compared with conventional lasers. We have successfully increased output power levels by developing improved optical components such as active fibers that
have increased their power capacities and improved their performance. Fiber lasers now offer output powers that exceed those of conventional lasers in many categories. Also, semiconductor diodes historically have represented the majority of the cost
of fiber lasers. The high cost of diodes meant that fiber lasers could not compete with conventional lasers on price and limited their use to high value-added applications. Over the last several years, however, our semiconductor diodes have become
more affordable and reliable due, in part, to substantial advancements in semiconductor diode technology and increased production volumes. As a result, the average cost per watt of output power has decreased dramatically over the last decade.
Because of these improvements, our fiber lasers can now effectively







compete with conventional lasers over a wide range of output powers and applications. As a pioneer in the development and commercialization of fiber lasers, we have contributed to many
advancements in fiber laser technology and products.

Advantages of Fiber Lasers over Conventional Lasers

We believe that fiber lasers provide a combination of benefits that include:



•Superior Performance.Fiber lasers provide high beam quality over the entire power range. In most conventional laser
solutions, the beam quality is sensitive to output power, while in fiber lasers, the output beam is virtually non-divergent over a wide power range. A non-divergent beam enables higher levels of precision, increased power densities and the ability
to deliver the beam over greater distances to where processing can be completed. The superior beam quality and greater intensity of a fiber laser’s beam allow tasks to be accomplished more rapidly, with lower-power units and with greater
flexibility than comparable conventional lasers.



•Lower Cost.The purchase price for fiber lasers is generally lower than that of YAG lasers and of many conventional
CO2lasers. Fiber lasers are cheaper to operate due to their
lower energy usage, lower required maintenance costs and better processing speeds. Fiber lasers convert electrical energy to optical energy approximately 2 to 3 times more efficiently than diode-pumped YAG lasers, approximately 3 times more
efficiently than conventional CO2lasers and approximately 15
to 30 times more efficiently than lamp-pumped YAG lasers. Because fiber lasers are much more energy-efficient and place lower levels of thermal stress on their internal components, they have substantially lower cooling requirements compared to those
of conventional lasers, which also improves overall energy efficiency. Fiber lasers have lower to no maintenance costs due to the high performance and long life of our single-emitter diodes, fiber optics and other optical components, which can be
used for up to 100,000 hours without replacement. The higher power density of the fiber laser beam also allows for higher processing speeds in many applications, which increases the operating efficiencies on a per-part basis.



•Ease of Use.Many features of fiber lasers make them easier to operate, maintain and integrate into laser-based systems
as compared to conventional lasers. There are no moving parts in the fiber laser so they do not require adjustments of internal components.



•Compact Size and Portability.Fiber lasers are typically smaller and lighter in weight than conventional lasers, saving
valuable floor space. While conventional lasers are delicate due to the precise alignment of mirrors, fiber lasers are more durable and able to perform in variable environments.



•Choice of Wavelengths and Precise Control of Beam.The design of fiber lasers generally provides a broad range of
wavelength choices, allowing users to select the precise wavelength that best matches their application and materials. Because the beam is delivered through fiber optics, it can be directed to the work area over longer distances without loss of beam
quality.

Fiber amplifiers are similar in design to fiber lasers, use many of the same components, such as
semiconductor diodes and specialty optical fibers, and provide many of the same advantages in the applications that require amplification.

Notwithstanding the benefits offered by fiber lasers, there remain applications and processes where conventional laser technologies may provide superior performance with respect to particular features.
For example, crystal lasers can provide higher peak power pulses and fiber lasers do not generate the deep ultra-violet light that is used for photolithography in many semiconductor applications. In addition, CO2lasers operate at wavelengths that are optimal for use on many
non-metallic materials, including plastics.

Broad Product Portfolio and Ability to Meet Customer
Requirements.We offer a broad range of standard and custom fiber lasers and amplifiers, enabling deployment in a wide variety of applications and end markets. Our vertically integrated manufacturing and broad technology
expertise enable us to design, prototype and commence high-volume production of our products rapidly, allowing our customers to meet their time-to-market requirements.

Our Strategy

Our objective is to maintain and extend our leadership
position by pursuing the following key elements of our strategy:

Leverage Our Technology to Increase
Sales.As fiber lasers become more widely accepted, we plan to leverage our position as the leader in fiber lasers and our applications expertise to develop solutions for customers and increase our position in the broader
laser market. We believe that our fiber lasers will continue to displace traditional lasers in many existing applications due to their superior performance and value. Over the last decade, our pulsed fiber lasers have become widely accepted in laser
metal marking applications and now have a leading position in those applications. More recently, our high-power continuous wave (“CW”) fiber lasers have been accepted by a growing number of laser cutting system OEMs for two- and
three-dimension cutting, one of the largest laser materials processing applications. We plan to continue to leverage our fiber laser technology by pursuing large-scale laser applications where our fiber lasers offer improved customer value and
performance. Some of the more significant applications we intend to target include: (i) welding of thick steel with our high-power lasers; (ii) micro-processing with our quasi-CW (“QCW”) fiber lasers; (iii) processing of
non-metals, such as plastics, with our new high-power thulium lasers; and (iv) fine-processing, scribing and marking with our high-power green lasers and new ultra-violet (“UV”), lasers now under development.

Target New Applications for Lasers and Expand into Broader Markets.We intend to expand the
use of fiber lasers into additional applications where faster or higher quality processing, higher power, portability, efficiency, size and flexible fiber cable delivery can lead customers to adopt fiber lasers instead of non-laser solutions. We
believe that the advantages of fiber laser technology can overcome many of the limitations that have hindered the adoption of conventional lasers in broader industrial markets and processes. Using our manufacturing scale and technology innovations,
we have been successful in reducing the cost of manufacturing with lasers, making fiber lasers a more attractive manufacturing alternative. We target applications where higher power, portability, efficiency, size and flexible fiber cable delivery
can lead customers to adopt fiber lasers instead of non-laser solutions. Certain industry trends such as the use of high-strength steel in automotive manufacturing and decreasing the weight of vehicles are driving the use of fiber lasers over other
manufacturing methods such as stamping, non-laser welding and adhesives. Other trends, such as miniaturization of parts and electronics, contribute to the use of lasers because no other tools can work as precisely. We are working on developing new
applications for fiber lasers through internal research and in partnership with customers and industrial institutes.

Expand Our Product Portfolio.We plan to continue to invest in research and development to add additional wavelengths, power levels and other parameters while also improving
beam quality, as well as developing new product lines and laser-based systems. Using our core technologies and breadth of experience, we plan to expand the wavelengths at which our lasers operate. This includes UV lasers that can be used for
fine-processing applications and mid-infrared lasers that can be used for medical applications, non-metal materials processing and other novel applications. We have increased the output power of our green lasers for use in the semiconductor market.
We will continue to expand sales of specialized laser-based systems to meet the specific needs of manufacturing end users whose requirements are not met by standard systems or in certain geographic areas where fiber laser systems are not currently
available. In 2012, we acquired a business that develops and produces industrial grade UV excimer, solid state and pico-second laser micromachining systems. We also expanded our capabilities to manufacture high-power laser systems for certain
applications and markets and developed a high-power scanning system for multiple materials processing applications.







Lower Our Costs Through Manufacturing Improvements and
Innovation.We plan to seek further improvements in component manufacturing processes and device assembly as well as innovation in components and device designs to improve performance and decrease the overall cost per watt
for our products. As we increase our volumes, we are better able to negotiate price reductions with certain of our suppliers. We intend to leverage our technology and operations expertise to manufacture additional components in order to reduce
costs, ensure component quality and ensure supply. In 2012, we machined more of our mechanical parts, manufactured more of the printed circuit boards we use, and redesigned certain optical components to improve quality and decrease costs. We also
further decreased the cost of our packaged diodes. In addition, we manufactured additional components that we had previously outsourced, such as mechanical cabinets, printed circuit boards and optical sub-assemblies. By reducing the cost per watt of
our lasers and maintaining the lower operating cost of our products, we believe that we can increase laser use in applications in which conventional lasers could not be used economically.

Expand Global Reach to Attract Customers Worldwide.Our customers’ manufacturing
operations have expanded in emerging markets and are moving to lower-cost international locations. We have increased and will continue to increase our international sales and service locations to respond to our customers’ needs. In 2012, we
opened a new sales and service office in Turkey. We are considering increasing our presence in additional countries with large manufacturing infrastructures.

We design and manufacture a broad range of high-performance
optical fiber-based lasers and amplifiers. We also make packaged diodes, direct diode lasers, laser systems, communications systems and materials processing laser systems that utilize our optical fiber-based products as well as other laser sources.
Many of our products are designed to be used as general-purpose energy or light sources, making them useful in diverse applications and markets.

Our products are based on a common proprietary technology platform using many of the same core components, such as semiconductor diodes and specialty fibers, which we configure to our customers’
specifications. Our engineers and scientists work closely with OEMs, system integrators and end users to develop and customize our products for their needs. Because of our flexible and modular product architecture, we offer products in different
configurations according to the desired application, including modules, rack-mounted units and tabletop units. Our engineers and other technical experts work directly with the customer in our application and development centers to develop and
configure the optimal solution for each customer’s manufacturing requirements. We also manufacture certain complementary products that are used with our lasers, such as optical delivery cables, fiber couplers, beam switches, optical heads and
chillers.

pulsed. We offer several different types of lasers, which are defined by the type of gain medium they use. These are ytterbium, erbium, thulium and Raman. We also sell fiber pigtailed packaged diodes and fiber coupled direct diode laser systems that
use semiconductor diodes rather than optical fibers as their gain medium. In addition, we offer high-energy pulsed lasers, multi-wavelength lasers, tunable lasers, single-polarization and single-frequency lasers, as well as other versions of our
products.

We believe that we produce the highest-power solid-state lasers in the industry. Our ytterbium fiber lasers reach
power levels of up to 100,000 watts. We also make single-mode and low-mode output ytterbium fiber lasers with power levels of up to 20,000 watts and single-mode, low-output erbium and thulium fiber lasers with power levels of up to 400 watts. Our
compact, durable design and integrated fiber optic beam delivery allow us to offer versatile laser energy sources and simple laser integration for complex production processes without compromising quality, speed or power.







We also sell laser diode chips and packaged laser diodes operating at 9XX nanometers. We
sell our own family of high-power optical fiber delivery cables, fiber couplers, beam switches, chillers and other accessories for our fiber lasers. Recently, we introduced a high-power scanner for use with our fiber lasers.

IPG offers a retrofit service to replace CO2and lamp-pumped YAG laser sources with fiber lasers in many welding, cutting, drilling and other systems, allowing
customers to retain their existing laser systems. IPG also makes active and passive laser materials and tunable lasers in the middle-infrared region.

Amplifiers

Our amplifier products range from milliwatts to up to
1,500 watts of output power from 1 to 2 microns in wavelength. We offer erbium-doped fiber amplifiers (“EDFAs”), Raman amplifiers and integrated communications systems that incorporate our amplifiers. These products are predominantly
deployed in broadband networks such as fiber to the home (“FTTH”), fiber to the curb (“FTTC”), and passive optical networks (“PON”), and dense wavelength division multiplexing (“DWDM”), networks. We also offer
ytterbium and thulium specialty fiber amplifiers and broadband light sources that are used in advanced applications. In addition, we sell single-frequency, linearly polarized and polarization-maintaining versions of our amplifier products. As with
our fiber lasers, our fiber amplifiers offer some of the highest output power levels and highest number of optical outputs in the industry. We believe our line of fiber amplifiers offers the best commercially available output power and performance.

Systems

Besides selling laser sources, we also offer integrated laser systems for particular geographic markets or custom-developed for a customer’s manufacturing requirements. Through our IPG Microsystems
business, we offer industrial grade UV excimer, diode pumped solid state and pico-second laser micromachining systems and materials processing services. Key applications for these systems include advanced laser scribing and lift-off
(“LLO”) of light-emitting diodes (“LEDs”), thin film solar scribing, semiconductor, micro-electro-mechanical systems (“MEMS”), research, biomedical and industrial micromachining. IPG Microsystems’ laser systems
operate at wavelengths from 157nm to 1,064nm, and are essential to a growing set of today’s industrial micromachining applications.

IPG also develops and sells specialized fiber laser systems for unique material processing applications as requested by customers desiring a complete laser-based solution, including remote welding,
micro-welding and cutting. The platforms include multi-axis workstations for welding, flatbed cutters, and diode markers. Other systems offerings include a welding seam stepper and picker, which is an automated and integrated fiber laser welding
tool providing customers increased processing speeds, better quality and the elimination of certain clamping tools. The seam stepper and picker, an alternative to resistance welding, are used in automotive assembly, sheet metal production and other
materials processing applications.

Our products are used in a broad range of applications. The major application is materials processing,
comprising approximately 88% of our sales in 2012. Our products also address other applications, including advanced applications (approximately 7% of sales), communications (approximately 4% of sales) and medical (approximately 1% of sales).

Our Markets

Materials Processing

The most significant materials processing applications for fiber lasers are cutting and welding and marking and engraving. Other applications include micro-processing, surface treatment, drilling,
soldering, annealing, hardening, rapid prototyping and laser-assisted machining.

Cutting and Welding
Applications.Laser-based cutting technology has several advantages compared to alternative technologies. Laser cutting is fast, flexible and highly precise and can be used to cut complex contours on flat, tubular or
three-dimensional materials. The laser source can be programmed to process many







different kinds of materials such as steel, aluminum, brass, copper, glass, ceramic and plastic at various thicknesses. Laser cutting technology is a non-contact process that is easy to integrate
into an automated production line and is not subject to wear of the cutting medium. We sell low, mid and high-power ytterbium fiber lasers for laser cutting. High electrical efficiency, low maintenance and operating cost, high beam quality, wide
operating power range, power stability and small spot size are some of the qualities offered by IPG fiber lasers for many cutting applications, which enable customers to cut a variety of materials faster.

Laser welding offers several important advantages compared to conventional welding technology as it is non-contact, easy to automate,
provides high process speed and results in narrow-seamed, high-quality welds that generally require little or no post-processing machining. The high beam quality of our fiber lasers coupled with high CW power offer deep penetration welding as well
as shallow conduction mode welding. In addition, fiber lasers can be focused to a small spot with extremely long focal lengths, enabling remote welding “on the fly,” a flexible method of three-dimensional welding in which the laser beam is
positioned by a robot-guided scanner. Such remote welding stations equipped with fiber lasers are used for welding door panels and seat backs, the multiple welding of spot and lap welds over the entire auto body frame and welding
“body-in-white,” which is welding pieces of metal with different thicknesses for automotive applications. Typically, mid to high-power ytterbium fiber lasers and long-pulse QCW ytterbium fiber lasers are used in welding applications. Our
products are used also for laser brazing of visible joints in automobiles such as tailgates, roof joints and columns. Brazing is a method of connecting sheet metal.

Marking and Engraving.With the increasing need for source traceability, component identification and product tracking as a means of reducing product liability and preventing
falsification, as well as the demand for modern robotic production systems, manufacturers increasingly demand marking systems capable of applying serialized alphanumeric, graphic or bar code identifications directly onto their manufactured
components. Laser engraving is similar to marking but forms deeper grooves in the material. In contrast to conventional acid etching and ink-based technologies, lasers can mark a wide variety of metal and non-metal materials, such as ceramic, glass
and plastic surfaces, at high speeds and without contact by changing the surface structure of the material or by engraving. Laser marking systems can be easily integrated into a customer’s production process and do not subject the item being
marked to mechanical stress. Our ytterbium pulsed fiber lasers are used for these applications.

In the semiconductor
industry, lasers typically are used to mark wafers and integrated circuits. In the electronics industry, lasers typically are used to mark electrical components such as contactors, relays and printed circuit boards. Consumer electronic devices such
as mobile phones, computers and handheld computers contain many parts that are laser-marked, including keyboards, logos and labels. With the increase in marking speed in the past few years, the cost of laser marking has decreased. In the
photovoltaic or solar panel industry, pulsed lasers increasingly are used to remove materials and to scribe, or cut, solar cells. The high beam quality, increased peak output powers, flexible fiber delivery and competitive price of fiber lasers have
accelerated the adoption of fiber lasers in these low-power applications.

Micro-Processing and Non-Metal
Processing.The trend toward miniaturization in numerous industries such as consumer electronics, as well as innovations in materials and structures, is driving end users to utilize lasers in processing and fabrication.
The ability of lasers to cut, weld, drill, ablate, etch and add materials on a fine scale is enabling new technologies and products across many industries. Our low-power CW and QCW lasers are used to cut medical stents and weld medical batteries. In
photovoltaic manufacturing, our lasers etch and perform edge isolation processes. The aerospace industry requires precise manufacturing of engine parts so that cooling is effective and aerospace manufacturers use lasers to conduct percussive
drilling. Processing of plastics and semi-conductors require short pulse and high energy lasers, in the green, UV and mid infra-red wavelengths.

Advanced Applications

Our fiber lasers and amplifiers are utilized
by commercial firms and by academic and government institutions worldwide for manufacturing of commercial systems and for research in advanced technologies and products. These markets may use specialty products developed by us or commercial versions
of our products.







Obstacle Warning and Mapping.Our products are used for
obstacle warning and 3-dimensional mapping of earth surfaces.

Special Projects.Due to the high
power, compactness, performance, portability, ruggedness and electrical efficiency of our fiber lasers and amplifiers, we sell our commercial products for government research and projects. These include materials testing, ordnance destruction,
coherent beam combining, directed energy demonstrations, advanced communications and research.

Research and
Development.Our products are used in a variety of applications for research and development by scientists and industrial researchers, including atom trapping. In addition, our lasers and amplifiers are used to design,
test and characterize components and systems in a variety of markets and applications.

Optical Pumping and Harmonic
Generation.Several types of our lasers are used to optically pump other solid-state lasers and for harmonic generation and parametric converters to support research in sensing, medical and other scientific research in the
infrared and visible wavelength domains. Our lasers are used as a power source for these other lasers. Green visible lasers are used to pump titanium sapphire lasers. Visible lasers can be used in optical displays, planetariums and light shows.

Remote Sensing.Our products are used in light detection and ranging (“LIDAR”), a
laser technique for remote sensing. Optical fiber can be used as a sensor for measuring changes in temperature, pressure and gas concentration in oil wells, atmospheric and pollution measurements and seismic exploration.

Communications

We design and manufacture a DWDM transport system with varying output power and wavelengths and a full range of fiber amplifiers and Raman pump lasers that enhance data transmission in broadband access
and DWDM optical networks. We are leveraging our high-power diode and fiber technology through the qualification and sale of high-value integrated solutions for network suppliers.

DWDM.    DWDM is a technology that expands the capacity of optical networks, allowing service providers to
extend the life of existing fiber networks and reduce operating and capital costs by maximizing bandwidth capacity. We provide a broad range of high-power products for DWDM applications including EDFAs and Raman lasers. We provide a DWDM transport
system that offers service providers and private network operators a simple, flexible, optical layer solution scalable to 80 channels that aggregates and multiplexes multiprotocol clients into optical transport network signals operating at 10, 40
and 100 gigabits per second per channel.

Broadband Access.The delivery to subscribers of
television programming and Internet-based information and communication services is converging, driven by advances in Internet Protocol (“IP”) technology and by changes in the regulatory and competitive environment. Fiber optic lines now
offer connection speeds of up to 10 gigabits per second to the subscriber, or 1,000 times faster than digital subscriber lines (“DSL”), or cable links. We offer a series of specialty multi-port EDFAs and cable television
(“TV”) nodes and transmitters that support different types of passive optical network architectures, enabling high-speed data, voice, video on demand and high-definition TV. We provide an EDFA that supports up to 64 output ports, which
allows service providers to support a high number of customers in a small space, reducing overall power consumption and network cost. End users for our products include communications network operators for video wavelength division multiplexing
overlay solutions, operators of metro and long-haul networks for DWDM and amplification solutions, as well as cable and multiple system operators for optical amplification solutions.

Medical

We sell our commercial fiber and diode lasers to OEMs that incorporate our products into their medical laser systems. CW erbium and thulium fiber lasers from 1 to 150 watts and diode laser systems can be
used in







various medical and biomedical applications. Aesthetic applications addressed by lasers include skin rejuvenation, skin resurfacing and stretch mark removal. Purchasers use our diode lasers in
dental and skin tightening procedures. Surgical applications include prostate surgery. Fiber lasers have the ability to fine-tune optical penetration depth and absorption characteristics and can be used for ear, nose and throat, urology, gynecology
and other surgical procedures.

Technology

Our products are based on our proprietary technology platform that we have developed and refined since our formation. The following technologies are key elements in our products.

Specialty Optical Fibers

We have extensive expertise in the disciplines and techniques that form the basis for the multi-clad active and passive optical fibers used in our products. Active optical fibers form the laser cavity or
gain medium in which lasing or amplification of light occurs in our products. Passive optical fibers deliver the optical energy created in our products. Our active fibers consist of an inner core that is infused with the appropriate rare earth ion,
such as ytterbium, erbium or thulium, and outer cores of un-doped glass having different indices of refraction. We believe that our large portfolio of specialty active and passive optical fibers has a number of advantages as compared to other
commercially available optical fibers. These advantages include higher concentrations of rare earth ions, fibers that will not degrade at the high power levels over the useful life of the product, high lasing efficiency, ability to achieve
single-mode outputs at high powers, ability to withstand high optical energies and temperatures and scalable side-pumping capability.

Semiconductor Diode Laser Processing and Packaging Technologies

Another key element of our technology platform is that we use multiple multi-mode, or broad area, single-emitter diodes rather than diode
bars or stacks as a pump source. We believe that multi-mode single-emitter diodes are the most efficient and reliable pumping source presently available, surpassing diode bars and stacks in efficiency, brightness and reliability. Single-emitter
diodes have substantially reduced cooling requirements and typically have estimated lifetimes of more than 100,000 hours at high operating currents, compared to typical lifetimes of up to 10,000 to 20,000 hours for diode bars.

We developed advanced molecular beam epitaxy techniques to grow alumina indium gallium arsenide wafers for our diodes. This method yields
high-quality optoelectronic material for low-defect density and high uniformity of optoelectronic parameters. In addition, we have developed numerous proprietary wafer processes and testing and qualification procedures in order to create a high
energy output in a reliable and high-power diode. We package our diodes in hermetically sealed pump modules in which the diodes are combined with an optical fiber output. Characteristics such as the ability of the package to dissipate heat produced
by the diode and withstand vibration, shock, high temperature, humidity and other environmental conditions are critical to the reliability and efficiency of the products.

Specialty Components and Combining Techniques

We developed a wide
range of advanced optical components that are capable of handling high optical power levels and contribute to the superior performance, efficiency and reliability of our products. In addition to fibers and diodes, our optical component portfolio
includes fiber gratings, couplers, isolators and combiners. We also developed special methods and expertise in splicing fibers together with low optical energy loss and on-line loss testing. We believe that our internal development and manufacturing
of key optical components allows us to lower our manufacturing costs and improve product performance.

Side Pumping of
Fibers and Fiber Block Technologies

Our technology platform allows us to efficiently combine a large number of
multi-mode single-emitter semiconductor diodes with our active optical fibers that are used in all of our products. A key element of this







technology is that we pump our fiber lasers through the cladding surrounding the active core. We splice our specialty active optical fibers with other optical components and package them in a
sealed box, which we call a fiber block. The fiber blocks are compact and eliminate the risk of contamination or misalignment due to mechanical vibrations and shocks as well as temperature or humidity variations. Our design is scalable and modular,
permitting us to make products with high output power by coupling a large number of diodes with fiber blocks, which can be combined in parallel and serially.

High-Stress Testing

We employ high-stress techniques in testing
components and final products that help increase reliability and accelerate product development. For example, we test all of our diodes with high current and temperatures to accelerate aging. We also have built a large database of diode test results
that allows us to predict the estimated lifetime of our diodes. This testing allows us to eliminate defective diodes prior to further assembly and thus increase reliability.

Customers

We sell our products globally to OEMs, system integrators and
end users in a wide range of diverse markets who have the in-house engineering capability to integrate our products into their own systems. We have thousands of customers worldwide. Our primary end market is materials processing, comprised of
general manufacturing, automotive, heavy industry, aerospace, consumer products, medical device manufacturing, natural resources, photovoltaic semiconductor and electronics customers. We also sell our products to other end markets, including
advanced applications (comprised of commercial companies, universities, research entities and government entities), communications (comprised of system integrators, utilities and municipalities) and medical (comprised of medical laser systems
manufacturers and researchers). We believe that our customer and end-market diversification minimizes dependence on any single industry or group of customers.

Backlog

At December 31, 2012, our backlog of orders (generally scheduled for shipment within one year) was approximately $203.0 million compared to $207.0 million at December 31, 2011. At
December 31, 2012, our backlog included $102.0 million of orders with firm shipment dates and $101.0 million of frame agreements that we expect to ship within one year, compared to $124.1 million of orders with firm shipment dates and $82.9
million of frame agreements at December 31, 2011. Frame agreements generally are agreements without committed shipment dates. Orders used to compute backlog are generally cancelable without substantial penalties. Historically, the rate of
cancellation experienced by us has not been significant. We manage the risk of cancellation by establishing the right to charge a cancellation fee that generally covers a portion of the purchase price, any materials and development costs incurred
prior to the order being cancelled. Our ability to enforce this right depends on many factors including, but not limited to, the customer’s requested length of delay, the number of other outstanding orders with the customer and our ability to
quickly convert the cancelled order to another sale.

We anticipate shipping a substantial majority of the present backlog
during fiscal year 2013. However, our backlog at any given date is not necessarily indicative of actual sales for any future period.

Sales, Marketing and Support

We market our products internationally primarily through our direct sales force. Our direct sales force sells to end users, OEMs and systems integrators. Once our fiber laser products are designed into an
OEM system, the OEM’s sales force markets its systems, allowing us to take advantage of numerous OEMs sales forces, each typically having several sales persons in locations other than where our sales offices are located. We have sales offices
in the United States, Germany, Italy, Turkey, the United Kingdom, France, Spain, China, Japan, South Korea, Singapore, India and Russia. We have materials processing application centers in the United States, Germany, Russia, China, Italy, Japan and
South Korea, which we use to demonstrate our products and develop new applications. Our application centers are fundamental to developing new laser applications for customers and assisting them in integrating lasers into their production processes.

To a lesser extent, we market through agreements with independent sales representatives and distributors. Sales to foreign
customers are generally priced in local currencies and are therefore subject to currency exchange fluctuations.

We maintain a
customer support and field service staff in our major markets. We work closely with customers and independent representatives to service equipment and to train customers to use our products. We have expanded our support and field service,
particularly in locations where customer concentration or volume requires local service capabilities. We repair products at our facilities or at customer sites.

We typically provide one to three-year parts and service warranties on our lasers and amplifiers. Most of our sales offices provide support to customers in their respective geographic areas. Warranty
reserves have generally been sufficient to cover product warranty repair and replacement costs.

Manufacturing

Vertical integration is one of our core business strategies through which we control our proprietary processes and technologies as well as
the supply of key components and assemblies. We believe that our vertically integrated business model gives us the following advantages:



•maintaining a technological lead over competitors;



•reducing component and final product costs compared to market prices available to competitors;



•ensuring access to critical components, enabling us to better meet customer demands;







•controlling performance, quality and consistency; and



•enabling rapid development and deployment of new products and technologies.

Our vertically integrated manufacturing operations include optical preform making, specialty fiber drawing, semiconductor wafer growth,
diode processing and packaging, specialty optical component manufacturing, fiber block and fiber module assembly for different power units, software and electronics development, final assembly, as well as testing, tool manufacturing and automated
production systems. Over the last several years, we added additional production capabilities, including three multi-wafer growth reactors, diode test stations, fiber pre-form and fiber drawing equipment and low, mid and high-power production and
testing, in order to increase our capacity as well as reduce the risks associated with our production process.

We operate our
own semiconductor foundry for the production of the multi-mode single-emitter diodes. Diodes are the pumps that are used as the light source in each device we make. We also process, package and extensively test all of our diodes. Because pump diodes
represent a significant component cost of the final laser or amplifier, we have chosen to develop internal manufacturing capabilities for diodes. As a result of our high-volume production levels of pump diodes, proprietary processes and use of
limited chip designs, we have been able to increase yields, lower component costs and assure high quality. We also design, manufacture and optimize many of our own test instruments, diode test racks, robotic and automated assembly tools and
machines.

We developed these proprietary components, manufacturing tools, equipment and techniques over many years in an
effort to address the major issues that had been inhibiting the development of fiber laser technology and to provide products that differentiate us from our competitors. We believe that the proprietary components, manufacturing tools, equipment,
techniques and software utilized in all of our product lines provide extensive barriers to potential competitors. Generally, we do not sell our proprietary components to third parties in material quantities. Using our technology platform, we
configure standard products based upon each customer’s specifications. Through our vertically integrated manufacturing operations, we can develop, test and produce new products and configurations with higher performance and reliability and in
less time than by working with external vendors. We have developed proprietary testing methodologies that allow us to develop higher power components and products in short periods of time, enable us to introduce products to the market more quickly,
capitalize on new opportunities and provide superior service to our customers.

Our in-house manufacturing generally includes
only those operations and components that are critical to the protection of our intellectual property, the reduction of our costs or the achievement of performance and quality standards. We purchase from vendors common and specialized mechanical,
electrical and optical parts and raw materials, such as printed circuit boards, wafer substrates and various optical components.

Research
and Development

We have extensive research and development experience in laser materials, fiber and optoelectronic
components. We have assembled a team of scientists and engineers with specialized experience and extensive knowledge in fiber lasers and amplifiers, critical components, testing and manufacturing process design.

We focus our research and development efforts on designing and introducing new and improved standard and customized products and the mass
production of components for our products. In addition to our cladding-pumped specialty fiber platform, we have core competencies in high-power multi-mode semiconductor laser diodes, diode packaging, specialty active and passive optical fibers,
high-performance optical components, fiber gain blocks and fiber modules, as well as splicing and combining techniques and high-stress test methods. Our research and development efforts are aided by our vertical integration and our proprietary
high-stress testing techniques that result in accelerated development cycles. The strategy of developing our proprietary components has allowed us to leverage our optical experience and large volume requirements to lower the cost of our products. We
concentrate our research and development efforts on advancements in performance as well as capacity to hold and produce higher optical power levels.







Our research and development efforts are also directed at expanding our product line by
increasing power levels, improving beam quality and electrical efficiency, decreasing the size of our products and lowering the cost per watt. We also are engaged in research projects to expand the spectral range of products that we offer, including
the development of UV pulsed fiber lasers, ultra-fast pulsed fiber lasers, and a mid-infrared (“IR”) line of lasers from 2 to 5 microns, with a hybrid fiber and crystal laser design. Our team of experienced scientists and engineers works
closely with many of our customers to develop and introduce custom products that address specific applications and performance requirements.

We incurred research and development costs of approximately $31.4 million, $25.4 million and $19.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. We plan to continue our
commitment to research and development and to introduce new products, systems and complementary products that would allow us to maintain our competitive position. See Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition of Results of Operations.”

Intellectual Property

We seek to protect our proprietary technology primarily through the U.S. and foreign laws affording protection for trade secrets, and to
seek U.S. and foreign patent, copyright and trademark protection of our products and processes where appropriate. Historically, we relied primarily on trade secrets, technical know-how and other unpatented proprietary information relating to our
product development and manufacturing activities. We seek to protect our trade secrets and proprietary information, in part, by requiring our employees to enter into agreements providing for the maintenance of confidentiality and the assignment to
us of rights to inventions that they make while we employ them. We also enter into non-disclosure agreements with our consultants and suppliers to protect confidential information delivered to them. We believe that our vertical integration,
including our long experience in making a wide range of specialty and high-power capacity components, as well as our technology platform make it difficult for others to reverse engineer our products.

We have increased our efforts to expand our patent portfolio globally. As of February 28, 2013, we have over 140 patents issued and
over 180 pending patent applications worldwide relating principally to optical fiber lasers, amplifiers, bulk optics, semiconductors, and laser and telecommunications systems. With respect to the United States, we were issued 18 patents and we filed
23 applications on new subject matter in 2012. In February 2008, we purchased a portfolio of photonics patents from British Telecommunications plc in the fields of optical fiber lasers and amplifiers, semiconductor devices, integrated optics, fiber
gratings, high-speed systems and optical networking. Intellectual property rights, including those that we own, those that we license and those of others, involve significant risks. See Item 1A, “Risk Factors-Our Inability to Protect Our
Intellectual Property and Proprietary Technologies Could Result in the Unauthorized Use of Our Technologies by Third Parties, Hurt Our Competitive Position and Adversely Affect Our Operating Results.”

Competition

Our markets
are competitive and characterized by rapidly changing technology and continuously evolving customer requirements. We believe that the primary competitive factors in our markets are:



•product performance and reliability;



•quality and service support;



•price and value to the customer;



•ability to manufacture and deliver products on a timely basis;



•ability to achieve qualification for and integration into OEM systems;



•ability to meet customer specifications; and



•ability to respond quickly to market demand and technological developments.







We believe we compete favorably with respect to these criteria. In the
materials processing market, the competition is fragmented and includes a large number of competitors. We compete with makers of high-power CO2,YAG and disc lasers, including Fanuc, Rofin-Sinar Technologies, Inc. and Trumpf GmbH + Co. KG, makers of mid and
low-power CO2,solid-state lasers such as Coherent, Inc., GSI
Group Inc., Newport Corporation and Rofin-Sinar Technologies, Inc., and direct diode lasers such as Laserline GmbH. We also compete with fiber laser makers, including Rofin-Sinar Technologies, Inc., Trumpf GmbH + Co. KG, GSI Group Inc., Coherent
Inc., Hypertherm, Inc., Newport Corporation, The Furukawa Electric Co., Ltd., Keopsys SA, Mitsubishi Cable Industries, Ltd., Miyachi Unitek Corporation, Raycus Fiber Laser Technologies Co. Ltd., Maxphotonics Co., Ltd. and JDS Uniphase Corporation.
Several competitors recently introduced fiber lasers or announced plans to introduce fiber lasers that compete with our high-power products. We believe that we compete favorably with other makers of fiber lasers on price and value to customer,
reliability, service and performance.

We also compete in the materials processing, advanced and medical applications markets
with end users that produce their own solid-state and gas lasers as well as with manufacturers of non-laser methods and tools, such as resistance welding and cutting dies in the materials processing market and scalpels in the medical market.

In the communications market, our principal competitors are manufacturers of mid-power fiber amplifiers and DWDM systems,
such as Oclaro Inc., the Scientific-Atlanta division of Cisco Systems, Inc. (Scientific-Atlanta), Emcore Corporation, JDS Uniphase Corporation and MPB Communications Inc. The fiber amplifier market is more established than the fiber laser market and
technological change has not occurred as rapidly as it has in the case of fiber lasers. We believe that we compete favorably with other high-power fiber amplifier producers with respect to price, product performance and output power.

Many of our competitors are larger than we are and have substantially greater financial, managerial and technical resources, more
extensive distribution and service networks, greater sales and marketing capacity, and larger installed customer bases than we do.

Employees

As of
December 31, 2012, we had approximately 2,400 full-time employees, including 260 in research and development, 1,840 in manufacturing operations, 110 in sales, service and marketing, and 190 in general and administrative functions. Of our total
full-time employees at our principal facilities, approximately 720 were in the United States, 710 were in Germany, 670 were in Russia and 90 were in China. We have never experienced a work stoppage and none of our employees is subject to a
collective bargaining agreement. We believe that our current relations with our employees are good.

Government Regulation

Regulatory Compliance

The majority of our laser and amplifier products sold in the United States are classified as Class IV Laser Products under the applicable rules and regulations of the Center for Devices and Radiological
Health (“CDRH”) of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”). The same classification system is applied in the European markets. Safety rules are formulated with “Deutsche Industrie Norm” (i.e., German Industrial
Standards) or International Organization for Standardization (“ISO”) standards, which are internationally harmonized.

CDRH regulations generally require a self-certification procedure pursuant to which a manufacturer must submit a filing to the CDRH with
respect to each product incorporating a laser device, make periodic reports of sales and purchases and comply with product labeling standards, product safety and design features and informational requirements. The CDRH is empowered to seek fines and
other remedies for violations of their requirements. We believe that our products are in material compliance with applicable laws and regulations relating to the manufacture of laser devices.







Environmental Regulation

Our operations are subject to various federal, state, local and international laws governing the environment, including those relating to
the storage, use, discharge, disposal, product composition and labeling of, and human exposure to, hazardous and toxic materials. We believe that our operations are in material compliance with applicable environmental protection laws and
regulations. Although we believe that our safety procedures for using, handling, storing and disposing of such materials comply with the standards required by federal and state laws and regulations, we cannot completely eliminate the risk of
accidental contamination or injury from these materials. In the event of such an accident involving such materials, we could be liable for damages and such liability could exceed the amount of our liability insurance coverage and the resources
of our business.
