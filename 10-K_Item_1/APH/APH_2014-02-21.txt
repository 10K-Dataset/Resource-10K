Item 1. Business



General



Amphenol Corporation (together with its subsidiaries, “Amphenol” or the “Company”) is one of the world’s largest designers, manufacturers and marketers of electrical, electronic and fiber optic connectors, interconnect systems, antennas, sensors and sensor- based products and coaxial and high-speed specialty cable. The Company was incorporated in 1987. Certain predecessor businesses, which now constitute part of the Company, have been in business since 1932.



The Company’s strategy is to provide its customers with comprehensive design capabilities, a broad selection of products and a high level of service on a world-wide basis while maintaining continuing programs of productivity improvement and cost control. The Company operates through two reporting segments: Interconnect Products and Assemblies and Cable Products and Solutions.  The Interconnect Product and Assemblies segment primarily designs, manufacturers and markets a broad range of connector and connector systems, value-add products and other products, including antennas and sensors, used in a broad range of applications in a diverse set of end markets.  Interconnect products include connectors, which when attached to an electrical, electronic or fiber optic cable, a printed circuit board or other device, facilitate transmission of power or signal.  Value-add systems generally consist of a system of cable, flexible circuits or printed circuit boards and connectors for linking electronic equipment.  The Cable Products and Solutions segment primarily designs, manufacturers and markets cable, value-added products and components for use primarily in the broadband communications and information technology markets as well as certain applications in other markets.



The table below provides a summary of our reporting segments, the fiscal 2013 net sales contribution of each segment, the primary industry and end markets that we service and our key products:

The Company, based on reports of industry analysts, estimates that the worldwide sales of interconnect products were approximately $50 billion in 2013. The Company believes that the worldwide industry for interconnect products and systems is highly











fragmented, with over 2,000 producers of connectors and interconnect systems worldwide, of which the 10 largest, including Amphenol, accounted for a combined market share of approximately 64% in 2013.  The Company’s acquisition strategy is focused on the consolidation of this highly fragmented industry.  For a discussion of Company’s acquisition strategy, refer to the “Our Strategy” section of this report.



Information regarding our operations by reporting segment and the Company’s long-lived assets appears in Note 13 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.



Our Strategy



The Company’s overall strategy is to provide its customers with comprehensive design capabilities, a broad selection of products and a high level of service on a worldwide basis while maintaining continuing programs of productivity improvement and cost control.  Specifically, our business strategy is as follows:



·Pursue broad diversification- The Company constantly drives to increase its diversity of markets, customers, applications and products.  Due to the tremendous variety of opportunities in the electronics industry, management believes that it is very important to ensure participation wherever significant growth opportunities are available.  This diversification positions us to proliferate our technologies across the broadest array of opportunities and reduces our exposure to any particular market, thereby reducing the variability of our financial performance.  An overview of the Company’s market and product participation is described under “Markets”.



·Develop performance-enhancing interconnect solutions- The Company seeks to expand the scope and number of its preferred supplier relationships.  The Company works closely with its customers at the design stage to create and manufacture innovative solutions.  These products generally have higher value-added content than other interconnect products and have been developed across all of the Company’s markets.  The Company has a particular focus on technology leadership in the interconnect areas of radio frequency, power, harsh environment, high-speed and fiber optics, as well as sensors, as it views these technology areas to be of particular importance to our global customer base.



·Expand global presence- The Company intends to further expand its global manufacturing, engineering, sales and service operations to better serve its existing customer base, penetrate developing markets and establish new customer relationships.  As the Company’s global customers expand their international operations to access developing world markets and lower manufacturing costs in certain regions, the Company is continuing to expand its international footprint in order to provide just-in-time capabilities to these customers.  The majority of the Company’s international operations have broad capabilities including new product development.  The Company is also able to take advantage of the lower manufacturing costs in some regions, and has established low-cost manufacturing and assembly facilities in the three major geographical markets of the Americas, Europe/Africa and Asia.



·Control costs- The Company recognizes the importance in today’s global marketplace of maintaining a competitive cost structure.  Innovation, product quality and comprehensive customer service are not mutually exclusive with controlling costs.  Controlling costs is part of a mindset.  It is having the discipline to invest in programs that have a good return, maintaining a cost structure as flexible as possible to respond to changes in the marketplace, dealing with suppliers and vendors in a fair but prudent way to ensure a reasonable cost for materials and services and creating a mindset of managers to manage the Company’s assets as if they were their own.



·Pursue strategic acquisitions and investments- The Company believes that the fragmented interconnect industry continues to provide significant opportunities for strategic acquisitions.  Accordingly, we continue to pursue acquisitions of high growth potential companies with strong management teams that complement our existing business while further expanding our product lines, technological capabilities and geographic presence.  Furthermore, we seek to enhance the performance of acquired companies by leveraging Amphenol’s business strategy and access to low-cost manufacturing around the world.  In 2013, the Company invested $485 million in five separate acquisitions in the automotive, industrial and commercial aerospace markets, which broadened and enhanced the Company’s customer base and product offerings in these markets.



·Foster collaborative, entrepreneurial management- Amphenol’s management system is designed to provide clear income statement and balance sheet responsibility in a flat organizational structure.  Each general manager is incented to grow and develop his or her business and to think entrepreneurially in providing innovative, timely and cost-effective solutions to customer needs.  In addition, Amphenol’s general managers have access to the resources of the larger organization and are encouraged to work collaboratively with other general managers to meet the needs of the expanding marketplace and to achieve common goals.

Net sales by geographic area are based on the customer location to which the product is shipped.



Research and Development



The Company generally implements its product development strategy through product design teams and collaboration arrangements with customers, which result in the Company obtaining approved vendor status for its customers’ new products and programs.  The Company focuses its research and development efforts primarily on those product areas that it believes have the potential for broad market applications and significant sales within a one to three year period.  The Company seeks to have its products become widely accepted within the industry for similar applications and products manufactured by other potential customers, which the Company believes will provide additional sources of future revenue.  By developing application specific products, the Company has decreased its exposure to standard products, which generally experience greater pricing pressure.



Our research, development, and engineering efforts are supported by approximately 1,500 engineers and are performed primarily by individual operating units focused on specific markets and technologies.  The Company’s research and development expense for the creation of new and improved products and processes was $103.4 million, $92.5 million and $88.9 million for 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively.











Intellectual Property



Patents and other proprietary rights are important to our business. We also rely upon trade secrets, manufacturing know-how, continuing technological innovations, and licensing opportunities to maintain and improve our competitive position. We review third-party proprietary rights, including patents and patent applications, as available, in an effort to develop an effective intellectual property strategy, avoid infringement of third-party proprietary rights, identify licensing opportunities, and monitor the intellectual property claims of others.



We own a large portfolio of patents that principally relate to electrical, optical, electronic and sensor products. We also own a portfolio of trademarks and are a licensee of various patents and trademarks. Patents for individual products extend for varying periods according to the date of patent filing or grant and the legal term of patents in the various countries where patent protection is obtained. Trademark rights may potentially extend for longer periods of time and are dependent upon national laws and use of the trademarks.



While we consider our patents and trademarks to be valued assets, we do not believe that our competitive position or our operations are dependent upon or would be materially impacted by the loss of any single patent or group of related patents.



Raw Materials



The Company purchases a wide variety of raw materials for the manufacture of its products, including precious metals such as gold and silver used in plating, aluminum, brass, steel, copper and bimetallic products used for cable, contacts and connector shells, and plastic materials used for cable and connector bodies and inserts. Such raw materials are generally available throughout the world and are purchased locally from a variety of suppliers. The Company is generally not dependent upon any one source for raw materials, or if one source is used the Company attempts to protect itself through long-term supply agreements.  Information regarding our purchasing obligations related to commitments to purchase certain goods and services is disclosed in Note 16 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.



Competition



The Company encounters competition in substantially all areas of its business. The Company competes primarily on the basis of technology innovation, product quality, price, customer service and delivery time.  Competitors within the Interconnect Products and Assemblies segment include TE Connectivity, Molex, Yazaki, Foxconn, FCI, JST, Delphi, Hirose and JAE, among others. The primary competitor within the Cable Products and Solutions segment is Commscope, among others.  In addition, the Company competes with a large number of smaller companies who compete in specific geographies, markets or products.



Backlog



The Company estimates that its backlog of unfilled orders as of December 31, 2013 was approximately $1,032 million compared with backlog of approximately $800 million as of December 31, 2012.  Orders typically fluctuate from quarter to quarter based on customer demand and general business conditions. Unfilled orders may generally be cancelled prior to shipment of goods. It is expected that all or a substantial portion of the backlog will be filled within the next 12 months. Significant elements of the Company’s business, such as sales to the communications related markets (including wireless communications, information technology and data communications) and broadband communications and sales to distributors, generally have short lead times. Therefore, backlog may not be indicative of future demand.



Employees



As of December 31, 2013, the Company had approximately 44,500 employees worldwide, of which approximately 35,000 were located in lower cost regions. Of these employees, approximately 36,900 were hourly employees and the remainder were salaried employees. The Company believes that it has a good relationship with its unionized and non-unionized employees.



Environmental Matters



Certain operations of the Company are subject to environmental laws and regulations which govern the discharge of pollutants into the air and water, as well as the handling and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes. The Company believes that its operations are currently in substantial compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations and that the costs of continuing compliance will not have a material effect on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.



Owners and occupiers of sites containing hazardous substances, as well as generators of hazardous substances, are subject to broad liability under various environmental laws and regulations, including expenditures for cleanup and monitoring costs and











potential damages arising out of past disposal activities. Such liability in many cases may be imposed regardless of fault or the legality of the original disposal activity. The Company has performed remediation activities and is currently performing operations and maintenance and monitoring activities at three off-site disposal sites previously utilized by the Company’s facility in Sidney, New York, and others - the Richardson Hill Road landfill, the Route 8 landfill and the Sidney landfill.  Actions at the Richardson Hill Road and Sidney landfills were undertaken subsequent to designation as “Superfund” sites on the National Priorities List under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980. The Route 8 landfill was designated as a New York State Inactive Hazardous Waste Disposal Site, with remedial actions taken pursuant to Chapter 6, Section 375-1 of the New York Code of Rules and Regulations. In addition, the Company is currently performing monitoring activities at, and in proximity to, its manufacturing site in Sidney, New York. The Company is also engaged in remediating or monitoring environmental conditions at certain of its other manufacturing facilities and has been named as a potentially responsible party for cleanup costs at other off-site disposal sites.



Subsequent to the acquisition of Amphenol Corporation from Allied Signal Corporation (“Allied Signal”) in 1987 (Allied Signal merged with Honeywell International Inc. in December 1999 (“Honeywell”)), the Company and Honeywell were named jointly and severally liable as potentially responsible parties in connection with several environmental cleanup sites. The Company and Honeywell jointly consented to perform certain investigations and remediation and monitoring activities at the Route 8 landfill and the Richardson Hill Road landfill, and they were jointly ordered to perform work at the Sidney landfill, all as referred to above. All of the costs incurred relating to these three sites are currently reimbursed by Honeywell based on an agreement (the “Honeywell Agreement”) entered into in connection with the acquisition in 1987. The environmental investigation, remediation and monitoring activities identified by the Company, including those referred to above, are covered under the Honeywell Agreement.  Management does not believe that the costs associated with resolution of these or any other environmental matters will have a material effect on the Company’s consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.



Since 1987, the Company has not been identified or named as a potentially responsible party with respect to any other significant on-site or off-site hazardous waste matters. In addition, the Company believes that its manufacturing activities and disposal practices since 1987 have been in material compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations. Nonetheless, it is possible that the Company will be named as a potentially responsible party in the future with respect to additional Superfund or other sites. Although the Company is unable to predict with any reasonable certainty the extent of its ultimate liability with respect to any pending or future environmental matters, the Company believes, based upon information currently known by management about the Company’s manufacturing activities, disposal practices and estimates of liability with respect to known environmental matters, that any such liability will not have a material effect on the Company’s consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.
