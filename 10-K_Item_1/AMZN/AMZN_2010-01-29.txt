Item 1.Business

This Annual
Report on Form 10-K and the documents incorporated herein by reference contain forward-looking statements based on expectations, estimates, and projections as of the date of this filing. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed in
forward-looking statements. See Item 1A of Part I—“Risk Factors.”

Amazon.com, Inc. was incorporated
in 1994 in the state of Washington and reincorporated in 1996 in the state of Delaware. Our principal corporate offices are located in Seattle, Washington. We completed our initial public offering in May 1997 and our common stock is listed on the
Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol “AMZN.”

As used herein, “Amazon.com,” “we,”
“our” and similar terms include Amazon.com, Inc. and its subsidiaries, unless the context indicates otherwise.

General

Amazon.com opened its virtual doors on the World Wide Web in July 1995 and offers Earth’s Biggest Selection. We seek
to be Earth’s most customer-centric company for three primary customer sets: consumers, sellers, and developers. In addition, we generate revenue through co-branded credit card agreements and other marketing and promotional services, such as
online advertising.

We have organized our operations into two principal segments: North America and International. See
Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 11—Segment Information.” See Item 7 of Part II, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations—Results of Operations—Supplemental Information” for supplemental information about our net sales.

Consumers

We serve consumers through our retail websites, and focus on selection, price, and convenience. We design our websites to
enable millions of unique products to be sold by us and by third parties across dozens of product categories. We also manufacture and sell the Kindle e-reader. We strive to offer our customers the lowest prices possible through low everyday product
pricing and free shipping offers, including Amazon Prime, and to improve our operating efficiencies so that we can continue to lower prices for our customers. We also provide easy-to-use functionality, fast and reliable fulfillment, and timely
customer service.

We fulfill customer orders in a number of ways, including through the U.S. and international fulfillment
centers and warehouses that we operate, through co-sourced and outsourced arrangements in certain countries, and through digital delivery. We operate customer service centers globally, which are supplemented by co-sourced arrangements. See
Item 2 of Part I, “Properties.”

Sellers

We offer programs that enable sellers to sell their products on our websites and their own branded websites and to fulfill orders through us.
We are not the seller of record in these transactions, but instead earn fixed fees, revenue share fees, per-unit activity fees, or some combination thereof.

Developers

We serve developers through Amazon Web Services, which provides
access to technology infrastructure that developers can use to enable virtually any type of business.







Competition

Intellectual Property

We regard our trademarks, service marks, copyrights, patents, domain names, trade dress,
trade secrets, proprietary technologies, and similar intellectual property as critical to our success, and we rely on trademark, copyright and patent law, trade-secret protection, and confidentiality and/or license agreements with our employees,
customers, partners, and others to protect our proprietary rights. We have registered, or applied for the registration of, a number of U.S. and international domain names, trademarks, service marks, and copyrights. Additionally, we have filed U.S.
and international patent applications covering certain of our proprietary technology. We have licensed in the past, and expect that we may license in the future, certain of our proprietary rights to third parties.

Seasonality

Our business
is affected by seasonality, which historically has resulted in higher sales volume during our fourth quarter, which ends December 31. We recognized 39%, 35%, and 38% of our annual revenue during the fourth quarter of 2009, 2008, and 2007.

Employees

We employed approximately 24,300 full-time and part-time employees at December 31, 2009. However, employment levels fluctuate due to seasonal factors affecting our business. Additionally, we utilize independent contractors and
temporary personnel to supplement our workforce, particularly on a seasonal basis. Although we have works councils and statutory employee representation obligations in certain countries, our employees are not represented by a labor union and we
consider our employee relations to be good. Competition for qualified personnel in our industry has historically been intense, particularly for software engineers, computer scientists, and other technical staff.

Available Information

Our
investor relations website iswww.amazon.com/ir. We make available on this website, free of charge, our annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to those reports as soon as
reasonably practicable after we electronically file or furnish such materials to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). We also make available on this website under the heading “Corporate Governance” our Code of
Business Conduct and Ethics.
