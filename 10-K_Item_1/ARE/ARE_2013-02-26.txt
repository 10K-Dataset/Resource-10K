ITEM 1. BUSINESS



Overview



We are a Maryland corporation formed in October 1994 that has elected to be taxed as a REIT for federal income tax purposes.  We are the largest owner, preeminent REIT, and leading life science real estate company focused principally on science-driven cluster development through the ownership, operation, management, selective acquisition, development, and redevelopment of properties containing life science laboratory space.  We are the leading provider of high-quality environmentally sustainable real estate, technical infrastructure, and services to the broad and diverse life science industry.  Client tenants include leading multinational pharmaceutical companies, academic and medical institutions, public and private biotechnology entities, U.S. government research agencies, medical device companies, industrial biotech companies, venture capital firms, and life science product and service companies.  Our primary business objective is to maximize stakeholder value by providing our debt and equity stakeholders with the greatest possible total return based on a multifaceted platform of internal and external growth.  Our operating platform is based on the principle of “clustering,” with assets and operations located adjacent to life science entities, and in close proximity to concentrations of specialized skills, knowledge, institutions, and related businesses, driving growth and technological advances within each cluster.



As of December 31, 2012, we had 178 properties aggregating approximately 17.1 million rentable square feet, composed of approximately 15.0 million rentable square feet of operating properties, approximately 1.6 million rentable square feet undergoing active development, and approximately 0.5 million rentable square feet undergoing active redevelopment.  Our operating properties were approximately 93.4% leased as of December 31, 2012.  Our primary sources of revenues are rental income and tenant recoveries from leases of our properties.  Investment-grade client tenants represented 47% of our total annualized base rent as of December 31, 2012.  The comparability of financial data from period to period is affected by the timing of our property acquisition, development, and redevelopment activities.

Business objectives and strategies



Our primary business objective is to maximize stakeholder value by providing our debt and equity stakeholders with the greatest possible total return based on a multifaceted platform of internal and external growth.  The key elements to our strategy include our consistent focus on high-quality assets and operations in the top life science cluster locations with our properties located adjacent to life science entities, driving growth and technological advances within each cluster.  These adjacency locations are characterized by high barriers to entry for new landlords, high barriers to exit for client tenants, limited supply of available space, and represent highly desirable locations for tenancy by life science entities because of the close proximity to concentrations of specialized skills, knowledge, institutions, and related businesses.  Our strategy also includes drawing upon our deep and broad life science and real estate relationships in order to attract new and leading life science client tenants and value-added real estate.



We focus our property operations and investment activities principally in the following life science markets:



·Greater Boston;

·San Francisco Bay Area;

·San Diego;

·Greater NYC;

·Suburban Washington, D.C.;

·Seattle;

·Research Triangle Park;

·Canada;

·India; and

·China.



The following chart summarizes the growth of the annualized base rent of our assets in our key cluster submarkets:







Our client tenant base is broad and diverse within the life science industry and reflects our focus on regional, national, and international client tenants with substantial financial and operational resources.  Investment-grade client tenants represented 47% of our total annualized base rent as of December 31, 2012.  For a more detailed description of our properties and client tenants, see “Item 2. Properties.”  We have an experienced board of directors and are led by a senior management team with extensive experience in both the real estate and life science industries.



Growth and core operating strategies



We continue to demonstrate the strength and durability of our core operations, providing life science laboratory space to the broad and diverse life science industry.  Our internal growth has been consistent, as demonstrated by our same property NOI performance, high and relatively stable occupancy, and continuing improvement of cash flows from the leasing activity of our core operating assets.  In addition, we continue to focus on our external growth through the conversion of non-income-producing assets into income-producing assets, which results in cash flow contribution from ground-up development and from redevelopment of non-laboratory space into laboratory space.  We intend to selectively acquire properties that we believe provide long-term value to our stockholders.  Our strategy for acquisitions will focus on the quality of the submarket locations, improvements, tenancy, and overall return.  We believe the life science industry will remain keenly focused on locations adjacent to key innovation drivers in each major life science submarket.  Owning and operating the best assets in the best adjacency locations provides the best upside potential and provides the most downside risk mitigation.  This being the case, we will also focus on adjacency locations that will deliver high cash flows, stability, and returns as we work to deliver the highest value to our stockholders.











We also intend to continue to focus on the completion and delivery of our existing active development projects, aggregating approximately 1,566,774 rentable square feet, and our existing active redevelopment projects, aggregating approximately 547,092 rentable square feet.  Additionally, we intend to continue with preconstruction activities for certain land parcels for future ground-up development in order to preserve and create value for these projects.  These important preconstruction activities add significant value to our land for future ground-up development and are required for the ultimate vertical construction of the buildings.  We also continue to be very prudent with any future decisions to add new projects to our active ground-up developments.  Future ground-up development projects will likely require significant pre-leasing from high-quality and/or creditworthy entities.



We intend to continue to transition our balance sheet debt from short-term and medium-term unsecured variable rate bank debt to long-term unsecured fixed rate debt.  We are focused on the recycling of sale proceeds from non-core suburban assets for investment into higher-value urban or central business district (“CBD”) assets and teaming with high-quality capital partners, as appropriate.  We expect sources of funds for construction activities and repayment of outstanding debt to be provided by opportunistic sales of real estate, joint ventures, cash flows from operations, new secured or unsecured debt, and the issuance of additional equity securities, as appropriate.  We intend to combine these sources of capital in a leverage-neutral manner in order to maintain our overall balance sheet leverage target.



We seek to maximize balance sheet liquidity and flexibility, cash flows, and cash available for distribution to our stockholders through the ownership, operation, management, and selective acquisition, development, and redevelopment of life science properties, as well as management of our balance sheet.  In particular, we seek to maximize balance sheet liquidity and flexibility, cash flows, and cash available for distribution by:



·Maintaining significant liquidity through borrowing capacity under our unsecured senior line of credit and cash and cash equivalents;

·Minimizing the amount of near-term debt maturities in a single year;

·Maintaining low to modest leverage;

·Minimizing variable interest rate risk;

·Maintaining strong and stable operating cash flows;

·Re-tenanting and re-leasing space at higher rental rates to the extent possible, while minimizing tenant improvement costs;

·Maintaining solid occupancy while also maintaining high lease rental rates;

·Realizing contractual rental rate escalations, which are currently provided for in approximately 96% of our leases (on a rentable square footage basis);

·Implementing effective cost control measures, including negotiating pass-through provisions in client tenant leases for operating expenses and certain capital expenditures;

·Improving investment returns through leasing of vacant space and replacement of existing client tenants with new client tenants at higher rental rates;

·Achieving higher rental rates from existing client tenants as existing leases expire;

·Selectively selling properties, including land parcels, to reduce outstanding debt;

·Selectively acquiring high-quality life science properties in our target life science cluster markets at prices that enable us to realize attractive returns;

·Selectively redeveloping existing office, warehouse, or shell space, or newly acquired properties, into generic life science laboratory space that can be leased at higher rental rates in our target life science cluster markets;

·Selectively developing properties in our target life science cluster markets; and

·Recycling non-core assets for capital deployment in key “brain trust” clusters for future value.



Acquisitions



We seek to identify and acquire high-quality life science properties in our target life science cluster markets.  Critical evaluation of prospective property acquisitions is an essential component of our acquisition strategy.  When evaluating acquisition opportunities, we assess a full range of matters relating to the prospective property or properties, including:



·Adjacency to centers of innovation and technological advances;

·Location of the property and our strategy in the relevant market;











·Quality of existing and prospective client tenants;

·Condition and capacity of the building infrastructure;

·Quality and generic characteristics of the laboratory facilities;

·Physical condition of the structure and common area improvements;

·Opportunities available for leasing vacant space and for re-tenanting occupied space;

·Availability of land for future ground-up development of new life science laboratory space; and

·Opportunities to redevelop existing space into higher-rent, generic life science laboratory space.



Development



A key component of our long-term business model is ground-up development projects.  Our development strategy is primarily to pursue selective projects with significant pre-leasing where we expect to achieve appropriate investment returns and generally match a source of funds for this use.  Our ground-up development projects focus primarily on investment in generic and reusable life science laboratory improvements, rather than tenant-specific improvements.  As of December 31, 2012, we had six projects undergoing ground-up development approximating 1,566,774 rentable square feet of life science laboratory space.  We also have an embedded pipeline for future ground-up development approximating 4.7 million developable square feet.



Redevelopment



Another key component of our long-term business model is the redevelopment of existing office, warehouse, or shell space into generic life science laboratory space that can be leased at higher rates.  Our redevelopment strategy includes significant pre-leasing of certain projects prior to the commencement of redevelopment.  As of December 31, 2012, we had 10 projects aggregating 547,092 rentable square feet undergoing active redevelopment.  In addition to properties undergoing redevelopment, as of December 31, 2012, our asset base contained embedded opportunities for a future permanent change of use to life science laboratory space through redevelopment aggregating approximately 1.0 million rentable square feet.



Client tenants



Investment-grade client tenants represented 47% of our total annualized base rent as of December 31, 2012.  As of December 31, 2012, we had 494 leases with a total of 396 client tenants, and 74, or 42%, of our 178 properties were single-tenant properties.  Our three largest client tenants accounted for approximately 14.7% of our aggregate annualized base rent, or approximately 6.9%, 4.2%, and 3.6%, respectively.  As of December 31, 2011, we had 474 leases with a total of 388 client tenants and 69, or 40%, of our 173 properties, were each leased to a single client tenant.  As of December 31, 2011, our three largest client tenants accounted for approximately 13.6% of our aggregate annualized base rent, or 6.4%, 3.6%, and 3.6%, respectively.



Competition



In general, other life science properties are located in close proximity to our properties.  The amount of rentable space available in any market could have a material effect on our ability to rent space and on the rents that we can earn.  In addition, we compete for investment opportunities with insurance companies, pension and investment funds, private equity entities, partnerships, developers, investment companies, other REITs, and owner/occupants.  Many of these entities have substantially greater financial resources than we do and may be able to invest more than we can or accept more risk than we are willing to accept.  These entities may be less sensitive to risks with respect to the creditworthiness of a client tenant or the geographic concentration of their investments.  Competition may also reduce the number of suitable investment opportunities available to us or may increase the bargaining power of property owners seeking to sell.  Competition in acquiring existing properties and land, both from institutional capital sources and from other REITs, has been very strong over the past several years.  However, we believe we have differentiated ourselves from our competitors, as we are thefirst publicly traded REIT to focus primarily on the life science real estate niche,as well as the largest owner, manager, and developer of life science properties, in key life science markets and have the most important relationships in the life science industry.



Financial information about our operating segment



See Note 2, Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to our consolidated financial statements for information about our operating segment.











Regulation



General



Properties in our markets are subject to various laws, ordinances, and regulations, including regulations relating to common areas.  We believe we have the necessary permits and approvals to operate each of our properties.



Americans with Disabilities Act



Our properties must comply with Title III of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (the “ADA”), to the extent that such properties are “public accommodations” as defined by the ADA.  The ADA may require removal of structural barriers to access by persons with disabilities in certain public areas of our properties where such removal is readily achievable.  We believe that our properties are in substantial compliance with the ADA and that we will not be required to incur substantial capital expenditures to address the requirements of the ADA.  However, noncompliance with the ADA could result in the imposition of fines or an award of damages to private litigants.  The obligation to make readily achievable accommodations is an ongoing one, and we will continue to assess our properties and make alterations as appropriate in this respect.  See “Item 1A. Risk Factors – We may incur significant costs complying with the Americans with Disabilities Act and similar laws.”



Environmental matters



Under various environmental protection laws, a current or previous owner or operator of real estate may be liable for contamination resulting from the presence or discharge of hazardous or toxic substances at that property, and may be required to investigate and clean up contamination located on or emanating from that property.  Such laws often impose liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of, or was responsible for, the presence of the contaminants, and the liability may be joint and several.  Previous owners used some of our properties for industrial and other purposes, so those properties may contain some level of environmental contamination.  The presence of contamination or the failure to remediate contamination at our properties may expose us to third-party liability or may materially adversely affect our ability to sell, lease, or develop the real estate or to borrow using the real estate as collateral.



Some of our properties may have asbestos-containing building materials.  Environmental laws require that asbestos-containing building materials be properly managed and maintained, and may impose fines and penalties on building owners or operators for failure to comply with these requirements.  These laws may also allow third parties to seek recovery from owners or operators for personal injury associated with exposure to asbestos-containing building materials.



In addition, some of our client tenants routinely handle hazardous substances and wastes as part of their operations at our properties.  Environmental laws and regulations subject our client tenants, and potentially us, to liability resulting from these activities or from previous uses of those properties.  Environmental liabilities could also affect a client tenant’s ability to make rental payments to us.  We require our client tenants to comply with these environmental laws and regulations.  See “Item 1A. Risk Factors – We could be held liable for damages resulting from our client tenants’ use of hazardous materials.”



Independent environmental consultants have conducted Phase I or similar environmental site assessments on the properties in our portfolio.  Site assessments are intended to discover and evaluate information regarding the environmental condition of the surveyed property and surrounding properties, and do not generally include soil samplings, subsurface investigations, or an asbestos survey.  To date, these assessments have not revealed any material environmental liability that we believe would have a material adverse effect on our business, assets, or results of operations.  Nevertheless, it is possible that the assessments on our properties have not revealed all environmental conditions, liabilities, or compliance concerns.  Material environmental conditions, liabilities, or compliance concerns may have arisen after the review was completed or may arise in the future; and future laws, ordinances, or regulations may impose material additional environmental liability.  See “Item 1A. Risk Factors – We may incur significant costs complying with environmental laws.”



Insurance



We carry comprehensive liability, fire, extended coverage, and rental loss insurance with respect to our properties.  We select policy specifications and insured limits that we believe to be appropriate given the relative risk of loss, the cost of the coverage, and industry practice.  In the opinion of management, the properties in our portfolio are currently adequately insured.  In addition, we have obtained earthquake insurance for certain properties located in the vicinity of active earthquake faults.  We also carry environmental remediation insurance and title insurance on our properties.  We obtain our title insurance policies generally when we acquire the property, with each policy covering an amount equal to the initial purchase price of each property.  Accordingly, any of our title insurance policies may be in an amount less than the current value of the related property.  See “Item 1A. Risk Factors – Our insurance may not adequately cover all potential losses.”
