The occupancy percentage of our operating properties in North America was97.0%as ofDecember 31, 2014.  Our average occupancy rate of operating properties as of December 31 of each year from 2000 to2014was94.8%.  Our average occupancy rate of operating and redevelopment properties as of December 31 of each year from 2000 to2014was89.4%.  Investment-grade client tenants represented56%of our total ABR as ofDecember 31, 2014.  The comparability of financial data from period to period is affected by the timing of our property acquisition, development, and redevelopment activities.





Business objective and strategies



Our primary business objective is to maximize long-term asset value and shareholder returns based on a multifaceted platform of internal and external growth.  A key element of our strategy is our unique focus on Class A assets clustered in urban campuses.  These key urban campus locations are characterized by high barriers to entry for new landlords, high barriers to exit for client tenants, and a limited supply of available space.  They represent highly desirable locations for tenancy by science and technology entities because of their close proximity to concentrations of specialized skills, knowledge, institutions, and related businesses.  Our strategy also includes drawing upon our deep and broad real estate, science, and technology relationships in order to identify and attract new and leading client tenants and to source additional value-creation real estate.












The following chart summarizes the growth of the ABR of our assets in our key cluster submarkets:





Our client tenant base is broad and diverse within the science and technology industries and reflects our focus on regional, national, and international client tenants with substantial financial and operational resources.  For a more detailed description of our properties and client tenants, refer to “Item 2. Properties.”  We have an experienced Board of Directors and are led by a senior management team with extensive experience in the real estate, science, and technology industries.



Acquisitions



We seek to identify and acquire high-quality properties in our target cluster markets.  Critical evaluation of prospective property acquisitions is an essential component of our acquisition strategy.  When evaluating acquisition opportunities, we assess a full range of matters relating to the prospective property or properties, including:



•Proximity to centers of innovation and technological advances;

•Location of the property and our strategy in the relevant market;

•Quality of existing and prospective client tenants;

•Condition and capacity of the building infrastructure;

•Quality and generic characteristics of the improvements;

•Physical condition of the structure and common area improvements;

•Opportunities available for leasing vacant space and for re-tenanting or renewing occupied space;

•Availability of and/or ability to add appropriate tenant amenities;

•Availability of land for future ground-up development of new office/laboratory or tech office space;

•Opportunities to redevelop existing space into higher-rent, generic, and reusable office/laboratory or tech office space;

•The property’s unlevered yields and;

•Our ability to increase the property’s long-term financial returns.



Development



A key component of our business model is our value-creation development projects.  Our development strategy is primarily to pursue selective projects with significant pre-leasing where we expect to achieve appropriate investment returns and generally match a source of funds for this use.  Our value-creation development projects focus on high-quality, generic, and reusable office/laboratory or tech office space to meet the real estate requirements of our wide range of client tenants.












Redevelopment



Another key component of our business model is our value-creation redevelopment of existing office, warehouse, or shell space into high-quality, generic, and reusable office/laboratory or tech office space that can be leased at higher rates.  Our redevelopment strategy generally includes significant pre-leasing of certain projects prior to the commencement of redevelopment.



Balance sheet and financial strategy



We seek to maximize balance sheet liquidity and flexibility, cash flows, and cash available for distribution to our stockholders through the ownership, operation, management, and selective acquisition, development, and redevelopment of office/laboratory and tech office properties, as well as management of our balance sheet.  In particular, we seek to maximize balance sheet liquidity and flexibility, cash flows, and cash available for distribution by:



•Maintaining significant liquidity through borrowing capacity under our unsecured senior line of credit, available commitments under secured construction loans, and cash and cash equivalents;

•Minimizing the amount of near-term debt maturities in a single year;

•Maintaining low to modest leverage;

•Minimizing variable interest rate risk;

•Generating high-quality, strong, and increasing operating cash flows;

•Maintaining geographic diversity in stable-value urban intellectual centers of innovation;

•Renewing existing client tenant space at higher rental rates to the extent possible;

•Minimizing tenant improvement costs;

•Improving investment returns through leasing of vacant space and replacing existing client tenants with new client tenants at higher rental rates;

•Maintaining solid occupancy while also maintaining high lease rental rates;

•Realizing contractual rental rate escalations, which are currently provided for in approximately94%of our leases (on an RSF basis);

•Implementing effective cost control measures, including negotiating pass-through provisions in client tenant leases for operating expenses and certain capital expenditures;

•Selectively selling real estate assets, including non-income-producing land parcels and non-core/“core-like” operating assets, and investing the proceeds into our highly-leased value-creation development projects;

•Maintaining access to diverse sources of capital;

•Selectively acquiring high-quality office/laboratory and tech office properties in our target urban innovation cluster submarkets at prices that enable us to realize attractive returns;

•Selectively developing properties in our target urban innovation cluster submarkets; and

•Selectively redeveloping existing office, warehouse, or shell space, or newly acquired properties, into generic office/laboratory or tech office space that can be leased at higher rental rates in our target urban innovation cluster submarkets.

Regulation



General



Properties in our markets are subject to various laws, ordinances, and regulations, including regulations relating to common areas.  We believe we have the necessary permits and approvals to operate each of our properties.












Americans with Disabilities Act



Our properties must comply with Title III of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (the “ADA”), to the extent that such properties are “public accommodations” as defined by the ADA.  The ADA may require removal of structural barriers to access by persons with disabilities in certain public areas of our properties where such removal is readily achievable.  We believe that our properties are in substantial compliance with the ADA and that we will not be required to incur substantial capital expenditures to address the requirements of the ADA.  However, noncompliance with the ADA could result in the imposition of fines or an award of damages to private litigants.  The obligation to make readily achievable accommodations is an ongoing one, and we will continue to assess our properties and make alterations as appropriate in this respect.



Environmental matters



Under various environmental protection laws, a current or previous owner or operator of real estate may be liable for contamination resulting from the presence or discharge of hazardous or toxic substances at that property, and may be required to investigate and clean up contamination located on or emanating from that property.  Such laws often impose liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of, or was responsible for, the presence of the contaminants, and the liability may be joint and several.  Previous owners used some of our properties for industrial and other purposes, so those properties may contain some level of environmental contamination.  The presence of contamination or the failure to remediate contamination at our properties may expose us to third-party liability or may materially adversely affect our ability to sell, lease, or develop the real estate or to borrow using the real estate as collateral.



Some of our properties may have asbestos-containing building materials.  Environmental laws require that asbestos-containing building materials be properly managed and maintained, and may impose fines and penalties on building owners or operators for failure to comply with these requirements.  These laws may also allow third parties to seek recovery from owners or operators for personal injury associated with exposure to asbestos-containing building materials.



In addition, some of our client tenants routinely handle hazardous substances and wastes as part of their operations at our properties.  Environmental laws and regulations subject our client tenants, and potentially us, to liability resulting from these activities or from previous uses of those properties.  Environmental liabilities could also affect a client tenant’s ability to make rental payments to us.  We require our client tenants to comply with these environmental laws and regulations.



Independent environmental consultants have conducted Phase I or similar environmental site assessments on the properties in our portfolio.  Site assessments are intended to discover and evaluate information regarding the environmental condition of the surveyed property and surrounding properties, and do not generally include soil samplings, subsurface investigations, or an asbestos survey.  To date, these assessments have not revealed any material environmental liability that we believe would have a material adverse effect on our business, assets, or results of operations.  Nevertheless, it is possible that the assessments on our properties have not revealed all environmental conditions, liabilities, or compliance concerns, which may have arisen after the review was completed or may arise in the future; and future laws, ordinances, or regulations may impose material additional environmental liability.



Insurance



We carry comprehensive liability, all-risk property, and rental loss insurance with respect to our properties.  We select policy specifications and insured limits that we believe to be appropriate given the relative risk of loss, the cost of the coverage, and industry practice.  In the opinion of management, the properties in our portfolio are currently adequately insured.  In addition, we have obtained earthquake insurance for certain properties located in the vicinity of known active earthquake zones.  We also carry environmental insurance and title insurance on our properties.  We generally obtain our title insurance policies when we acquire the property, with each policy covering an amount equal to the initial purchase price of each property.  Accordingly, any of our title insurance policies may be in an amount less than the current value of the related property.
